Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  with  your permission I would  like  to  take\r\n\r\nQuestion Nos. 1 and 2 together as they are related?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Singapore Government has for\r\n\r\nlong  encouraged local companies, both GLCs and non-GLCs,  to\r\n\r\ngrow beyond the confines of the Singapore economy.  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelecom's acquisition of Optus and DBS Bank's acquisition  of\r\n\r\nDao Heng are such moves.  They enable SingTel and DBS Bank to\r\n\r\ntap  regional opportunities and become more than  Singaporean\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both SingTel and DBS Bank are listed on the Singapore\r\n\r\nExchange  (SGX)  and fully subject to the discipline  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  Like all GLCs, they operate strictly on a commercial\r\n\r\nbasis.   The  Government does not interfere in the commercial\r\n\r\ndecisions of GLCs.  Their managements are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupervised by their own boards of directors.  The  boards  in\r\n\r\nturn are accountable to all shareholders, and not just to the\r\n\r\nGovernment   through  Temasek  Holdings,  which   holds   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's shares in the companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchases of Optus and Dao Heng are long term\r\n\r\nstrategic  business moves.  Their soundness has to be  judged\r\n\r\nover time by the performance of SingTel and DBS Bank, and not\r\n\r\nby the immediate reaction of the stock market as reflected in\r\n\r\ntheir  share prices.  It is up to the managements of  SingTel\r\n\r\nand  DBS  Bank  to  satisfy themselves of the  strategic  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  merits  of the acquisitions,  and  convince  their\r\n\r\nboards  of directors and their shareholders that overall  the\r\n\r\ndeals will benefit the companies and their shareholders.   As\r\n\r\na  shareholder, Temasek Holdings has full confidence  in  the\r\n\r\ncompetence  and  judgment of the managements  and  boards  of\r\n\r\nSingTel  and  DBS  Bank.  SingTel and DBS Bank  are  able  to\r\n\r\nundertake  these  transactions only because  they  have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful in their operations, and hence have the  financial\r\n\r\nresources to pursue such opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether he is aware that in the case  of  Cable\r\n\r\nand   Wireless  Optus,  it  is  operating  at  a  much  lower\r\n\r\nprofitability  than  SingTel  and,  as  a  result,  SingTel's\r\n\r\nearnings  could  be dragged down after the acquisition?   Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister tell this House why the board and the management\r\n\r\nof  SingTel considered Optus to be acquired at a fair  price,\r\n\r\neven though it was at a price tag of about $15 billion?   How\r\n\r\nwould SingTel fund this acquisition?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question relating to DBS Bank, along the same\r\n\r\nvein,  is  whether the Minister is aware that some  newspaper\r\n\r\nanalysts  have  commented that DBS Bank is  perceived  to  be\r\n\r\noverpaying for Dao Heng Bank.  Can the Minister also  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  the board and management of DBS Bank considered Dao Heng\r\n\r\nBank to be a good buy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thought I had answered these\r\n\r\nquestions.  SingTel put in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  bid  for  Optus  because they believed  that  a  long-term\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  a  major  telecommunications  corporation  in\r\n\r\nAustralia is in their strategic interest.  It would give them\r\n\r\na large footprint in Australia to be linked up with SingTel's\r\n\r\nown operations both in Singapore and elsewhere in the region.\r\n\r\nThey  are  taking  a  strategic  interest  and  not  so  much\r\n\r\nconcerned about the immediate impact on their share prices or\r\n\r\nshort-term profitability based on Optus' historical results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, DBS Bank has taken a strategic look at where\r\n\r\nthey  want to go offshore and Hong Kong is clearly one market\r\n\r\nwhich,  for obvious reasons, is a must for DBS Bank  if  they\r\n\r\nare  going  to  be  a  regional player  and  because  of  the\r\n\r\npotential   of   entering  China  sooner   or   later.    The\r\n\r\nobservations  of analysts, as I have explained earlier,  tend\r\n\r\nto  take  a relatively short-term view on what the impact  of\r\n\r\nthe acquisition, whether it is three-times the book value  or\r\n\r\notherwise,  may  have on the immediate profitability  of  DBS\r\n\r\nBank.   When you buy a controlling share in a large  company,\r\n\r\ngenerally, you have to pay a substantial premium.   The  size\r\n\r\nof the premium is a judgment which the management has to take\r\n\r\nand  it  is not in Government's interest to try and challenge\r\n\r\nthat decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister is\r\n\r\naware  that  in  the  case of SingTel it is  quite  different\r\n\r\nbecause  it is part of our asset enhancement exercise  and  a\r\n\r\nfairly  large number of Singaporeans own shares  in  SingTel.\r\n\r\nSince  the announcement of the Optus deal, share prices  have\r\n\r\ndropped  by some 30%.  The question I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister is whether there has been any change in the terms of\r\n\r\nthe  deal  and, if there is any change to the  terms  of  the\r\n\r\noriginal  offer, is SingTel prepared to walk  away  from  the\r\n\r\ndeal?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not aware of any\r\n\r\nsignificant   changes.   I  think  SingTel  has   said   that\r\n\r\nnegotiations are proceeding smoothly, including the issue  of\r\n\r\nstrategic  use of the satellites.  So I am not aware  of  any\r\n\r\nchange that would make it necessary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  review  the deal.  So far, this is based on their  public\r\n\r\nannouncements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  clarify  the terms of purchase?   I  hear  that\r\n\r\nSingapore wants to exchange shares and also in cash,  and  is\r\n\r\nit true that the cash component is in US dollars?  If that is\r\n\r\nso,  is  that  the cause of the rise in value  of  US  dollar\r\n\r\nagainst the Singapore dollar?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> SingTel has already announced\r\n\r\nthe  package alternative which is a mix of shares  and  cash,\r\n\r\nand  I  do not think I need to go into it because the  Member\r\n\r\ncan always find it from the publications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the price of purchase being in US\r\n\r\ndollars  - indeed I believe it is in US dollars - and whether\r\n\r\nit  will  have an impact on the Singapore dollar,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the  amounts  are  sufficiently  large  to  move   the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar in a significant way although there  may  be\r\n\r\nshort-term  perturbations which MAS  will  surely  take  into\r\n\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, given that\r\n\r\nthese  are  Government-linked companies and Government  holds\r\n\r\ncontrolling  shares,  may  I ask  the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwhether Government will reassure their counterparts that this\r\n\r\nis  a  private sector deal and not versus their own  national\r\n\r\ninterest, given that these are relatively sensitive  sectors,\r\n\r\nie, telecommunications and banking?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not think that this is an\r\n\r\nissue.

But SingTel  has  said  that  these\r\n\r\ndiscussions  are proceeding smoothly and they do  not  expect\r\n\r\nany particular problems.  In the case of Hong Kong, I believe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Hong Kong monetary authority supports the deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF HON.

Generally, the preferred way of doing this is\r\n\r\nthrough the public listing of shares.  I do not think we have\r\n\r\ndeviated  from  this policy for many years.  The  problem  is\r\n\r\nthat some of these companies are so large that placing of the\r\n\r\nshares in large amounts would destabilise the market.  So  we\r\n\r\nhave  to do it gradually.

As  Mr\r\n\r\nJ  B Jeyaretnam has raised a query on GIC in Question No. 11,\r\n\r\nI suggest Mr Thomas Thomas awaits Government's response later\r\n\r\nin Question Time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the GLCs overseen by Temasek Holdings, most of the\r\n\r\nlarger  companies  would  have made investments  overseas  in\r\n\r\norder  to  seek growth outside the constraints of  the  small\r\n\r\nSingapore market.  Several are publicly listed companies  and\r\n\r\ntheir overseas investments have been well publicised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my response to the questions on\r\n\r\nSingTel's  and  DBS  Bank's acquisitions,  the  GLCs  operate\r\n\r\nstrictly  on  a  commercial basis.  The Government  does  not\r\n\r\ninterfere  in  their  business  decisions,  which   are   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  their  boards  of  directors.   Not   all\r\n\r\noverseas investments will yield immediate benefits but it  is\r\n\r\na  direction which all the larger GLCs will have to  take  if\r\n\r\nthey   are  to  participate  in  an  increasingly  globalised\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Could the Minister\r\n\r\nalso  try  and  explain  the impact the  performance  of  our\r\n\r\nforeign reserves, including Government-linked companies, have\r\n\r\non Central Provident Fund balances and holdings?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The CPF balances are managed by\r\n\r\nthe Government through a mechanism in which the net surpluses\r\n\r\nof  the  CPF are acquired by Government through the issue  of\r\n\r\nlong-term Government bonds to the CPF Board.

The  disease  is\r\n\r\ncaused  by a number of different strains of the bacteria,  of\r\n\r\nwhich the strains A, B and C are responsible for about 90% of\r\n\r\nall cases.  The disease is potentially fatal, with a fatality\r\n\r\nrate  of  about 5% to 10%, and this is despite the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe disease may have been diagnosed and treated early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In year 2000, the World Health Organisation reported an\r\n\r\ninternational  outbreak of the meningococcal disease  related\r\n\r\nto  travel to Saudi Arabia, which was caused by the  uncommon\r\n\r\nstrain,  W135.  In Singapore last year, ie, year 2000,  there\r\n\r\nwere eight reported cases of meningococcal disease related to\r\n\r\ntravel  to  Saudi Arabia, of which five were  caused  by  the\r\n\r\nW135.   In 1999, there were no cases reported at all.  So  we\r\n\r\nhave cases only from the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this international outbreak, in May 2000, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health and the Ministry of the Environment issued\r\n\r\na joint press statement advising all travellers to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSaudi   Arabia   to  be  vaccinated  with  the   quadrivalent\r\n\r\nmeningococcal  vaccine.   This  provides  protection  against\r\n\r\ndisease  caused  by  the  A, C, Y as well  as  W135  strains,\r\n\r\ninstead  of the vaccine against only strains A and C required\r\n\r\nby  Saudi  Arabia.   The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura  (MUIS)\r\n\r\nwas informed of this advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although vaccinated persons are protected against the\r\n\r\ndisease,  a small number of returning pilgrims who have  been\r\n\r\nvaccinated  may  still carry the bacteria in their  nose  and\r\n\r\nmouth  and  transmit  the infection to close  contacts.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  would  like to  advise  that  returning\r\n\r\npilgrims can reduce transmission to close contacts by  simply\r\n\r\nobserving good personal hygiene and by reducing direct  close\r\n\r\ncontact and exposure to respiratory droplets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far in 2001, there were four reported cases in\r\n\r\nSingapore  of meningococcal disease caused by the  W135.   Of\r\n\r\nthe  four, three of them were contacts of returning  pilgrims\r\n\r\nfrom   Saudi  Arabia  who  had  been  vaccinated   with   the\r\n\r\nquadrivalent vaccine. The other was a foreigner with a travel\r\n\r\nhistory  to  Africa.   Of the four, three patients recovered,\r\n\r\nwhile    the   fourth,   unfortunately,   developed   serious\r\n\r\ncomplications and died.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is under control. We do not expect a\r\n\r\nsignificant  increase in cases.  The Ministry of  Health  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  the  Environment  will  again  remind  all\r\n\r\ntravellers  to  Saudi  Arabia  to  be  vaccinated  with   the\r\n\r\nquadrivalent  vaccine  and  advise returning  travellers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  close contacts to seek immediate medical attention  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  unwell.

They are  special  in  that\r\n\r\nsense,  and  the Government takes great pains to ensure  that\r\n\r\ntheir  flats  are  protected.   For  example,  even  in   the\r\n\r\nsituation  where the lessee is made a bankrupt, his creditors\r\n\r\ncannot  touch  his  flat.  That is the extent  to  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would like to make sure that lessees'  flats  are\r\n\r\nprotected.    So   it  does  not  make  sense,   under   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, to then allow the banks to give a  loan  based\r\n\r\nupon the flats.

Hence, the\r\n\r\nintention  to  abolish rent control was  announced  in  April\r\n\r\n1997,  four years ago.  This exceptionally long notice period\r\n\r\nwas  to  give  tenants  sufficient time to  find  alternative\r\n\r\npremises or to reach agreement with their landlords  to  stay\r\n\r\non  after  lifting  of  rent  control.   The  URA  also  sent\r\n\r\nreminders  to tenants every year since April 1997, and  since\r\n\r\nApril last year, every three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has in place two special housing schemes\r\n\r\nfor  residential  tenants affected by the abolition  of  rent\r\n\r\ncontrol.  These are the Old Single Person Tenants' Scheme and\r\n\r\nthe  Rent  Decontrol Housing Assistance Scheme.  Since  1993,\r\n\r\nout  of 502 applicants, 441 of them qualified for either  one\r\n\r\nof  these  housing schemes.  Seven applications were received\r\n\r\nafter  1st April this year when the abolition of rent control\r\n\r\ntook  effect.   Of  these seven, six were  eligible  for  the\r\n\r\nspecial housing schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of rent control was to ensure a\r\n\r\nroof over people's heads, especially during the post-war days\r\n\r\nof  severe  housing shortage.  It was not  meant  to  provide\r\n\r\ncheap  premises for commercial or other non-residential uses.\r\n\r\nTenants who use rent-controlled premises for their businesses\r\n\r\nor  other non-residential purposes have enjoyed exceptionally\r\n\r\nlow  rental  for many, many years.  Such tenants  should  now\r\n\r\nlook for alternative premises on their own, or negotiate with\r\n\r\ntheir landlords for mutually acceptable terms if they wish to\r\n\r\ncontinue to stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

It is for the simple reason, as I said,\r\n\r\nin  the  first  place, the rent control legislation  was  not\r\n\r\nreally  meant  to  allow them to operate out  of  very  cheap\r\n\r\nrental premises.  Indeed, we are aware, for example, of  many\r\n\r\nsuch  tenants  who  have actually sublet  their  premises  at\r\n\r\nconsiderable  financial gain.  Be that as it may,  the  small\r\n\r\nand  medium enterprises have actually been given, as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier, many years of notice in order to allow them to start\r\n\r\nto negotiate with their landlords to prepare for the day when\r\n\r\nthe  rent  control  will finally be lifted.   So  under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the  Government has no  special  arrangements\r\n\r\nmade to either relocate or compensate them.

It is therefore not appropriate to  suspend  the\r\n\r\nthree-quarter tank rule on account of higher petrol prices in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry had informed the\r\n\r\nHouse in January this year that his Ministry is studying  how\r\n\r\nmore  competition  can be introduced into the  petrol  retail\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  is  working  with  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment to study the feasibility of allowing 'white pump'\r\n\r\nsites  to dispense petrol without compromising on fire safety\r\n\r\nand environmental requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, does the Minister appreciate that the\r\n\r\nrule  used  to  be  a half-tank rule and, secondly,  in  that\r\n\r\nsense,  we have increased the margin of protection  that  the\r\n\r\nlocal oil companies have in refusing to lower their prices?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the reason why the half-tank\r\n\r\nrule  was changed to the three-quarter tank rule was  because\r\n\r\nthe  half-tank rule was manifestly inadequate to achieve  the\r\n\r\npurpose  which  we  have  set out to  do.   There  was  still\r\n\r\nconsiderable  leakage due to motorists  leaving  their  tanks\r\n\r\nhalf  full and filling up in Johor.

The market that\r\n\r\nGovernment  has created, first, by setting the  three-quarter\r\n\r\ntank rule (raising it from the half-tank rule), from limiting\r\n\r\nthe number of sites which petrol pumps can be situated and by\r\n\r\nlicensing of petrol pumps, has led to a situation where there\r\n\r\nis  a  near  cartel  which has proven that prices  have  been\r\n\r\nsticky upwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think this is a very sensitive\r\n\r\nsubject.

The only  suppliers  of\r\n\r\npetroleum  here are the major oil companies.  So  unless  you\r\n\r\nare  proposing  to  import finished fuel  directly  from  the\r\n\r\nMiddle-East, then you are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreally going to find it very difficult to compete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of price-fixing and cartel procedure, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry had, in fact, addressed  this\r\n\r\nparticular  problem, in response to a series of questions  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  this year when Dr Teo Ho Pin asked him what measures\r\n\r\ncould   be   taken  to  address  the  apparent  oligopolistic\r\n\r\nbehaviour of oil companies in Singapore.  And he had given  a\r\n\r\nvery comprehensive answer.  I would refer Mr Tay to read  the\r\n\r\ndetails in the Hansard.  But I would just quote briefly  from\r\n\r\nhis first paragraph:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`MTI's study shows that petrol pump prices have moved in\r\n\r\ntandem  with  crude oil prices in the past, but with  a  time\r\n\r\nlag.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  fact, petrol pump prices generally move with crude prices\r\n\r\nafter a lag, both upwards and downwards.  In other words,  if\r\n\r\ncrude oil prices move up, petrol pump prices will not move up\r\n\r\nsimultaneously but with a pronounced lag, and the reason  for\r\n\r\nthis  is  quite clear if you look into how petroleum products\r\n\r\nare  produced.   Crude oil is bought in the Middle-East  from\r\n\r\nOPEC  producers.   It  has got to be  shipped  10,000  miles,\r\n\r\nthrough a long supply chain, to a refinery.  It may be  three\r\n\r\nmonths before crude purchased at higher prices would actually\r\n\r\nreach  the pump.  So a lag is inevitable.  The reverse  works\r\n\r\nthe same way.  If prices of crude fall, the lower crude price\r\n\r\nwill  not be reflected in the pump price until after  a  lag.\r\n\r\nSo  these lags must occur because of the nature of the supply\r\n\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second paragraph, MTI has said that it \"has found\r\n\r\nno  evidence of price fixing by the oil companies.    Because\r\n\r\nthe  industry  structure is oligopolistic, .  price  movement\r\n\r\ntends  to  be sticky and the companies prefer to  compete  on\r\n\r\nfree  gifts and loyalty benefits.\"  Generally, in the  market\r\n\r\nof  this  sort  where  you  have a  few  major  producers  or\r\n\r\nretailers  of  petrol, prices tend to equate largely  because\r\n\r\nthe  cost of producing a litre of petrol nowadays is not very\r\n\r\ndifferent between one company and another.  The difference is\r\n\r\nquite small.  Companies are all equally\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlarge,  they  buy crude from the same people, their  refinery\r\n\r\ncosts are not significantly different, shipping costs are not\r\n\r\nsignificantly  different,  they tender  for  their  sites  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, so their retail costs are not that different.   So\r\n\r\nin  the  end,  differences in pump prices will  not  be  very\r\n\r\nlarge.   That being the case, the market leader who  has  the\r\n\r\nlargest  network  of  retail sites would  probably  have  the\r\n\r\nlowest  unit  cost.   Therefore, he sets  the  price  and  he\r\n\r\nbecomes the market leader.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other companies who have comparable retail prices\r\n\r\nwould then just follow the leader.  If they try to compete by\r\n\r\nslashing price directly, I think, in the end, they would  not\r\n\r\nsucceed.   I  think this is the nature of  retail  oil  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry  like Singapore, where the oil business is  dominated\r\n\r\nby  major companies who have very long supply lines.  If  you\r\n\r\nare  operating  a  retail outlet in the  United  States,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  quite  different  because  the  US  has   many\r\n\r\nindependent oil producers with widely varying oil  production\r\n\r\ncosts,  and  that  allows  them  to  have  different  pricing\r\n\r\nstructures.

The annual values of\r\n\r\nsome  properties  may  not move in tandem  with  the  general\r\n\r\nmovement in property values.  For example, the property might\r\n\r\nhave  undergone  some  improvements  or  there  could  be  an\r\n\r\nimprovement in rents due to local factors or due to policy or\r\n\r\nlaw  changes such as the abolition of rent control, therefore\r\n\r\naffecting the rental value of that property, which will  then\r\n\r\nbe reflected in upward revision of the annual value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY98 and FY99, the percentage of the total stock of\r\n\r\nproperties that had a downward revision in annual values  was\r\n\r\n21%  and  7%  respectively.  A total of 2% have their  annual\r\n\r\nvalues reviewed upwards in FY98 and FY99.  For FY2000,  about\r\n\r\n4%  of  the  total  stock of properties have  had  an  upward\r\n\r\nrevision  in their annual values.  Most were due to additions\r\n\r\nand  alterations to the properties, therefore enhancing their\r\n\r\nrental  values.   1%  had a downward  revision  and  95%  had\r\n\r\nexperienced no change to their annual values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For owners who are dissatisfied with their annual value\r\n\r\nrevisions, there is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  appeals  process,  where  those  who  disagree  with  the\r\n\r\nrevaluations proposed by the Chief Assessor can submit  their\r\n\r\ncases,  and the appeals can finally go to a Valuation  Review\r\n\r\nBoard.

It is better\r\n\r\nthat  we have fewer rules than more rules because more  rules\r\n\r\nonly   make   it   more  complicated.   Now,   it   is   very\r\n\r\nstraightforward.   You  put in on a case-by-case  basis.   So\r\n\r\nlong as we feel that the dignity and respect of the flag  can\r\n\r\nbe safeguarded, I think approval can be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, could I ask what the penalties are\r\n\r\nif  one continues to fly the flag after 31st August, and  how\r\n\r\nmany  people  have  actually been found  for  committing  the\r\n\r\noffence?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Six of the best.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, nothing so severe as\r\n\r\nthat.  The use of the State flag is governed by the Singapore\r\n\r\nArms and Flags and National Anthem Rules 1960.  Anyone guilty\r\n\r\nof  an offence under this rule is liable on conviction  to  a\r\n\r\nfine not exceeding $1,000.

C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Prime Minister what\r\n\r\nprogress  there has been on Singapore 21 and  ways  in  which\r\n\r\nsuch progress can be measured.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay I, before I give the reply, thank Mr Tay for his question\r\n\r\nand opportunity to briefly update this House on Singapore 21.\r\n\r\nRealising  the Singapore 21 vision, or S21 for  short,  is  a\r\n\r\nlong-term process.   To briefly recap, Singapore 21  is  made\r\n\r\nup of five key ideas.  These are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Every Singaporean matters, and can contribute to our\r\n\r\nsociety's development;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Strong families are the foundation of our society\r\n\r\nand our future;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Nurturing the Singapore heartbeat is important,\r\n\r\nbecause it makes us proud to be and want to be Singaporeans;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We want to make Singapore a centre of opportunities\r\n\r\nfor all; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Everyone should be an active citizen, and play a\r\n\r\npart in shaping our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ideas are not new. But they collectively set a\r\n\r\ndirection, and affirm the foundations on which we  build  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore 21 Report was published in April\r\n\r\n1999,  the Government considered how best to take the  vision\r\n\r\nforward.    An   implementation  committee  best   guaranteed\r\n\r\nresults,  but ran counter to the S21 notion that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  take  greater responsibility for shaping  the  future\r\n\r\nsociety  they  want.   To  do nothing,  however,  risked  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 vision dying a premature death.   We  therefore\r\n\r\ndecided  that  a  facilitative  approach  would  best  create\r\n\r\nawareness and ownership of the Singapore 21 ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S21 Facilitation Committee decided that it could\r\n\r\nplay its role by raising public awareness of Singapore 21 and\r\n\r\nby   encouraging  individuals  to  play  an  active  part  in\r\n\r\nrealising S21 goals.  It maintains a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nS21 website, publishes a monthly newsletter, and organises an\r\n\r\nannual    public   conference   to   highlight    significant\r\n\r\ncontributions to the vision and to discuss S21 issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the committee does not prescribe how\r\n\r\nindividuals  and  organisations should respond  to  S21.   It\r\n\r\nleaves it to each person and organisation to respond in  ways\r\n\r\nthey  feel  appropriate because the success of  Singapore  21\r\n\r\ndepends on its values being internalised by Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nmanifested in their lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has worked fairly well. Singapore 21 has\r\n\r\nbecome a familiar term to many.  Good ideas are often raised,\r\n\r\nand  activities  are  often  organised,  in  the  spirit   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  21.  Many people-sector organisations, like  CDCs,\r\n\r\nor  self-help  groups and other NGOs have organised  outreach\r\n\r\nactivities  to  explain Singapore 21  to  their  members  and\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  Some private companies are now helping their\r\n\r\nemployees   to  balance  their  work,  family  and  community\r\n\r\ncommitments.  The public service is also cultivating a spirit\r\n\r\nof  openness and responsiveness amongst its officers to  take\r\n\r\nin  ideas from the public, as well as encouraging them to  be\r\n\r\nactive citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has deliberated on how we can track the\r\n\r\nprogress  of a long-term goal like Singapore 21.    It  noted\r\n\r\nthat  many  Ministries and agencies, such as the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  and Sports, already  have  indicators\r\n\r\nthat   measure   aspects  of  Singapore  21.   The   national\r\n\r\nvolunteerism rate, for example, is an indicator of the  level\r\n\r\nof active citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these indicators do not fluctuate significantly\r\n\r\non  a year-to-year basis, so it may not be very meaningful to\r\n\r\nmeasure   our  progress  in  the  short-term  against   them.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  what  we  are  aiming for  are  qualitative  and\r\n\r\nemotional  results,  such  as a  deeper  sense  of  identity,\r\n\r\nownership and commitment that cannot be measured by  counting\r\n\r\nevents  and  keeping scores. Indicators are  useful,  but  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  over  rely  on them to  track  the  progress  of\r\n\r\nSingapore 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore 21 vision cannot be\r\n\r\nrealised by a committee alone.  It becomes a reality only  if\r\n\r\nthe  whole  community takes an active part  in  building  our\r\n\r\nfuture  society.  If each one of us lives according to  these\r\n\r\nprinciples, then, over time, we will be able to  see  and  to\r\n\r\nfeel the progress that we have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I commend the Minister of State\r\n\r\nfor  the  work that he is doing in the Facilitation Committee\r\n\r\nand the recognition that there needs to be some monitoring or\r\n\r\ntracking.  While I recognise the problems of trying to use ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, no speeches. Can you ask the\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Yes, Sir. May I ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthey  will  move towards an index - trying to bring  together\r\n\r\nthings  like the volunteerism index he mentioned - and  other\r\n\r\nfactors  and  somehow,  although  imperfectly,  reflect   the\r\n\r\ntrends, because when the Minister said they are doing \"fairly\r\n\r\nwell\", I would like to know how he thinks we are doing fairly\r\n\r\nwell, why does he think we are doing fairly well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I say that we are\r\n\r\ndoing \"fairly well\", I look at anecdotal evidence, I look  at\r\n\r\nhow  much  recognition there is for the term \"Singapore  21\",\r\n\r\nand how people raise issues under this banner and argue their\r\n\r\ncase  and  their cause in the name of active citizenship,  on\r\n\r\nthe  principle  that  everybody does matter  or  can  make  a\r\n\r\ncontribution.  And I think we see these arguments being  made\r\n\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to indicators, I indicated in my reply there are\r\n\r\nseveral agencies that already seek to monitor various  social\r\n\r\nindicators.   I  do  know that MCDS  is  working  on  a  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  set of indicators but, perhaps,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nmore appropriate for them to explain that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLICE WARNING TO MR JAMES GOMEZ AND MR KEVIN LIEW</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Justification)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Is the Minister  aware  that\r\n\r\nsection 5(2) requires the Minister, first of all, by an order\r\n\r\n- which I take will be published in the Gazette - to prohibit\r\n\r\nany  assembly or procession in any public place,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  after  that  order  has been made  that  the  penalties\r\n\r\nprovided under section 5(4)\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncome  into operation?  The rules were made to implement these\r\n\r\nsections of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my first question, following what I have told the\r\n\r\nMinister,  is when was this order made that any  assembly  at\r\n\r\nthe Speakers' Corner is prohibited.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, once again, Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  reads the Act selectively because, under  section\r\n\r\n5(1), rules can be made by the Minister to govern assemblies.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  under  section  5(1) of the Act,  the  Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nOffences   (Public  Order  and  Nuisance)   (Assemblies   and\r\n\r\nProcessions) Rules are promulgated legally, and Rule 2 states\r\n\r\nvery clearly that any assembly of five or more persons in any\r\n\r\npublic place to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) demonstrate support for or opposition to the views\r\n\r\nor actions of any person;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to publicise a cause or campaign; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to mark or commemorate any event,\r\n\r\nmust get a permit under these rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister accept that rules owe\r\n\r\ntheir  legitimacy to the parent Act?  I repeat: was there  an\r\n\r\norder made by the Minister under section 5(2) prohibiting the\r\n\r\nholding of any assembly in the Speakers' Corner?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam is a\r\n\r\nlawyer.   He  must know that sections must be read  in  their\r\n\r\ntotality.  He has mentioned section 5(2).  But that is in the\r\n\r\ncontext of the entire section 5, and section 5(1) allows  the\r\n\r\nMinister to make rules and the Minister has made these rules.\r\n\r\nSo  section 5(2) will not apply.  Section 5(2) may apply, for\r\n\r\nexample,  in a situation where the Minister makes a  specific\r\n\r\norder  as  to a particular place, but it is still subject  to\r\n\r\nsection 5(1) and the rules which have been promulgated.   And\r\n\r\nwe  have said very clearly in Parliament when we set  up  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner, that the Speakers' Corner will be  subject\r\n\r\nto the laws of the land.  And the Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOffences rules are indeed part of the laws of the land.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I have an answer to the question?\r\n\r\nHas  the  Minister made any order or declaration that  before\r\n\r\nanybody  holds  an assembly at the Speakers' Corner  he  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  get  a  licence?   May I have  an  answer  to  that\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> May I ask the hon. Member\r\n\r\nwhether or not the Speakers' Corner is a public place?  Under\r\n\r\nsection  5(1), read with Rule 2 of the Miscellaneous Offences\r\n\r\nRules,  any  assembly  of five or more persons  in  a  public\r\n\r\nplace,  if  they do (a), (b) or (c), they must  apply  for  a\r\n\r\npermit.   And that is the governing provision, in so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe Speakers' Corner is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, if Mr Jeyaretnam or anybody is doubtful\r\n\r\nabout  it, he can challenge it in court.  But, in this  case,\r\n\r\nMr  James Gomez accepted the warning, which means that he did\r\n\r\nnot  challenge the interpretation of the laws by  the  police\r\n\r\nand the AG's Chambers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I again ask the Minister: did his\r\n\r\nMinister  say  in  this House not very long ago  that  nobody\r\n\r\nneeds  any  permit  for  going to the  Speakers'  Corner  and\r\n\r\naddress  an assembly, that all he had to do was to  register?\r\n\r\nAre  we to understand that that utterance by the Minister was\r\n\r\nsimply  hot air and that it will be an offence for any person\r\n\r\nto assemble at the Speakers' Corner to listen to somebody?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I do not know who is\r\n\r\nspouting  hot air and who is selectively hearing speeches  in\r\n\r\nParliament.   The  Minister said that one does  not  have  to\r\n\r\napply  for  a  permit to speak, because he was talking  about\r\n\r\nexemption  under the Public Entertainments Act.  So  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  exemption.   He also said that one needs to comply  with\r\n\r\nall  the  other laws of the land and, like I have  said,  the\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous  Offences Rules are part of  the  laws  of  the\r\n\r\nland.   So  the  exemption  is to speak,  not  exemption  for\r\n\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell us what did\r\n\r\nthese two persons do at the Speakers' Corner on 10th December\r\n\r\nlast year except to speak?

It was not a matter of people\r\n\r\njust going there to speak, but it was an organised gathering.\r\n\r\nThey had organised a gathering of people - in this case about\r\n\r\n60  people  -  to  commemorate an event, International  Human\r\n\r\nRights Day, and \"to demonstrate\" - the words were used in the\r\n\r\nnotice which was publicised on the Think Centre website - \"to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate\"  against the abolition of the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone through this debate many times in this\r\n\r\nHouse, Mr Speaker, and I have made my points very clear, that\r\n\r\nover  the last eight months, more than 800 registrations have\r\n\r\nbeen  received and people have spoken, people have  listened.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I do not know if anybody goes there now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It only will trap those who\r\n\r\nthink that it is a trap.  Mr Jeyaretnam probably thinks it is\r\n\r\na  trap  because  at  the outset he condemned  the  Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner,  both in Singapore and overseas, and said  it  was  a\r\n\r\n\"farce\"  and only meant for irresponsible people  to  go  and\r\n\r\nspeak.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the police is always looking for ways to\r\n\r\nserve  our  people better.  For this reason, it is constantly\r\n\r\nreviewing  a  system  of  policing  and,  if  necessary,  the\r\n\r\nboundaries of our Police Land Divisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure of Geylang Police Division on 17th December\r\n\r\nlast  year was a result of this review.  After careful study,\r\n\r\nthe police concluded that its operational effectiveness would\r\n\r\nbe  enhanced,  and the public better served, by  reorganising\r\n\r\nits resources from seven into six Police Divisions, each with\r\n\r\nits  complement  of Neighbourhood Police Centres  (NPCs)  and\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs).  Thus, the areas  formerly\r\n\r\nunder  the jurisdiction of Geylang Police Division have  been\r\n\r\nabsorbed   under  Ang  Mo  Kio,  Bedok  and  Tanglin   Police\r\n\r\nDivisions.  This reorganisation enables the police to operate\r\n\r\ncloser  to areas where its services are most needed, such  as\r\n\r\nareas of high population density.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the police has opened four new Neighbourhood Police\r\n\r\nCentres (NPCs) to serve the needs of the residents in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narea  formerly  covered  by  Geylang  Division.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Police reorganisation is\r\n\r\ndone  systematically and carefully.  In fact, police  decided\r\n\r\nto  follow the URA's Development Guide Plans.  Under the  URA\r\n\r\nDevelopment Guide Plans, there are five regions.  But in  the\r\n\r\nPolice  scheme of things, there are six, because the  central\r\n\r\nregion  is  a  big one.  So there are two divisions  there  - Central  and  Tanglin.  For the eastern region, we  have  got\r\n\r\nBedok  and Geylang under this redivision.  Between  the  two,\r\n\r\nthe Police decided to close down Geylang Division because  it\r\n\r\nwas  smaller.   This is all very rational  and  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister of State tell us\r\n\r\nwhether  the  prosecutions of some officers from the  Geylang\r\n\r\nDivision  for their links with gambling and brothel operators\r\n\r\nwere  one  of  the  reasons  for  closing  down  the  Geylang\r\n\r\nDivision?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The police does not work on\r\n\r\nsuch  short-term  considerations.  It is an  overall  review,\r\n\r\nlooking   at   both   the  immediate   and   also   long-term\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  and  also in line with  the  repackaging  of\r\n\r\nservices.

Our objective of  ensuring\r\n\r\nfinancial  stability is unchanged.  But in order  to  have  a\r\n\r\nmore  dynamic  and vibrant financial sector, we have  shifted\r\n\r\nemphasis from regulation to supervision.  We have moved  away\r\n\r\nfrom one-size-fits-all laws and regulations, towards tailored\r\n\r\nsupervision  of  individual institutions  according  to  each\r\n\r\ninstitution's financial strength, risk management  capability\r\n\r\nand risk profile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important changes have been to the banking\r\n\r\nsector.   Banking  is not just the biggest  industry  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector.   A sound and dynamic  banking  system  is\r\n\r\ncritical  to  financial stability and to the entire  economy.\r\n\r\nWe need to attract quality\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninternational  banks and, at the same time, build  up  strong\r\n\r\nlocal banks able to compete against the best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1999, MAS launched the first phase of the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the banking sector.  We introduced  greater\r\n\r\nforeign  competition, removed foreign shareholding limits  on\r\n\r\nlocal banks, and raised standards of corporate governance and\r\n\r\ndisclosure.  We required banks to form nominating  committees\r\n\r\nto vet key appointments of directors and top executives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2000, we required banks to separate their\r\n\r\nfinancial and non-financial businesses, and unwind the cross-shareholdings within the local banking groups.  This  was  to\r\n\r\nlimit  the  risk of contagion from non-banking businesses  to\r\n\r\nbanks,  improve  the  banks'  corporate  governance,  enhance\r\n\r\ntransparency  of  transactions  and  market  discipline,  and\r\n\r\nensure  that  bank managements focus their attention  on  the\r\n\r\ncomplex  business  of banking in an increasingly  competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these major initiatives, we have been updating\r\n\r\nand  streamlining  many banking regulations,  for  which  the\r\n\r\nunderlying objectives are either no longer valid or not being\r\n\r\neffectively met.  We have amended rules to give banks greater\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  operational flexibility  without  compromising\r\n\r\nprudence.   We  have also adopted a risk-focused  supervisory\r\n\r\napproach  that  enhances  our  oversight  on  banks   without\r\n\r\nincreasing their cost of regulatory compliance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing our supervisory framework for the banking\r\n\r\nsector  is  a  continuous process.  Several important  pieces\r\n\r\nhave  been put in place, and more will be done over the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years.   The  enactment of the Banking (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  give legislative effect to new policy changes announced\r\n\r\nin  the past year.  The Bill will also introduce several  new\r\n\r\nchanges to bring the Banking Act up to date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Bill, MAS has consulted widely with the\r\n\r\nindustry through the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Banks in Singapore, and with accounting  and\r\n\r\nlegal  practitioners.   The  individual  amendments  to   the\r\n\r\nBanking Act are explained in the explanatory statement to the\r\n\r\nBill.  I also circulated earlier a separate Explanatory  Note\r\n\r\nto Members, following the First Reading of the Bill.  Today I\r\n\r\npropose to speak in detail only on the major changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Giving Effect To Announced Policies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of giving effect to announced policy changes, I\r\n\r\nshall  discuss three main ones: (1) separation  of  financial\r\n\r\nand non-financial activities; (2) revision of ownership rules\r\n\r\nfor  local  banks;  and  (3)  reduction  of  paid-up  capital\r\n\r\nrequirements for local bank subsidiaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, separation of financial and non-financial\r\n\r\nactivities.  New sections 30 to 35 will prohibit  banks  from\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  any  business which is not  banking  business,\r\n\r\nother  financial business regulated or authorised by MAS,  or\r\n\r\nbusiness which is incidental to financial business.  Business\r\n\r\nincidental  to financial business includes the  provision  of\r\n\r\nclearing  and  settlement  services,  custody,  trustee   and\r\n\r\nnominee  services,  financial advisory activity  as  well  as\r\n\r\nagency  transactional services where the banks act as  agents\r\n\r\nfor  third  party  products but take on  no  additional  risk\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks will have to obtain MAS' approval before acquiring\r\n\r\na  major stake in any company.  If the company being acquired\r\n\r\ncarries  on  non-financial  activities,  MAS  will  generally\r\n\r\nwithhold  consent, although it may grant approval  if,  after\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with  the bank, it is satisfied  that  there  are\r\n\r\nclear  synergies  with the bank's financial  business.   Over\r\n\r\ntime, MAS will be able to develop a list of such approved non-financial  businesses,  so  that  banks  need  not  seek  our\r\n\r\napproval for each acquisition.  The list will naturally  have\r\n\r\nto  be  regularly updated.  The financial industry is rapidly\r\n\r\nevolving, and it is not possible to define a static  list  of\r\n\r\napproved activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While banks should not venture into non-financial\r\n\r\nactivities, we do need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nallow  them  some flexibility to own shares in  non-financial\r\n\r\ncompanies,  for  portfolio  investment  purposes.   The   new\r\n\r\nsection  32  will  allow  banks to  purchase  non-controlling\r\n\r\nstakes  (generally 10% or less) in the share capital  of  any\r\n\r\ncompany.   To limit concentration risks, the new  section  31\r\n\r\nwill limit equity investments in any single company to 2%  of\r\n\r\nthe  bank's  capital  funds, while the new  section  33  will\r\n\r\nrevise the rules on a bank's immovable property holdings  and\r\n\r\nlower the limit to 20% of its capital funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These restrictions on non-financial business will also\r\n\r\napply   to  the  branches  of  foreign  banks  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nContagion  and  other risks arising from the  co-mingling  of\r\n\r\nfinancial and non-financial businesses can affect all  banks,\r\n\r\nwhether local or foreign.  The policy is thus relevant across\r\n\r\nthe entire banking sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Bill will prohibit a person from using\r\n\r\nany   logo  or  trademark  in  a  manner  that  would   imply\r\n\r\nassociation  with  a bank incorporated in  Singapore  or  its\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  carrying  on financial  business,  unless  that\r\n\r\nperson  is a financial affiliate of the bank or its financial\r\n\r\nholding  company.   This  will  limit  the  reputational  and\r\n\r\ncontagion risks from such name-sharing between the  bank  and\r\n\r\nits non-financial affiliates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend section 78 of the Act to enable MAS\r\n\r\nto   make   regulations  which  spell  out   other   detailed\r\n\r\nrequirements on the separation of financial and non-financial\r\n\r\nactivities,   including  the  prohibition   on   sharing   of\r\n\r\nmanagement  between  the  bank group  and  its  non-financial\r\n\r\naffiliates, and on cross-shareholdings within the bank group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new measures will require local banks to undertake\r\n\r\nsignificant  corporate restructuring and divestment  of  non-financial  assets.  To ensure that the process is  undertaken\r\n\r\nin  an orderly manner, the new section 34 will allow banks  a\r\n\r\nthree-year  grace  period,  from  the  time  that   the   new\r\n\r\namendments take effect, to divest any investment assets which\r\n\r\nthey hold at that time.  MAS has been in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclose  discussion  with the banks on  their  plans  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  keep  close watch over the divestment  process.\r\n\r\nThere  is no reason to force the banks to conduct fire  sales\r\n\r\nin  a  depressed  market.  This would be detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  banks'  shareholders,  and  might  weaken  our\r\n\r\nfinancial  system.   But  the banks  have  to  act  with  due\r\n\r\ndespatch  within the three-year period, and  I  am  confident\r\n\r\nthat they will do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, revision of ownership rules for local banks. When\r\n\r\nMAS  lifted the 40% aggregate foreign shareholding limit  for\r\n\r\nlocal  banks,  it  had  also introduced  a  new  shareholding\r\n\r\napproval  threshold  of  12%, to be  added  to  the  existing\r\n\r\nthresholds  at 5% and 20%.  The Bill revises sections  15  to\r\n\r\n18, which relate to the approval of controllers of Singapore-incorporated  banks,  to  ensure  that  control  rests   with\r\n\r\nindividuals  or groups whose interests are aligned  with  the\r\n\r\nlong-term interests of the Singapore economy and the national\r\n\r\ninterest.  The new 12% threshold gives greater flexibility to\r\n\r\nMAS  to  allow  strategic  partners and  large  institutional\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  reach  and  cross the 5%  shareholding  level,\r\n\r\nwithout   having   to  also  allow  their  stakes   to   grow\r\n\r\nunrestrained up to 20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended sections will also address passive increases\r\n\r\nin   shareholdings  and  shareholders  acting   in   concert.\r\n\r\nLegislative  powers will be introduced for  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nobject  to persons who were previously allowed to exceed  the\r\n\r\nthreshold levels but who subsequently become unacceptable  as\r\n\r\nsignificant shareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, reduction of paid-up capital requirements for\r\n\r\nlocal  bank  subsidiaries.  The Bill provides for  a  reduced\r\n\r\nminimum  paid-up  capital requirement of  S$100  million  for\r\n\r\nbanking  subsidiaries of Singapore-incorporated  banks  which\r\n\r\nhave  themselves  met the S$1.5 billion capital  requirement.\r\n\r\n(This  will  be  in a new section 9A to be  inserted  in  the\r\n\r\nBanking  Act.)  This was announced in July 2000  as  part  of\r\n\r\nMAS'  Internet  banking policy.  The reduced paid-up  capital\r\n\r\nrequirement  facilitates the setting up  by  local  banks  of\r\n\r\nbanking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  which  adopt  new  business  models,  such   as\r\n\r\nInternet-only banking.  These new banking subsidiaries may be\r\n\r\nset  up  together  with joint venture partners  provided  the\r\n\r\nparent local bank retains control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Policy Changes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for new policy changes contained in the Bill, I shall\r\n\r\nelaborate on four main ones: (1) revision of banking  secrecy\r\n\r\nprovisions;  (2)  prohibition  of  unlicensed  deposit-taking\r\n\r\nservices;  (3)  flexibility  for  MAS  to  prescribe  capital\r\n\r\nadequacy  requirements  on  a  supervisory  basis;  and   (4)\r\n\r\nrevision   of  methodology  for  regulating  property-related\r\n\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revision of Banking Secrecy Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking secrecy provisions of the Banking Act\r\n\r\nprotect  the confidentiality of customer information.   Tight\r\n\r\nbanking secrecy is important to maintaining the confidence of\r\n\r\ncustomers  in  our  banking  system.   However,  our  present\r\n\r\nbanking secrecy provisions have impeded banks wanting to take\r\n\r\nadvantage of potential operational benefits and savings.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  banks  find  it  difficult to  securitise  mortgage\r\n\r\nloans, or to outsource data processing to third parties.  MAS\r\n\r\nhas  reviewed  the banking secrecy provisions in consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the  industry.  We have considered both the operational\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  banks  and the need  to  preserve  customer\r\n\r\nconfidentiality.  The measures set out in the new section  47\r\n\r\nstrike   a  careful  balance  between  these  two   sets   of\r\n\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 47 will stipulate a wider set of\r\n\r\ncircumstances   under  which  banks  can  disclose   customer\r\n\r\ninformation, and the terms of such disclosure.  These are set\r\n\r\nout  in  a  new Sixth Schedule, which consists of two  parts.\r\n\r\nPart I will contain many of the existing exceptions, and Part\r\n\r\nII  will  contain most of the new exceptions to  the  secrecy\r\n\r\nprovisions.  Examples of new exceptions are the disclosure of\r\n\r\ncredit information in a sale or transfer of credit facilities\r\n\r\n(for  example,  asset securitisation), and the disclosure  of\r\n\r\ncustomer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninformation  to  a  bank's head office  for  risk  management\r\n\r\npurposes.   Two  key  points about the  new  exceptions  are,\r\n\r\nfirst,  only  very few exceptions have been allowed  for  the\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of  information relating to a customer's  deposit\r\n\r\nand  funds  placed for investment; and second, a  person  who\r\n\r\nreceives customer information will be required by law to keep\r\n\r\nthe information confidential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures ensure that by law, all banks will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  basic  level of customer confidentiality  to  all\r\n\r\ntheir customers.  Beyond this legal minimum, individual banks\r\n\r\nand  customers  may reach their own contractual  arrangements\r\n\r\noffering  higher standards of confidentiality.  The Act  does\r\n\r\nnot  compel  a bank to invoke the newly introduced exceptions\r\n\r\nif  the  bank deems this to be in the best interests  of  its\r\n\r\nbusiness and its customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prohibition of Unlicensed Offering of Deposit-Taking Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taking of deposits is an integral part of banking\r\n\r\nbusiness  regulated  under the Banking Act.   However,  under\r\n\r\ncurrent provisions in the Banking Act, deposit-taking on  its\r\n\r\nown   is  not  a  regulated  activity.   A  company  is  only\r\n\r\nconsidered  to be conducting banking business if  it  carries\r\n\r\nout  three  related  activities - deposit  taking,  extending\r\n\r\nloans,  and  providing  customers with  chequing  facilities.\r\n\r\nHence,  a company set up to take deposits in Singapore  which\r\n\r\ndoes not also grant loans and provide chequing services would\r\n\r\nnot  need to meet MAS' licensing requirements or abide by the\r\n\r\nBanking Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But new business models have emerged in the changing\r\n\r\nbanking  industry.  Some banks now operate using an Internet-only  strategy.  They take deposits but do not extend  loans,\r\n\r\nyet  there  is  no  doubt  they are banks,  and  need  to  be\r\n\r\nregulated  like  banks.   We therefore  need  to  update  the\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will introduce new sections 4A to 4C to\r\n\r\ngenerally restrict deposit-taking in Singapore in the  course\r\n\r\nof  a deposit-taking business to institutions licensed by MAS\r\n\r\nor specifically exempted.  The new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions   will  also  prohibit  offers,  invitations   and\r\n\r\nadvertisements  to the public in Singapore to place  deposits\r\n\r\nwith any deposit-taking business.  Again, this does not apply\r\n\r\nto   institutions  licensed  in  Singapore  or   specifically\r\n\r\nexempted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new rules will accord the public a measure of\r\n\r\nprotection.  But they do not prevent anyone from seeking  out\r\n\r\non  their  own, via the Internet or other means, the services\r\n\r\nof  financial institutions operating overseas.   Persons  who\r\n\r\nchoose to do so take their own risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to assure the House that the new provisions\r\n\r\nare  not  meant  to restrict capital market  fund-raising  by\r\n\r\ncorporations   which  are  not  carrying  on   deposit-taking\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Such companies issue bonds and notes from time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  and  these  will generally not be considered  deposit-taking  business.   Where necessary,  MAS  may  make  further\r\n\r\nexemptions   to  clarify  that  capital  market  fund-raising\r\n\r\nactivities are not restricted by the new provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Flexibility for MAS to Prescribe Capital Adequacy Requirements on a Supervisory Basis</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 10 is amended to enable MAS to impose, on a\r\n\r\nsupervisory  basis,  specific capital requirements  over  and\r\n\r\nabove  the  statutory minimum that apply to  all  banks,  and\r\n\r\nspecific  capital adequacy ratio requirements that vary  from\r\n\r\nthe stipulated minimum of 12%.  This amendment allows MAS  to\r\n\r\nimpose  capital  requirements appropriate  to  an  individual\r\n\r\nbank's risk profile and management capabilities.  This  risk-focused supervisory approach is being increasingly recognised\r\n\r\nand  followed  by regulators in other key financial  centres.\r\n\r\nAfter  the enactment of this amendment, MAS will engage  each\r\n\r\nbank  in  an  ongoing consultative process to  determine  the\r\n\r\nappropriate level of capital that it should maintain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revision   of  Methodology  for  Monitoring  Property-Related Exposure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to effectively monitor and limit banks'\r\n\r\nexposure to the property\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector  in order to minimise the vulnerability of the banking\r\n\r\nsystem  in  a property market downturn.  Section  34  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Banking  Act  limits loans  secured  by  \"immovable\r\n\r\nproperty   for  the  purpose  of  purchasing,  improving   or\r\n\r\naltering\"  that  property to 30% of the  bank's  deposits  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This statutory requirement will be repealed  and\r\n\r\nreplaced  by a section empowering MAS to make regulations  to\r\n\r\nlimit banks' property-related risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another facet of the risk-focused supervisory\r\n\r\napproach.   In some jurisdictions, the law does not prescribe\r\n\r\nany  limits to the exposure of banks to the property  market.\r\n\r\nIt  is  left  entirely to regulators to exercise  supervisory\r\n\r\ndiscretion.  In Singapore, a major part of the banks' lending\r\n\r\ncomprises  loans that are directly or indirectly  related  to\r\n\r\nproperty.   This is because of the structure of our  economy.\r\n\r\nMany  manufacturers are MNCs who depend on their own  sources\r\n\r\nof  financing rather than on local banks.  Rather than  leave\r\n\r\nthe  matter  entirely to the discretion of the regulator,  we\r\n\r\nhave decided that the Banking Act should explicitly spell out\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of MAS' supervision of banks' property  exposure,\r\n\r\nwhile  leaving the specific approach and degree of  tightness\r\n\r\nto MAS' judgement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the enactment of the Bill, MAS intends to\r\n\r\nimplement, via regulations, a new methodology to monitor  and\r\n\r\nlimit  property-related  exposure.  The  old  methodology  is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory in several ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it only limits loans secured on immovable\r\n\r\nproperty, and fails to capture loan exposures to the property\r\n\r\nsector  that may not be secured on property, for  example,  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  loan  to a property developer.  The new  methodology\r\n\r\nwill impose a limit on all loans and debt instruments for the\r\n\r\npurpose of property development or investment, whether or not\r\n\r\nit is secured on immovable property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the old methodology limits property exposure to\r\n\r\na  proportion  of the bank's deposits.  But deposits  can  be\r\n\r\ninflated  by  borrowing via the inter-bank market.   The  new\r\n\r\nmethodology will limit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperty  loans to a proportion of the bank's total  non-bank\r\n\r\nloans   and   debt  instruments.   This  encourages   healthy\r\n\r\ndiversification in the bank's loan portfolio.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the old methodology includes owner-occupied\r\n\r\nhousing  loans secured on the property.  The new  methodology\r\n\r\nexcludes   owner-occupied  housing  loans  from  the   limit,\r\n\r\nrecognising  that  its risk of default is  lower  than  other\r\n\r\nproperty loans.  Owner-occupied housing loans will be subject\r\n\r\nto  separate supervisory limits where warranted, according to\r\n\r\nthe circumstances of each bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS intends initially to set the limit on banks'\r\n\r\nproperty  exposure  at  35%  of  its  total  loans  and  debt\r\n\r\ninstruments.   The  main banks are all currently  below  this\r\n\r\nlimit.   For  the  handful of smaller banks  which  currently\r\n\r\nexceed the limit, MAS will grant them a short grace period to\r\n\r\nbring down their ratios.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any misunderstanding that this change is\r\n\r\nintended  either  to tighten or loosen bank  lending  to  the\r\n\r\nproperty sector, let me state explicitly that this is not the\r\n\r\ncase.   Our  aim  is rather to enable MAS to more  accurately\r\n\r\nmonitor  and  limit banks' exposure to the  property  sector.\r\n\r\nWhether the 35% limit will be tightened or loosened in future\r\n\r\nis   an  entirely  separate  policy  decision  that  will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered in the future, and will depend on our view of  the\r\n\r\nrisk profile of the banking sector, and our view of the risks\r\n\r\nin the property market at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to take the House through the rest of\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  that  will be made in the  order  that  they\r\n\r\nappear in the Bill.  These include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments to the provisions in section 9 on capital\r\n\r\nrequirements for foreign banks to allow the bank's issued and\r\n\r\npaid-up  capital or its equivalent, and the bank's  reserves,\r\n\r\nto count towards the S$200 million capital requirement;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeal of the rule in section 24 prohibiting payment\r\n\r\nof  dividends  by banks until all capitalised expenditure  is\r\n\r\nwritten  off.  This is in line with new accounting  standards\r\n\r\nthat require goodwill to be amortised over a number of years;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeal of provisions in section 25 empowering MAS to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  form in which a bank publishes its  accounts.\r\n\r\nThis  is  no longer necessary because MAS does not  prescribe\r\n\r\nthe form of presentation, verify the accuracy of the accounts\r\n\r\nor  decide  on  any other details in relation to  the  bank's\r\n\r\naccounts.   This  is and should remain the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe Board of the bank and the bank's external auditors;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 62 to clarify that Singapore-incorporated banks are able to issue subordinated debt that\r\n\r\nqualifies as regulatory capital;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The updating of penalties in the Banking Act to\r\n\r\nunderscore the importance of sound prudential standards.   In\r\n\r\ngeneral the penalties have been multiplied by a factor of  5.\r\n\r\nThis  is not excessive considering that many of the penalties\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  revised  since  1984,  and  some  have  been\r\n\r\nunchanged since 1970.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, these amendments to the Banking Act will\r\n\r\nimplement   key  measures  to  strengthen  MAS'  risk-focused\r\n\r\nsupervision  of the banking sector, upgrade the local  banks,\r\n\r\nand  provide  all banks with greater operational flexibility.\r\n\r\nMAS  is currently reviewing policy changes to other areas  of\r\n\r\nour  supervisory  framework.  A new Banking (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nwill be tabled once the next major pieces are ready, probably\r\n\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nstart by stating explicitly that I support all the provisions\r\n\r\nin   this  Banking  (Amendment)  Bill.   The  amendments  are\r\n\r\npositive as they generally strengthen the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregulatory and legislative structure of the banking industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments pertain to stronger prudential\r\n\r\nsafeguards  and  corporate  governance,  greater  operational\r\n\r\nflexibility and facilitating risk supervision of  the  banks.\r\n\r\nAs  said by the Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee, who is also the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  MAS,  these  changes  will  ultimately  benefit\r\n\r\ndepositors  and  shareholders, and strengthen  the  financial\r\n\r\nsystem as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rules that I particularly like are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Separation of financial and non-financial\r\n\r\nactivities  of  local banking groups, and  the  3-year  grace\r\n\r\nperiod for the divestments to take effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The revision of ownership rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Revision of methodology of monitoring property-related exposure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Prohibition of unlicensed offering of deposit-taking services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Changes to the capital adequacy requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from these amendments, I have the following\r\n\r\nclarifications and queries which I wish to pose to the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the overall consolidation and merger of local\r\n\r\nbanks.   The Government has expressed the wish to see  faster\r\n\r\nconsolidation  of  local  banks, so  that  they  can  achieve\r\n\r\ngreater   size  and  bulk,  to  be  better  able  to  compete\r\n\r\nregionally  and  internationally.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister whether the Government is  happy  with\r\n\r\nthe  current pace of restructuring and consolidation of local\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of consolidation, I would like to urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government  not  to  forget the  small  SMEs  and  small\r\n\r\ndepositors.  Bigger banks mean that they will target for  and\r\n\r\nconcentrate on the big customers.  Hence, I am concerned that\r\n\r\nthe smaller customers and depositors may be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneglected, and given poorer service.  This is evident in  the\r\n\r\nmerger  of  DBS Bank and POSBank.  There have been  instances\r\n\r\nrecently  where  the  small  depositors  have  to  suffer   a\r\n\r\nsignificant drop of the service standards and an increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  charges  imposed on them.  I would  therefore  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or the MAS to be mindful of these developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the prohibition of unlicensed offering of\r\n\r\ndeposit-taking services.  This restriction is targeted mainly\r\n\r\nat entities that are offering deposit-taking services through\r\n\r\nthe  Internet.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhow  the  Government could regulate Internet banking entities\r\n\r\nthat  are  not  domiciled  in Singapore,  and  therefore  not\r\n\r\nsubject to MAS' licensing and rules.  I recall that about two\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  there  was an Internet bank started  in  the  UK\r\n\r\ncalled  EGG.com.  This company offered better interest  rates\r\n\r\nto  attract depositors and managed to amass 7 billion  pounds\r\n\r\nof  deposits  within  one  year.  If  such  Internet  banking\r\n\r\ncompanies  were to lure Singapore depositors with substantial\r\n\r\nhigher  interest rates and other benefits, some  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  residents  may  fall for it.  How  do  we  regulate  and\r\n\r\ncontrol such Internet banking operators who are not operating\r\n\r\nwithin Singapore, but attract deposits from overseas?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, flexibility for MAS to prescribe capital adequacy\r\n\r\nrequirements.  The present Banking Act requires  local  banks\r\n\r\nto  maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR)  of  12%.\r\n\r\nThe  new  amendment  will allow MAS to  prescribe  CAR  on  a\r\n\r\nconsultative  basis.  This is a meaningful flexibility  which\r\n\r\nMAS  can  decide  to impose lower CAR for the stronger  local\r\n\r\nbanks  which are therefore better able to take a higher  risk\r\n\r\nprofile  so  as to compete internationally.  For instance,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the Basel Accord only requires  a  8%  CAR.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we have to be aware that if the CAR on  some  local\r\n\r\nbanks  is lowered, would the depositors be subject to  higher\r\n\r\nrisk?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, MAS may decide to impose higher CAR for\r\n\r\nthe smaller local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbanks.   I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minster whether\r\n\r\nor  not,  in  this case, MAS is setting uneven standards  and\r\n\r\nrules on CAR for the various local banks, thereby creating an\r\n\r\nunlevel playing field between the local banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of my queries and questions. May I\r\n\r\nconclude by stating that I fully support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to support the Banking (Amendment) Bill which seeks  to\r\n\r\neffect  changes  to  revised and new policies  and  measures.\r\n\r\nThese  will  help  position Singapore banks  better  in  ever\r\n\r\nchanging  circumstances that will require and reward  greater\r\n\r\noperational  flexibility.   At  the  same  time,  we   should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  have  the  assurance that  banks  meet  minimum\r\n\r\nprudential limits in order to preserve the integrity  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   banking   system,   something   which   we   have\r\n\r\npainstakingly built up over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes cover a wide range of issues but I\r\n\r\nwould like to limit my comments to the following three areas,\r\n\r\nnamely,  capital  adequacy,  property  exposure  and  banking\r\n\r\nsecrecy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, capital adequacy of banks. It is a well-known\r\n\r\nfact  that  unlike  banks elsewhere which are  found  wanting\r\n\r\nduring  an  economic  downturn,  Singapore  banks  are  well-capitalised.   In fact, for many years, the  main  grouse  of\r\n\r\ninstitutional  investors  in banking  stocks  has  been  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  banks are over-capitalised.  Hence, their  returns\r\n\r\non  capital would pale in comparison with those of comparable\r\n\r\nbanks elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, capital efficiency has figured\r\n\r\nprominently and banks have sought other ways of funding their\r\n\r\nactivities whilst reducing the capital base.  Notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthat,  banks  here  still generally keep a  capital  adequacy\r\n\r\nratio  (CAR)  well above the MAS' minimum of  12%,  which  is\r\n\r\nitself  already  higher  than  8%  imposed  by  the  Bank  of\r\n\r\nInternational\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSettlements (BIS) on all banks.  According to published data,\r\n\r\nthe  average CAR of the top five locally owned banks  ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  16%  to  24% was 19% in year 2000.  Thus, the  proposed\r\n\r\nflexibility  for the MAS, in clause 12, to set  bank-specific\r\n\r\nCAR  above its relatively high 12% minimum, runs the risk  of\r\n\r\nbeing seen as an over-kill unless the circumstances for  such\r\n\r\nan  imposition,  such as the innovation of  new  but  riskier\r\n\r\nactivities, are well understood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, our local CAR standards must always be\r\n\r\nseen  in  the  context  of  regional  or  even  international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  as well as the ambitions of Singapore  banks\r\n\r\nto  expand offshore.  Imposing higher standards for Singapore\r\n\r\nbanks   may   unwittingly  limit  the  ability   to   compete\r\n\r\nmeaningfully as their threshold returns would be much higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the intent behind the introduction of\r\n\r\nflexibility is a sound one, I would like to urge the  MAS  to\r\n\r\nconstantly  review  its 12% minimum  level  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nlowering  it  to  reward banks for good behaviour,  that  is,\r\n\r\nbanks  who  are themselves using internal models to calculate\r\n\r\nrisk  so as to calibrate the amount of capital they must  set\r\n\r\naside.   This, I believe, would be consistent with the spirit\r\n\r\nof the new Basle 2 framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, property exposure. Sir, the changes outlined\r\n\r\nin clause 22 attempt to help minimise the contagion effect of\r\n\r\na   property   market  downturn  through  a  more  meaningful\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  property-exposed  loans.   Whilst   the   re-definition  will effectively broaden the coverage to  include\r\n\r\nloans  to  building and construction, the  increase  will  be\r\n\r\noffset  to  a large extent by the exclusion of owner-occupied\r\n\r\nproperty  loans.   Hence,  lending  capacity  should  not  be\r\n\r\nmaterially affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this exclusion of owner-occupied property loans is\r\n\r\nwell-founded and intuitively logical.  But I note that it  is\r\n\r\na  slight departure from the convention of attributing  lower\r\n\r\nrates to mortgages in general, regardless of whether they are\r\n\r\nowner-occupied or not.  The question of enforcement comes  to\r\n\r\nmind, as an owner-occupied property may turn into an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestment  during  the tenure of the loan.   How  would  the\r\n\r\nbanks,  and the MAS as supervisor, know when there is such  a\r\n\r\nchange?   If left unchecked, would the real property exposure\r\n\r\nbe understated over time?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, banking secrecy versus the convergence of\r\n\r\nretail  businesses.  Sir, here, the amendment seeks to  grant\r\n\r\nbanks  more  operational  flexibility  whilst  guarding   the\r\n\r\nconfidentiality of customer information.  This is significant\r\n\r\non  two counts, as the DPM has elaborated.   Firstly, it will\r\n\r\nallow  outsourcing  of  functions to intermediaries  who  may\r\n\r\nenjoy  greater economies of scale than the banks  themselves,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  backroom processing of  credit  cards  or  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of non-sensitive banking services which  does  not\r\n\r\ninvolve  data handling.  This will enable banks to  focus  on\r\n\r\nwhat they do best in the whole value chain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and more importantly, it will facilitate the\r\n\r\nextension   of   cross-marketing  capabilities   to   promote\r\n\r\nfinancial  products  and services as outlined  in  the  Sixth\r\n\r\nSchedule.   Again, as banks cannot be experts across  a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum,  cross-marketing to help  broaden  consumer  choice\r\n\r\nmust be allowed as far as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take special significance on the Internet\r\n\r\nplatform  in  the  light of increasing  customer  demand  for\r\n\r\nspeedier processing.  For example, in the area of e-payments,\r\n\r\nwe read of Citigroup's use of the MSN portal or the emergence\r\n\r\nof  PayPal,  which is posing some competition to credit  card\r\n\r\ncompanies  like  Visa  and MasterCard.  However,  convergence\r\n\r\nwill  not  be limited to the electronic medium and a one-stop\r\n\r\nbanking-cum-services point may soon be the model for customer\r\n\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In due course, with convergence and the exciting\r\n\r\npossibilities    of    cross-marketing    beyond    financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to overlapping customer segments, the  question\r\n\r\nof  selectively extending banking secrecy requirement has  to\r\n\r\nbe  addressed.   An  appropriate balance  has  to  be  struck\r\n\r\nbetween  reaping synergies and unbridled use of  confidential\r\n\r\ncustomer information.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEven  the imposition of a non-disclosure obligation will have\r\n\r\nlimited  practical effects.  Hence, any extension  should  be\r\n\r\ncontemplated only on a selective basis.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister what are the MAS' thoughts on  the\r\n\r\npossible  extension  beyond financial institutions  in  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Banking (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I support the Banking (Amendment) Bill as I believe the policies and measures\r\n\r\nencapsulated  in  these amendments to the  Banking  Act  will\r\n\r\nenhance  our position and reputation as a credible  financial\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have two main concerns to raise and would\r\n\r\nlike  to  seek clarification from the Deputy Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nMy  first  concern  relates to Internet-only  banks  and  the\r\n\r\nsecond relates to revision of the banking secrecy provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Internet-only Banks.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2000, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued\r\n\r\nan Internet banking policy statement that allowed a reduction\r\n\r\nof   the  paid-up  capital  requirements  for  local  banking\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries from $1.5 billion to $100 million.  This is  now\r\n\r\ncovered in clause 11 of the Bill by introducing a new section\r\n\r\n9A to the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was stated in the MAS policy statement that one of\r\n\r\nthe reasons for this reduction in capital requirements was to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the banks' adoption of new business models,  such\r\n\r\nas  Internet-only banking.  The MAS also recognised that  two\r\n\r\nbroad  business models had emerged that a bank could consider\r\n\r\nin  implementing  its  Internet banking  strategy.   One  was\r\n\r\nthrough Internet banking facilities within the existing bank,\r\n\r\nand  the  other  was through a stand-alone  entity,  such  as\r\n\r\nInternet-only  banks (or IOBs).  I have a concern  about  the\r\n\r\nsecond model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree that to survive in this fast changing\r\n\r\nworld,  a  company must be nimble, innovative  and  quick  to\r\n\r\nchange to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrespond  to  challenges in its industry.  I also  agree  that\r\n\r\nInternet  banking has the potential to improve  services  for\r\n\r\nthe  public.  But I would like to ask, in the context of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  banking industry, is Internet-only banking so  crucial\r\n\r\nthat   it   warrants  a  reduction  in  the  paid-up  capital\r\n\r\nrequirements  from $1.5 billion to $100 million?   Could  not\r\n\r\nthe  existing  banks  achieve  their  Internet  strategy  and\r\n\r\ncompete  equally effectively by offering its banking services\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Internet directly?  Do we  have  to  have  this\r\n\r\nspecial  emphasis  so  as  to encourage  the  setting  up  of\r\n\r\nInternet-only banks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of the Internet is only a means of\r\n\r\ndelivering   a  company's  products  and  services   to   its\r\n\r\ncustomers.  Whether these products are toys, books or banking\r\n\r\nservices,  many  of these Internet-dependent business  models\r\n\r\nhave not been proven to be sustainable in the long run.   For\r\n\r\ntoys,  I  am reminded of e-Toys which has folded up  but  the\r\n\r\ngood old Toys-R-Us is still around.  And, in the light of the\r\n\r\nrecent  NASDAQ meltdown, people are now more enlightened  and\r\n\r\nsceptical  about  the viability or non-viability  of  a  pure\r\n\r\nInternet-only business model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the MAS issued the policy statement in July 2000,\r\n\r\nNASDAQ  was  then in the first phase of its long and  painful\r\n\r\ndecline.   Now  that almost a year has passed and  many  once\r\n\r\nhigh-flying  Internet or dot-com companies with  much  higher\r\n\r\ncapitalisation  than $100 million have run out  of  cash  and\r\n\r\ncrashed,  I  would  like  to ask the  Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether there should be a re-think on this issue of promoting\r\n\r\nInternet-only banks.  S$100 million do not seem like a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney  when  the  company  has  to  invest  in  building  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and  to  advertise  aggressively  to  attract\r\n\r\ntraffic.   And  banking products and services are  definitely\r\n\r\nmore important to us than toys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business risks faced by Internet-only banks are no\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  other companies.  The MAS July  2000  policy\r\n\r\nstatement recognised these risks and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncautioned that \"unlike other Internet ventures, banks can ill-afford  to  incur  losses  for long start-up  periods\".   The\r\n\r\npolicy  statement also highlighted liquidity  risk  resulting\r\n\r\nfrom   price-sensitive   customers  moving   their   deposits\r\n\r\nelectronically from one bank to another to take advantage  of\r\n\r\na  marginal difference in rates.  This is compounded  by  the\r\n\r\nconvenience of conducting Internet transactions and may cause\r\n\r\nan electronic run on the bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons for companies to set up a subsidiary\r\n\r\nfor  a  new business venture is to limit the liabilities  and\r\n\r\nexposure arising from that venture.  Notwithstanding that the\r\n\r\nparent  Singapore incorporated bank will retain  control  and\r\n\r\nletters  of  undertaking will be required from the  Singapore\r\n\r\nbank and any alliance partners to pledge their support, in  a\r\n\r\nlimited liability company, the shareholders' liabilities  are\r\n\r\nlimited  to the extent of the capital they have put in.   The\r\n\r\nletter  of  undertaking is usually not binding.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nintention  is  to make it binding, it would effectively  mean\r\n\r\nthat  alliance  partners are guaranteeing the liabilities  of\r\n\r\nthe  banking subsidiary.  In that case, how would it help  in\r\n\r\nremoving  the  obstacles to our banks adopting  new  business\r\n\r\nmodels?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the rationale is to facilitate the adoption of\r\n\r\nnew, but untested, business models, I believe there are other\r\n\r\noperational structures and forms of collaboration that can be\r\n\r\nexplored  to  provide  the  banks  with  the  same  level  of\r\n\r\noperational flexibility and yet afford the customer of the so-called  banking subsidiary better protection.   With  banking\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries licensed as banks and permitted to offer a whole\r\n\r\nhost of traditional banking services and products, my concern\r\n\r\nis on how the bank's customers will be protected in the event\r\n\r\nthat  it  runs  out of cash and folds up. Will  such  a  bank\r\n\r\ncollapse  affect the banking industry on the  whole  and  our\r\n\r\nreputation as a financial centre?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revision of banking secrecy provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this point, I have two concerns. The first is\r\n\r\nparagraph 3 in Part II of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSixth   Schedule   that   permits  disclosure   of   customer\r\n\r\ninformation in connection with the performance of operational\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  a  bank where such operational functions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  out-sourced.  Under this exception to banking  secrecy,\r\n\r\nthe  disclosure can be made to any person, whether inside  or\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore,  who  has been engaged  by  the  bank  to\r\n\r\nperform  the  out-sourced  functions.   These  persons  would\r\n\r\nprobably be located in a lower cost jurisdiction, such as the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  or  perhaps Bangalore IT  Park,  as  that  makes\r\n\r\ncommercial and financial sense to the bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: what if these companies become\r\n\r\ninsolvent  and  bankrupt?  We have heard of bankrupt  dot-com\r\n\r\ncompanies  becoming  the  target  of  a  takeover  for  their\r\n\r\nvaluable  databases  of  customer information  and  of  cash-strapped companies offering their customer database for  sale\r\n\r\nto  raise cash.  What is to prevent otherwise-secret customer\r\n\r\ninformation  from  falling into the wrong hands  through  the\r\n\r\nsale  of  the database by a cash-strapped foreign contractor?\r\n\r\nWhat  can we do to prevent or stop such a sale of information\r\n\r\nin  a  foreign jurisdiction?  Could the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nplease elaborate on the nature and types of conditions  which\r\n\r\nmay be specified or imposed by the MAS to prevent such events\r\n\r\nfrom happening?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in view of the risk of leakage of banking\r\n\r\ninformation  through foreign companies which are  undertaking\r\n\r\nout-sourced functions, I believe that more measures should be\r\n\r\nput  in place to counter this risk.  My thinking is that  the\r\n\r\npenalty   of  $250,000  under  new  section  47(6)  for   any\r\n\r\ncorporation which contravenes new section 47(5) by disclosing\r\n\r\nthe  customer information is grossly insufficient in relation\r\n\r\nto the value of the customer database at hand.  Further, I am\r\n\r\nunsure  how  this penalty can be enforced extra-territorially\r\n\r\nagainst a foreign company in a foreign jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern is on paragraph 9 of Part II\r\n\r\nof   the  Sixth  Schedule  that  allows  disclosure  of   the\r\n\r\ncustomer's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nname, identity, address and contact number if such disclosure\r\n\r\nis  solely  in connection with the promotion to the customers\r\n\r\nof  the  bank in Singapore of financial products and services\r\n\r\nmade  available  in  Singapore by any  financial  institution\r\n\r\nwhich  is  licensed or otherwise regulated  by  the  MAS.   I\r\n\r\npresume  this  is  to facilitate the promotion  and  sale  of\r\n\r\nfinancial products, such as credit cards, insurance policies,\r\n\r\nforeign  currency deposits and unit trusts, offered by  other\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions apart from the bank itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what the rationale is for\r\n\r\nintroducing  such a blanket exception to our banking  secrecy\r\n\r\nlaws.   Instead of having this blanket exception, I  think  a\r\n\r\nbetter way would be for the bank to ask its customers, either\r\n\r\nby  way  of a newsletter, customer survey or other  means  of\r\n\r\ncommunication from time to time, whether they would  like  to\r\n\r\nreceive  promotional  materials  and  information  on   other\r\n\r\nfinancial  products and services.  This would be an  \"opt-in\"\r\n\r\nsystem.   If  the customer wishes to know about  these  other\r\n\r\nproducts and opts in, he would have signified in writing  his\r\n\r\nconsent  to the bank disclosing his name, identity and  other\r\n\r\ncontact particulars to the other financial institutions which\r\n\r\ncan  then  contact him.  This consent would be sufficient  to\r\n\r\npermit  disclosure  as covered under the first  paragraph  of\r\n\r\nPart  1,  ie,  where  the disclosure has  been  permitted  in\r\n\r\nwriting by the customer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a position is in fact commonly adopted by many\r\n\r\nreputable on-line vendors where they state clearly  in  their\r\n\r\npersonal privacy policy that they will not sell or distribute\r\n\r\nany  personal  information about the customer  to  any  third\r\n\r\nparty  and  the  customer is assured  that  he  will  receive\r\n\r\npromotional materials only when he requests that  the  vendor\r\n\r\nsends  that  information to him.  Additionally, the  customer\r\n\r\nmay  take  his name off the list at any time and  the  vendor\r\n\r\nwill  immediately cease delivery of the promotional materials\r\n\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore surprised that a customer of a bank\r\n\r\nshould run the risk of his  name\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  contact particulars being circulated to other  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  I fear this will open the floodgates for  name\r\n\r\nlists  of  bank  customers to be swapped and exchanged  among\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions, leading to all of us being inundated\r\n\r\nwith more junk mail and cold calls, and not to mention a loss\r\n\r\nof privacy and confidentiality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Banking (Amendment) Bill and hope\r\n\r\nthat,  in  its  implementation, the MAS will take  the  above\r\n\r\nconcerns into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  who have spoken for their support for the Bill,  and\r\n\r\nlet  me  address  the points which they have raised,  all  of\r\n\r\nwhich are valuable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked whether the rate of\r\n\r\nbanking  consolidation is fast enough.  There has  been  some\r\n\r\nprogress.   DBS has merged with POSBank, but there have  been\r\n\r\nno  other mergers in Singapore, as he well knows.  But, as  I\r\n\r\nhave said, no merger does not mean that nothing is happening.\r\n\r\nI am sure that the banks are talking to each other and I hope\r\n\r\nthat  something  will  develop as time  passes.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  which  we can do in a hurry.  Arranging  a  match-making  is  a delicate business.  One has to find  the  right\r\n\r\npartner  and  reach  the right terms, otherwise  it  can  end\r\n\r\nunhappily,  and  it  is MAS' job to make  sure  that  unhappy\r\n\r\noutcomes  are  kept  to a minimum.  So we will  foster  their\r\n\r\nconsolidation but it will take a little bit of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for small companies and small depositors who may be\r\n\r\naffected  by the consolidation of banking, this is  an  issue\r\n\r\nwhich  we have discussed several times in this House.  It  is\r\n\r\nnaturally of considerable concern to Members.  DBS-POSBank is\r\n\r\na  major  example, but there will be others  because  further\r\n\r\nconsolidation  will take place and further  adjustments  will\r\n\r\nbecome  necessary.   So  one  of  the  things  which  we  are\r\n\r\nconsidering  in  MAS is whether we should  not  require  many\r\n\r\nbanks in Singapore to provide a basic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbanking  account - not free, but affordable - with  specified\r\n\r\ncharacteristics, which we can have the Association  of  Banks\r\n\r\ndiscuss  and  agree  upon, so that whoever  operates  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  retail  banking market  will  have  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nservice  to look after the small depositors.  It is something\r\n\r\nwe  are considering.  We have to make sure that the burden is\r\n\r\nnot too onerous, but we hope to reach a conclusion before too\r\n\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Internet banking and how they will be regulated,\r\n\r\nI  completely share Mr Leong Horn Kee's and also Mr Ong  Kian\r\n\r\nMin's  scepticism about the risks of Internet  and  the  hype\r\n\r\nabout the dot-com euphoria which was very strong 12-18 months\r\n\r\nago but is now substantially evaporated.  I think it is right\r\n\r\nfor  us  to allow a certain degree of experimentation by  our\r\n\r\nbanks, but in a cautious way.  And one of the things which we\r\n\r\nhave  allowed  is to say, \"You may set up a subsidiary,  only\r\n\r\n$100 million paid-up capital, and you can use that subsidiary\r\n\r\nto   carry   out  Internet  banking  or  all  other   banking\r\n\r\nactivities, or form a joint venture with a foreign partner.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100 million is not a small sum of money. Our overall\r\n\r\nrequirement  for bank capital is $1 1/2 billion paid-up,  but\r\n\r\nthat  is  at the top level.  To require the subsidiary  of  a\r\n\r\nbank  also  to have $1 1/2 billion tied up is not reasonable.\r\n\r\nIn  most other jurisdictions, one can set up a bank with much\r\n\r\nless  capital than that.  In the UK, it is only five  million\r\n\r\nEuros,  which  is  about S$7 million.  In Hong  Kong,  it  is\r\n\r\nHK$150  million,  which is only about S$30 million.   So  our\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  $1 1/2 billion is many orders  of  magnitude\r\n\r\nhigher.   It  is there because we want to be absolutely  safe\r\n\r\nand  we also wanted the banks to have a certain critical mass\r\n\r\nand size.  But there is no justification for applying that at\r\n\r\nthe subsidiary level.  So we have set the subsidiary level at\r\n\r\n$100  million,  which is still higher than  nearly  everybody\r\n\r\nelse.   If you say that the burn rate will soon burn out  the\r\n\r\n$100  million, I would reply with what one banking supervisor\r\n\r\ntold me, that it makes him very nervous when he reads bankers\r\n\r\nsaying that they are running an Internet bank and it is their\r\n\r\nbusiness to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlose money so as to gain customers.  Because when banks start\r\n\r\nto think like that, trouble is going to come.  And so we have\r\n\r\na  banking  framework  for Internet  banking  which  puts  in\r\n\r\nadequate safeguards so that if a bank wants to start, it  has\r\n\r\nsome  flexibility but, before it goes too far, there will  be\r\n\r\nsome checks to hold it back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked about the capital adequacy of\r\n\r\nbanks and whether 12% was not already high, and whether going\r\n\r\nfor  even more on a supervisory discretionary basis would  be\r\n\r\nan  overkill.   12% is higher than the BIS  standard  of  8%.\r\n\r\nThat  is  true.  But I would make two points.   Firstly,  our\r\n\r\nbanks  are  operating  in Asia and  this  is  a  less  stable\r\n\r\nenvironment than the OECD countries and economies.  So it  is\r\n\r\nwise  to  have  a  bigger capital cushion to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nuncertainties  of  the market.  Secondly,  although  the  BIS\r\n\r\nstandard  is  8%, nearly all banks in good health  have  much\r\n\r\nhigher  capital ratios than that.  Very few banks operate  at\r\n\r\nthe  margin,  with  just enough capital as specified  by  the\r\n\r\nregulator.  So they have 12%-16% capital, enough  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncushion without being so excessive that it affects their rate\r\n\r\nof return.  I think 12% is about the right figure for us.  We\r\n\r\nmay  revise  it  from  time to time.   We  have  revised  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of this 12% already twice to give the banks  more\r\n\r\nflexibility, but it is not in the wrong ballpark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will we go above 12%? When we think the bank's\r\n\r\nrisk profile or risk management capabilities or the health of\r\n\r\nthe  bank's loan book is such that it better have a bit  more\r\n\r\ncapital because, over all, its exposure is riskier.  That has\r\n\r\nto be judged bank by bank.  I think the circumstances will be\r\n\r\nthat we will look at the individual banks to decide, and I do\r\n\r\nnot  expect  very  many banks to have additional  supervisory\r\n\r\nimpositions  placed  upon them over  and  above  the  general\r\n\r\nstandard.  But that will depend on how the practice  evolves.\r\n\r\nWith a Basel II framework which is being developed now, banks\r\n\r\nare  moving  towards  internal  risk  models  of  loans,   of\r\n\r\noperational  risks,  and will depend on these  internal  risk\r\n\r\nmodels to decide how much capital they need,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrather than a certain formula set by the regulator.  We  hope\r\n\r\nthat our banks in Singapore will be able to develop such risk\r\n\r\nmodels.   They are working at it, but it will take some  work\r\n\r\nand it also requires some pooling of data, because we need to\r\n\r\nhave  the track record to have reliable statistics as to  how\r\n\r\nrisky  the loans are.  If they have these risk models and  if\r\n\r\nindeed their track record is good, then, of course, they will\r\n\r\nbe  able to save on their capital requirements and this  will\r\n\r\nbe  to their advantage.  So there is a positive incentive, as\r\n\r\nMrs Lim Hwee Hua suggested should be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On property exposure, Mrs Lim talked about the coverage\r\n\r\nbeing broadened because it will include loans to building and\r\n\r\nconstruction, and whether this will not be offset to a  large\r\n\r\nextent  by  the  exclusion of owner-occupied property  loans.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all,  I  should clarify that the coverage  is  not\r\n\r\nreally  broadened, because we are still focusing on  property\r\n\r\nloans, ie, loans for property development.  We are not  going\r\n\r\nto  impose  limits on loans to construction service providers\r\n\r\nor  people who provide building materials, because these  are\r\n\r\nnot  property  developers or property  investors.   They  are\r\n\r\nproviding  services, goods.  So, similarly,  if  you  are  an\r\n\r\narchitect,  you  are  not a property developer  but  you  are\r\n\r\nproviding  services to the property developers.  Or,  if  you\r\n\r\nare  a  civil engineer, construction engineer or a  transport\r\n\r\ncompany,  you  are  not in the business.   So  we  are  still\r\n\r\nfocused only on property development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have excluded the owner-occupied housing loans from\r\n\r\nour  limits  on property exposure, but it is not a  departure\r\n\r\nfrom  the Basel approach, which assigns risk weights  because\r\n\r\nowner-occupied housing loans do tend to have a lower risk  of\r\n\r\ndefault,  so they do merit more lenient treatment than  other\r\n\r\nproperty  loans.   We  are not treating  them  completely  as\r\n\r\nunrestricted.   We  will  monitor  them  separately  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, we will limit them.  And one of the limits we  now\r\n\r\nhave  is  to  say  home-buyers must make a 20%  cash  payment\r\n\r\nbefore they borrow money from the bank and the bank will only\r\n\r\nlend them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n80%.   It  is a somewhat sore point with the developers,  but\r\n\r\nthat is a rule which we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for ownership status, Mrs Lim is right that it is a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit difficult to find out who is living in  a  house.\r\n\r\nHDB  has  ways of finding out and there are severe penalties.\r\n\r\nIf  he is not really living in the house and he is found out,\r\n\r\nhe  may get evicted and the house may be re-acquired.  If  it\r\n\r\nis  a  private  property, there is no  such  sanction.   But,\r\n\r\nstill,  there  is a distinction between a loan which  is  for\r\n\r\nowner  occupation  and  a loan which  is  for  an  investment\r\n\r\nproperty.   If  it is for owner occupation, it is  his  first\r\n\r\nhouse,  he is living in it, he is paying for it probably  out\r\n\r\nof  his income and, therefore, he is not so likely to default\r\n\r\non  it,  whereas if it is an investment property  and  he  is\r\n\r\npaying  for it out of rental income and he loses his  tenant,\r\n\r\nthen he may be unable to service his mortgage.  So there is a\r\n\r\nrisk  difference between an owner-occupied house and a  house\r\n\r\npurchased for investment purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the banks know? The banks presently already\r\n\r\nask  borrowers to declare, when they want a loan, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  for owner occupation, and it is possible that one way  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  banks  to regularly ask for a new declaration,  and\r\n\r\nascertain  the position every year.  It is not likely  to  be\r\n\r\nabsolutely  foolproof but I think adequate  measures  can  be\r\n\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, banking secrecy provisions. I will take Mr Ong\r\n\r\nKian Min's comments on banking secrecy provisions first.   Mr\r\n\r\nOng   asked   what  happens  to  the  database  of   customer\r\n\r\ninformation  which  has been given to  an  outsource  service\r\n\r\nprovider  to process and it goes bankrupt.  Can he  sell  it?\r\n\r\nThe  answer is he cannot, because it is an offence under  the\r\n\r\nBanking Act for a party receiving customer information from a\r\n\r\nbank  in  the  course of performing an outsource function  to\r\n\r\nonward  disclose that information.  So he cannot go and  sell\r\n\r\nit to somebody else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is overseas, it is a bit difficult for us to\r\n\r\nenforce, because our laws do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstretch  overseas.   But before a bank outsources  a  service\r\n\r\noverseas,  we will want to be satisfied that it is  going  to\r\n\r\nsomebody  overseas  which the bank can, in  good  conscience,\r\n\r\nhave confidence with.  And the outsource service provider  is\r\n\r\nin  a  country overseas where he can have some assurance that\r\n\r\nthe  rule  of  law applies and that it is not just  a  cowboy\r\n\r\nenvironment.  These are standard precautions before we  allow\r\n\r\na  bank to outsource its services.  They will have to consult\r\n\r\nus  and if there is a regulator on the other side, we will be\r\n\r\nin  touch  with the regulator on the other side to  reach  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding on the conditions before we approve.  So  there\r\n\r\nare some safeguards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On contravention of banking secrecy, Mr Ong says\r\n\r\n$250,000 is not an adequate penalty.  It is not a small  sum.\r\n\r\nIt  is five times bigger than any other penalty that used  to\r\n\r\nbe  in the Act.  It is the biggest penalty in the Act, as  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  amended.  If it is still not enough and we need  to\r\n\r\nmultiply  it by another factor of five, I will come back  and\r\n\r\nask the House for permission.  But I think, for now, $250,000\r\n\r\nis adequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sharing information about customers for cross-selling, Mr Ong and Mrs Lim made opposite suggestions. Mrs\r\n\r\nLim  talked about making it more flexible and allowing cross-selling even to non-financial institutions.  Whereas  Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nsays,  \"Why do we want to have cross-selling?  Why  not  just\r\n\r\nrestrict  it to people who opt in and tick off in a  box  and\r\n\r\nagree  to have their information shared around?\"  This  is  a\r\n\r\njudgment.   It  is a trade-off.  On the one hand,  the  banks\r\n\r\nneed  the flexibility to cross-sell.  On the other hand,  the\r\n\r\ncustomer  wants  some privacy.  Mr Ong talked about  Internet\r\n\r\nsites  invariably asking you whether you want  to  have  your\r\n\r\nname  being  circulated around before they give your name  to\r\n\r\nother service providers.  I wish they were all so scrupulous.\r\n\r\nI  receive  all sorts of junk mail from people whom  I  never\r\n\r\nagreed  to  give  my  name to, and I  am  sure  so  does  he.\r\n\r\nUsually, there is a mechanism to get your name off the  list.\r\n\r\nI  think what we need is a balance between the two, a balance\r\n\r\nwhich will enable cross-selling to take place\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithout  it  being intrusive to the customer and without  the\r\n\r\ncustomer feeling that his privacy has been compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are two things we should do. First, there\r\n\r\nshould  be  only limited customer information relating  to  a\r\n\r\nperson's  personal  particulars which may be  disclosed,  and\r\n\r\nonly to financial institutions.  So, if your banker wants  to\r\n\r\ncross-sell a product of the insurance company, he cannot tell\r\n\r\nthe  insurance company, \"This is a good customer.  He  has  X\r\n\r\nnumber  of dollars in his bank account.  Please go and  offer\r\n\r\nhim  a  $1 million insurance policy.\"  He can give your  name\r\n\r\nand  you  may  be approached, but he cannot give  particulars\r\n\r\nabout accounts, transactions, assets and so on.  I think that\r\n\r\nis  not  the  purpose why people go to the bank in  order  to\r\n\r\nmanage  their  money.   So it should  be  only  to  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, only personal particulars and, secondly,  there\r\n\r\nhas to be an opt-out mechanism.  So if I object or I tick off\r\n\r\nin  a  box, I will not have my particulars circulated  around\r\n\r\nand not receive junk mail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried to strike a balance in this legislation.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  delicate balance.  It is not one which is possible\r\n\r\nfor  MAS to strike on its own.  We have discussed it with the\r\n\r\nbanks  very carefully.  The banks are comfortable with  these\r\n\r\narrangements,  and  that is why I am here  before  the  House\r\n\r\ncommending this Bill to Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, could I ask the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  there will be a problem of less financing  available\r\n\r\nfor  home  purchasers as a result of this Bill,  and  whether\r\n\r\nthere  will  be unloading of properties by some  banks  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of this Bill, and thus adding to the present property\r\n\r\nglut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, as I explained in my main\r\n\r\nspeech,  it is not the intention of the changes in this  Bill\r\n\r\nto  tighten or loosen bank loans to the property sector.  The\r\n\r\n35%  ratio which we intend to set has been calculated so that\r\n\r\nnearly  all  the banks are below this limit.  The main  banks\r\n\r\nare all below this limit.  There are a few\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmall banks which are above it, but we will give them time to\r\n\r\nadjust  their  loans, and I do not think it should  have  any\r\n\r\nsignificant impact.  In future, whether we tighten or  loosen\r\n\r\nthis  limit  is a separate matter, which we will  address  in\r\n\r\nfuture   when   the  moment  comes.   It   depends   on   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  at  that time.  As of now, we  see  no  reason\r\n\r\neither to tighten or loosen the state of bank lending to  the\r\n\r\nproperty sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nnot  answered  a  question that I posed in  my  speech.   The\r\n\r\nsupervision of banks using different capital adequacy  ratios\r\n\r\nmay  lead  to  unfair rules and an uneven playing  field  for\r\n\r\ndifferent banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, I should\r\n\r\nhave explained.  As I said, we expect most of the banks to be\r\n\r\non  standard rules.  But in special circumstances  where  the\r\n\r\nbanks  have special risks, then it is necessary for  them  to\r\n\r\nhave higher capital adequacy provided for, and we have to set\r\n\r\nhigher limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an uneven playing field? Well, it is, because we\r\n\r\nare  dealing with players who are not of equal quality.   And\r\n\r\nif  the risk is higher, it is necessary that you carry higher\r\n\r\ncapital.   It  may  be that you are running higher  risk  and\r\n\r\nbecause  your capital is down, you are trying desperately  to\r\n\r\ndouble  or  quits, and make good.  As a regulator, we  cannot\r\n\r\nallow  that  to happen.  Between Singapore banks and  foreign\r\n\r\nbanks, even today there is a certain unevenness, because  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  banks  have to have 12% capital adequacy,  whereas\r\n\r\nforeign  banks in foreign jurisdictions have 8%  by  law  and\r\n\r\noperate  under  a  different regime.  So it  is  already  not\r\n\r\nequal.  But as I explained to Members, very few banks operate\r\n\r\nexactly  at  the margin.  The Singapore banks  are  all  well\r\n\r\nabove  the  12% level.  The good foreign banks are  not  only\r\n\r\nabove  the  8% level but also above 12% de facto.   In  fact,\r\n\r\ncapital adequacy has not been a constraint on banks' returns,\r\n\r\nand has not been a constraint on banks developing and growing\r\n\r\ntheir business.  I do not think the changes we are making\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill make the situation any more difficult than it is now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The main objective of the Act was  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  quality of timber processed  and  exported  from\r\n\r\nSingapore, so as to maintain Singapore's status as a reliable\r\n\r\ntimber  trading  centre.   The Act  stipulated,  among  other\r\n\r\nthings, the licensing of manufacturers, exporters and graders\r\n\r\nof sawn timber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has since changed. Singapore's economic\r\n\r\nlandscape  has  evolved over the years and  our  trade  today\r\n\r\nlargely  comprises  high-value  manufactured  goods.   Timber\r\n\r\nprocessing  and  timber  trading  are  largely  carried   out\r\n\r\noffshore,  where the cost is lower.  Last year, timber  trade\r\n\r\naccounted for only 0.3%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  our  total trade compared to 2% in 1980.  The  number  of\r\n\r\nsawmills has gone down from about 50 in 1980 to 4 last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our timber trade now mainly consists of import and re-export of timber. Those who continue to maintain their\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore have also reached a certain level  of\r\n\r\nmaturity.  Our traders have adopted market practices that are\r\n\r\nin  line  with international standards and requirements.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  industry has introduced the Singapore  Timber\r\n\r\nTrade  Procedures  since 1996 to foster  good  practices  for\r\n\r\ntimber  trading.   To  them,  market  competition,  and   not\r\n\r\nGovernment  regulations,  provides  the  best  discipline  to\r\n\r\nmaintain high product quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater industry self-regulation by the Singapore\r\n\r\nTimber  Exporters'  Association (STEA) and  Singapore  Timber\r\n\r\nManufacturers'  Association  (STMA),  the  Trade  Development\r\n\r\nBoard (TDB) has over the years progressively deregulated  the\r\n\r\ntimber  industry by removing export licences and registration\r\n\r\nof manufacturers for timber items such as fibreboards, ground\r\n\r\nwood and mouldings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these considerations, the Trade Development\r\n\r\nBoard  decided  to  review  the  regulations  on  the  timber\r\n\r\nindustry.    The   Trade  Development  Board  consulted   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Timber  Exporters' Association and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTimber  Manufacturers' Association, who  confirmed  that  the\r\n\r\nTimber Industry Act no longer serves much purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Peter Chen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMODITY FUTURES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Objective</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodity Futures (Amendment) Bill introduces new\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  the existing Commodity Futures  Act  (Chapter\r\n\r\n48A) to address the `bucket shop' problem.  The Bill provides\r\n\r\nfor  penalties for persons and entities operating  without  a\r\n\r\nlicence,  and enhances the penalties for stipulated  offences\r\n\r\nunder the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Background</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Bucket shops' are firms that entice the public to open\r\n\r\ntrading  accounts with them and to grant them wide discretion\r\n\r\nto  trade on the investors' behalf.  Instead of trading  with\r\n\r\nthe  investors' interest in mind, the contractual  terms  are\r\n\r\nsuch  that  they favour the firms.  They may claim to  effect\r\n\r\ntransactions  when they did not; or `churn',  that  is,  make\r\n\r\nrepeated transactions to earn commissions, without regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  interest of investors.  Investors are enticed with small\r\n\r\ninitial profits but may end up losing their entire investment\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodity Futures Act was first enacted in 1992. It\r\n\r\ncovers  commodity  futures that are traded at  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCommodity  Exchange (SICOM), namely, rubber and coffee  only.\r\n\r\nIn  the  mid-1990s, `bucket shops' caused a stir with  mainly\r\n\r\nspot or leveraged foreign exchange trading.  This was stamped\r\n\r\nout  when  the MAS amended its Futures Trading Act  in  1995.\r\n\r\nThe  situation  was somewhat controlled until  `bucket  shop'\r\n\r\noperators  came  up with new schemes in the last  2-3  years.\r\n\r\nThese  `bucket shops' deal in other commodities such as  pork\r\n\r\nbelly,  which  are  not covered under the  current  Commodity\r\n\r\nFutures Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to the Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodity Futures (Amendment) Bill provides for the\r\n\r\nCommodity  Futures Act to cover all commodities,  instead  of\r\n\r\njust   rubber  and  coffee.   Apart  from  commodity  futures\r\n\r\ntrading, the Amendment Bill also provides for other forms  of\r\n\r\ncommodity trading to be covered.  These\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninclude  forward contracts, trading in differences, spot  and\r\n\r\nleveraged trading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who wishes to engage in any of these trading\r\n\r\nactivities, for any type of commodity, will have to apply for\r\n\r\na  licence under the amended Act.  Those who cannot  qualify,\r\n\r\nincluding  bucket  shops,  will  have  to  close  down  their\r\n\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the licensing requirement, the Amendment\r\n\r\nBill  also  stipulated  stiffer penalties  for  offences,  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Individuals who operate without a licence will face\r\n\r\na  fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for up to one  year,\r\n\r\nor  both.  Corporations face a fine of up to $100,000  or  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for up to three years, or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Penalties have also been enhanced for offences such\r\n\r\nas  false  trading,  bucketing, disseminating  of  misleading\r\n\r\ninformation  in  the  promotion of false  trading,  employing\r\n\r\nfraudulent  devices  or  schemes, and  fraudulently  inducing\r\n\r\npersons  to  trade in commodity contracts.   Individuals  who\r\n\r\ncommit  any of these offences face a maximum fine of $250,000\r\n\r\nor  imprisonment of up to seven years, or both.  Corporations\r\n\r\nwill face a higher maximum fine of $500,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the broader scope of the Act does not\r\n\r\naffect  bona  fide  traders and result in over-regulation  or\r\n\r\nunintended  consequences, the Act  provides  for  a  list  of\r\n\r\nexemptions.  They are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, principal to principal traders. This is because\r\n\r\nthese  transactions are conducted between parties  that  know\r\n\r\nthe  commodity  and  its market very well.   They  also  have\r\n\r\ngenuine  business  reasons  to  conduct  these  transactions,\r\n\r\neither because they physically need the commodities to supply\r\n\r\nto   the  market,  or  they  need  to  hedge  against  future\r\n\r\nuncertainties.

The rationale for the proposal  was\r\n\r\nthat  the duties of the Serjeant-at-Arms, especially  in  the\r\n\r\narea of security, have increased tremendously over the years,\r\n\r\nespecially more so after moving into the new Parliament House\r\n\r\nin 1999.

But not being a  regular\r\n\r\nreader of the Straits Times, I missed out a lot of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  had been going on.  So I decided I would raise this  in\r\n\r\nthe  House.  I decided to look at this article that  appeared\r\n\r\nin  the  Straits Times on 25th April where there was a  great\r\n\r\npiece  about  whether  the  vote is  a  right  or  privilege.\r\n\r\nWithout  being  disrespectful to the  writer,  may  I  say  I\r\n\r\nthought it was much of a flip-flop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flurry arose, as I understand it, from the\r\n\r\nMinister's   statement  in  this  House  when  debating   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill that the vote is not\r\n\r\na  right, but a privilege.  Having seen the article, again, I\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Well, that is just symptomatic of the PAP Government's\r\n\r\nthinking  that the citizens of Singapore have no  rights  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  only such rights as the Government deems  at  its\r\n\r\npleasure  to grant them.\"  I do not know whether the Minister\r\n\r\nconsulted  or sought any legal opinion before he  made  this,\r\n\r\nmay  I say, very surprising statement in this House.  And the\r\n\r\narticle in the Straits Times did not make it any better.  The\r\n\r\nwriter talks about digging deep into the Constitution to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  there  was any such right.  May  I  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nwriter that perhaps she was digging deep into the underground\r\n\r\nlooking  for  it somewhere down far below when it  was  there\r\n\r\nright  on  the  top.  She missed that, and kept looking  down\r\n\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's statement, with all due respect to the\r\n\r\nMinister, suffers from one basic flaw.  And the flaw is  this\r\n\r\n-  a  failure to recognise that the marking of a ballot paper\r\n\r\nis  just  as  much  an  expression as a writing  or  an  oral\r\n\r\nutterance.   What  is more is that it is an expression  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical choice on a matter that is of supreme importance to\r\n\r\nthe country.  The marking is an expression, just as a drawing\r\n\r\nor a picture is an expression of the artist's view of things.\r\n\r\nSo  if  you  accept, and I do not see how you cannot  accept,\r\n\r\nthat  the marking of a ballot paper is an expression  of  the\r\n\r\nvoter, the electorate, then it becomes obvious that it  is  a\r\n\r\nright  and  it  is  not a privilege that is  granted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   And what is more is that it is right  there  in\r\n\r\nthe Constitution.  The writer of the article says, \"Oh, there\r\n\r\nare plenty of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  rights.  But I couldn't find any right to vote.\"   But\r\n\r\nshe  misses it.  As I said, right at the beginning of Article\r\n\r\n14,  one finds that every Singapore citizen has the right  to\r\n\r\nfreedom of expression.  And if, as I said, the marking of the\r\n\r\nvote is an expression of the citizen's choice of a candidate,\r\n\r\nthen the citizen, the electorate, has a right to express  his\r\n\r\nchoice.  It is no longer a privilege.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of that, if you look at section 5 of the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Elections Act, what does that  say?   For  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the Minister, in case he has not read  it  before\r\n\r\ncoming  into Parliament, it says in no uncertain  terms  that\r\n\r\nall  citizens of Singapore over 21 years of age, resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, on the 1st of July in any year, shall be  entitled\r\n\r\nto  have their names on the register of electors.  What could\r\n\r\nbe  clearer - \"shall be entitled to have their names  on  the\r\n\r\nregister\".   And  if they have their names on  the  register,\r\n\r\nthen they are entitled to vote.  No two ways about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did say when I spoke on the Parliamentary Elections\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill that I considered leaving out some  of  our\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens   overseas  is  a   violation   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution, and I repeat that.  Every citizen of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhether he is in Singapore or not, if he had been resident in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  the 1st of July before he went overseas,  and,\r\n\r\nagain,  if his name is still on the register, whether  he  is\r\n\r\nhere  or not, because there is a presumption, is entitled  to\r\n\r\nvote, and there can be no discrimination between them.  And I\r\n\r\ndo question even section 6 in the Parliamentary Elections Act\r\n\r\nwhich  takes away from prisoners serving sentences the  right\r\n\r\nto  vote.  That clearly conflicts with section 5, that  every\r\n\r\ncitizen of Singapore over 21, resident, shall be entitled  to\r\n\r\nhave his name on the register.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, I question the validity of section 43(5) and\r\n\r\n(8)  removing, from the register, non-voters.   That,  again,\r\n\r\nseems  to me to be a violation of the Constitution.  If  they\r\n\r\nare  over 21 and they are citizens of Singapore, whether they\r\n\r\nvoted  or  not,  their names have to remain on the  register.\r\n\r\nThey cannot be taken out.  And\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  suggestion offered to them, that they  can  have  their\r\n\r\nnames  on  the  register again if they  pay  $5,  is  equally\r\n\r\nanother violation of their constitutional right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I hope, without sounding too professorial, that I\r\n\r\nhave  cleared  the  cobwebs in the mind of the  Minister  and\r\n\r\nothers who seem to think that the vote is not a right  but  a\r\n\r\nprivilege.   As I have said, it is symptomatic of  the  PAP's\r\n\r\nthinking.  Workers in Singapore have no rights.  And we  were\r\n\r\nonly  told  this  afternoon that a Singapore citizen,  if  he\r\n\r\nwants  to  fly the Singapore flag, has no right  to  do  that\r\n\r\nwithout getting the permission of the Government.  He has  to\r\n\r\nmake an application for it.  Everything, it would appear,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is a privilege granted at the pleasure of  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I said this when I spoke on 28th April  2001  at\r\n\r\nYio  Chu Kang Stadium and I also said this in Manila, when  I\r\n\r\nattended  the  conference  of all  Asian  parties,  that  the\r\n\r\nsociety  in  Singapore is a castrated one.  Nobody  seems  to\r\n\r\nhave  any  right.   All  the  rights  are  vested  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister will now tell us, if he can,\r\n\r\nwhy  he  says that the vote is a privilege and not  a  right.\r\n\r\nWhere  does  he  get that authority from?  In any  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry,  it  is the citizens who decide who the  legislature\r\n\r\nshall  consist  of.   And  so  it  is  provided  in  our  own\r\n\r\nConstitution.  It is the electorate who elect the Members  to\r\n\r\nthis  legislature.  So they are given a right to choose their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to this House.  But, in Singapore, apparently\r\n\r\naccording  to the Minister and the PAP Government,  they  can\r\n\r\ntake away from the citizens this right to vote to elect their\r\n\r\nown Members into Parliament.  No wonder we have had all these\r\n\r\namendments  about introducing Nominated Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nwhen  Parliament  should  only consist  of  elected  Members,\r\n\r\nelected by the electorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

When I said Mr Jeyaretnam's speech\r\n\r\njust  now is symptomatic of his conduct in this House,  I  am\r\n\r\nreferring  to the times when we gave replies to his  comments\r\n\r\nand he was not around to listen.  Or, when we made statements\r\n\r\nand  speeches,  he did not listen, just as when  the  answers\r\n\r\nwere  given  this afternoon by my Minister of  State  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  questions  he raised.  He kept  repeating  the  same\r\n\r\nquestions over and over again.  It is a pity.  He should have\r\n\r\nused  the time properly and then he would have been  able  to\r\n\r\nmake  more constructive contributions to the House.   But  he\r\n\r\nraises the same issues over and over again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from his earlier comments attributing to me saying\r\n\r\nthat \"voting is a privilege\", all his points about what is in\r\n\r\nthe  law,  I agree with them.  This is one of the  very  rare\r\n\r\noccasions that I agree\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  him.  Let me put in my way what the position is in  our\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the only expressed reference to voting by a\r\n\r\ncitizen  is  in the Parliamentary Elections Act.  Section  38\r\n\r\nstates  that  the  register  of electors  is  the  conclusive\r\n\r\nevidence  of  a  person's entitlement to  vote.    So,  if  a\r\n\r\nperson's  name is not in the register, he is not entitled  to\r\n\r\nvote.   Section  5  says  that the  qualifications  for  that\r\n\r\nentitlement  are that he must be a citizen,  he  must  be  21\r\n\r\nyears  old and above, and that he must be ordinarily resident\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   So, if a citizen whose name is  not  in  the\r\n\r\nregister  or  if he is not ordinarily resident in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen he cannot vote.  That is quite clear in section 5 of the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Elections Act.  Section 43 of the Act, which Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  also referred to, says that voting is compulsory.\r\n\r\nSo we have a duty to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Constitution does not contain an expressed\r\n\r\ndeclaration of the right to vote, I have been advised by  the\r\n\r\nAttorney General, even before today, that the right  to  vote\r\n\r\nat parliamentary and presidential elections is implied within\r\n\r\nthe  structure  of our Constitution.  We have a parliamentary\r\n\r\nform  of  government.  The Constitution provides for  regular\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections  to  make  up Parliament  and  establishes\r\n\r\nrepresentative democracy in Singapore.  So the right to  vote\r\n\r\nis  fundamental to a representative democracy, which we  are,\r\n\r\nand  that is why we have the Parliamentary Elections  Act  to\r\n\r\ngive effect to this right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must also add that, as is the case in most\r\n\r\ncountries of the world, the right to vote is not absolute but\r\n\r\nis usually subject to some conditions.  Singapore, therefore,\r\n\r\nis  no different.  The most common of these conditions is age\r\n\r\n-  in  our case, 21 and above.  All democracies allow  voting\r\n\r\nonly  for  citizens  above  a  certain  age.  Another  common\r\n\r\ncondition  is  residence in the country where  elections  are\r\n\r\nheld  for  regional  representation.  In our  case,  this  is\r\n\r\nreflected as the need for a citizen to be ordinarily resident\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  to  be  able to vote.   Residency  is  also  a\r\n\r\nrequirement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  voters  in,  for example, New Zealand, Canada,  Germany,\r\n\r\nIreland, and South Korea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me reiterate and emphasise again that the recent\r\n\r\namendments  did not change or affect our citizens'  right  to\r\n\r\nvote.   Rather,  they  have relaxed the definition  of  being\r\n\r\n\"ordinarily resident\" in the Singapore context to  facilitate\r\n\r\noverseas  voting. Any overseas Singaporean  who  fulfils  the\r\n\r\ncriteria as a registered overseas voter, can register at  the\r\n\r\nnearest mission, whether or not he lives in the country where\r\n\r\nthe mission is located, or he can come home to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the comments also referred to equality or\r\n\r\nprotection  in  Article 12 of the Constitution.   The  recent\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Act  are also not  in  contravention  of\r\n\r\nArticle  12, which I think Mr Simon Tay referred  to  in  his\r\n\r\nearlier  statement.   They  do not remove  anyone's  existing\r\n\r\nvoting  entitlement.  Neither do they make it more  difficult\r\n\r\nfor anyone to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In replying to some of the Members' questions at the\r\n\r\nlast sitting, I have explained why not every overseas citizen\r\n\r\ncan  be  qualified to vote so long as parliamentary elections\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be run on a constituency representation  basis,\r\n\r\nand there also remains the threat of plural voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residency requirement is necessary to allocate the\r\n\r\nvoter  to  a constituency.  This is necessary in an  election\r\n\r\nbased  on  constituency representation and to prevent  plural\r\n\r\nvoting.   The  recent  amendments expand  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"residency\" to include groups of citizens who are  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore   for   non-permanent  reasons  and   hence,   have\r\n\r\nsufficient  ties  to  be allocated to vote  in  a  particular\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help it but to also refer to another article in\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times recently, arising from this debate on  the\r\n\r\nright  to vote.   Another Straits Times journalist has argued\r\n\r\nthat   being  Singaporean  adds  up  to  a  Singapore   minus\r\n\r\nexperience.  It is a pity that she feels\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis way.  Among other things, she wrote about several issues\r\n\r\nlike  detention  without trial, X-rated  movies,  banning  of\r\n\r\nchewing   gums  and  mandatory  imprisonment  for  harbouring\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans generally agree that the unbridled rights\r\n\r\nof  individuals who run afoul of the law cannot override  the\r\n\r\nrights   of  the  community  to  be  safe  from  subversives,\r\n\r\ngangsters,  illegal immigrants, or to have  clean  roads  and\r\n\r\nsmooth MRT rides.  Likewise, voting as a right comes with the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  exercise it  for  the  best  interest  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  one's  family and the  community  at  large.   If\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do indeed feel \"diminished when their  political\r\n\r\nspace  and  political rights are circumscribed\", as  she  had\r\n\r\nclaimed,  then would they still remain in Singapore if  their\r\n\r\npersonal  safety  and  security, and that  of  their  family,\r\n\r\nbecome  a  daily  concern through the  lifting  of  the  same\r\n\r\nsafeguards  that  were cited?  Singapore  cannot  be  such  a\r\n\r\nstifling  place if it continues to attract tens of  thousands\r\n\r\nof foreigners who want to work and live here.\r\n\r\n.     Finally, Sir, I would like to reiterate what I said  at\r\n\r\nthe  last  Parliament  sitting.   We  are  not  doubting  the\r\n\r\nloyalties  or  emotional links of Singaporeans  to  Singapore\r\n\r\njust  because  they live overseas.  We believe that  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  will return to Singapore, that they feel for Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  that they will defend Singapore's interest.  The current\r\n\r\ncriteria for overseas voting are not cast in stone, as I said\r\n\r\nat  the  last  sitting.   This is only  the  first  step  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  taking  to provide  for  it.   As  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said recently, the original intention  was  to\r\n\r\nimplement overseas voting only in the 2007 General Elections,\r\n\r\nbut we decided to bring it forward so that we can do it on  a\r\n\r\nlimited scale to gain some experience.  We will review  after\r\n\r\nthe next Elections to assess the scope for extending overseas\r\n\r\nvoting to more Singaporeans who are overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just say that ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
