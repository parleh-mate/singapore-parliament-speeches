The DRS was introduced in 2009 to allow debtors with regular\r\nincomes and debts not exceeding $100,000, an opportunity to avoid\r\nbankruptcy by paying off all or some of their debts through a repayment\r\nplan. In 2010 and 2011, 274 debtors in total were placed on the\r\nDRS. Of these, seven have completed the scheme while 29 fell out\r\nof the scheme as they did not adhere to the repayment plan. The remaining\r\n238 are still on the scheme. Sir, Mrs Chiam also asks for the number\r\nof bankrupts who were discharged from bankruptcy in the past two\r\nyears.

However, blood tests are such that they are usually for\r\nspecific objectives and purposes. When we take blood samples, they\r\nare to be tested for specific results that we are looking for. Therefore,\r\nit is unlikely for us to be able to draw blood from a patient for\r\na comprehensive test in anticipation of tests that would be needed\r\nin future. Usually, the doctors or nurses in attendance will decide\r\nthe relevant tests that need to be done on the blood sample. So\r\nwe will draw the blood and it will be subject to the tests that\r\nare prescribed by the doctors or nurses for the specific purpose\r\nof treating the patient's diseases. If the patient is admitted subsequently\r\nfor a different episode, tests may have to be done again because\r\nthe illnesses or the problems that the patient has may be quite\r\ndifferent from the conditions before and, therefore, repeat tests\r\nmay be necessary so that we can determine the conditions of the\r\npatient and are able to prescribe treatment more precisely. These\r\nare clinical decisions that will be decided by the doctors and the\r\nnurses on the ground based on the conditions of the patient. But\r\nI do agree with the Member that we should continue to see how we\r\ncan minimise unnecessary tests or duplication of tests because tests\r\nare inconvenient and sometimes can be painful to patients. So, our\r\nobjectives are in alignment.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-f1814919-84b0-4fce-b667-47a8b437ff79\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-cfe12325-f87b-452a-bd8d-173af7dd1bfb__id-f1814919-84b0-4fce-b667-47a8b437ff79\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-33198aae-ed21-4869-8f63-ee98ff496432\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-cfe12325-f87b-452a-bd8d-173af7dd1bfb__id-33198aae-ed21-4869-8f63-ee98ff496432\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Miss Penny Low</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I would\r\nlike to once again thank the Minister for his very comprehensive\r\nanswer.

The challenge\r\nis in understanding the criteria which companies are required to\r\ncheck, validate and get the appropriate approvals from the relevant agencies\r\nagainst their other tax criteria. I think you get my drift now on\r\nthe need for simplification. While promising small companies can\r\nand should tap the scheme, given their day-to-day operations and business\r\npressures, they do not have the capacity to navigate the complexity\r\nof the application for the scheme. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1306</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bcf22d31-6276-4140-a213-befb07ddb484\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bcf22d31-6276-4140-a213-befb07ddb484\"><!--a--></a>For companies to make the shift and to\r\nrestructure as well, it is more than just a matter of cost.

CPF contribution rates\r\nfor older workers were lowered in the late 1980s and, again, in\r\nthe 1990s. The then seniority-based wage system discouraged employers\r\nfrom hiring older workers as the seniority based system at the time\r\nmade the older worker more costly to hire than the younger worker. With\r\nthe focus on productivity and the flattening of the wage system\r\nto one focused on performance, it is now only fair that older workers\r\nare recognised and rewarded for the work that they do. I personally find\r\nit hard to justify why any older worker is paid less just because\r\nthey are older. If they are able to do the work, they should be\r\nrewarded for the same as any worker, young or old. On the recommendations for\r\nthe rise in the CPF contributions for older workers, I would also\r\nencourage the Government to consider extending the CPF contribution\r\nrates for those above 65 years who can and are working.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b2932482-57d9-4c82-a022-f2057f2030ad\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b2932482-57d9-4c82-a022-f2057f2030ad\"><!--a--></a>Our economy today is dependent\r\non services rather than manufacturing. And, hence, productivity while\r\nit still entails getting things done faster in a shorter time does\r\nimply the need for experience and knowledge. So while an older worker\r\nmay be physically slower in some instances, it does not necessarily mean\r\nthat they are less effective than their younger counterparts. Let\r\nme give you a very simple example. Take going into a store or going\r\ninto a restaurant as an example: the quality of the service you\r\nreceive from the service personnel really depends on their knowledge\r\nof the products and services and their ability to understand and\r\nmatch your needs and then to follow up and give you the products\r\nand services you require. The ability to complete the transaction\r\nin the shortest time and to provide you with a quality customer\r\nexperience need not mean that each step must be done in the shortest\r\ntime but rather the ability to complete it in the shortest time\r\naccurately. With older workers better educated and having more experience,\r\ntheir ability to provide good service and to understand customer\r\nneeds will be strong. Their ability to retrieve products, input\r\nthe service requirements or complete the order quickly can be assisted with\r\nsuitable technologies to check stocks or to scan products or to\r\nuse portable input devices to input service requirements. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f727c33d-130f-4598-a594-2f4275aa7e1a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f727c33d-130f-4598-a594-2f4275aa7e1a\"><!--a--></a>We must recognise that\r\nthere still exist perceptions and sometimes biases that older workers\r\nmay not be productive as compared to the younger workers and it\r\nwill take time for such perceptions to change. While the CPF contribution\r\nrates are increased, having the Special Employment Credit (SEC)\r\nin place will encourage employers to continue to employ older workers\r\nand keep them in demand in the employment market. Together with\r\nschemes like PIC and the restructuring of work to leverage the use of\r\ntechnology and automation to be less labour intensive and to improving\r\nthe work processes, all these will enable older workers and disabled\r\nworkers to be more effective and equally productive. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e231100a-0eea-42da-bf13-d7b9f0c7d6dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e231100a-0eea-42da-bf13-d7b9f0c7d6dc\"><!--a--></a>I would like to share\r\na recent example that I was fortunate to come to learn about during\r\nthe course of my commercial work.

This company is called\r\nEureka Call Centre Pte Ltd. Eureka Call Centre is a 30-seat Call\r\nCentre. It was facing high staff turnover and was not able to run\r\nits operations effectively. In 2008, it decided to embark on an\r\nambitious re-engineering project. Eureka decided that they would\r\nrun a Call Centre with call agents who were visually impaired. In\r\n2009, they started with their pioneer batch of visually impaired\r\ncall agents. They currently have 16 persons with physical disabilities\r\n(PWDs) and intend to recruit 12 to15 more every six months. They\r\nbenchmark themselves with Call Centres that have able Call Agents\r\nand they set their KPIs at 10% higher than able Call Agents and\r\naims to have their Call Agents to be more productive. They have\r\nbeen successful in achieving these goals. And their Call Agents\r\nhandle an average of 30% to 50% more calls than able Call Agents.\r\nThey are able to do an average of 16% higher talk time per hour. They\r\nwere able to achieve this by re-engineering of their work processes\r\nand providing technology to enable the PWDs and the visually impaired\r\nworkers do their work effectively. The User-Interface was re-programmed:\r\nthey use technologies like hotkeys as shortcuts, voice synthesizers\r\nfor the totally blind, screen magnifiers and high contrast displays,\r\nand real time monitoring for supervision, training and barging. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1308</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-874ac83d-6afe-499a-a642-3a06b6546afb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-874ac83d-6afe-499a-a642-3a06b6546afb\"><!--a--></a>While they pay their agents\r\ncompetitively, they also realise that their needs to socialise and\r\nhave outings was really what they valued.

On that point, I would say that the Special\r\nEmployment Credit that is in place, 16% for employers who hire SPED\r\ngraduates, regardless of age, is definitely welcomed.

Most would expect that since the majority\r\nof Singaporeans are Chinese, there will be a natural fit. However,\r\namong the Chinese, we would be able to identify a different language,\r\naccent or slang in the way we speak. Hence, we might even be more\r\nconscious of the differences among us. I believe it could be a similar\r\nsituation within\r\nthe Indian community. As a non-Indian, I cannot differentiate between\r\nTamil, Hindi or any Indian dialects, but I believe some Singaporean\r\nIndians would be able to tell from a glance whether someone is from\r\nnorthern India or southern India.

The Government\r\nshould be congratulated for taking these changes into account, and\r\nwith Budget 2012, we are better placed to address concerns of many\r\nSingaporeans, particularly those in the lower income brackets. I\r\nwish to focus my current comments, and those that I intend to make\r\nduring the Committee of Supply debates, on this latter group of\r\nSingaporeans \u2013 those from the lower income and less skilled groups.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-196c4a28-c604-44ad-8607-125623aabb99\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-196c4a28-c604-44ad-8607-125623aabb99\"><!--a--></a>This new, inclusive approach\r\nof the Government in budgeting is a positive move. By allocating\r\nmore funds to help the elderly, the needy and the less able, the\r\nGovernment is acknowledging that some groups of Singaporeans need\r\nspecial attention. I hope that in our upcoming debate, we will continue\r\nwith this approach, and allocate the Government's budget to address\r\ncurrent and immediate concerns of less fortunate Singaporeans. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-82c2f810-ffc5-43e1-a0c6-5f274b0a68a1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-82c2f810-ffc5-43e1-a0c6-5f274b0a68a1\"><!--a--></a>To start with, Sir, I\r\nam deeply concerned with the plight of older and less skilled workers.\r\nI accept the Government's argument that the best and the most sustainable\r\nway to raise incomes is by improving productivity. And this comes\r\nthrough upskilling and use of technology and even processes. This approach\r\nis well and fine for many workers, but perhaps not so applicable\r\nto those in the lowest rungs of our workforce. Let me give you an\r\nexample. Recently, I was approached by an elderly man, in his late\r\n50s, approaching 60s. He works as a cleaner in a small company.\r\nTo his credit, he said that he had heard a news report that his\r\nincome could go up if he could improve his productivity. Then he\r\nasked me how he\r\ncould go about improving his productivity. Honestly, it is not an\r\neasy answer. Because while I could tell him to attend a course to\r\nupgrade himself, or learn to use the cleaning machines, I knew that his\r\ncompany, which is a small one, was not going to send him for many\r\ncourses, or buy many machines. For him, there would be a difficult\r\nway up. At close to 60 years of age, he struggles and is unlikely\r\nto learn a new trade. Realistically, he is unlikely to find a new\r\njob, even in more progressive cleaning companies. So, the Government's\r\ncall for workers to improve productivity was irrelevant to him.\r\nThis is not an uncommon view among workers in the services sectors\r\nlike cleaning, health care, F&amp;B, retail, etc. To these workers,\r\nin these sectors, it is all good and well to throw a big word like\r\nproductivity at them, but they still struggle to come to terms on\r\nhow it will really make an impact in the way they work, the salary\r\nthat they earn and the career progression that they may have.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1312</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d07e3a87-7ce2-4908-aa0d-50ed8d2674d1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d07e3a87-7ce2-4908-aa0d-50ed8d2674d1\"><!--a--></a>Sir, this is just one\r\nexample \u2013 workers in many small companies in Singapore may be in\r\nthe same situation \u2013 and my point is that at the macro level, it\r\nis reasonable to talk about improving productivity as a way of improving\r\nincomes. But at the micro level, we must have a more meaningful\r\ndiscussion about how individual workers can hope to raise their\r\nincomes, so that they too can benefit from the results of Singapore's\r\nprogress. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8634a9b5-38fc-42c2-b130-0e0d3df2cd3d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-8634a9b5-38fc-42c2-b130-0e0d3df2cd3d\"><!--a--></a>I believe that we have\r\nnot fully recognised the plight of the low-income workers and particularly\r\nso, the plight of older and less skilled workers. I urge the Government\r\nto place some emphasis, using the power of whole of Government,\r\nto look at how we can improve the lives of this group. While I am\r\nsure that they appreciate the rebates, the vouchers, and so on,\r\nthat the Government offers from time to time, I think that there\r\nis a need for a closer examination of where each dollar of a low-wage\r\nworker earns goes to. A question that I would like to ask is: how\r\nmuch of the earnings of the low-wage worker go to paying direct\r\nand indirect government-related taxes, fees, charges and the like?\r\nIf we do have some sense of the reality, we could consider options\r\nthat are more effective in helping them cope with the challenges\r\nthat they faced. Like, what scope exists to reduce these charges,\r\nfor example? My logic is that a low-wage worker's standard of living\r\ncan be improved not only by increasing his income, but also by reducing\r\nthe cost of his living. I believe that now is the most opportune\r\ntime to look at this issue because, in fact, our Minister for Manpower\r\nis also the Minister of Finance!</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-31659539-3982-4a9a-962e-299f03fbba5f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-31659539-3982-4a9a-962e-299f03fbba5f\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I accept that the\r\nissue of housing for low-income workers is a complex one too. I\r\nhave previously suggested that the HDB look at managing the sale\r\nof 3-room and smaller flats differently \u2013 totally different from\r\nthe way we do it now, so that poorer households can buy or rent\r\nhomes at an affordable price. Today, I would like to suggest even\r\nmore bolder and radical ideas to the Government. One idea is for\r\nHDB to consider selling homes on shorter leases \u2013 say 50 years or\r\n60 years lease, for example \u2013 for Singaporeans with lower incomes\r\nand limited financial resources. HDB can put further restrictions like\r\nrecovery of subsidies on sales and buy them back at a cost-plus\r\nbasis. This can remove speculation of 3-room or smaller flats, and\r\nrevert the HDB to its original mission of housing a nation. If we\r\nmake enough effort, I am confident that we can think of a scheme\r\nto reduce the start-up burden on low-income families and even young\r\nfamilies, and they can be assured of a roof over their heads at\r\na reasonable price. This would be another way to reduce the burden\r\nof cost on low-income workers and also for young Singaporeans.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5c1a2ace-d74c-4dcc-b00f-3107d25c26a5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-5c1a2ace-d74c-4dcc-b00f-3107d25c26a5\"><!--a--></a>Next, Sir, beyond the\r\nlow-income workers, I also wish to focus and discuss on workers\r\nin general, and whether our education and training system is preparing\r\nour students for the work life. We know that Singapore's brand and\r\nreputation on education is well-known far and wide. Our schools\r\nand tertiary institutions are ranked among the best in the world,\r\nso I think it is only reasonable to expect that our young people,\r\nhaving attended these schools, should be highly productive. Yet,\r\nwhen we talk to our businesses, this does not seem to be the case.\r\nThey find school leavers to be book smart, but not street smart.\r\nThey seem to know how to behave in a classroom, but not in a workplace.\r\nAnd they seem to lack a hunger to excel and are demanding in their\r\nexpectation. I am not sure what the cause of this apparent gap is.\r\nIs it because we teach what is not exactly relevant to what the\r\nbusinesses want? Or is it because we teach theoretical principles, but not\r\nhow these will be relevant in the workplace? Or does the issue lie\r\nwith the students \u2013 after being told to study hard, work so hard\r\nthat they can get comfortable jobs, they think that getting a degree\r\nmeans that they have arrived. Perhaps, it is true that they have\r\narrived, but they need to accept that they have only arrived at\r\nthe start of the next phase of their lives \u2013 where they can only\r\nachieve their aspirations through continued hard work!</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1313</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-450fb094-34e1-474d-8134-d60eb4fe6279\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-450fb094-34e1-474d-8134-d60eb4fe6279\"><!--a--></a>Another point that we\r\nmust consider is the difficulties that some of our workers face\r\nin retirement. Sir, we have received much feedback about the elderly\r\nin my housing estates who are very concerned about their retirement\r\nand employability in their old age. I was, in fact, very encouraged\r\nwhen the Government, in the past few years, was discussing ways\r\nto improve the returns of the CPF balances. It is good that the\r\nGovernment has decided to grant a higher interest rate for the first\r\n$60,000 of the CPF balances. But I am asking if there is a possibility\r\nfor us to do more and give more whenever gains are good. We are\r\naware of the magic of compound interest. For example, if you have\r\n$1,000 balance in your CPF account, at an interest rate of 2.5%,\r\nover 30 years, it will give you $2,098. But we know that if this interest\r\ncan be better, the gains can be much more. Now, imagine if you are\r\nable to achieve an appropriate interest rate that is viable and\r\nalso sustainable, this would mean that our retiring workers can look\r\nforward to more resources at retirement and little more comfort,\r\nafter helping Singapore grow and prosper. It would also mean that\r\nthey would be less reliant on the Government for their needs in\r\nlater part of their life. It may be opportune time for us to relook\r\nat the interest rates of CPF accounts of Singaporean workers for\r\ntheir long term benefits. It is also timely, Sir, I think for us,\r\nas a whole of Government, to see how we can maximise the contributions\r\nof all in our workforce.

This can be attributed to the market driven\r\npricing approach taken by the Government and its agencies. The Government\r\nhas, many a time, been quick to increase the various charges, allowing\r\ncosts to escalate, immediately upon a recovery of an economic recession.\r\nEach time this happens, we bring the cost base higher without an opportunity\r\nfor cost reductions. This has led costs to unrealistically increase\r\nfaster and more than profit and income growth of Singaporeans. If\r\nfact, in the 2008 recession for example, the worst was in the property\r\nmarket where we continued to see real estate prices increase despite\r\nthe recession and this was because of our liberal policies on capital\r\ninflows. There are many foreigners who invested in Singapore. While\r\nthe Government should not interfere in the private market except\r\nto curb speculation, it could have done a lot in the HDB market\r\nhad it not pursued market driven pricing. Also market driven pricing has\r\ncreated huge cost burdens and will potentially edge out many of\r\nour SMEs because of squeezed margins. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2ba1af1f-25cd-4e41-be46-7dd77e4a0862\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-2ba1af1f-25cd-4e41-be46-7dd77e4a0862\"><!--a--></a>While the Government has\r\nkept corporate taxes relatively low, and this is a good thing, there\r\nare other high overheads that companies here face that add to their\r\nhigh operational costs and erode their profits. There are many hidden\r\ntaxes \u2013 GST is one, high levies for foreign workers, a series of\r\nduties and taxes on utilities, transportation costs such as COEs\r\nand ERP charges and many others that add to escalating business\r\ncosts. Similarly, Singaporeans are left with little disposable income\r\nas they pay for higher HDB prices and also their share of higher\r\ntaxes and levies. The Government should review all of these to see\r\nwhich could be removed or adjusted because these built-in taxes\r\nand high operational costs cream off the profits for our SMEs and\r\nlower the disposable income of Singaporeans. As suggested by Prof\r\nTan Khee Giap and his team in an article in <em class=\"ph i\">The Straits Times</em> dated\r\n4 January this year, \"this approach of re-pricing Government services\r\nmay lead to lower revenues or bigger subsidies for statutory boards,\r\nministries and Government-linked companies. But it will also translate\r\ninto higher income and employment for Singaporeans\". What I am suggesting\r\nis that the Government does a thorough cost reduction review exercise.\r\nWe must re-calibrate our policies to minimise upfront costs for\r\ncompanies and Singaporeans and let them earn better incomes. If\r\ndone correctly, the Government may offset lower revenues by spending\r\nless on special transfers for social safety nets.

For now, we should focus on short-term cost\r\nissues and allow companies to survive first. When we talk about\r\nrestructuring the economy, we will also have to restructure the\r\nway the Government contributes to cost. If we are not careful at\r\nthe pace of restructuring of the economy, we may end up hurting the future\r\npotential of our economy as we reverse many of the good things that\r\nwe have been doing, as recommended by the Economic Review Committee\r\nin 2002. My fear is that once again the Government may be inducing\r\na significant squeeze out of SMEs who are the biggest employers\r\nin Singapore today. And if we are not careful, the day that MNCs\r\nstart to move out in large numbers, we will see a vacuum and a hollowing\r\nout of our economy without a strong base of home grown companies to\r\ntake over. For the long-term view of Singapore, this is also not\r\ngood and will undermine our restructuring efforts.

But we need to go beyond the academic route.\r\nWe also need to be aggressive in our Continuing Education and Training\r\n(CET) route.

And they will continue to drive with two or three\r\nshort breaks of seven to eight minutes in the interchange.

Working overtime daily is a norm for bus drivers to\r\nsupplement their monthly basic wage ranging from $1,375 to $1,700.\r\nThis helps them to make ends meet and it is also compounded by the\r\nshortage of bus drivers. Encountering difficult commuters is also\r\ncommon. A slip of the tongue, momentary loss of cool, means getting\r\na complaint letter and, at the end of the day, bonus or increment\r\ncan get cut.

I also noted\r\nthat back then, the price of an HDB flat was much lower as of today.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-437bf8e4-8ec2-4bd0-a4c7-73386085d4b5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-437bf8e4-8ec2-4bd0-a4c7-73386085d4b5\"><!--a--></a>During the Singapore Perspectives\r\n2012 Forum organised by the Institute of Policy Studies on 16 January,\r\na professor shared on retirement adequacy measured by income replacement\r\nratio, which is the proportion of the working income that one has\r\nat retirement.

Sir, this again seems to suggest the inadequacy\r\nof the CPF savings to support the retirement needs of our workers.\r\nCPF contribution had been cut three times from 25% to 10% in 1986,\r\n20% to 10% in 1999 and 16% to 13% in 2003. However, the restoration\r\nfrom 10% to 20% and 13% to 16% both took eight years to restore.\r\nThis excludes the further CPF cuts for workers age 50 years and\r\nabove. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0b339f9b-bdf6-477c-9d5c-a0a42f724bbe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-0b339f9b-bdf6-477c-9d5c-a0a42f724bbe\"><!--a--></a>To illustrate my point\r\nof how much Singaporean workers have sacrificed in their CPF savings,\r\nI take the case of a 30-year-old worker who earned S$1,000 per month\r\nin 1985 and the employer contribution rate then was 25%. If this\r\n25% contribution had not been cut, the worker would have accumulated\r\nan additional of more than S$30,000 in his account by 2011, that\r\nis, 26 years later.

The ESC referred to this level as about one-third of the\r\ntotal workforce. So, we are still talking about a one-third leverage\r\nin manpower. With tighter foreign labour inflows, the Government hopes\r\nthat companies would either look to improve productivity or hire\r\nmore Singaporeans or both. The social intent here is that as companies\r\npay up to attract Singaporeans to the job, it would help grow our median\r\nwages.

So, what are the risks and what could go wrong? First,\r\nthere is the obvious risk of an unsustainable rise in business costs.\r\nWe are hearing this loud and clear from the businesses. Raising\r\nthe foreign worker levy will directly increase labour costs. Tightening\r\nthe DRC will also compel companies to pay up to hire local workers\r\nand hence would also add to the manpower costs. In an almost full\r\nemployment situation that we are now in, local hiring may well be\r\na zero sum game. The most probable occurrence would be the unhealthy\r\npractice of staff poaching from each other which would just push\r\nwages up sharply to an unsustainable level. The cumulative increase\r\nin levy announced so far is expected to increase wage cost by 20%\r\nto 25%, according to some studies. Escalating business costs would\r\nimpact companies' bottom line if productivity improvements are not\r\nable to make up for the cost increases. The concern here is whether\r\nthis would lead to a repeat of a 1985-style recession.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-37784701-0461-4bf9-9054-98bf55cd5dea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-37784701-0461-4bf9-9054-98bf55cd5dea\"><!--a--></a>Back in 1980s, as part\r\nof \"wage correction\", the NWC recommended three consecutive rounds\r\nof aggressive wage hikes. This resulted in a severe loss of international\r\ncompetitiveness. At that time, the wage reform actually benefited\r\nSingaporeans more directly because it was a straight wage increase\r\nfor the workers. In our current situation, the restructuring is\r\ndone by way of tightening foreign labour dependency ratio and higher\r\nlevy. One of the causes cited in the 1986 Economic Committee Report\r\nto review the economy then stated that the loss of competitiveness\r\ndue to high costs of doing business in Singapore as one of the internal\r\nfactors for the recession. So we have to be mindful during this adjustment\r\nphase not to allow non-wage operating costs to rise beyond control\r\nas costs are usually more sticky on the downside.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bb12ef75-91ff-4c8e-bd9a-a32150499d47\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bb12ef75-91ff-4c8e-bd9a-a32150499d47\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, the inflation\r\nrisks, as well expressed by many economists. It is unavoidable that\r\nsome of the businesses will pass on the increased costs to consumers,\r\nespecially those in the domestic services sector. Given the significant\r\ncost impact from increased wages and levy, prices will head north.\r\nWhether it is the cleaning contractor, delivery, building maintenance,\r\nrestaurant, and so on, these will likely cost more. In the midst\r\nof all these adjustments, we may be facing a sharp oil shock arising\r\nfrom the Middle East geo-political tension. So, we cannot take our\r\neyes off inflation.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-54c430b7-a685-4f2d-a0df-4b023aa99a3a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-54c430b7-a685-4f2d-a0df-4b023aa99a3a\"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, the potential\r\nrisk of hollowing out within our economy. The expected rising costs\r\nand higher inflation coupled with tight labour supply will no doubt\r\nreduce our attractiveness as a business and investment destination.\r\nWe can expect more relocations and reduction in direct investments.\r\nEven without these foreign labour tightening measures, there is\r\nalways the fear of industry hollowing out due to our small domestic\r\nmarket and the lack of a dynamic hinterland. Of course, economies\r\nremain viable on the premise of comparative advantages.

The setting up of a cross-border project finance institution\r\nand the development of Iskandar region at Johor would also complement\r\nour strategy. However, if the cost pressures and tight labour supply\r\nhit every aspect of the economy with no corresponding improvements\r\nin productivity or local labour\r\nparticipation, we could see an exodus or downsizing of companies,\r\nand this may include losing some of our strategic capabilities which\r\nwe hope to retain and grow. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1327</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-49ba6506-ff78-4772-8cb2-d0a088731482\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-49ba6506-ff78-4772-8cb2-d0a088731482\"><!--a--></a>Fourthly, the risk of\r\nlong-term unemployment.

We want to continually elevate ourselves to be amongst\r\nthe most productive and the most technological advanced country\r\nin the world. Having an abundance of foreign workers would not get\r\nus there. In any case, foreign labour will not always stay cheap.\r\nWe must be prepared for the eventuality where foreign workers will\r\ncost more due to economic progress in those countries where the\r\nworkers come from.

One of the most important costs we need to restrain is,\r\nof course, the cost of land which Mr Inderjit Singh has also mentioned.\r\nAccording to URA data for the year 2011, as a whole, prices of multiple-user\r\nfactory space increased sharply by 27.1% while rentals increased\r\nby 16.2%. And this is after steep increases of 23.7% in prices and\r\n11.7% in rentals in 2010.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8c9c2a73-230f-471f-9d94-df8ffdcc6d02\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-8c9c2a73-230f-471f-9d94-df8ffdcc6d02\"><!--a--></a>If land costs continue\r\nto rise at such a rate, our international competitiveness would\r\nbe eroded even without this round of labour cost increase.

Just like hawker centres, these industrial\r\nworkshops offer to businesses no-frills, practical and budgeted workspace\r\nto operate.

Investing\r\nin our elderly, the disabled, the poor and other needy Singaporeans\r\nwill reward society with the economic, social and cultural contributions\r\nthey will be able to make with assistance.

This coming financial\r\nyear's Budget addresses some of Singaporeans' key concerns as Singapore\r\nundergoes transformational changes by making a significant calibrated\r\nshift in the Budget's focus.

It underlines\r\nthe move away from \"equal sharing\" to one of \"equitable distribution\"\r\nas the fundamental basis of sharing our nation's wealth. This shift\r\nis at least a decade in the making. To be sure, equity has been\r\na growing \"accent\" in previous Budgets since 2002.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bab197aa-940e-4ac0-88e6-67b649af488b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bab197aa-940e-4ac0-88e6-67b649af488b\"><!--a--></a>But, going forward, equity\r\nmust be the unequivocal \"language\" of future Budgets.

It is timely that the focus of the Budget is\r\nsquarely on older Singaporeans, Singaporeans with disabilities,\r\nand lower income Singaporeans. This commitment towards preventing\r\na permanent underclass from forming is necessary. The reality is\r\nthat economic globalisation and our economic policies have not resulted\r\nin every Singaporean being able to benefit from them. In fact, there\r\nis a considerable segment of Singaporeans who have found the economic\r\ntransformation and restructuring disconcerting as they have not\r\nbeen able to take\r\nadvantage of it. This group feels displaced by the rapid economic\r\nchanges and feels that the nation's prosperity seems to have passed\r\nthem by.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1332</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1c2efc8-b4af-47ec-8ca9-9ffb36c926e2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a1c2efc8-b4af-47ec-8ca9-9ffb36c926e2\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the abiding imperative\r\nto renew Singaporeans' confidence in the commitment to shared economic\r\ngrowth is crucial if the ongoing plans to restructure the economy\r\nare to have the buy-in from Singaporeans. The social and economic\r\ndimensions of the Budget complement each other. Our society will\r\nbe all the poorer if we do not pay equal attention to both. Economic\r\ngrowth is necessary to sustain the evolving social compact as our\r\nnation grapples with competing, and perhaps even conflicting, needs and\r\ninterests. Sir, let me now list what I thought are some of the noteworthy\r\nfeatures of Budget 2012. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-77645e99-eed5-4411-a5b0-8a651c221d1e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-77645e99-eed5-4411-a5b0-8a651c221d1e\"><!--a--></a>First, there is a greater\r\nwillingness to look beyond the 12-month fiscal year through multi-year spending\r\ncommitments. This funding model benefits, for example, the Special\r\nEmployment Credit, which is aimed at encouraging employers to plan\r\nahead and hire older workers. I hope that future Budgets will have\r\nmore spending commitments beyond 12-month fiscal year, especially\r\nin areas where multi-year funding is vital to ensure continuity\r\nand sustainability of those programmes. We should not let the financial\r\nyear's duration limit our commitment to plan beyond the next 12\r\nmonths. For many of the issues we are grappling with today, such\r\nas income inequality, dysfunctional families, expanding the public\r\ntransport network, we should not be strait-jacketed by a 12-month\r\ntimeframe.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e0280aeb-7f7c-4938-925f-acf13a33783f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e0280aeb-7f7c-4938-925f-acf13a33783f\"><!--a--></a>Second, I applaud the\r\nrelatively comprehensive package of helping Singaporeans with special\r\nneeds through strengthening early intervention and education, to\r\nsupporting their being in gainful employment, and to the provision\r\nof better adult care. This support given to Singaporeans with disabilities\r\nis, I believe, unprecedented. They have often been at the periphery\r\nof the Budget and our society but there is now a concerted move\r\nto help them.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-81eb0e0c-ca6e-4ca9-9f65-49133c02a54f\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-81eb0e0c-ca6e-4ca9-9f65-49133c02a54f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6aff64b9-d153-4248-9ca1-7409df9a1e34\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-6aff64b9-d153-4248-9ca1-7409df9a1e34\"><!--a--></a>The third noteworthy feature\r\nis that the support for low-income Singaporeans has progressed to embrace\r\nnon-income support. The plan for more social workers and other professionals\r\nto help lower income families underlines the need for a holistic\r\napproach to helping them break out of the poverty cycle and become\r\nresilient. I hope we can make a serious effort to make non-income\r\nsupport a central feature of our ecosystem of care and caring. This\r\nHouse would be more than familiar with the gross limitations of\r\nwhat income transfers can do. In 2011, Government transfers constituted\r\na massive 43.8% of the annual household income from work per household\r\nmember for HDB 1- and 2-room resident households. This is an increase\r\nover the figure of 43.3% in 2010 and 41.4% in 2009. These transfers\r\nhelp in the short term but to help families become self-reliant\r\nand confident about the future, the need for psycho-social, holistic\r\nhelp, and principled-based case intervention are necessary if Government transfers\r\nare not to become a crutch for the disadvantaged among us.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-525ca876-a055-4226-8888-29a5b4f7c061\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-525ca876-a055-4226-8888-29a5b4f7c061\"><!--a--></a>Fourth, with the introduction\r\nof the GST Voucher, the Government has acknowledged, albeit indirectly\r\nand somewhat reluctantly, that the GST is a regressive tax since\r\nlower income households pay a larger share of their income to the\r\nGST than wealthier households do. Given that the GST Voucher will\r\noperate as a permanent system of offsets, does it suggest that an\r\nincrease in the GST is likely to be sooner rather than later?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1ab14095-cec6-4e7c-be1c-7eb728b58416\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-1ab14095-cec6-4e7c-be1c-7eb728b58416\"><!--a--></a>Much as there is a tendency\r\nto see less well-off Singaporeans as the primary beneficiaries,\r\nit bears noting that we are all better-off as a society when it\r\nengenders resilience, hope, and confidence in the future, regardless\r\nof one's socio-economic status. Furthermore, how we, as a society,\r\ncare for the disadvantaged, give voice to the voiceless, and help\r\nthe downtrodden among us reflects on our heart-ware, and the quality\r\nof our nation-building. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ca4387f7-0218-44b1-b641-b08b19121923\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-ca4387f7-0218-44b1-b641-b08b19121923\"><!--a--></a>Sir, it would be a pipe-dream\r\nfor any Budget to remove the inequalities in our society. Nonetheless, the\r\nBudget must contribute towards a less unequal society. I submit\r\nthat the Budget must represent the essence of our social compact.\r\nOur social compact must retain its inclusiveness, legitimacy and effectiveness. The\r\ngrowing income gap raises the real concern of the imminent development\r\nof \"two Singapores\". As the growing income gap is a reality that\r\nwill persist into the foreseeable future, what will prevent this\r\nstate of \"two Singapores\" is to ensure true social mobility and\r\nto provide adequate social safety nets that encourage risk-taking\r\nwhile not sapping the work ethic so carefully nurtured in the management\r\nof Singapore's success. Indeed, social mobility, and its promise\r\nof economic opportunity and success, has served as a powerful engine\r\nof economic growth and a source of social cohesion. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1333</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-29d60d06-7ca5-4020-b3ac-0584dc9fa5dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-29d60d06-7ca5-4020-b3ac-0584dc9fa5dc\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the sustenance of\r\nour social compact requires a multi-stakeholder approach. Governments\r\nalone cannot maintain social compacts. A key challenge as we incur\r\nmore social spending in the medium to long term is whether those\r\nwho bear the tax burden would appreciate the significance and shoulder\r\nthe responsibility of the better-off helping the less well-off.\r\nIf so, we have a sustainable social compact that will not only be\r\na deep resource of Singaporeans' bond with the State but it will\r\nalso nourish the affective ties between fellow Singaporeans. The\r\nBudget is a social compact that must be a common enterprise for the\r\ncommon good. If not, then we will have \"two Singapores\" forming,\r\nand such a divided country will undermine the hopes and aspirations\r\nof all Singaporeans.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3b516424-d208-4a55-8141-897d612fb36a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-3b516424-d208-4a55-8141-897d612fb36a\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I hope this House\r\nwill affirm the need to view the Budget as a tangible manifestation\r\nof our evolving social compact. To be sure, the Budget is about\r\nsharing our wealth, and Budget 2012 is a \"social Budget\" that puts\r\nthe disadvantaged and elderly Singaporeans at the forefront. The\r\nBudget is a very powerful tool, an influential driver of social\r\nengineering to mould social attitudes and mindsets, and influence\r\nsocio-economic behaviour. However, I do not think we have effectively\r\nharnessed that to good effect. Instead, in recent years, the Budget\r\nhas all too often emphasised the \"goodies\" it contains which Singaporeans\r\nhave now grown to expect as an entitlement. I note that the Finance\r\nMinistry's Budget website provides a calculator tool for households\r\nand businesses to estimate the total amount that they can receive\r\nfrom the Budget. However, the larger and more important messages\r\nintended by the various policies and measures are drowned out by\r\nthe \"noise\" of calculating and comparing one's budgetary \"gains\"\r\nand \"losses\". This cultivation of \"what's-in-it-for-me\" mindset\r\nmay unwittingly lull Singaporeans into sacrificing long-term benefits\r\nfor short-term gains.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8e736a67-14bd-44a2-9e2f-daf51547d570\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-8e736a67-14bd-44a2-9e2f-daf51547d570\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Government has\r\nbeen criticised severely in the past for being tight-fisted. There\r\nare now concerns of whether the pendulum has swung to the other\r\nextreme. Even as the Budget shifts our focus towards expanded social\r\nsafety nets to help the less well-off Singaporeans, there is a concern\r\nof whether we might be unwittingly planting the seeds of a welfare\r\nstate. I doubt so. The fact that the concerns are raised suggests\r\nthat we are mindful of the dependency syndrome. It is perhaps inevitable\r\nand necessary, given the differential impact that our economic policies\r\nhave on different groups of Singaporeans, that Singapore has become\r\nmore welfare-oriented in recent years. However, if being less tight-fisted\r\non principled grounds to help Singapore remain inclusive and a land\r\nof opportunity, without undermining the spirit of self-reliance,\r\nthen, why not? Besides, rising inequality results in declining equality\r\nof opportunities, and runs the risk of political backlash and social\r\ninstability. Both could undermine the economic dynamism and social\r\ncohesion that form the bedrock of our success.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5deb10a4-ff84-42db-b43c-9b6c6a12bbd8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-5deb10a4-ff84-42db-b43c-9b6c6a12bbd8\"><!--a--></a>But I also detect, through\r\nmy association with the voluntary welfare sector, the nascent signs\r\nof an easy reliance on the Government. What is more important now\r\nis to inculcate the desirable values, norms and attitudes even as\r\nwe roll out more support. Our Budget and the assistance it offers\r\nto less privileged Singaporeans must not result in their having\r\na crutch mentality. For those who are able-bodied, the combination\r\nof assistance and government transfers must reinforce the dignity\r\nof work. The message of re-skilling, skills upgrading, and lifelong\r\nlearning must strike a chord with Singaporeans.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1334</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ebc3836f-61d0-4ec2-89a5-dc2127708c38\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-ebc3836f-61d0-4ec2-89a5-dc2127708c38\"><!--a--></a>In addition, I hope that as a society\r\nwe will keep a lookout for children from disadvantaged homes. In\r\nthis regard, education \u2013 especially pre-school education \u2013 becomes\r\ncritical in ensuring children from such homes are not unnecessarily\r\ndisadvantaged by the fates and fortunes of their parents.

My view is that in the\r\npast decade, the Government has focussed more on the threat to jobs\r\nthat the bottom 20% customarily face as their jobs get off-shored,\r\nout-sourced or simply become unavailable. However, we should pay\r\njust as much attention to the threat to wages that the sandwiched\r\nmiddle-class Singaporean faces.

For too long, the corporate sector has perhaps\r\nbenefited from the fiscal largesse dispensed due to the Government's\r\nanxiety to grow the economy and our desire for material well-being.\r\nAgainst a backdrop of a growing income gap, I would urge the business\r\ncommunity to see the Budget in a different light. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ba4eaca8-ca2d-45bb-a97c-f3006686cc56\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-ba4eaca8-ca2d-45bb-a97c-f3006686cc56\"><!--a--></a>Sir, it appears that the\r\nbusiness community equates a social Budget as a Budget that is not\r\npro-business.

The Budget is our social\r\ncompact and the business community is a key stakeholder. Singapore's\r\nBudgets cannot be seen as a zero-sum game where if more is devoted\r\nto social spending, that there is then less for the economy. Strong\r\neconomic growth and a cohesive society are not and need not be mutually\r\nexclusive. Businesses can do more and should do more in areas like\r\nemployability of older Singaporeans, tackling the various forms\r\nof workplace discrimination, and promoting work-life balance. The\r\nneed for businesses to step up and play their role in the development\r\nof a resilient society is necessary. It is vital for them to do\r\nso if the tripartite framework that has served us well is to be\r\nsustained and enhanced in tandem with a changing world.

It stands apart from Budgets of the past. One aspect I note\r\nis that the Budget did not attempt to give something to everyone. In\r\ntimes of economic uncertainty, our spending must be focused to meet\r\nnational objectives. It makes less sense to give <em class=\"ph i\">hong baos</em> to\r\neveryone, whether they need it or not. One more dollar which goes\r\nto someone who needs it less, means a dollar less for someone who\r\nneeds it more. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c812423c-0c28-4c9a-8eb9-84018b5a578d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-c812423c-0c28-4c9a-8eb9-84018b5a578d\"><!--a--></a>I also support the Budget\r\nbecause it strikes a balance between encouraging Singaporeans to\r\nsucceed through their own efforts, yet recognising that you have\r\nto do more to level up society, and help those in need. Because\r\nthat is the hallmark of any inclusive society \u2212 or tribe as Mr Baey\r\ncalls it \u2212 every citizen instilled with the unshakeable belief that\r\nthe well-being of their fellow Singaporeans is important to them\r\nand a fundamental part of our national mission. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a6a98dfa-8ca3-47e6-b4f4-2d623218fcfa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a6a98dfa-8ca3-47e6-b4f4-2d623218fcfa\"><!--a--></a>There is, however, a temptation\r\nin such debates to focus on areas which the Government could do more\r\nor has not addressed. Anyone can, without much effort, think of\r\nsomething we can spend more money on or areas they want the Government\r\nto pay more attention to. We all want to be as inclusive as possible\r\nbut our resources are not unlimited. It should not be how much we\r\nspend but really the outcomes we achieved. Mr Inderjit Singh and\r\nMs Sylvia Lim both talked about increasing healthcare spending,\r\nand that is a good example. In the US, for example, US spends 18%\r\nof their GDP on healthcare. And this compares to about 9%-10% of\r\nEuropean countries. But the outcomes in European countries on healthcare\r\nare much better \u2013 longer longevity, life spans, healthcare outcomes,\r\ninfant mortality. So it is not about how much we spend but the outcomes\r\nwe achieved. The real challenge is about getting our spending priorities\r\nright, and to be smart about how we spend, where we spend, why we\r\nspend, so that we can make a real difference to the lives of as\r\nmany Singaporeans as possible on a balanced Budget. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f941c57f-6450-40b2-8346-d02b88835fd4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f941c57f-6450-40b2-8346-d02b88835fd4\"><!--a--></a>One of the key concerns\r\nall Singaporeans have is, of course, growing old and the challenges\r\nthat it will bring \u2212 lack of employment opportunities, rising cost\r\nof living, healthcare and housing.

And even if we build more, it may be difficult\r\nfor the elderly to sell off their current homes, break ties they\r\nhave developed over the years, and start all over again in a strange\r\nenvironment. A recent <em class=\"ph i\">Straits Times</em> article published interviews\r\nwith a number of elderly, who expressed those very concerns. Do\r\nwe really want them to move? This cannot be good for their well\r\nbeing.

But it proved very unpopular, with very low take-up\r\nrate. For the reasons I gave in my earlier speech, I can understand\r\nwhy. It only applies to 2- and 3-room flats. The monthly payments\r\nare low. There are also a number of disadvantages. The payments\r\nare based on the present day value of the flats as determined by\r\nthe HDB, which means that the owner does not benefit from any rises\r\nin property prices. He, in fact, suffers inflation. And once he\r\nsigns on, he cannot get out. So, he can no longer sell his flat\r\nor bequeath it. And when he passes on, the flat is taken back by\r\nthe HDB and the remaining value cashed out and given to his beneficiaries.\r\nThe new changes will increase the amount of payout, both upfront\r\nand monthly. But I suspect the other disadvantages I have outlined\r\nwill not make the enhanced scheme much more popular. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-682779b1-2fdd-4bba-a49d-0a517ac7f822\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-682779b1-2fdd-4bba-a49d-0a517ac7f822\"><!--a--></a>I, therefore, urge the\r\nGovernment to come up with further options or choices to help older Singaporeans\r\nunlock the value of their HDB flats, which will not only allow them\r\nto stay where they are, but allow greater flexibility than the current\r\nLease Buy-back Scheme. At the debate on the President's Address,\r\nI suggested a scheme which will allow Singaporeans to sell back\r\nportions of their lease to HDB. A 70-year-old couple does not need\r\na 50- or 60-year lease. If they can sell part of their lease back\r\nto HDB, and for the proceeds to be given part in cash and part paid\r\ninto CPF, that would give them a decent sum to meet immediate needs,\r\nsuch as the costs of an operation or other medical needs, as well\r\nas daily expenses. Only a portion of their lease will be valued\r\nat current prices, which means that they will still benefit from\r\nfuture property price increases and the effects of inflation are\r\nreduced. They will continue to have the option to sell the flat\r\nand buy a studio apartment, when one becomes available. Or they\r\ncan leave the flat behind for loved ones. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0d84e7c5-2148-4f69-846d-76d0604cc8e2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-0d84e7c5-2148-4f69-846d-76d0604cc8e2\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the second aspect:\r\nprivate property owners. There were two notable changes in the assistance given\r\nin this Budget. First, unlike in the past, no or little distinction\r\nis made in the benefits given to those living in different HDB types.\r\nThis is welcome, as we know from the ground that the size of a person's flat\r\nis not an accurate proxy of his financial needs. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-911e8b7c-79dc-479d-ab55-5aefa81faef4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-911e8b7c-79dc-479d-ab55-5aefa81faef4\"><!--a--></a>The second is that owners\r\nof smaller private properties, about 15% of the market, will enjoy\r\nbenefits as well. I can understand why we make distinctions for\r\nprivate homes. Those who live in larger private homes are generally\r\nconsidered wealthier, and they certainly have more options. But\r\nthere are a good number of them owned by elderly retirees who purchased\r\ntheir homes when they were considerably cheaper, and who are now\r\nin the same boat \u2212 small bank and small CPF balances. Some may argue\r\nthat if they need cash, they can sell their homes and downgrade\r\nquite comfortably. I think that is easier said than done. Again,\r\nit is a solution which forces them, in their golden years, to move\r\naway from their homes, their friends and places they are familiar\r\nwith. They have another challenge, which is this. Because of the\r\nsignificant rise in private property prices in recent years, many\r\nof them have seen a substantial\r\nincrease in the annual value of their homes, and therefore the property\r\ntax they pay. But the rise in annual values does not help them as\r\nthey derive no income from their homes and the increased tax they\r\npay is a further draw on their cash reserves. Would the Government\r\ntherefore consider a lower concessionary property tax for elderly,\r\nretired couples? It would, of course, not apply if they have other investment\r\nproperties or income. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1341</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d7a86fe8-9a87-4303-894b-9e69af80cf57\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d7a86fe8-9a87-4303-894b-9e69af80cf57\"><!--a--></a>The third specified issue\r\ndeals with improving infrastructure to help the elderly become more mobile.\r\nOne example of this is an old chestnut \u2013 lifts for overhead bridges.\r\nThis has been brought up a few times in this House.

For an elderly person,\r\nthe inability to climb the stairs of an overhead bridge means, in\r\nsome instances, taking long detours just to cross a road.

The Budget initiatives for the elderly are intended\r\nto enable an elderly person to live safely and in comfort, and when\r\nill, to encourage him to recuperate at home, with his family and\r\nloved ones around him, and this makes sense. We must, therefore,\r\nbuild more Studio Apartments, nursing homes and Eldercare Centres\r\nnear where we live, so that the elderly can have access to amenities\r\nsuch as markets, parks, and bus-stops. The Government wants to build\r\nmore of these facilities \u2013 but where are we going to put them? The\r\nanswer is obvious. We need to build them within existing housing\r\nestates. That will enable our elderly to live within the community.\r\nIt will also enable them to be more independent, since they will\r\nbe living near the amenities they obviously need. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-af1d0506-07ae-4f04-8f5d-5a7b2c39568b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-af1d0506-07ae-4f04-8f5d-5a7b2c39568b\"><!--a--></a>The problem is that some\r\nof us do not want such facilities near our homes.

Is there any doubt that there will be similar\r\nreactions if these facilities were proposed in other estates? There\r\nare too many similar examples. A couple of years ago, residents\r\nof one constituency even objected to building rental flats in their\r\nestate. The Government is in an impossible situation, as I see it:\r\n(a) if it builds without consulting residents, it will be accused\r\nof not listening; (b) if it consults, and builds, it will be accused\r\nof engaging in theatre; (c) if it consults and does not build, it will\r\nnot be able to build anything anywhere in the future. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-da8585ae-b740-48ff-919b-faa329a61118\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-da8585ae-b740-48ff-919b-faa329a61118\"><!--a--></a>The fact remains that\r\nfacilities for the elderly have to be built.

We feel deeply moved and encouraged by this.\r\nThe latest Budget emphasises the Government's determination to promote\r\neconomic growth and increase productivity. Minister Tharman also\r\npointed out that this year's Budget is a Budget for the future,\r\nthe focus being to address Singapore's long-term challenges, and\r\nnot to provide a counter-cyclic boost. Today, I would like to reflect\r\nsome problems that are being faced by our businesses using three\r\nmain points: human resource, an environment for SMEs' survival,\r\nand an inter-Ministry co-ordinating agency.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f1ec4889-d09c-4e6e-bce7-4774abfe58b1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f1ec4889-d09c-4e6e-bce7-4774abfe58b1\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e56248bb-2e19-454a-b851-1b2a721fbf4e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e56248bb-2e19-454a-b851-1b2a721fbf4e\"><!--a--></a>First, on human resource,\r\nthis is what we call a \"Move that Affects Everything\". One of the\r\nfocal points of this year's Budget is on the manpower resource policy:\r\nreducing the dependence on foreign workers, recruiting older workers,\r\nand improving productivity. Overall, we see the social benefit of\r\nthis move. As the number of foreign workers is reduced, employers\r\nwill naturally find all means to recruit local workers, including\r\nhome-makers and part-time workers. However, not all jobs could be\r\ntaken up by older workers or part-time workers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a4376304-e1a4-47f9-ba2d-1850e9e26813\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a4376304-e1a4-47f9-ba2d-1850e9e26813\"><!--a--></a>A week ago, the General\r\nAffairs Council Member of the Singapore Canvas, Chairs &amp; Tables\r\nHire Service Association shared their predicament with me. Their\r\nmembers are involved in building tentages for all kinds of occasions,\r\nincluding weddings, wakes, night markets and all kinds of celebratory\r\nevents. The working hours are very long and the work is physically\r\ndemanding. The busiest periods are on weekends and public holidays.\r\nHence, it is extremely difficult to get local workers for this industry. Currently,\r\nas the Government will be reducing the Dependency Ratio Ceiling\r\nfor S pass workers, there will be an even greater tussle for local\r\nworkers, especially young workers who are willing to undertake such\r\nmanual labour. Employers are concerned that further down the road,\r\nthey would not find workers to fulfil their orders for the National\r\nDay and the Chinese seventh month events. The Singapore Canvas, Chairs\r\n&amp; Tables Hire Service Association hopes that given these special\r\ncircumstances, those workers belonging to this trade could be grouped\r\nunder the construction sector, and prevent the reduction in foreign\r\nworkers from making a large impact on local customs and culture.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1349</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-139584bc-2811-4a24-b07b-54911a2bfc53\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-139584bc-2811-4a24-b07b-54911a2bfc53\"><!--a--></a>Another major area requiring attention\r\nwould be the training of older workers. One of our Chamber's members\r\nin the manufacturing sector had begun to encourage its older workers\r\nto attend training courses some three years ago. However, some older\r\nworkers were more reluctant to attend the training, even when courses\r\nare arranged during working hours, and all fees are sponsored by\r\nthe company. The company had no choice but to make some rearrangements\r\nand let the older workers undertake less physically demanding work.\r\nIn the end, the older workers felt that this was an insult to them\r\nand did not cooperate. Thus, when the Government has decided to\r\nreduce the dependency on foreign workers, the training of older\r\nemployees must be supported by a tripartite effort involving employees,\r\nemployers and the Government.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1aed254-d142-4886-bf3b-ae9d6e8f8257\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a1aed254-d142-4886-bf3b-ae9d6e8f8257\"><!--a--></a>I sincerely hope that\r\nin implementing the tightening in foreign worker policy, the Government\r\ncould exercise greater flexibility by considering the circumstances\r\nof each industry.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd3287a3-cf41-4260-8310-2707d51b2275\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bd3287a3-cf41-4260-8310-2707d51b2275\"><!--a--></a>Second, on SMEs: the difficulty\r\nof survival. SMEs are the most affected by this year's Budget. Although\r\nindustrial restructuring is inevitable, we should try to mnimise\r\nthe impact on social cohesion, and allow some breathing space for\r\ntraditional industries that are still very welcome. Economic development\r\nis unstoppable, but once social cohesion is gone, it would be very\r\ndifficult to get it reinstated.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9f8af665-1352-4a25-b339-8025d14dd15e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-9f8af665-1352-4a25-b339-8025d14dd15e\"><!--a--></a> In January this year,\r\nin a Mediacorp Channel 8 programme called \"Tuesday Report\", there\r\nwas a report on Nam Hin Noodles Manufacturer run by Mr Pei Guang\r\nNan. Mr Pei continues to produce different types and flavours of\r\nnoodles according to his customers' requirements. Some street hawkers have\r\nmoved into food courts but continue to use noodles made from Mr\r\nPei's shop, enabling patrons to enjoy disappearing street flavours.\r\nMr Pei's noodle shop at Balestier Road uses machines to produce noodles\r\nand is a family-run business. Although it is a small outfit, its\r\nproducts are very popular. After decades in the business, he has\r\nbecome fast friends with many of his clients. Mr Pei worries that\r\nif the Government wants to widen the road, he would have to move.\r\nIn the current rental market, he fears not being able to find a\r\nsuitable location to continue with his business, because he would\r\nface many constraints in applying for licences in a new location.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-af5066c2-c131-4f0f-b409-bd2ad12eb146\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-af5066c2-c131-4f0f-b409-bd2ad12eb146\"><!--a--></a>Singapore has many similar\r\nsmall companies plying traditional trades like that of Nam Hin Noodles Manufacturer,\r\nwhich, besides providing good food and employment opportunities,\r\nalso work hard at preserving traditional food culture. I hope that\r\nthe Government's policy-making Ministries would view things from\r\na long-term perspective, and endeavour to build Singapore into a\r\ndiverse and vibrant metropolis. Besides the MNCs and large enterprises,\r\nwe hope that the Government would spare a thought for the SMEs,\r\ninclusive of those in traditional trades, so that they could have\r\na chance at survival. Literally speaking, SMEs should be given the\r\nchance to drink soup while large enterprises are consuming the entr\u00c3\u00a9e.\r\nSMEs' existence would not only provide employment opportunities.\r\nMore importantly, they have a part to play in creating a more vibrant\r\nsociety, offering more alternatives, and increasing social cohesion.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cc5d5aa1-304d-4953-a3c2-04fb2d9bb5e9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-cc5d5aa1-304d-4953-a3c2-04fb2d9bb5e9\"><!--a--></a>Next is about escalating\r\nrentals and increasing business costs. As with previous Budgets,\r\nthe Government would roll out some welcome policies in response\r\nto the needs of the private sector, for example, providing the SME\r\nCash Grant, and helping our enterprises to restructure their operations\r\nvia the Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme (PIC). Such policies\r\nare beneficial to many local enterprises. However, the problems\r\nfaced by SMEs are the results of such policy changes. For example, JTC\r\nflatted factories were originally built to serve the needs of SMEs\r\nsince 1968, but after divestment in 2008, rentals have continued\r\nto rise. The property companies are not in the wrong. Once they\r\nare privatised, they would have to show profits to be accountable\r\nto their shareholders. But some consequences need to be borne by\r\nthe society as a whole. Could the Government provide alternatives for the SMEs and start-up\r\ncompanies? Apart from renting from large property companies, I recommend that\r\nthe Government could provide properties, not driven by commercial\r\ngain, to serve as incubating centres, to support local start-ups\r\nand SMEs. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1350</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-34259751-3fc4-4773-8e44-7e0e367c2033\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-34259751-3fc4-4773-8e44-7e0e367c2033\"><!--a--></a>Business costs are continuing\r\nto rise rapidly, and this has proven to be detrimental for some\r\ntrades. From the beginning of last year, many bookstores, including\r\nlarge international and local bookstores, have folded due to the\r\nrental problem. Those which are still in business are languishing.\r\nFollowing the closure of Borders, the Harris bookstore belonging\r\nto the Popular chain and Page One have also just shut down. Page\r\nOne's 24 overseas outlets are doing very well, but its main bookstore\r\nin Singapore has terminated operations. Another small niche bookstore,\r\nBooksActualy, had to move three times because of the rental problem,\r\nand managed to find a good spot in Tiong Bahru. However, because\r\nthis little enclave has become a popular area for shops and eateries,\r\nthe landlord also intends to increase rents.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-60328b7c-1993-4bfd-9d2c-14f6810759fd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-60328b7c-1993-4bfd-9d2c-14f6810759fd\"><!--a--></a>Bookstores are places\r\nwhere culture and literary knowledge can be transmitted. In the\r\nlarge malls in Singapore, there is very little differentiation in\r\nretail mix. Eateries and clothing shops, arcades are becoming more\r\ncommon, while it is almost impossible to find any shops to feed\r\nthe mind and the soul. This is not a healthy sign. In January, the\r\nSunbeam Theatre, the only privately-owned Cantonese opera house\r\nin Hong Kong, announced its imminent closure due to rental problems,\r\nand attracted widespread public attention. Eventually, the theatre\r\nwas preserved owing to public support and appeal. While Hong Kong\r\nis well-known for being very commercialised, it has bent over backwards\r\nto preserve such a cultural landmark. Could Singapore also consider\r\nthe long-term interests of its people by providing such a subsidy\r\nfor these more genteel and culturally-significant trades? Besides\r\nproviding Government subsidy, the community could also work together\r\nand prevent Singapore from becoming a society which pursues economic\r\ngain to the detriment of its cultural and gracious identity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-82434e0a-a21e-4b27-afef-760d537ea515\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-82434e0a-a21e-4b27-afef-760d537ea515\"><!--a--></a>Third, on inter-Ministry\r\ncooperation, solving difficulties of enterprises. More often than\r\nnot, a Government policy could involve many different Ministries.\r\nAt such time, there should be a lead agency to push through the\r\nimplementation. For example, the National Productivity and Continuing\r\nEducation Council led by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and\r\nthe SME Committee led by Minister of State Teo Ser Luck are both\r\ngood examples. The various problems faced by our enterprises would\r\ninvolve the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry,\r\nMinistry of Manpower, and many others. Hence, I do hope that there\r\ncould be one over-arching agency to facilitate the coordination.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-00ef9cb6-6484-4387-b31b-2083efce520b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-00ef9cb6-6484-4387-b31b-2083efce520b\"><!--a--></a>Allow me to cite an example\r\nrequiring a coordinating agency to take the helm. Recently, some\r\nlocal transport operators are getting very apprehensive. They are\r\nworried about manpower and space for their operations. For the first\r\ntime, the Government will be helping public transport operators\r\nto buy new buses to relieve daily congestion in public transport.\r\nBut those who will benefit are the listed companies which have already\r\nincreased bus fares eight times from July 2002 to October 2011,\r\nand revenues have increased annually. This year, the Government\r\nwill be setting aside $1.1 billion to fund the purchase of 800 buses,\r\nand this is certainly not a small amount. We hope that the bus fares\r\nwill not continue to rise. The main concern for school bus companies\r\nand private bus operators is that 800 new buses would require more\r\nthan 1,000 bus drivers. Where are these qualified drivers going\r\nto come from? If public buses need manpower, and they are unable\r\nto recruit foreign workers, then the school bus companies and private\r\nbus companies would face an even more challenging task in getting\r\nthe drivers they need. Moreover, these companies stand to lose not\r\nonly their qualified drivers to the public bus operators, but face\r\na double whammy of recruiting fewer foreign workers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-686d2f5f-7f60-41e1-b62b-c83db1553f72\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-686d2f5f-7f60-41e1-b62b-c83db1553f72\"><!--a--></a>Last November, we arranged\r\nfor a ministerial dialogue, and invited 14 trade association members\r\nto take part. They hoped that the Government could open up some\r\nparking space for the benefit of the private bus operators. A representative\r\nfrom the Express Bus Agencies Association said that the express bus\r\nterminal at Beach Road was far too small, and therefore unable to\r\naccommodate the requirements of passengers. Currently, the related\r\nMinistry had installed surveillance cameras at the Golden Mile Complex express bus\r\nstand to control the parking of buses there. The express bus drivers\r\nhad been fined heavily. One fine is $70, and with more of such fines,\r\nthe companies' costs will go up. Participants at the dialogue suggested\r\nthat the Government allocate an area in Geylang Lorong 1 near the\r\nPeople's Association for an express bus terminal, to resolve the\r\novercrowding at the express bus stops and the fines for express\r\nbus drivers. Manpower shortage, the lack of a place to operate,\r\nincreasing fines \u2013 these are all problems which concern three Ministries,\r\nnamely the Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Transport, and the\r\nMinistry of National Development. The companies in question are\r\nstill waiting for an appropriate solution.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1351</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-21339c1b-9ee4-4dae-8b66-af07949462e2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-21339c1b-9ee4-4dae-8b66-af07949462e2\"><!--a--></a>In summary, as I have\r\ndescribed, local enterprises, particularly the SMEs, will face a\r\ngreat deal of difficulties in the period of restructuring.

Social workers\r\nand other helping professionals, such as counsellors, are in the\r\nfrontline of forging the inclusive society and they have to be empowered\r\nto do it. We have long treated social workers like fire-fighters\r\nsquelching bush fires and told them to thrive on the passion to\r\nserve. We need to change our model. Passion is good and well, but\r\nsocial workers need to be recognised as talents deserving fair compensation,\r\nsocial respect, and optimal workloads.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-20d26d6f-c7a5-421e-9189-4c1d1e7272ad\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-20d26d6f-c7a5-421e-9189-4c1d1e7272ad\"><!--a--></a>The starting salary of\r\nhelping professionals, particularly social workers, is not sending\r\nthe right message that social work is a vocation deserving of high\r\nsocial respect.

According to the National Council\r\nof Social Services, the expected starting salary of social workers\r\nranges from $2,550 to $2,750. In comparison, the starting salary\r\nrange of a degree-holding teacher begins above the social worker\r\nstarting salary range, at $2,770, and tops off at $3,250 for an\r\nHonours degree. This is almost 20% above an Honours degree-holding\r\nsocial worker's pay. Social workers are more like teachers in nature.\r\nSocial workers help the vulnerable pick up valuable life skills\r\nand attitudes so that they can help realise their own potential\r\nhuman capital.

Faced with better pay and opportunities elsewhere, social\r\nworkers have to make a painful decision to leave the frontline and\r\nmore sadly their passions, for better jobs to serve their own family\r\nneeds.

We must be careful that the silver housing policy does\r\nnot diminish the transmission of social and cultural values. Already,\r\nthe proportion of younger married couples who prefer to live with\r\nor near their parents has dropped from 73% in 2003 to 53% in 2008,\r\nin just five years.

This is a welcome move.\r\nBut on the back of this, we as a country and a society will have\r\nto decide what level of healthcare and to what extent healthcare\r\nwould be considered humane and acceptable to everyone in the population.\r\nWe are not just talking about basic healthcare in our country, and\r\nwhen we are comparing affordability across different healthcare\r\nsystems, it is very important for us not just to look at costs and\r\ncoverage at base value but to really scrutinise the type of healthcare\r\nand the quality of the healthcare that is delivered.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f32d211b-164f-4b51-9cee-176db8a59303\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f32d211b-164f-4b51-9cee-176db8a59303\"><!--a--></a> When we talk about medical\r\nprogress, there are many choices that have to be made.

Now, the first pill, which is more convenient,\r\ncosts four to five times that of the other pill. The question then\r\nremains who has to pay for this increase in cost.

The other area\r\nto improve upon is the execution and the delivery of the many schemes\r\nto help SMEs.

On the other hand,\r\nthey can really do with some help with recruitment. Would the Government\r\nconsider setting up a centralised agency to help companies with\r\nlabour shortage to match-make with those local workers? Yes, there\r\nis a job directory on WDA's website which listed both public and\r\nprivate sector job portals. However, this is only accessible to\r\nthe educated and computer-savvy.

I strongly urge the Government to take a resolute step\r\nto make accreditation mandatory \u2013 only cleaning companies which\r\nhave accreditation are to be used.

This\r\nwould motivate the elderly to earn investments to their health.\r\nAlthough there are localised reward schemes to promote certain programmes,\r\nsuch as the Northwest CDC Brisk Walk Club, I feel that a more broad-based\r\nreward scheme that promotes healthy lifestyle activities can be\r\nimplemented to further enhance our health promotion efforts. The\r\nGovernment should also consider measures to support and incentivise\r\ninnovation in providing health support services using technology.\r\nRecently, <em class=\"ph i\">The </em>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">Straits Times</em> reported about telemedicine.\r\nWe should also encourage initiatives in the medical sector to support\r\nthe elderly living at home in e-ordering medicines, e-visiting GPs,\r\nmanaging dietary needs and personal health.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8f874989-02aa-441e-a761-1a85b64a3271\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-8f874989-02aa-441e-a761-1a85b64a3271\"><!--a--></a>Sir, before I end my speech,\r\nas mentioned in my speech in Malay, I am puzzled by what was said\r\nby the hon.

Over the last decade, our society faced\r\nmany challenges, such as widening income inequality, rising inflation\r\nand slower social mobility. Wages of low and lower middle income\r\nearners have stagnated or grew much slower than that of our highest\r\nincome earners. Our over reliance on market-driven policies has\r\nresulted in deficiencies in the provision of social goods. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b15ab776-f504-4918-92af-e16e1c4423ef\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b15ab776-f504-4918-92af-e16e1c4423ef\"><!--a--></a>Refocusing on the weak,\r\ndisabled and elderly amongst us is timely. The Government has to\r\nstep up to mitigate the adverse effects of the widening income inequality\r\nby proactively providing essential social goods and services. This\r\nBudget is a first step. Moving forward, we need to tread between\r\ngrowth and equity; between individual's and society's responsibility.\r\nHow far will we go in our journey to be inclusive? How much do we\r\nprovide for in elderly care and medical costs? What is affordable\r\npublic housing? What levels of social security are we comfortable\r\nwith?

There are a number of assistance\r\nschemes in this Budget for SMEs. We have not been short of schemes\r\nfor SMEs in the past, especially in the form of grants. While these\r\ncan provide some slight help, given the challenging environment\r\nSMEs operate in, they are like aspirins for short-term pain relief.\r\nWe need to look deeper beyond assistances and tackle directly the\r\nimportant issues confronting SMEs. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cf4afe57-352e-4c6d-9560-369c45791a47\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-cf4afe57-352e-4c6d-9560-369c45791a47\"><!--a--></a>In preparing for this\r\nsection on SMEs, I recall a hike I made into the primary rainforest\r\nof Sarawak some years ago.

SMEs operate in challenging environments.\r\nIndustrial rent increased at more than three times inflation rate\r\nat 16% last year. This increase is the highest level in the past\r\n14 years. Retail rent rates have risen steadily too. Industrial\r\nand retail spaces are now dominated by REITS. I join Members Inderjit\r\nSingh and Mr Teo Siong Seng to echo my concerns about the effects\r\nof a decade of the proliferation of REITS on rent. Could retail\r\nrent increases be partly driven by Retail REITS enhancing their\r\nnegotiation position given common market practice that they can\r\nobtain the retailer's gross retail turnover data?

For example, in the USA, two-thirds of the\r\nnation's total income gains from 2002 to 2007 flowed to the top\r\n1% of US households, and that top 1% held a larger share of income\r\nin 2007 than at any time since 1928, according to the Centre on\r\nBudget and Priority Policies' Report dated 9 September 2009. USA\r\ntoday has a Gini coefficient of 0.45. In Singapore, we are facing\r\nthis issue.

Some have even experienced earning declines,\r\nas reported in <em class=\"ph i\">The Straits Times</em> on 7 February 2012, that\r\nin 2000, the median gross wage for cleaners and labourers was at\r\n$1,277.

Singapore today\r\nhas the highest proportion of millionaires \u2013 one in six households.\r\nSome have highlighted that Singapore, as a small economy, is more\r\nsusceptible to global trends and influences and, hence, the more\r\npronounced rising inequality. But what can we do to manage this\r\ninequality better? While we can add more to smoothen out the path\r\nfor greater mobility, as Deputy Prime Minister Tharman rightly pointed\r\nout, it will get more difficult to keep up this mobility in the\r\nyears to come. There is therefore a need to provide more direct help\r\nfor the average person to tackle the issue of cost of living. We\r\nneed to ensure that there is space for lower-skilled or retired\r\nSingaporeans to make a living and enjoy the fruits of the nation's\r\nwealth.

It is the notion of \"satisficing\"\r\nrather than satisfying. Let us talk about floods, for example. One\r\nkey piece of data provides perspective \u2013 our PUB has done an incredible\r\njob of reducing the flood-prone area from 3,200 hectares in the\r\n1970s to 56 hectares today and only 40 hectares by next year.

In other words, high risk can occur\r\neither from frequent floods that have relatively limited consequences\r\nor from rare floods that have great consequences. The first are\r\nthe sorts of floods in Singapore last year, wet stores and feet\r\nfor half an hour in Orchard Road; and the second, far more disastrous,\r\nwith severe costs in life and homes, such as the 2005 floods in\r\nNew Orleans. It is true that Singapore may be \"high risk\" under\r\nthis calculation but to just trust the final number without appreciating\r\nthe type of risk is a mistake.

Sir, at this juncture, let me share with Members the experience\r\nof North West CDC in encouraging companies and individuals to make\r\nmonthly donations of at least $100 per month to help our needy. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-21189966-ef3e-4fcb-a4e0-e10d34aaa36b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-21189966-ef3e-4fcb-a4e0-e10d34aaa36b\"><!--a--></a>In May 2008, North West\r\nCDC started the Club-100 @ North West to foster philanthropy spirit among\r\nSingaporeans. We identified a cause for the donations and conveyed\r\nthe message that all donations will go towards the North West Food\r\nAid Fund which provides food rations and vouchers to over 700 needy\r\nhouseholds monthly. To date, we are pleased to report that Club-100\r\n@ North West has 300 members, contributing half a million dollars\r\na year to help our needy.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-95356a5d-c9ab-44d4-951f-73ab1e2df104\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-95356a5d-c9ab-44d4-951f-73ab1e2df104\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Government can\r\ndo more to encourage corporate social responsibility and philanthropy. Besides\r\nproviding the 2.5 times income tax exemption, I would urge the Government\r\nto provide a one-to-one matching grant subject to a certain cap\r\nfor donations made to VWOs with Charity or IPC status. At the same\r\ntime, the Government can be a VWO venture capitalist to provide\r\nseed money for VWO start-ups. More tax exemption can also be provided\r\nto encourage individuals to make monthly donations. The returns\r\nfor such investment will be a more caring society with many helping\r\nhands.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3f4c8179-0d69-402c-8756-471c889b8410\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-3f4c8179-0d69-402c-8756-471c889b8410\"><!--a--></a>(3) Supporting 3Ps efforts\r\nto build a caring community.
