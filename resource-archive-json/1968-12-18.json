The\r\n\r\nregulations  should also be amended and harsh  action\r\n\r\nshould not be taken to force the tenants to move out.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Board ask a tenant to buy a flat at\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh Housing Estate and he says he is not  able\r\n\r\nto  buy  it.

The  satellite town of Toa  Payoh  alone\r\n\r\nwill  have  around 250,000 persons. A  population  of\r\n\r\nthis  size will sorely tax the hospital which  has  a\r\n\r\ntotal  capacity  of only 396 beds.

This is already being done in many  areas;\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is  not  done,  the  reason  is  the  non-\r\n\r\navailability of labour and funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many housing estates, individual houses are\r\n\r\noccupied gradually while physical construction of the\r\n\r\nestate   is   still  in  progress.  More  often   the\r\n\r\noccupation  of houses in such estates is before  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  a certificate of fitness by the  competent\r\n\r\nbuilding authority. Because of building operations in\r\n\r\nprogress in other parts of the estate, there is often\r\n\r\nall  the  accumulation of refuse,  lumber  and  other\r\n\r\nmaterial usually present in a developing estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual practice is to require the developer to\r\n\r\nprovide  the maintenance and cleansing service  while\r\n\r\nbuilding operations are in progress. It will  not  be\r\n\r\npractical  until an estate is occupied  and  building\r\n\r\noperations  have  ceased and the  drains,  pavements,\r\n\r\nsidewalks, etc, are properly completed before  it  is\r\n\r\ntaken over for cleansing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has, however, to be emphasised that the streets\r\n\r\nin such private housing estates and drains should, by\r\n\r\nand  large, remain in a clean and sanitary state,  as\r\n\r\nthese  often are areas with limited movement  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public. A high standard of sanitary care  by\r\n\r\nthe  residents will ensure that both the streets and\r\n\r\ndrains are kept clean and free of refuse and  filth.\r\n\r\nThis,  however, is not always so and the co-operation\r\n\r\nof householders is often needed to ensure this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars of incidence)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  yesterday I outlined a situation which may  not\r\n\r\ninconveniently persuade our populace  to  infer  that\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional protection that a person may  not\r\n\r\nbe  kept  in custody by the police for more  than  24\r\n\r\nhours  without bringing him before the court is being\r\n\r\nevaded  by  the  apprehension of  persons  under  the\r\n\r\ndetention  laws, namely, the Criminal Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)   Ordinance,   under   which   a   person\r\n\r\napprehended may be kept in custody for more  than  24\r\n\r\nhours.   Admittedly   this   occurs   after   certain\r\n\r\nprecautions have been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to a question which I submitted to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  oral  answer,  I  learned  that  1,408\r\n\r\npersons had been arrested for the period 1st January,\r\n\r\n1967,  to  30th June, 1968, of whom as  many  as  438\r\n\r\npersons were subsequently charged in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the detention laws provide that a police\r\n\r\nofficer  may,  without warrant, arrest and  detain  a\r\n\r\nperson  pending  inquiry in respect of  whom  he  has\r\n\r\nreason to believe that there are grounds which  would\r\n\r\njustify  the detention of such person under a certain\r\n\r\nsection  in  the Ordinance. The grounds  which  would\r\n\r\njustify the detention of such a person would  be  the\r\n\r\nperson's  association with activities of  a  criminal\r\n\r\nnature  and  that the person's detention  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of public safety, peace and good order.  In\r\n\r\nother words, in my view, before this exceptional  law\r\n\r\nis  enforced, the police authorities would first have\r\n\r\nsufficient  recorded information that the person  has\r\n\r\nbeen  involved in criminal activities for a  span  of\r\n\r\ntime,   because  the  word  \"association\"   certainly\r\n\r\nimplies  a  prolonged association with such  type  of\r\n\r\nactivities.   Secondly,   that   the   police    have\r\n\r\ninsufficient  evidence to support the  charge  before\r\n\r\nthe  court, and that is why the person is apprehended\r\n\r\nfor  detention.  If  that is so, and  if  the  police\r\n\r\nauthorities  have  complied with these  requirements,\r\n\r\nwhy  do  they find it convenient to charge the person\r\n\r\nin court a few days after his apprehension?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the apprehension of a person under the\r\n\r\ndetention laws is to appear credible to the populace,\r\n\r\nthen it must demonstrate a deliberateness which comes\r\n\r\nafter  a  careful and responsible assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nperson's danger to society. But the populace will not\r\n\r\nsee  this credibility if persons are apprehended with\r\n\r\nease   and  a  few  days  later  charged  in   court,\r\n\r\nespecially  if the figures revealed that as  many  as\r\n\r\n396  persons  out  of 420 charged  in  court  pleaded\r\n\r\nguilty.  A  lot of unpleasant questions  arise,  Sir.\r\n\r\nWould  these persons have pleaded guilty if  they  in\r\n\r\nfact  had  been  apprehended under the  laws  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  which guaranteed their being in custody  for\r\n\r\nonly  24 hours? Or is it because of their having been\r\n\r\nin  custody for more than 24 hours - for three, four,\r\n\r\nfive  or  six  days  - which provided  them  with  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  introspection and  repentance  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they pleaded guilty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point of all these observations is simply\r\n\r\nthis.  There  are 58 of us here in this Chamber,  all\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the People's Action Party.  That  being\r\n\r\nthe  case,  in  my view, I say that it is  absolutely\r\n\r\nimperative  that this Government give the  people  no\r\n\r\nreason - none at all - at any time to suspect that it\r\n\r\nis  prepared to ignore constitutionalism or  that  it\r\n\r\ncan afford to dispense with the fundamental rights of\r\n\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  associate myself with the points raised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Delta yesterday evening  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  adjourned.

As  stated by the Finance Minister,  they\r\n\r\nare  already  committed to put their capital  in  our\r\n\r\nRepublic to set up industries which are mainly export-\r\n\r\noriented.   But   the  greatest   drawback   to   the\r\n\r\nrealisation  and  fruition of  these  export-oriented\r\n\r\nindustries,  which  can  employ  many  thousands   of\r\n\r\nworkers,  is  the  dearth  of  trained  manpower   at\r\n\r\nprofessional, technician and craft levels,  and  our\r\n\r\ninability to supply these trained men at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to the fact that his Ministry has called up every graduate within the age group from the three levels of technical education to join national service as soon as they have passed out from the institutions. The Minister will agree that\r\n\r\nthe calling up of these graduates to undergo national\r\n\r\nservice  training  is  a  great  wastage  of  trained\r\n\r\nmanpower  which, although non-productive, is  vitally\r\n\r\nessential. If these graduates are called up  as  soon\r\n\r\nas  they  pass  out,  they  will  lose  much  of  the\r\n\r\ntheoretical  and academic knowledge which  they  have\r\n\r\nacquired in their three or four years of education in\r\n\r\nthe  higher institutions of learning after two  years\r\n\r\nof national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully endorse the Government's policy that all\r\n\r\nable-bodied  young men of all types of  training  and\r\n\r\neducational standards within the age group should  be\r\n\r\ntrained  and called up for national service. But  our\r\n\r\nGovernment must make a more pragmatic approach to the\r\n\r\nproblem  of defence and economic growth as  they  are\r\n\r\ncomplementary to each other in our national survival.\r\n\r\nWe  must  strike a balance. In other words, a certain\r\n\r\npercentage  of the technical graduates at  the  three\r\n\r\nlevels of training should be released to build up the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustries during the three critical years,  so  that\r\n\r\nby  the  end of 1971 these industries will be  viable\r\n\r\nand will be able to expand to provide more job opport\r\n\r\nunities for released national service men and school-\r\n\r\nleavers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here the Singapore Polytechnic Annual Report\r\n\r\nfor 1967-1968. If you turn to page 39, you will find\r\n\r\nthat during the years 1961 to 1968, we produced only 502   \r\n\r\nprofessional   graduates,   1,043   technician\r\n\r\ngraduates,  and 520 craft graduates. In other  words -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

This  is  a  ridiculous\r\n\r\nsituation when we talk of industrialisalion. In  view\r\n\r\nof the foregoing situation facing Singapore today,  I\r\n\r\nwould  appeal to the Minister to reconsider  relaxing\r\n\r\nhis  present  policy, i.e., whether  he  would  allow\r\n\r\ngraduates  of technical institutions within  the  age\r\n\r\ngroup who can get employment to remain at their  jobs\r\n\r\nbut  to  do  part-time instead of full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice training, as some of these graduates are  the\r\n\r\nsole breadwinners of their family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, before taking up the issues which  were\r\n\r\nraised by Members yesterday and today, may I take the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  touch  briefly  on  one  item  which\r\n\r\nappears  in  the  Budget  Estimates  under  both  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Communications  and  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nDefence,   namely,  the  subject  of   good   conduct\r\n\r\nallowance.  I would like tu congratulate  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon Gardens on having very arduously  gone\r\n\r\nthrough this thick book of Estimates to find and draw\r\n\r\nattention to this item which has appeared year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin and year out in the past without any Member making\r\n\r\nany  reference to it. We all agree with him  that  as\r\n\r\ncivil  servants,  and more so as  policemen  who  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  uphold law and order in  this  country,\r\n\r\nthey  are  expected to show good conduct and,  having\r\n\r\nconducted  themselves well, there is  no  reason  why\r\n\r\nthey  should be paid an allowance over and above what\r\n\r\nthey  should  normally get. However,  I  am  glad  to\r\n\r\ninform  this  House  that  in  time  this  item  will\r\n\r\ndisappear.  I  have been delving into the  historical\r\n\r\npast  to  find  out the whys and wherefores  of  this\r\n\r\nallowance being paid, but I regret to report  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  not been able to find any reason for it at all,\r\n\r\nexcept   that,  in  looking  through  the  files,   I\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  the allowance is an  incentive  for\r\n\r\npolicemen  not to sleep at their posts! I  think  the\r\n\r\npresent  lot of policemen need no incentive  to  stay\r\n\r\nawake at their posts. I am glad to report that since 1965 we have not been\r\n\r\npaying this allowance at all. As the years go by, the\r\n\r\nprovision  for this allowance will be less and  less,\r\n\r\nand ultimately there will be none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have referred to the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens,  I  may as well take up the issue  which  he\r\n\r\nraised  yesterday and again today. His fear  is  that\r\n\r\nthe   constitutional  rights  of  the   citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  not  be  protected  because  we  are\r\n\r\nabusing  the  powers that we have under  the  special\r\n\r\ndetention  laws  to detain people for  more  than  24\r\n\r\nhours  and  then bring them to court. I  think  every\r\n\r\nMember  in this House is as zealous as he is  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  we  protect the constitutional  rights  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens. I dare not say that the powers given  under\r\n\r\nthe  special  detention laws have  not  been  abused.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  in  their  zest  to  rid  this  country   of\r\n\r\nundesirable  elements, officers in the  police  force\r\n\r\nmay have made use of these powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can assure the Member that every precaution\r\n\r\nhas  been and will be taken to see that advantage  is\r\n\r\nnot taken of the special detention laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member seems to impute that 438 persons were\r\n\r\ncharged  after detention of 24 hours.  I  doubt  that\r\n\r\nvery  much,  Sir. Probably a majority  of  them  were\r\n\r\ncharged within 24 hours. But I do wish to assure  him\r\n\r\nand  the  House that I will take every precaution  to\r\n\r\nsee that advantage is not taken of the special powers\r\n\r\nunder the detention laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Mount-batten who wants to\r\n\r\nknow why there is no provision under the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Interior  and  Defence to  celebrate  our  150th\r\n\r\nanniversary  next year, all I can  say  is  that  the\r\n\r\nplanning  and  co-ordination for the  celebration  of\r\n\r\nthis  anniversary come under the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\nThat is why there is no provision under my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang claims that members of the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps are given only one suit  of  uniform\r\n\r\neach. I wish to correct him. They are given two suits\r\n\r\nof  uniform. They are not given transport  allowance.\r\n\r\nBut  they  can  claim whatever money  they  spent  on\r\n\r\ntransport from the Commandant of the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta asked four questions. I can say\r\n\r\nthat  she  is  in very good company indeed  when  she\r\n\r\nwants  to  know how long the Australians are  staying\r\n\r\nhere.  I  think all of us want to know that. I  would\r\n\r\nanswer  the question if I could, and things would  be\r\n\r\nmade  much  easier for us because we could then  plan\r\n\r\nour defence with more precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other question is: can we fill the\r\n\r\nvacuum left by the British military withdrawal? I  do\r\n\r\nnot believe any nation in Southeast Asia can fill the\r\n\r\nvacuum  left  by  the British. In fact,  I  feel  the\r\n\r\nBritish  have  probably calculated that  they  cannot\r\n\r\nhold their position in Southeast Asia as well as they\r\n\r\ncould before, and that is one of the reasons why they\r\n\r\nare leaving. As regards the filling of the vacuum, we\r\n\r\nare  building our armed forces in order to fulfil our\r\n\r\nshare  in trying to fill that vacuum, and that vacuum\r\n\r\ncan  only be filled either by a major power or by all\r\n\r\nthe nations in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, extending as far as Australia and New\r\n\r\nZealand, working together in concert for the security\r\n\r\nof  this  region. We are taking every step to prepare\r\n\r\nourselves  in  order to play our part when  the  time\r\n\r\ncomes  when  all these nations can work together  for\r\n\r\npeace and stability in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether there is any\r\n\r\npossibility   of   lowering  the  age   of   national\r\n\r\nconscripts.  In the foreseeable future, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not think there is a likelihood  of  our\r\n\r\nlowering  the age of national conscripts. I  say  \"in\r\n\r\nthe  foreseeable  future\", but if  anything  untoward\r\n\r\nhappens,  then we have got to find ways and means  of\r\n\r\nincreasing our manpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta also wants to know whether the\r\n\r\nwomen's  defence  force are working  under  the  same\r\n\r\nconditions as the men. I do not know what  she  means\r\n\r\nby  working under the same conditions. They  are  not\r\n\r\ngiven  the same kind of training physically. Our  men\r\n\r\nconscripts  have got to go through a  very  strenuous\r\n\r\ncourse  of  basic training which taxes them  mentally\r\n\r\nand  physically to the utmost. I do not think we  can\r\n\r\nequate women with men here. Therefore, women are  not\r\n\r\ngiven  this training. But as regards pay, where  they\r\n\r\ndo  the same kind of work we consider them equal  and\r\n\r\nhave given them equal pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley alleges that the dearth\r\n\r\nof  manpower to help us in our economic growth is due\r\n\r\nto  the national call-up. I cannot agree with him. He\r\n\r\nsays that technical graduates of the Polytechnic  and\r\n\r\nthe University have been called up by my Ministry. If\r\n\r\nit  had  been so, my men and I would not  be  running\r\n\r\naround today trying to find technical men to man  the\r\n\r\npositions  that  we  have. Only  graduates  who  have\r\n\r\ngraduated  since  1967 have been called  up.  So  the\r\n\r\nfigures  he  mentioned  of 502 professional  men  and\r\n\r\n1,043  technicians  -  I  did  not  catch  how   many\r\n\r\ncraftsmen  there were - the majority of them  are  in\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards reserving a proportion of these graduates\r\n\r\nto  help  in our industrial growth, I cannot  promise\r\n\r\nhim that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are at the very outset of our  build-up.\r\n\r\nHere  again  it is a question of priority -  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth or defence capability. I would like Members to\r\n\r\nthink  that without this defence build-up, there  may\r\n\r\ncome a time when all the economic growth in the world\r\n\r\nwill not stand us in good stead, because we would  be\r\n\r\ncaptured and it would be too late to regret  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  given priority to our defence  build-up\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered one of my\r\n\r\nquestions. I said that the salary paid to members  of\r\n\r\nthe women's defence force is different from that paid\r\n\r\nto  the men serving in the armed forces. I understand\r\n\r\nthat  when  women were called up by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence,  there was a stipulation that they would  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  same pay as the men serving in the  armed\r\n\r\nforces and that their training may bc different. I am\r\n\r\nraising  this  point  because a few  members  of  the\r\n\r\nwomen's  defence force have complained to me of  this\r\n\r\nanomaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister for Defence\r\n\r\nwhether  the  strength of the women's defence  force\r\n\r\nwill be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that women\r\n\r\nare paid the same salary as the men if they are doing\r\n\r\nthe  same kind of work.

It is mainly due to the support and\r\n\r\ncooperation  of  our people because  they  know  that\r\n\r\npatriotism  and  defence of  the  country  are  their\r\n\r\nbounden   duties.  But  I  wish  to   raise   certain\r\n\r\ncomplaints  about the Central Manpower Base.  I  have\r\n\r\nrecently   received  complaints  from   parents   who\r\n\r\ncomplained  that  the efficiency of this  office  was\r\n\r\nvery  poor. They also said that the officials of this\r\n\r\noffice adopted a bad attitude towards their work. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  conscripts who went  to  register  at  the\r\n\r\noffice had to wait from 8 a.m, to 12 noon before they\r\n\r\nwere  called  up  for  actual registration.  This  is\r\n\r\nundeniably too long a time to expect the boys to  get\r\n\r\nregistered.  I would like the Minister  to  urge  the\r\n\r\noffice  to  improve  the system of  registration, if\r\n\r\nthere is no time, then another day should be allotted\r\n\r\nto the youths to be registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about parents accompanying their\r\n\r\nchildren  to get registered. We all know  that  women\r\n\r\nare  very  concerned  with their  children.  National\r\n\r\nservice  was  introduced only recently in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBefore  this,  the people did not know what  national\r\n\r\nservice  was all about. When they went to the office,\r\n\r\nthe  officials there did not welcome them. This  kind\r\n\r\nof attitude is not right. I feel that the people need\r\n\r\nco-operation from the officers concerned so that they\r\n\r\nmay have a favourable impression of national service,\r\n\r\nour  Government, our political institutions, and  our\r\n\r\ncountry as well. I feel that when parents bring their\r\n\r\nchildren  along  to get registered  at  the  National\r\n\r\nService  Office,  they  should  be  well  treated.  A\r\n\r\nwaiting  room  should be provided for  them.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  they  are all standing around.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can consider my points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the\r\n\r\ninformation of Members, I would like to say that  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  of  registration takes  quite  some  time,\r\n\r\nlargely  because  there are a  lot  of  tests  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  and  a lot of information to be sought  from\r\n\r\nconscripts. I will briefly give the procedure that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational conscript is expected to go through and  the\r\n\r\ntime taken. There are several stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is documentation. This requires about 40\r\n\r\nminutes  per person. After this, there is an aptitude\r\n\r\ntest  which  takes one and a half hours  per  person.\r\n\r\nThis  aptitude test is to find Out what the  national\r\n\r\nconscript is fitted for technical, combat or for  the\r\n\r\nvarious  vocations that we have in the armed  forces.\r\n\r\nThen  there  is  a language proficiency  test  and  a\r\n\r\npersonal interview which require about 20 minutes per\r\n\r\nperson. Therefore, all in all, it takes about two and\r\n\r\na  half  hours for each conscript. So it is  expected\r\n\r\nthat   every  conscript  who  presents  himself   for\r\n\r\nregistration has to wait quite some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, 400 people are called up a day. When\r\n\r\nwe   first  started  conscription  and  call-up,  the\r\n\r\nparents  who  accompanied these youths  were  allowed\r\n\r\ninto  the  camp, but after some experience of  it  we\r\n\r\nfound   that  it  delayed  the  interview   and   the\r\n\r\nregistration  itself because of  the  limited  space.\r\n\r\nHence,  parents are now not allowed inside the  camp.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  we  do not have sufficient  space  to\r\n\r\nprovide  places  for these parents  to  sit.  We  are\r\n\r\ntrying to find whether we can make use of the canteen\r\n\r\nof   the  People's  Association,  which  is  situated\r\n\r\nnearby, for the parents to wait for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself do not understand what the Member meant\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said that the staff of the Central Manpower\r\n\r\nBase  have not treated the mothers well. Does he mean\r\n\r\nthat they do not allow the mothers to accompany their\r\n\r\nchildren  when  they  go  through  these  stages   of\r\n\r\ninterview, or does he mean that they were asked to go\r\n\r\naway?

Perhaps  there\r\n\r\nis  insufficient space because every day  400  youths\r\n\r\nhave  to be registered and including the parents  who\r\n\r\naccompany their children, it will come to 700 or  800\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nthis   matter  and,  if  possible,  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nsituation by providing facilities for the parents  to\r\n\r\nwait for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the presence of\r\n\r\nparents  will  interfere with the  registration  and,\r\n\r\nfurthermore,  there  is  a limitation  of  space.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we are trying to see whether we can  provide\r\n\r\nwaiting space for the parents. But I believe, Sir, if\r\n\r\nwe  go to the secondary schools where the youths  are\r\n\r\nregistered - they are much younger than those who are\r\n\r\nbeing  called up we do not find parents holding their\r\n\r\nsons'  hands when they go for registration. I  expect\r\n\r\nvery  soon that parents will treat their children  in\r\n\r\nthe same way as those being registered in the schools\r\n\r\nand we will not have parents holding their children's\r\n\r\nhands when they go for registration. While trying  to\r\n\r\nmake  it as comfortable as possible for those parents\r\n\r\nwho  still  have doubts whether their  children  have\r\n\r\ngrown  up  or not, I think it is a question  of  time\r\n\r\nbefore the necessity for providing waiting space  for\r\n\r\nparents does not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  agree  with what the Minister  has  said,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  there  are  complaints  there  must   be\r\n\r\nproblems  involved. If problems arise,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nmust  try  to  solve them. We can always  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of youths to be registered from 400 to 300 per\r\n\r\nday and the time for waiting will be shortened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only natural that parents accompany their\r\n\r\nchildren   to  the  registration  centre.  Even   the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  accompany his son to the  centre  for\r\n\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The translation of the Member's\r\n\r\nspeech  did  not come through quite well.

But it is my considered opinion that  very\r\n\r\nsoon there will be no more parents accompanying their\r\n\r\nchildren there.

When they deal with  an\r\n\r\nemergency  case, they are rather slow in their  work.\r\n\r\nWhen an emergency case occurs, they merely go to  the\r\n\r\nspot and take a look at it only. When they arrive  at\r\n\r\nthe  spot,  the evildoers have already escaped.  They\r\n\r\nare  too slow to rise to the occasion. Although  they\r\n\r\nare  there  in full force, they are still  unable  to\r\n\r\narrest  the  culprits. When a police  patrol  car  is\r\n\r\nsummoned, it does not go to the spot in time.  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not know the route to the  scene  of\r\n\r\nthe  incident or the locality of the incident?  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think this is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that when members of the public\r\n\r\nsummon  a  police patrol car, the car, while  on  its\r\n\r\nway,   will  sound  its  siren.

If the patrol car sounds\r\n\r\nthe siren in order to warn on-coming traffic, I would\r\n\r\nsuggest a special type of light be installed  in  it,\r\n\r\nand  whenever it signals this light, road users  will\r\n\r\nthen make way for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are some members of the police force, especially those in the lower ranks, who still adopt the colonial attitude. One night I went to a police station to speak on behalf of a resident who broke certain traffic rules. The police officers on duty seemed to be very rude to\r\n\r\nmembers of public. They should have been courteous to\r\n\r\nthem, otherwise the public will have a bad impression\r\n\r\nof our police force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about a person who was detained by\r\n\r\nthe police for eight hours because they wanted him to\r\n\r\nact  as a witness and to co-operate with them.  After\r\n\r\nhaving  been  detained for so  many  hours  and  also\r\n\r\nbecause he was feeling hungry, do you think he  would\r\n\r\ncooperate  with  the police? I feel that  the  police\r\n\r\nshould  be  polite and courteous to the public.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  friendly, dedicated and kind.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthis is also the aim of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not correct for me to criticise the police\r\n\r\nforce.  Perhaps the people will say that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Paya  Lebar is not satisfied with anything.  Now\r\n\r\nlet  me  give  credit where it is due to  the  police\r\n\r\nforce.  I  would  like to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  the plight of the bereaved families  of\r\n\r\nthose police officers who have sacrificed their lives\r\n\r\nin  the course of their duties. I wonder whether  any\r\n\r\ncompensation  or  pension is given  to  the  bereaved\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I wish to touch on one subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has said that the\r\n\r\npolicemen are proud but I do not agree with  him.  As\r\n\r\nfar as I am aware, they are not arrogant at all. Some\r\n\r\nofficers  in charge of police stations are good,  but\r\n\r\nothers are not so. For example, last Saturday at 1.00\r\n\r\np.m, a  resident of my constituency came to  me  and\r\n\r\nsaid  that four of his sons had been arrested by  the\r\n\r\npolice. Their ages were 27, 25, 21 and 17 years.  The\r\n\r\nyoungest child was still schooling. I therefore  went\r\n\r\nwith the father to the police station. The officer in\r\n\r\ncharge,  Mr Chin, was out at the time. It was  about 3.00 p.m., or 4.00 p.m. \r\n\r\nI did not know that the 'four\r\n\r\nsons had been arrested by Mr Chin. He was 'arrogant.\r\n\r\nI do not know why. I cannot say whether he recognised\r\n\r\nme  or not. His colleagues introduced -me to him'  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Ulu Pandan. His manners  were  very,\r\n\r\nvery  arrogant  indeed. He did  not  even  smile.  He\r\n\r\ntreated  me as if I were a culprit. This attitude  on\r\n\r\nthe   part   of  such  a  high-ranking   officer   is\r\n\r\nmeaningless. Even a Superintendent of Police does not\r\n\r\nbehave  like this. What is the use of employing  such\r\n\r\nan officer who ill-treats the people? He arrested the\r\n\r\nfour  brothers  with the use of force. He  threatened\r\n\r\nthe  youngest boy with a gun and knife to answer  his\r\n\r\nquestion,  \"Tell me whether you have associated  with\r\n\r\nbad people.\" I-Ic made it look as if he was going  to\r\n\r\nshoot  the  boy. This is very bad. I-low can  such  a\r\n\r\nthing  be  done? A police station is not a court.  If\r\n\r\nthe  boy  did not commit any offence, he should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  released.  He should not have  been  threatened\r\n\r\nwith  a  gun.  Ours is a democratic country.  Such  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  servant is described by  the  Chinese  as\r\n\r\ndespotic  and  dictatorial. Police officers  who  are\r\n\r\nimpolite to Members of Parliament are bad. I dare say\r\n\r\nthat  our  Government will be toppled as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  attitude of such Government servants. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  hope the Minister will investigate the matter  and\r\n\r\nsee what kind of a person that officer is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two Members have\r\n\r\nmentioned specific cases where they met with rudeness\r\n\r\nfrom  the police force.

They could have written  to\r\n\r\nme  giving  the time, date and place of the incident,\r\n\r\nand  I  could  have  made  the  necessary  inquiries,\r\n\r\nbecause  all  along we have asked our  police  to  be\r\n\r\ncourteous  and polite to the public. I am  glad  that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Paya Lebar thinks that only a minority\r\n\r\nof   the  police  force  are  acting  in  this   way.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is our duty to weed them out. I will\r\n\r\nbe  glad to receive more detailed information so that\r\n\r\nI can take appropriate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar complained about the\r\n\r\nslowness  of the police to appear at the scene  of  a\r\n\r\ncrime. Here again, I think it is a general statement,\r\n\r\nand  if  specific instances can be given, I  will  go\r\n\r\ninto  the whys and wherefores. The Member - in  fact,\r\n\r\nall  of  us  -would like the police, when called,  to\r\n\r\narrive  at  the  scene  of  a  crime  as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible.  On the other hand, he suggested that  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  use their car horns to get a  clear  way\r\n\r\nthrough the traffic. I am grateful for his suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  lights can be used to alert the road users that\r\n\r\nthe police are on duty or in a hurry to go somewhere.\r\n\r\nBut  as  I am not a specialist, I do not know whether\r\n\r\nlights in the daytime will have the desired effect of\r\n\r\nalerting  the  cars  in front to  make  way  for  the\r\n\r\npolice. Anyway, I am grateful for his suggestion, but\r\n\r\nthe best way that we know of clearing the traffic  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  police to sound their horns. If the  Member\r\n\r\ncan  pinpoint  any incident where the police  arrived\r\n\r\none  hour after they had received a call, I will look\r\n\r\ninto  it.  As  he  knows, sometimes  the  traffic  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  quite  congested  and  it  takes  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable time to get from one place to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid that I should have reported the matter to him.

They  have  to protect us,  look  after  our\r\n\r\ncountry  and  maintain law and order.  They  are  the\r\n\r\nprotectors  of  our  rights. Besides  the  army,  the\r\n\r\npolice  should  look  after our personal  safety  and\r\n\r\nproperty.  However, since the P.A.P, came  to  power,\r\n\r\nthe  standard of conduct and efficiency of the police\r\n\r\nhas  improved. It is possible that there is  still  a\r\n\r\nminority  in the police force who adopt the  colonial\r\n\r\nattitude.  This should be put right. There  are  many\r\n\r\nofficers who are well-mannered and are doing well  in\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.  But there are still some  flaws  'which\r\n\r\nneed  to  be corrected so that the police can  render\r\n\r\ngood service which is expected of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one aspect of the police force on which I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to touch. We learn from the  press  that\r\n\r\nsometimes  the  police resort to  the  use  of  their\r\n\r\npistols  when carrying out their duties.  There  have\r\n\r\nbeen  reported  cases of the loss  of  pistols  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of a quarrel over some women and some  people\r\n\r\nwere  murdered,  and so on. This is not  an  isolated\r\n\r\nincident. This kind of news appears in the press  now\r\n\r\nand  then.  As  a result, people form the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  the  police  are careless with  their  weapons.\r\n\r\nThere  is a doubt in the minds of the people  whether\r\n\r\nthe police can really look after their safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also learned that there are many restaurants\r\n\r\nand  bars which have recently been set up by some  of\r\n\r\nour  police  officers, though not under their  actual\r\n\r\nnames. But, in actual fact, they are the sponsors  of\r\n\r\nthese restaurants and bars where many crimes are  committed. \r\n\r\nThis is an open secret to many people. I feel\r\n\r\nthat this is bad for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood reputation of the police force and calls for  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that most of our secondary school\r\n\r\npupils  have  organised a police cadet corps.  Police\r\n\r\nofficers have also been sent to the schools to  train\r\n\r\nthe  students. In order to improve the  standards  of\r\n\r\nour police, I wonder whether the Minister is prepared\r\n\r\nto  consider  police cadets who have  graduated  from\r\n\r\nschools  and  recruit  them direct  into  the  police\r\n\r\nforce.  These  police cadets have already  had  basic\r\n\r\ntraining and have acquired skill in police duties. As\r\n\r\nsuch, we do not have to recruit other people who have\r\n\r\nnot  been  so  trained,  and  thus  incur  additional\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  In  this way, we  can  also  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandards of the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The Member for Delta alleges that a\r\n\r\nlarge  number o police personnel are careless in  the\r\n\r\nhandling  of  their weapons.

Some national  service\r\n\r\nyouths  have been absorbed into the Vigilante  Corps.\r\n\r\nIt  has now become a force supplementing the work  of\r\n\r\nthe  police.  They have contributed much  by  way  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining law and order in our country. Our purpose\r\n\r\nin  getting  national servicemen into  the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  is  to inculcate in them a spirit of  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  and service to the people.  Since  the\r\n\r\npast  few weeks, a number of Vigilante Corps  members\r\n\r\nhave  completed their training. They have  graduated.\r\n\r\nSo  far  they  have not been sent  to  serve  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious community centres. The Vigilante Corps  posts\r\n\r\nare still being manned by volunteers. I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Minister whether these well-trained Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  members who are national servicemen  could  be\r\n\r\nsent  to  serve  in  the various  community  centres.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there are many community centres  which  do\r\n\r\nnot  have Vigilante Corps posts.

Sir, unfortunately for\r\n\r\nthe Member for Mountbatten, the answer to all his queries  is  no.  He  must understand that  the  present\r\n\r\norganisation  of  the  Vigilante  Corps  is  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  from that of the Vigilante Corps  that  we\r\n\r\nhad during the Indonesian confrontation. At that time\r\n\r\nwe  had volunteers who came forward to help us patrol\r\n\r\nthe   beaches  and  stand  guard  against  subversive\r\n\r\nelements. But at the moment the Vigilante Corps takes\r\n\r\nin young conscripts and we have an entirely different\r\n\r\nkind of programme for these people. Therefore, though\r\n\r\nthey  have  completed their basic training  and  have\r\n\r\npassed out, it is not the intention of my Ministry to\r\n\r\npost  these people to the various community  centres.\r\n\r\nSecurity,  that  is, the patrolling  and  manning  of\r\n\r\nbeaches,  will  be undertaken by the police  and  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary. The Vigilante Corps has  other\r\n\r\nobjectives which I need not go into detail here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For security reasons, it is not the policy of my\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  make  known  the  number  of  training\r\n\r\ncentres we have and where they are.

Perhaps\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware that the Singapore  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nTraining Institute is situated in my constituency. In\r\n\r\nJurong,  there  is  also  a  camp  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInfantry  Regiment. It appears that  my  constituency\r\n\r\nhas  become a training ground for military personnel.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not object to the training  of  military\r\n\r\npersonnel  in my constituency.

Owing  to  the  frequency  of\r\n\r\nexercises, 3-ton military trucks using the good roads\r\n\r\nin my constituency have spoilt them. These trucks are\r\n\r\nsturdy and therefore they are not damaged. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen   the   roads   are  spoilt,  the   people   are\r\n\r\ninconvenienced.  Requests  have  been  made  to   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development to repair the roads,\r\n\r\nbut  usually  it takes some time before they  are  re\r\n\r\npaired.  I  would like to ask the Minister whether  a\r\n\r\nsum of money could be allotted under his Ministry for\r\n\r\nthe  repair  of  roads  which have  been  damaged  by\r\n\r\nmilitary  trucks.  Perhaps he  can  also  direct  the\r\n\r\ntroops  to  repair the roads in order to improve  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  troops  and   the   rural\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that when the troops are on an\r\n\r\nexercise  some  of  them steal  rambutans  and  other\r\n\r\nfruits belonging to the rural folk. This usually  hap\r\n\r\npens  at night. This should be stopped, otherwise  it\r\n\r\nwill create bad feeling among the rural folk and  the\r\n\r\ngood  relationship between the troops and the  people\r\n\r\nwill  deteriorate. I hope the Minister will look into\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and make the troops realise  that  they\r\n\r\nshould not do such a thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker.

If my memory serves me right,\r\n\r\nthe  last  group  of cadets before  they  were  given\r\n\r\ncommissions as officers did participate in some  road\r\n\r\nconstruction.  Where  members  of  the   M.I.D, are\r\n\r\nresponsible for spoiling some of the roads,  I  think\r\n\r\nit  will  not be difficult at all for them to  repair\r\n\r\nthese roads where-ever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards stealing of rambutans by the troops at\r\n\r\nnight while under training, I have given instructions\r\n\r\nthat incidents of this nature should not be repeated.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  you  know, our youths are  physically  fit,\r\n\r\nrobust and high-spirited.

The answer is substantially\r\n\r\nto be given by the Minister for Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, basically there is an absence of co-ordination\r\n\r\nbetween  the Immigration Department and the  Registry\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarriages.  In  a  way, it touches a  matter  of  the\r\n\r\nheart.  We  may have a male non-citizen, a foreigner,\r\n\r\nin our country for short periods of stay and the more\r\n\r\nselective of our charming females may decide  to  tie\r\n\r\nthe  matrimonial  knot with such a male  non-citizen.\r\n\r\nThe result of it is that our female citizen makes  an\r\n\r\napplication  to  the Registry of  Marriages  for  the\r\n\r\nissue  of the necessary licence and the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nMarriages   appears   to   issue   it   without   any\r\n\r\ninhibitions. Of course, solemnisation of the marriage\r\n\r\ntakes  place  and  the  two  are  married.  Then   an\r\n\r\napplication  is  made to the Immigration  authorities\r\n\r\nfor  residence  of the husband of our female  citizen\r\n\r\nwho  is  told  - also without inhibitions - \"Very sorry.\r\n\r\nResidence  in Singapore cannot be given to  him.\"  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this would necessitate a separation  between\r\n\r\nhusband and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However much it appears that efforts have been made\r\n\r\nin  the  past by our female citizen to get  her  non-\r\n\r\ncitizen   husband   into  Singapore   for   permanent\r\n\r\nresidence,  she is told that that, unfortunately,  is\r\n\r\nnot possible because the law is so. I tend to believe\r\n\r\nthat  if  co-ordination had existed between  the  two\r\n\r\ndepartments, perhaps the Registrar of Marriages might\r\n\r\nnot   be   issuing  licences  of  marriage  in   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances which do create hardship. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat  is the situation now and I would be obliged  if\r\n\r\nthe Minister could inform the House whether this sort\r\n\r\nof   practice  has  ceased  and  licences  for   such\r\n\r\nmarriages  are no longer issued by the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nMarriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also opportune, Mr Speaker, Sir, to raise a\r\n\r\nquestion under this subhead if the Minister cares  to\r\n\r\nanswer  it,  because I wonder whether  it  is  really\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  this  subject; that is,  the  rationale\r\n\r\nbehind  the  law  offering a non-citizen  female  who\r\n\r\nhappens to marry one of our male citizens entitlement\r\n\r\nto  residence  in this country. What  is  the  reason\r\n\r\nbehind this discrimination? On the one hand, we allow\r\n\r\na  non-citizen female who is married to  one  of  our\r\n\r\nmale  citizens residence in the country. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, we do not grant residence to a male non-citizen\r\n\r\nwho\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarries one of our female citizens. There might be  a\r\n\r\nrational explanation for this. I do not know.

There may, on principle, be a difference\r\n\r\nbetween a female citizen of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngetting  married  to  a  male foreigner  and  a  male\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  Singapore getting married  to  a  female\r\n\r\nforeigner. So far as the law is concerned, a girl who\r\n\r\ngets  married to a foreigner will have to follow  the\r\n\r\ndomicile  of the foreigner and there are a number  of\r\n\r\nlegal consequences that follow from this fact. But  I\r\n\r\nam  much more concerned with a male Singapore citizen\r\n\r\ngetting  married  to a female foreigner  who  is  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  bring  his wife into Singapore.  The  Immigration  Department  steps in  and  says  that  she\r\n\r\ncannot be allowed the necessary permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a much more harassing situation is this. It\r\n\r\nhas,  in fact, happened in Singapore and I have  come\r\n\r\nacross  this  case  personally.  A  female  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  got  married to a teacher in the  Federation\r\n\r\nwho was a Federal citizen. She went to the Federation\r\n\r\nto stay with him and in the process had two children.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her husband died in a  car  crash  and\r\n\r\nshe came back to stay with her mother because she did\r\n\r\nnot   have  any  relatives  in  the  Federation.  The\r\n\r\nImmigration Department stepped in and said  that  she\r\n\r\ncould not bring her children in. In other words,  the\r\n\r\nchildren  could  not stay in Singapore  although  she\r\n\r\ncould.

Others who\r\n\r\nhave   not  qualified  due  to  lack  of  residential\r\n\r\nqualification   are   unable  to  obtain   restricted\r\n\r\npassports to go across the causeway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if these persons were born either in India or\r\n\r\nThailand  or  anywhere else, they  could  go  to  the\r\n\r\nrespective  High  Commissioner Consulates  to  obtain\r\n\r\nletters stating they are stateless and we would  have\r\n\r\nno    objection    in    issuing   them    passports.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  the people who were born  across  the\r\n\r\ncauseway  were not given a certificate of  stateless-\r\n\r\nness  by  their High Commissions and we  turned  them\r\n\r\naway.  Eventually, they will come to feel  that  they\r\n\r\nare  prisoners in Singapore and are unable to get out\r\n\r\neven if they want to. Sir, it is easy to say that  we\r\n\r\nwant  them  to  go  away because  they  are  not  our\r\n\r\nresponsibility  but the responsibility  of  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nBut we should not forget that they have been here for\r\n\r\na number of years with no intention of going back and\r\n\r\nyet are unable to go across the causeway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into these cases\r\n\r\nwhich are numerous indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the cases mentioned by the Members  who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  before  me have  also  happened  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  Male citizens were  unable  to  obtain\r\n\r\npermission for their non-citizen wife to stay  perman\r\n\r\nently  in  Singapore. They were  also  asked  by  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department  to speed  up  the  necessary\r\n\r\nformalities so that their wife could leave  Singapore\r\n\r\nas soon as possible. I do not know whether the aim of\r\n\r\nthis policy is, as with the aim of protection of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  industries, to encourage our male citizens  to\r\n\r\nmarry   only  our  women  citizens.  In  our  present\r\n\r\nsociety,  we believe in having love as the foundation\r\n\r\nof  marriage.  Whether we like it or not,  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  become husbands and wives. It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nunreasonable, from the humanitarian point of view, if\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  allow  a non-citizen  wife  to  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  force her to separate from her husband  and  her\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a well-known Chinese fairy tale of a\r\n\r\ncowboy called Niu Lang and a spinner called Jze  Nyu.\r\n\r\nThe  audience shed tears of sympathy when that  fairy\r\n\r\ntale  is shown on stage. This story is now being  re-\r\n\r\nenacted with our own people acting as the cowboy  and\r\n\r\nthe  spinner as the case may be. I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan  review  the present immigration policy  so  that\r\n\r\nthis tragic Chinese story will not be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members seem to\r\n\r\nthink that I am the fly in the ointment in affairs of\r\n\r\nthe  heart!  I  would  like to  assure  them  that  I\r\n\r\nencourage  freedom in affairs of the  heart  wherever\r\n\r\npossible!  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  why   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Marriages does not show discrimination\r\n\r\nwhom  a person marries so long as he gives sufficient\r\n\r\nnotice  and  the  parties  concerned  have  lived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for more than 15 days. I do not see in what\r\n\r\nway this has got anything to do with immigration.  It\r\n\r\nis  a service which Singapore can render to join them\r\n\r\nin  holy and legal wedlock so that they can live  hap\r\n\r\npily  ever after. I do not think there is any  tie-up\r\n\r\nbetween  the Immigration Department and the  Registry\r\n\r\nof Marriages. I do not think the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  would  like the Government to determine  who\r\n\r\nshould  marry whom and who should not marry whom.  We\r\n\r\ngive  complete freedom here provided the couple  have\r\n\r\nlived here for more than 15 days. If they want to get\r\n\r\nmarried,  the Registry will perform the service,  and\r\n\r\ngood  luck  to  them.  Therefore,  the  question   of\r\n\r\nimmigration does not come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also wants to know\r\n\r\nthe  rationale under which we decide that female non-\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens who are married to male  citizens\r\n\r\nare  allowed  in, whereas male non-citizens  who  are\r\n\r\nmarried  to women citizens are not allowed in.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know exactly what is the rationale, but I  would\r\n\r\nsay that, being an eastern country, we would like  to\r\n\r\nfeel  that  it  is the man who wears the  pants  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  woman takes the domicile of the man. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Panjang has given the legal interpretation\r\n\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards admission of women non-citizens who are\r\n\r\nmarried to Singapore citizens, the law provides  that\r\n\r\nthey can apply for entry into Singapore. Just to  let\r\n\r\nMembers know that we have not been heartless, I  will\r\n\r\ngive  the  figures  of applications  and  the  number\r\n\r\napproved  and rejected. In 1967, 486 applications  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature  were approved and 134 were refused;  in\r\n\r\n1968,  449  were approved and 187 were refused;  from\r\n\r\nOctober to December 1967, 28 were approved and  three\r\n\r\nwere  refused;  January to November  1968,  668  were\r\n\r\napproved and 161 were refused. Every case is  treated\r\n\r\non  its own merits, but the law covering applications\r\n\r\nof  female non-citizens married to Singapore citizens\r\n\r\ncomes  under  the  Immigration Prohibition  of  Entry\r\n\r\nOrder, 1966. Those who are interested can read it  in\r\n\r\ndetail. Those female non-citizens who are married  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and who are on a visit  pass  are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  an  extension  of  stay  because  their\r\n\r\nhusbands are not in a position to support them or the\r\n\r\nchildren  whom they will bring into this world  later\r\n\r\non.  That  is  the main reason why they  are  refused\r\n\r\nadmission, otherwise we will not interfere with their\r\n\r\nmatrimonial problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the refusal to issue restricted passports\r\n\r\nto persons holding blue identity cards, we will issue\r\n\r\nthem   these   passports  if  they  can   produce   a\r\n\r\ncertificate of statelessness. But they cannot produce\r\n\r\nthis   certificate  of  statelessness  because  their\r\n\r\ncountry of domicile is not willing to give them  this\r\n\r\ncertificate. Is that correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

How can the Minister or the Controller  of\r\n\r\nImmigration be sure that the husband cannot  maintain\r\n\r\nhis  wife?  If the wife is willing to stay  with  her\r\n\r\nhusband,  he  will be able to maintain  her  and  the\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not quarrelling\r\n\r\nwith  the legalistics of the matter if that, in fact,\r\n\r\nis  the rationale behind the legal discrimination. If\r\n\r\nour female citizen marries a non-citizen, she has  to\r\n\r\naccept the fact that she follows the domicile of  her\r\n\r\nhusband.  That is quite correct. I think there  still\r\n\r\nexists  a  moral obligation at least  to  inform  our\r\n\r\nfemale  citizen that when she marries a  non-citizen,\r\n\r\nhe will not be entitled to reside in this country.  I\r\n\r\nthink  if this situation is made known to our  female\r\n\r\napplicants,  it  will  correct the  wrong  impression\r\n\r\nthat,  as  they  are  citizens  of  Singapore,  their\r\n\r\nhusbands are entitled to reside with them, because  I\r\n\r\nthink this impression is very real.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

This discrimination is only for those born  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  If they have been living  here  for\r\n\r\nsome  years and if they have permanent residence  and\r\n\r\njobs  here,  at  least some consideration  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them so that they can go to the Federation\r\n\r\nwhen  they  want to, especially in view of  the  good\r\n\r\nrelationship  between Singapore and  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nSomebody has to look into their problems to see  that\r\n\r\nthey are given freedom of travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am most sympathetic to that\r\n\r\nappeal and I will look into the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is simple to make it widely known that\r\n\r\nfemale  Singapore  citizens  who  marry  non-citizens\r\n\r\nshould follow the domiciles of their husbands.

For\r\n\r\ninstance,  there  are more and more  films  of  local\r\n\r\nplays  and dramas. Many educative films are shown  on\r\n\r\ntelevision. Although these films are supplied by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education, television comes  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture. So the credit should also go  to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture. Such TV programmes as \"Youth\r\n\r\nForum\"   and   \"It's  Happening  in  Singapore\"   are\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the people as a whole.

I would like to ask\r\n\r\nhim  whether our T.V, is going to organise  and  show\r\n\r\nfilms  on youth forums and organise radio forums  and\r\n\r\nshows  which  will  enable our social  and  political\r\n\r\nleaders  and  those in educational  circles  to  give\r\n\r\ntalks. These programmes would benefit our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, as we know, radio and  television\r\n\r\nare the media of communication between the Government\r\n\r\nand the people. They are also forms of entertainment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they are useful guides to our people. In\r\n\r\nview  of  the fact that our country is in the process\r\n\r\nof nation building, every citizen must strive towards\r\n\r\nachieving this aim. Radio and television can play  an\r\n\r\nimportant  role  in this respect.  They  can  put  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes which contain plays and concerts which aim\r\n\r\nat nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few Malay programmes on television.\r\n\r\nMoreover, translations from non-Malay films  are  few\r\n\r\nand  far between. The national language is encouraged\r\n\r\nby  the Government. Every citizen should learn to use\r\n\r\nit. It is, therefore, wise for films to be translated\r\n\r\ninto  the national language and increase the  showing\r\n\r\nof  such  films  on  T.V. I hope  the  Ministry  will\r\n\r\nconsider  my  suggestions and improve the  radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision programmes in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a notice of\r\n\r\namendment No. (2)*. I think I can take up my  subject\r\n\r\nunder  this  subhead and forgo moving  amendment  No. (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Amendment (2) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1006.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of what I want to say will be underlining the\r\n\r\nobservations  of the Member for Sembawang.  Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking, Sir, I think the Department of Broadcasting\r\n\r\nhas met the leisure needs of the people in television\r\n\r\nviewing. Human preferences are multitudinous  and  so\r\n\r\nvaried that I think it is impossible to satisfy every\r\n\r\nviewer. But what appears to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  case  is  that  the Broadcasting  Department  is\r\n\r\npleasing  a  large number of people  with  programmes\r\n\r\nlike   crime   thrillers  and  associated  programmes\r\n\r\ncontaining no small measure of violence. I think this\r\n\r\nis  worrying.  It  becomes  extraordinarily  worrying\r\n\r\nbecause  at the time when I was applying my  mind  to\r\n\r\nthis  problem, there was reported in our local  press\r\n\r\nthe  case of Mary and Nomar who were alleged to  have\r\n\r\nstrangled  a  five-year old in a county  in  England.\r\n\r\nThen   in  one  of  our  local  cinemas,  the  Boston\r\n\r\nStrangler  was  \"let  loose\".  All  this   was   also\r\n\r\nreminiscent of the assault on a residence in  my  own\r\n\r\nconstituency in the style and tradition of The F.B.I.\r\n\r\nseries. I think this calls for some thinking  in  the\r\n\r\ndepartment.  I  wonder if there  is  any  sort  of  a\r\n\r\nresearch  unit  in  the Department  .of  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nwhich  is constantly applying its efforts to  try  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the great number of television viewers  with\r\n\r\nprogrammes   much  more  congenial  and   much   less\r\n\r\nfrightening. I believe that if some effort is applied\r\n\r\nin  this direction, it is possible to devise a  means\r\n\r\nby which we can try to satisfy our television viewers\r\n\r\nin a happier manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter which I wish to raise under this\r\n\r\nsubhead  is censorship of publications and  films.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is being carried out by this Ministry. In so\r\n\r\nfar  as  censorship of publications is  concerned,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know who constitutes  the  censoring\r\n\r\nbody.  What is the extent of layman participation  in\r\n\r\nit? What is the proportion of laymen and professional\r\n\r\nmen  in the censoring body? Are there also laymen  in\r\n\r\nthe censoring body of film censorship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to round off my observations, Sir, I come back\r\n\r\nto   the   Broadcasting  Department.  I  think   this\r\n\r\nDepartment should be aware that we have already  bulk\r\n\r\nunemployment, and as time goes on it will increase in\r\n\r\nsize.  Whatever efforts have been undertaken by  this\r\n\r\nmedium  -  it  is a most powerful medium  indeed  -an\r\n\r\nattempt  should be made to inculcate in our people  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  positivism. This is going  to  be  a  tall\r\n\r\norder.  I do not know how they are going to go  about\r\n\r\nit.  If  this  medium can inculcate in our  people  a\r\n\r\nsense of positivism instead of a sense\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof negativism, a sense of confidence in their ability\r\n\r\nto  look after their position in life, it might  help\r\n\r\nto  make them more creative individually. They  would\r\n\r\nadopt  a  brighter outlook towards life, and be  more\r\n\r\nconfident,  instead of reacting to  life  negatively.\r\n\r\nThe short outcome of it all is that it will invoke in\r\n\r\nthem  a very positivistic attitude. I certainly  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Broadcasting  Department  will  look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, much of the criticism levelled  at  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  is aimed at  the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment. I think it would be useful to Members  if\r\n\r\nI  were to give a brief description of the activities\r\n\r\nwhich we are carrying on in the Broadcasting Division\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Culture. In fact, for the last six\r\n\r\nmonths  most  of  our attention and energy  has  been\r\n\r\nconcentrated in reorganising this division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary task of the Broadcasting Division is to\r\n\r\nintroduce  dynamic  leadership so that  talents  both\r\n\r\nfrom  within and from without can be fully  utilised.\r\n\r\nThis   calls   for   administrative  and   structural\r\n\r\nreorganisation  and  the Broadcasting  Division  was,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  raised to the status of a Ministry,  with\r\n\r\nits  own  Permanent Secretary and its own Ministerial\r\n\r\nadministrative machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has enabled the division to act more quickly\r\n\r\nand   effectively  in  the  past  six   months.   The\r\n\r\nconversion of the department into a Ministry has been\r\n\r\ncompleted  in a very short period of time.  With  the\r\n\r\nnew status, the division is able to plan and put into\r\n\r\nexecution a number of desirable projects as  well  as\r\n\r\nmodifying old ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the obvious projects was the extension of\r\n\r\nboth  radio and television broadcasting hours.  Radio\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  hours have increased by  59  hours  per\r\n\r\nweek  and television transmissions have been extended\r\n\r\nby  some 12 hours per week. With the arrival  of  new\r\n\r\nequipment  expected in the early part of  next  year,\r\n\r\ntelevision   transmission  hours  will   be   further\r\n\r\nextended from the planned 34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhours  per week to over 110 hours a week. This figure\r\n\r\ndoes not include some 60 hours a week for educational\r\n\r\ntelevision broadcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project was the successful series of youth\r\n\r\nforums  which were mentioned just now by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang. These programmes give our youth their\r\n\r\nrightful  share  of opportunities  to  speak  on  and\r\n\r\nparticipate  in matters concerning our  society.  The\r\n\r\nprogrammes  themselves  were  enriched  by   audience\r\n\r\nparticipation. In this way, we hope to try to  instil\r\n\r\nin  our  programmes  the  so-called  healthy  content\r\n\r\nrequired by our society. Audience participation is an\r\n\r\nimportant ingredient in a programme and we are  going\r\n\r\nto   have   more   programmes  with  this   kind   of\r\n\r\nparticipation so as to make them lively and enjoyable\r\n\r\nto all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised the question of\r\n\r\npop songs being broadcast over radio and T.V. This is\r\n\r\na  subject which has been brought up year after year.\r\n\r\nI  begin to wonder whether he is raising this subject\r\n\r\nin order to appear a moralist. Sometimes it is rather\r\n\r\ndifficult to define what you call low-class and high-\r\n\r\nclass  music. Of course, sometimes we have love songs\r\n\r\nand  crazy music over radio and T.V. But not all love\r\n\r\nsongs are low class. I think some classical songs are\r\n\r\nvery  good but they are also love songs. It is rather\r\n\r\ndifficult for us to define. Furthermore, we  have  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  people  of all walks of  life.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the requirements of people of different  age\r\n\r\ngroups,  people  of  different  races  and  different\r\n\r\nlanguage  streams.  Since radio  and  T.V, are  mass\r\n\r\nmedia, we have always aimed at trying to present  our\r\n\r\nprogrammes to satisfy the majority of the  people.  I\r\n\r\nthink pop songs may sometimes be necessary because it\r\n\r\nis  simple and easy to learn. To appreciate classical\r\n\r\nmusic  requires  some training and  knowledge.  Since\r\n\r\nradio and T.V, have appeal for the masses, we have to\r\n\r\ntake  the mean and it is rather difficult for  us  to\r\n\r\ntry to define whether a song is low class or not.  It\r\n\r\nis a matter of personal taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think part of the question has been answered by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Serangoon Gardens when he says that it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible  to satisfy every  viewer.  We  are\r\n\r\nalways trying to look for new formats, and I do agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  that  the  violent films  which  sometimes\r\n\r\nappear  on  T.V, are very damaging  to  our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.  But  the trouble here  is  that  we  are\r\n\r\ndependent  on syndicated films to fill  up  the  long\r\n\r\nhours of broadcast. Since it is expensive to make our\r\n\r\nshows  and films, we have always taken in  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nfilms imported from the West. Unfortunately, most  of\r\n\r\nthese films are mainly about violence, adventures  or\r\n\r\nsex.  But we try to minimise their effect and  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number of hours for films of this kind.  Another\r\n\r\nway  is to try to go into our own production of films\r\n\r\nin a big way. In the past, we have produced operas in\r\n\r\nTeochew,  Hokkien  and Cantonese. I understand  these\r\n\r\nshows   have   received   widespread   support    and\r\n\r\nenthusiasm.  This  is only an attempt  to  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem and we are also looking into other fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has also asked\r\n\r\nwhether   there   is  any  basis  in  censorship   of\r\n\r\npublications.   The-censorship  of  publications   is\r\n\r\ngoverned  by the Undesirable Publications  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  Controller of Undesirable Publications has power\r\n\r\nto  retain publications which he thinks are objection\r\n\r\nable  in the public interest on political, social  or\r\n\r\nmoral  grounds. The Controller acts on the advice  of\r\n\r\nan advisory committee. The committee comprises people\r\n\r\nfrom outside the Ministry, including some Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  Censor-, ship of books is considered  on\r\n\r\nthe  merits of each case and there is no blanket rule\r\n\r\nwith regard to censorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards film censorship, there is, also a Film\r\n\r\nAppeals  Committee  which  allow  appeals  from  film\r\n\r\ndistributors. The Chairman is the Speaker  of  Parlia\r\n\r\nment  and  the Committee meet once a week or  once  a\r\n\r\nmonth to review appeals made by film importers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to  hear  the  reply by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture.  I  feel that if he were to  listen  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang, life would be very  dull.  My\r\n\r\nimpression  is that the Member for Sembawang  appears\r\n\r\nto  be  deprived  of  even one iota  of  romance.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  I  find that our radio and T.V, programmes\r\n\r\nare  very, very dull and I think a little  bit  of  a\r\n\r\n\"pep-up\" might do our population a lot of good. I  am\r\n\r\nglad  the  Minister is not listening  to  puritanical\r\n\r\ndemands by some Members. Otherwise our population  of\r\n\r\ntwo million will look like the Member for Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in normal life, the usual activities of love,\r\n\r\nromance,  violence and perhaps even  murder  are  not\r\n\r\nunusual. If our radio and T.V. programmes are  to  be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  these, again I say life  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndull.  Are we going to develop two million robots  in\r\n\r\nthis  country? I feel that if the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\ncan  have  reasonable control over more  violent  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  sexy types of programmes, then life will  be\r\n\r\nall   right.  We  must  not  try  to  introduce  such\r\n\r\npuritanical standards in our population just  because\r\n\r\nof  a  small  section of the people. Our  people  are\r\n\r\nintelligent and wise enough to see for themselves and\r\n\r\nthink for themselves what is right and what is wrong.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope  the Minister for Culture will allow  our\r\n\r\npopulation to enjoy our radio and T.V, programmes and\r\n\r\nnot to be subjected to a lot of brainwashing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that for Chinese shows and films\r\n\r\nthat  are  being  shown  nowadays  on  T.V.,  English\r\n\r\nsubtitles be given so that they will be of some  help\r\n\r\nto persons like me because I cannot understand a word\r\n\r\nof  what is going on and I have no chance of enjoying\r\n\r\nsuch good films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker.

There is  a\r\n\r\nlack of advertisements for locally-produced goods  on\r\n\r\ntelevision.  This  is  contrary to  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy   of  promoting  local  industries,   imposing\r\n\r\ntariffs on imported goods, and encouraging our people\r\n\r\nto  buy locally-made goods. There is still a lack  of\r\n\r\nadvertisements on locally-made goods; and because  of\r\n\r\nthis, the people may not have confidence in them. The\r\n\r\nbest means of publicising the policy to the people is\r\n\r\nto   advertise  extensively  on  television.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, I should say such advertisements are very few\r\n\r\nand  I  do not know whether the Minister has  any  explanation for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  low-class music, pop songs or anything  of\r\n\r\nthat  sort.

The  literary  classics\r\n\r\npublished  in  China  are  bad,  but  what  is   more\r\n\r\nsurprising  is  this. Someone went to Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\nbought some books and records on the teaching of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  language, but these books  were  confiscated\r\n\r\nbecause  they  praised Mao Tse-tung.

The Commercial Section of the Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDivision  has  approached all  kinds  of  people  for\r\n\r\nadvertisements  and  they have  not  overlooked  this\r\n\r\nsource  of  income  from the manufacturers  of  local\r\n\r\nproducts.   But   the   trouble   with   our    local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers is that they have a captive market, an-\r\n\r\nd  knowing  that  their  products  are  protected  by\r\n\r\ntariffs, they are in a very advantageous position  to\r\n\r\ncompete with the imported products. They therefore do\r\n\r\nnot  bother  to advertise even though we  have  given\r\n\r\nthem  special discounts for putting up advertisements\r\n\r\nover  the radio and on television. They will have  to\r\n\r\nchange their attitude because our population is  very\r\n\r\nbrand-conscious, and if they want to be successful in\r\n\r\nselling  their products, they will have to resort  to\r\n\r\nthis mass medium to sell them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi asked why we have repeated\r\n\r\ntelecasting low-class films on television. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what he means by \"low-class\" films. I think  he\r\n\r\nhas  in mind the Chinese films from Hong Kong.  There\r\n\r\nis  an  acute  shortage of Chinese films.  The  films\r\n\r\nindustry is not happy that television should  compete\r\n\r\nwith  them  because it is taking away their audience.\r\n\r\nThey  have  therefore tried to control the supply  of\r\n\r\nChinese  films to television. I understand that  they\r\n\r\nhave  agreed not to supply films to television  which\r\n\r\nare less than 10 years old. This is the reason why we\r\n\r\nhave  been  telecasting all these very old films.  We\r\n\r\nhave recently solved this problem by installing a new\r\n\r\n35  m.m, film projector and we do not have to  depend\r\n\r\non  16  m.m, films the supply of which is  less  than\r\n\r\nthat  of  35 m.m, films. The film industry  has  also\r\n\r\nagreed  to co-operate with us and good films are  now\r\n\r\navailable.  I hope we can get some very good  Chinese\r\n\r\nfilms on television next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint about the importation of\r\n\r\nbooks from China and Taiwan, the Publications Section\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Culture deals with the importation\r\n\r\nof  books and it does not allow into Singapore  books\r\n\r\nwhich are politically objectionable. Of course, there\r\n\r\nare  many good classical books produced in China. But\r\n\r\nof late, because of the cultural revolution in China,\r\n\r\nI  think  almost  every book that is published  there\r\n\r\ncontains  quotations  from The Thoughts  of  Chairman\r\n\r\nMao.  I do not think books of this kind should be  im\r\n\r\nported  into  Singapore. But if they are good  books,\r\n\r\nthe  importer  can appeal and we will look  into  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I have to reply to the charge made\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for  Ulu  Pandan  about  mini-skirts\r\n\r\nbecause  my  Ministry  is not in  charge  of  women's\r\n\r\ndresses.  Fortunately,  there  is  no  censorship  of\r\n\r\nwomen's dresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai asked why there is\r\n\r\nsuch   a   small   number  of  Malay  programmes   on\r\n\r\ntelevision.  We have a system of allocating  transmis\r\n\r\nsion  hours  to  the  various  language  streams.  To\r\n\r\nrefresh the Member's memory, the percentages  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  transmission hours are 20  per  cent  for  the\r\n\r\nnational  language,  35  per  cent  for  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nstream, 10 per cent for the Tamil stream and  35  per\r\n\r\ncent  for  the English stream. Previously, Television\r\n\r\nSingapura used to show Egyptian and Hindustani  films\r\n\r\nwith Malay subtitles against the Malay quota. It  was\r\n\r\nthought  that  the shortage of films  for  the  Malay\r\n\r\nprogrammes  could  be  met  by  using  Egyptian   and\r\n\r\nHindustani  films.  But in the  last  few  months,  a\r\n\r\nchange has been made. We are now using English  films\r\n\r\nwith  sub-titles  in Malay to meet the  Malay  quota.\r\n\r\nThis has met\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   an   enthusiastic  response  from  the   Malay\r\n\r\naudience.  They prefer Western films to Egyptian  and\r\n\r\nHindustani  films.  The  people  of  other   language\r\n\r\nstreams are slso able to enjoy these films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  thank  you very much for letting me have the  last\r\n\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with what the Minister has said.

Since the creation\r\n\r\nof  the  Sports  Division in the Ministry  of  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs   in  1967,  sports  activities   have   been\r\n\r\norganised and promoted on a national basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Ministers and even some Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nhave  shown  their keenness in sports  activities  by\r\n\r\ntaking  an  active part as presidents of sports  orga\r\n\r\nnisations.   However,  I  note   with   regret   that\r\n\r\nbadminton, which is popular among our young citizens,\r\n\r\nhas  been  somewhat neglected by the  Government  and\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations.  There  has  so  far  been   no\r\n\r\norganised effort to revive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore, seek information from the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Social  Affairs as to whether a  plan  has  been\r\n\r\ndrawn  up  to train our young enthusiasts  to  become\r\n\r\npotential players of international standard?  If  so,\r\n\r\nhow  many  trainees are there and how often  do  they\r\n\r\ntrain?  Can  the Minister also inform the House  when\r\n\r\nthese trainees are expected to come out into the open\r\n\r\nand compete in international tournaments in order  to\r\n\r\nwin back the coveted Thomas Cup?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Member for Mountbatten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that sports play a very important part\r\n\r\nin  the building of a rugged society in our Republic.\r\n\r\nSports  activities make our youths physically strong,\r\n\r\ntenacious  and  well disciplined. Therefore,  we  lay\r\n\r\ngreat emphasis on the promotion of sports activities.\r\n\r\nBut  we  neglect to train the athletes who  represent\r\n\r\nour country in international sports events. It is not\r\n\r\njust  a  simple  matter to build  a  rugged  society.\r\n\r\nBasically  the  problem lies in how to encourage  the\r\n\r\npeople to take an interest in sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, of course, we must have suitable playgrounds\r\n\r\nfor  them in which to train and compete. If  we  have\r\n\r\nthese two conditions, then we can call the people  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  more  positively  in  sports.  In  other\r\n\r\ncountries, athletes compete in international  events,\r\n\r\nand the gaining of national glory for the state is an\r\n\r\ninvaluable asset. But the important point with regard\r\n\r\nto our national athletes is whether the Government is\r\n\r\nmaking an effort to train them in order to show  that\r\n\r\nit  is  encouraging an interest in sports,  and  also\r\n\r\nwhether  we  are  giving enough  attention  to  these\r\n\r\nathletes  to show that the Government is appreciative\r\n\r\nof  their efforts. We are trying to promote a  rugged\r\n\r\nsociety,  but  I am afraid we are not paying  enough\r\n\r\nattention  to these national athletes and  sportsmen.\r\n\r\nWe  all  know that it takes a long period of training\r\n\r\nfor  an  athlete or sportsman to reach  the  required\r\n\r\nhigh standard when he can represent our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational team. The training is very rigorous.  Herein\r\n\r\nlies the problem. Should the Government encourage and\r\n\r\ntrain  them  or  should  they  themselves  take   the\r\n\r\ninitiative  and train on their own? When I  refer  to\r\n\r\nathletes,  I, of course, refer to those athletes  who\r\n\r\nrepresent Singapore. Our athletes are left  to  their\r\n\r\nown  initiative and devices to train themselves. They\r\n\r\ndo  not have the necessary equipment or apparatus for\r\n\r\ntheir  training.  They do not also  have  sufficient\r\n\r\ntime. Most of them are employed. If you want to train\r\n\r\nthem  after they have returned from work, you  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  much result from such training. How then  are\r\n\r\nwe going to raise their standards?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\ntake  note  of is that certain athletes do  not  even\r\n\r\nhave  a  proper  job. For example,  the  Volley  Ball\r\n\r\nAssociation has three of its members who  have  given\r\n\r\nup  their training because of the need to look for  a\r\n\r\njob. They have recently taken on jobs as sailors  and\r\n\r\nhave left the country. This is a waste of talent  and\r\n\r\na  loss  to  our  country.  These  three  volley-ball\r\n\r\nplayers  have  all  the necessary qualifications  and\r\n\r\ncapability to be trained as excellent athletes. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  suggesting that the state should feed and clothe\r\n\r\nthem.  It is beyond our means to do so. But  what  we\r\n\r\nshould do is to engage these athletes in the task  of\r\n\r\nnation  building.  They can very well  become  sports\r\n\r\ninstructors  in  the  Ministry of  the  Interior  and\r\n\r\nDefence.  They  have the necessary qualifications  to\r\n\r\nbecome sports instructors. If they have the necessary\r\n\r\nacademic  qualifications, the Government should  give\r\n\r\nthem  better treatment. By doing so, the people  will\r\n\r\nrespond  and- take part in sports and other  athletic\r\n\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to touch upon is the question\r\n\r\nof  playing  fields and training grounds.  We  should\r\n\r\nhave  better training grounds and other training faci\r\n\r\nlities.  I do not mean that we should have  an  ideal\r\n\r\ntraining ground and build a grand sports complex.  In\r\n\r\nany  case, we should at least build an indoor  sports\r\n\r\nstadium with training facilities.

To\r\n\r\nsee  that the squad is physically fit to undergo  the\r\n\r\ntraining, regular checks are made on them by a  panel\r\n\r\nof three doctors who have volunteered their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wong has also recommended that the national badminton squad should, at the appropriate time, be sent abroad to take part in international matches to give them the necessary experience and match temperament so that they will be fully attuned when they take part in the next Thomas Cup series.\r\n\r\nArrangements are being made for them to go on a  tout\r\n\r\nto   play  matches  in  Japan,  Cambodia,  Burma  and\r\n\r\nThailand in April or May next year, after which  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  ready to compete in the Australian zone  of\r\n\r\nthe Thomas Cup series in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the point that was raised by the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar,  I  would  like to inform the House  that  the\r\n\r\nactive  encouragement of sports and games as part  of\r\n\r\nthe policy of creating a physically rugged society in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic has resulted in numerous requests being\r\n\r\nmade  by  sports  organisations to  help  members  of\r\n\r\nnational  teams to enable them to keep up with  their\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Promotion Division has assisted sportsmen\r\n\r\nin  one  way or another, such as obtaining unrecorded\r\n\r\nleave from their employers, time-off for training an-\r\n\r\nd  also free medical attention. For those members who\r\n\r\nare  unemployed, arrangements have also been made  to\r\n\r\nget  them suitable jobs. Since the beginning of  this\r\n\r\nyear,  jobs  have  been found for a  few  outstanding\r\n\r\nathletes, basket-ball  players,  football   players,\r\n\r\nbadminton  players, cyclists and, I believe,  volley-\r\n\r\nball  players, too, in the private sector and in  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies.  If the three volley-ball  players\r\n\r\nare  still unemployed at the moment, I should be very\r\n\r\ngrateful  if the Member could forward their names  to\r\n\r\nme and I will do my best to help them get employment.\r\n\r\nAlso with the active promotion of sports in the armed\r\n\r\nforces,  it  is expected that some good sportsmen  in\r\n\r\nthe national teams may be recruited into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  police and military services.

From the\r\n\r\nname  of  this Bureau, I presume that its aim  is  to\r\n\r\nrender  legal aid to poor people who cannot otherwise\r\n\r\nafford to obtain professiona1 legal advice. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  many  cases have been dealt  with  by  the\r\n\r\nBureau  every year and I do not know how  many  have\r\n\r\nbeen  solved.  I am of the view that this  Bureau  is\r\n\r\nspending quite a lot of Government money but its work\r\n\r\nis not satisfactory. It has come to my knowledge that\r\n\r\nthis Bureau\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  not been able to render legal aid to poor people\r\n\r\ngenerally. On the contrary, it has been made  use  of\r\n\r\nby  lawyers for their own administrative convenience.\r\n\r\nTake  the instance of a lawyer who takes up the  case\r\n\r\nof  a  client and he is not able to get the necessary\r\n\r\nevidence.  If  this  evidence  is  deposited  in  the\r\n\r\nBureau, the client will be asked to go to the  Bureau\r\n\r\nto  seek  legal  aid. The Bureau will say  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot act on his behalf. But if he wants to get  cer\r\n\r\ntain  documents or records, he will be  able  to  get\r\n\r\nthem from the Bureau and, having got them, he will go\r\n\r\nback to the lawyer. This lawyer will then be able  to\r\n\r\nmake use of the documents on behalf of his client  in\r\n\r\ncourt.  The client is not poor and yet it turns  out\r\n\r\nthe Legal Aid Bureau has rendered help to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But poor people who really need legal aid are not\r\n\r\ngiven  aid  at all. I have come across  a  case  like\r\n\r\nthis.  In  my  constituency, there is a certain  area\r\n\r\nwhere  Malays live. Previously this area was part  of\r\n\r\nQueenstown  Constituency. But after the redelineation\r\n\r\nof electoral boundaries, this area has come within my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  The Malays who live in this  area  are\r\n\r\nsubtenants  and the houses are owned by rich  people.\r\n\r\nThe rent is $30 for a partitioned house and there are\r\n\r\nabout  20  families living in every house. There  are\r\n\r\nmore than ten houses of this type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, we have only three minutes\r\n\r\nmore  and if you want a reply from the Minister,  you\r\n\r\nwill have to stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwill cut it short.

When I raised  this\r\n\r\nmatter  with  the  Legal  Aid Bureau,  the  officials\r\n\r\npromised  to  help  them. However, after  nearly  two\r\n\r\nmonths,  no  news was heard about this case.  I  made\r\n\r\nseveral inquiries and yet no satisfactory answer  was\r\n\r\ngiven,  with  the result that the landlord  has  been\r\n\r\nable  to  persuade the Malays to move out  by  giving\r\n\r\neach family only a small sum of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney as compensation.

The last time I raised a question  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  concerning extending the hours of  service  of\r\n\r\ncreches, the Minister for Social Affairs said that he\r\n\r\nwas  not prepared to do so. I would like to say  that\r\n\r\nin  the  daytime  these creches are mainly  used  for\r\n\r\nchildren  whose  mothers  are  working.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nevening  the  women folk will not have  the  time  to\r\n\r\nengage  in  community activities.  Because  of  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties, they  cannot  engage  house-\r\n\r\nmaids  to  look after their children. And  when  the\r\n\r\nhusband  goes to work, the wife will have to stay  at\r\n\r\nhome  and look after the children. This may be  quite\r\n\r\nunfair.  As  such, women are not able to go  out  and\r\n\r\ntake  part in community activities. Since the creches\r\n\r\nare empty in the evening, it would be a good idea  if\r\n\r\nwe  could extend the hours of service of creches  so\r\n\r\nthat  mothers  can have more time  to  take  part  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  activities.  This will  not  endanger  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the children and their mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we can employ more people if\r\n\r\nthe  hours  of service of creches are extended.  This\r\n\r\nwill  contribute  towards the solution  of  our  unemployment problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point concerns the instructors in these\r\n\r\ncreches.   As   far  as  I  know,  ever   since   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of children's centres and creches,  the\r\n\r\nmethod of supervision and the equipment used in these\r\n\r\ncreches  have  not  been ideal. The instructors  have\r\n\r\nbeen using English to deal with the children. Most of\r\n\r\nthe  reading material is mainly in English.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  quite in harmony with our efforts to promote the\r\n\r\nuse of a second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These children will be deprived of the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  familiarise  themselves with the second  language\r\n\r\nand this may cause them some difficulties later on.

They  were only set up after  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party came to power. Their establishment is in\r\n\r\nline  with our policy of democratic socialism to look\r\n\r\nafter  the  poorer people, and those who are  working\r\n\r\ncan leave their children in the creches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two points to raise on this matter. Firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  creches  are  not widespread  because  they  are\r\n\r\nsituated in the urban areas only. I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary whether  the  Government\r\n\r\nplans to build creches in the rural areas. There  are\r\n\r\nmany  women folk in the rural areas who go  to  work,\r\n\r\nand their children lack their personal attention.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government can build creches in the rural areas,\r\n\r\nthey will be helping the people because they can send\r\n\r\ntheir children there when they go to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that I have received complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the  food  served in the  creches.  In  recent\r\n\r\nyears,  the  food has been reduced in quantity.  This\r\n\r\nwill  adversely affect the health of the children.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will look into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I support the motion of the Member for Delta.

I would suggest that  creches\r\n\r\nbe built there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the children in the creches should also\r\n\r\nbe taught various languages. The Member for Delta has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that the medium of instruction  is  solely\r\n\r\nEnglish. In our efforts to promote multi-lingualism,\r\n\r\nwe should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstruct the children in other languages as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, I support the suggestion made by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Sembawang that  we  should  set  up\r\n\r\ncreches  in  the rural areas, because the rural  folk\r\n\r\nare  financially worse off than those  in  the  urban\r\n\r\nareas. Also they have more children. I feel there  is\r\n\r\na  need  to build creches for the children  of  these\r\n\r\npeople in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, first of all, let me thank the  Members\r\n\r\nwho have spoken on the creches. Thus, they have given\r\n\r\npublicity  to  the availability of  creches  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  will know that they can leave their  children\r\n\r\nin the creches when they go to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, we held a press conference during\r\n\r\nwhich  we  mentioned the services  that  the  creches\r\n\r\ncould  provide. But many parents still  do  not  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to the creches when they go to  work.\r\n\r\nMany of the creches are quite empty and some are  not\r\n\r\nfull  up.  So  when  Members raise  the  question  of\r\n\r\ncreches  in  this House, it will serve to inform  the\r\n\r\npublic of the services provided by the creches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have criticised the services provided by the\r\n\r\ncreches, for example, shortage of food, etc. I  would\r\n\r\nlike to assure Members that if their allegations  are\r\n\r\ncorrect,  then we will take the necessary  action  to\r\n\r\nimprove the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to languages used at the creches, I agree\r\n\r\nthat  we  should also provide opportunities  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren  to  learn other languages than English.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past, most of the officials in the creches  have\r\n\r\nbeen  educated  in  English and so  we  have  to  use\r\n\r\nEnglish  as the medium of instruction. Since  Members\r\n\r\nhave expressed their views on this point, we will try\r\n\r\nour  best to rectify the situation. But speaking from\r\n\r\nthe   administrative  point  of  view,  we  have   no\r\n\r\nalternative  but to carry on using English,  but,  in\r\n\r\nother  aspects,  we may use other languages  or  even\r\n\r\ndialects.  In fact, many dialects are spoken  because\r\n\r\nthe children in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreches come from various races an-d an Indian may be\r\n\r\nable to speak Hokkien. During the youth festival,  we\r\n\r\nwere  able  to  see on television children  of  other\r\n\r\nraces performing Chinese traditional dances and  vice\r\n\r\nversa.  Our  policy  in educating these  children  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  based  on  multi-lingualism  and   multi-racialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give some figures about the teachers\r\n\r\nin   the   creches.   Of  the   10   assistant   lady\r\n\r\nsuperintendents, five are educated in Chinese and two\r\n\r\nare  educated in both Chinese and English. Of the  16\r\n\r\ninstructors in charge of the children's centres, nine\r\n\r\nare  educated in both Chinese and English.  The  term\r\n\r\n\"Chinese\"  also includes dialects such as  Cantonese,\r\n\r\nHainanese,  Hokkien, etc. Some of them  are  able  to\r\n\r\nspeak  Indian and Tamil. Of the 51 assistant  instruc\r\n\r\ntors  working in the creches and children's  centres,\r\n\r\n32  are educated in Chinese and seven are educated in\r\n\r\nboth Chinese and English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have sufficient books produced locally for\r\n\r\nthe children to read. It is regrettable that there is\r\n\r\na  shortage of locally-produced books for reading. As\r\n\r\nlong  as  the  contents of the books are healthy  and\r\n\r\neducative to the children and not pernicious  to  our\r\n\r\npolicy  of patriotism an-d nationalism, they  can  be\r\n\r\nused  in  the creches. It does not matter where  they\r\n\r\nare produced. Books which provide lessons in singing,\r\n\r\n-dancing  and  handicraft are useful to the  children\r\n\r\nand  we have seen the works of these children in  the\r\n\r\nvarious exhibitions held so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of quantity of food, the decision\r\n\r\nrests  with  the experts. If they are of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  the quantity of food is insufficient, they will\r\n\r\nlook  into it. I think Members should not worry about\r\n\r\nthis  because almost all the children in the  creches\r\n\r\nhave  very fat and round faces.

The setting  up\r\n\r\nof  creches in the industrial areas is logical.  Many\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the lower income group are  employed  in\r\n\r\nindustries. It is a good suggestion that they can put\r\n\r\ntheir  children in creches while they go to  work  in\r\n\r\nthe  day-time. As I have said, creches have not  been\r\n\r\nextensively used. But I will look into the matter  if\r\n\r\nthere is a greater need for creches in the rural  and\r\n\r\nindustrial areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has not answered one  of  the\r\n\r\npoints I have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am sorry I\r\n\r\nforgot to reply to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta said a few days ago that the\r\n\r\ncreches  should remain open in the evenings.

During last year's debate on the Estimates  in\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply, I raised a certain point  and  I\r\n\r\nwas  told  that the matter could be referred  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  action. One year has now  elapsed  and\r\n\r\nthere is still no action yet. Therefore, I am raising\r\n\r\nthis  point again this year. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\ndo  something in respect of the points I  am  raising\r\n\r\nand  give  sympathetic consideration to the voice  of\r\n\r\nthe poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Amendment No. (3) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be reduced by $10 in rspect of subhead 1152.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, our people are self-respecting. It\r\n\r\nis only when they have no other alternative that they\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  Public  Assistance  Section  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance.  There are many kinds of  people  in  the\r\n\r\nworld. There are well-off people who shamelessly seek\r\n\r\npublic   assistance.  I  will,  therefore,  ask   the\r\n\r\nMinister to reassess the situation so that the  names\r\n\r\nof those who are not in need of public assistance can\r\n\r\nbe struck off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention the case of some recipients\r\n\r\nof  public assistance. In my constituency, there  are\r\n\r\nwidows  with seven or eight children who are neglected  when their mothers go to work. When these mothers\r\n\r\nare  unable  to  maintain their families,  they  seek\r\n\r\npublic assistance. If an applicant is suffering  from\r\n\r\ntuberculosis or a disability, he gets more, otherwise\r\n\r\nhe  gets $40 a month. The expenditure of a family  of\r\n\r\neight  living in an attap house is smaller than  that\r\n\r\nof  a similar family who are required to resettle  in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flats. Although the rent of a  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flat is only about $20 a month, such a  family\r\n\r\nmay  find it difficult to make ends meet as they have\r\n\r\nto pay an additional $10 or $20 a month for water and  electricity. So some members of the household take\r\n\r\nin  washing and earn about $10 or $15 a month. But if\r\n\r\nthe  inspectors of the Public Assistance Section find\r\n\r\nout  that they are getting an additional income  from\r\n\r\nother sources,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   amount  of  money  that  they  get  as   public\r\n\r\nassistance will be cut the following month. When this\r\n\r\nhappens,  they  come sorrowfully  to  our  \"meet-the-people  sessions\" and the only thing that we  can  do\r\n\r\nfor them is to approach the Public Assistance Section\r\n\r\nand  plead on their behalf. The difficulty of the pro\r\n\r\nblem  lies  in  the  policy of the Public  Assistance\r\n\r\nSection  which  stops paying public assistance  to  a\r\n\r\nfamily  that  is  earning  an  additional  income.  I\r\n\r\npersonally think this is wrong because such  families\r\n\r\nare  not getting sufficient public assistance. So  we\r\n\r\nshould  give them sympathetic consideration. But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if a recipient family is earning  more  than\r\n\r\n$100 a month, their public assistance can be cut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe know that fleece is got from a sheep. So if we are\r\n\r\nmillionaires, we can say, \"I will give you as much as\r\n\r\nyou want.\" But in the final analysis, the money comes\r\n\r\nfrom the taxes paid by the people. Of course, we have\r\n\r\ngood  intentions, but we must face realities. We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  the Minister for Finance has given  us  a\r\n\r\ncertain  sum of money. If we are going to give  money\r\n\r\nto  anyone  who claims that he is in -dire  need,  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  able  to  fulfil  our  obligations.  I\r\n\r\nremember on one occasion the Minister gave $10  to  a\r\n\r\nperson   at  a  \"meet-the-people  session\"  when   he\r\n\r\ncomplained  that  he was in dire straits.  Very  soon\r\n\r\nafterwards, many people came for similar requests.  I\r\n\r\nsympathise  with what the Member for Delta  has  said\r\n\r\nregarding the plight of the poor people, that because\r\n\r\nof the inability of the Government to give sufficient\r\n\r\npublic  assistance some members of a family  have  to\r\n\r\ntake in washing to earn an additional income and that\r\n\r\nthis  may result in a cut in their public assistance.\r\n\r\nThe  Public Assistance Section is in charge of public\r\n\r\nmoney.  Although we have to help the poor people,  at\r\n\r\ntimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey may not be satisfied with what they get.

It must be admitted  that\r\n\r\nfire  fighting  in  certain slum areas  is  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult  because  of  the  congestion  of  squatter\r\n\r\nhouses and the lack of fire fighting facilities, such\r\n\r\nas  fire  hydrants.

I have some suggestions to make on\r\n\r\nthis  subhead.  It  is  important  that  agricultural\r\n\r\nknowledge  should  be imparted to  prisoners  serving\r\n\r\ntheir sentences. Most of the prisoners' time is spent\r\n\r\nin  acquiring  industrial know-how. This  is  a  good\r\n\r\npolicy  on the part of the Prison Department. We  can\r\n\r\ntrain people in industrial know-how to cope with  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme. However, although  these\r\n\r\nprisoners  have  committed  offences,  we  hope  that\r\n\r\nduring  the time that they spend in prison they  will\r\n\r\nacquire  certain knowledge and skills. Most of  these\r\n\r\nprisoners  are  secret society members.  They  landed\r\n\r\nthemselves  in prison because they had no jobs.  They\r\n\r\nwere  forced  to  extort money from people  and  they\r\n\r\ncommitted  other  crimes. In prison  they  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  an  opportunity to acquire  a  skill  in  some\r\n\r\ntrade.  I have a suggestion. As far as I know,  these\r\n\r\nprisoners are now acquiring a knowledge of industrial\r\n\r\nknow-how.  They are learning only the  basic  skills.\r\n\r\nSince  we  are going to spend so much money  on  this\r\n\r\nitem,  the  Prison  Department should  see  that  the\r\n\r\nprisoners  are given proper training in the acquiring\r\n\r\nof  technical  skills. The goods which  they  produce\r\n\r\nshould  also be put up for sale in shops outside  the\r\n\r\nprison.  This  will encourage them  to  acquire  more\r\n\r\nskill  and  knowledge and thereby earn  more  income.\r\n\r\nThey can make better use of their leisure time during\r\n\r\ntheir  term  of imprisonment. They will thus  discard\r\n\r\ntheir  bad habits and ways. This is a kind of reform.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  necessary to mete out any punishment  in\r\n\r\norder to reform them. Their leisure time can be taken\r\n\r\nup with the acquiring of technical skill in trade and\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, briefly, our\r\n\r\nprisoners are being trained in various types of jobs.\r\n\r\nWe  have  gone  beyond  the original  concept  of  re\r\n\r\nhabilitating  them.
