The  Ministry of Health  is  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nlimitations  of the Ad Hoc Industrial Health  Unit\r\n\r\nwhich  was  set up in October 1967 with a  limited\r\n\r\nstaff  consisting of a part-time medical  officer,\r\n\r\nan inspector of factories and a few office staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the visit of an expert on occupational\r\n\r\nhealth  from the International Labour Organisation\r\n\r\nin  1967-68, recommendations were put  forward  to\r\n\r\nexpand the Ad Hoc Industrial Health Unit in  terms\r\n\r\nof  staff  and activities. My Ministry  recognises\r\n\r\nthe  need to establish a more effective Industrial\r\n\r\nHealth Unit to promote industrial health which  is\r\n\r\nincumbent upon our rapid industrial growth. A plan\r\n\r\nto  expand the industrial Health Unit in terms  of\r\n\r\nstaff  and activities is already in hand.  In  the\r\n\r\nprovision for more staff, it is envisaged  that  a\r\n\r\nfull-time   medical  officer  and  an   industrial\r\n\r\nhygienist  with  an  engineering  background,   in\r\n\r\naddition  to  eight  other professional  and  non-professional staff, would be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the second part\r\n\r\nof  the  question which is regarding the expanding\r\n\r\nof   the   Unit  and  increasing  its   functional\r\n\r\nactivities.

For instance, one of the items  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule on page 106 of Volume II of the  Laws  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, 1955\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nedition,  substitutes \"Assistant Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour\" for \"Assistant Controller for Labour\".  As\r\n\r\n\"Assistant  Controller of Labour\", the old  title,\r\n\r\nno  longer appears in any laws or documents, it is\r\n\r\nremoved along with a number of other items set out\r\n\r\nin  Part I of the Schedule to the motion and which\r\n\r\nare no longer required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way is to add items to the Schedule\r\n\r\nto   the   Ordinance   where   there   have   been\r\n\r\ndepartmental changes and the old titles  or  names\r\n\r\nare  still  likely to be found in  laws  and  documents.  To  take an example, the office of  \"Extra\r\n\r\nAssistant  Commissioner for  Labour\"  was  changed\r\n\r\nlast year to \"Principal Assistant Commissioner for\r\n\r\nLabour\",  but the old name still appears  in  some\r\n\r\nlaws and other documents. The addition of this and\r\n\r\nother  items  in  Part II of the Schedule  to  the\r\n\r\nmotion  will  ensure that wherever a reference  to\r\n\r\none  of the obsolete titles and names occurs,  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding new title will be substituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance provides in section 3 that\r\n\r\nadditions  and amendments to the Schedule  may  be\r\n\r\neffected by a resolution at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of\r\n\r\nthe  Departmental  Titles  (Alteration)  Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  55), resolves that the Schedule  to  the\r\n\r\nsaid  Ordinance  be amended by the deletion  under\r\n\r\nthe  headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and\r\n\r\n\"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively of  the\r\n\r\nitems,  shown in Part I of the following Schedule,\r\n\r\nand  by  the addition under the headings  of  \"Old\r\n\r\nTitle or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of\r\n\r\nOffice\", respectively of the items shown  in  Part\r\n\r\nII of the said Schedule+.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n+  The  Schedule is reproduced as an  appendix at cols. 217-32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1969/19691222/19691222-HA-0290217.pdf\"\">Appendix to Mr Barker's motion on \"Department Titles\" at column 181(Cols 0217-0232)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STATUTE LAW REVISION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

I am afraid\r\n\r\nour workers in the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nare  going to face the same problems as the result\r\n\r\nof  the parcelling out of our housing estates  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of maintenance and servicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill, while it still embodies the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that the privilege of homeownership  is\r\n\r\nassociated  with  the  responsibility  of   taking\r\n\r\ncharge of the maintenance and servicing facilities\r\n\r\nthrough  the  management corporations by  widening\r\n\r\nthe  basis for such management corporations, helps\r\n\r\nto   minimise  the  undesirable  effect   of   the\r\n\r\nfragmentation  of maintenance services.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,   it  prevents  mushrooming  of  management\r\n\r\ncorporations  in any one housing  estate  and,  as\r\n\r\nsuch, I welcome\r\n\r\nit.  However, I would like to ask the Minister  if\r\n\r\nhe  can assure the House that, as a result of  the\r\n\r\nformation  of  such  management corporations,  the\r\n\r\nemployees in the Housing and Development Board who\r\n\r\nare  at  the moment maintaining and servicing  the\r\n\r\nBoard  flats will not become redundant or,  alternatively,  would it be possible for the  Board  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  providing maintenance and  other  allied\r\n\r\nservices  in the blocks of flats which  have  been\r\n\r\nsold  to  the  public by charging  the  homeowners\r\n\r\neconomic rates for the services so provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In raising this point, I have also in mind the\r\n\r\npossibility  that gangsters and other  anti-social\r\n\r\nelements may attempt to muscle and cash in on  the\r\n\r\nsituation. We are all aware of the racket of swill-collection  in  the  housing  estates  until   the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board  completely  took\r\n\r\ncharge.

Where,  for  example, the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  accedes to a request of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  return a fugitive accused  of  the\r\n\r\nmurder  of a child that he had kidnapped, the  use\r\n\r\nof  the words \"any other offence\" under section 31\r\n\r\nof our Act as at present drafted would enable that\r\n\r\nperson  to be convicted of kidnapping with  intent\r\n\r\nto  murder  which under our law carries  the  same\r\n\r\npenalty as murder - the offence for which  he  was\r\n\r\nreturned. The offence of kidnapping with intent to\r\n\r\nmurder is not therefore \"a lesser offence\" to that\r\n\r\nof murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, therefore, the existing provisions in our\r\n\r\nAct  are  amended  as proposed in  the  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government would be obliged to give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  undertaking to the Government  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  every  time  it seeks  the  return  of  a\r\n\r\nfugitive  offender that he will only be tried  for\r\n\r\nthe offence for which he was returned, or a lesser\r\n\r\noffence  based  on proof of the same  facts.  This\r\n\r\nwould  lead to unnecessary inconvenience and delay\r\n\r\nin  the  rendition of a fugitive.  The  amendments\r\n\r\nproposed in clauses 4 and 6 of the Bill will  thus\r\n\r\nobviate   the   necessity  of   giving   such   an\r\n\r\nundertaking  every time we seek the  return  of  a\r\n\r\nfugitive offender from the United Kingdom  or  any\r\n\r\nother  Commonwealth country which has adopted  the\r\n\r\n\"speciality rule\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has also been taken in this Bill to\r\n\r\nmake  a  drafting amendment to the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"extradition  crime\"  in  relation   both   to   a\r\n\r\nCommonwealth country and to a foreign  state,  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  make it clear that a District Judge  has\r\n\r\nall   the  powers  that  are  conferred   upon   a\r\n\r\nMagistrate  under the Extradition Act.

Unlike law, medicine  or  accountancy,\r\n\r\nthe practice of engineering is not governed by any\r\n\r\nsubstantial  written  law,  and  the  800  or   so\r\n\r\npractising  engineers can only be  registered,  if\r\n\r\nthey so desire, as practising architects. With the\r\n\r\nneed  today  for  more  sophisticated  engineering\r\n\r\nprojects, the Government feels the time  has  come\r\n\r\nto  legislate for the compulsory registration  and\r\n\r\ncontrol of practising engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to provide, inter alia, for the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a Professional  Engineers  Board\r\n\r\nwhich will be responsible for the registration  of\r\n\r\nall  practising engineers. The Board will regulate\r\n\r\nthe  practice and will hear and determine disputes\r\n\r\nrelating to their profession, and it will have the\r\n\r\npower to cancel the registration of a professional\r\n\r\nengineer, or suspend him for as long as it  thinks\r\n\r\nfit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision has been made to empower the Board in\r\n\r\nthe  event  of any prima facie defect in  work  or\r\n\r\nprima  facie  negligence to suspend  forthwith  the\r\n\r\nengineer  responsible from further performance  of\r\n\r\nhis  profession  for  a  period  of  time  pending\r\n\r\nfurther  investigation and the final  decision  of\r\n\r\nthe Board.

Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Third time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill was introduced in this House,\r\n\r\nI  emphasised the fact that the proposed abolition\r\n\r\nof the jury had not been conceived impulsively but\r\n\r\nthat Government had given considerable thought  to\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  and  could not ignore  experiences  in\r\n\r\nrecent  trials  by jury. I would not  hesitate  to\r\n\r\nreiterate  that rather than allow  justice  to  be\r\n\r\nthwarted,   through   either   squeamishness    or\r\n\r\nignorance,   Government   is   prepared   whenever\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the well-being of the community  to\r\n\r\namend the procedural methods of administering  the\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opponents to the Bill had asked whether we had\r\n\r\nany  positive  evidence that the jury  system  had\r\n\r\nfailed. Because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  these objections, this Bill was sent to Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many written representations were received by the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  of  which 11 were  accepted  as  being\r\n\r\nrelevant,  and these are annexed to the Report  as\r\n\r\nAppendix  II.  Most of these representations  were\r\n\r\nfrom  advocates and solicitors and one from  their\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Oral  evidence  was  heard  from   seven\r\n\r\nmembers  of one jury and three members of  another\r\n\r\njury, who sat in two trials for murder held in the\r\n\r\nfew  weeks  since the Second Reading of the  Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  Deputy Registrar of the High Court also  gave\r\n\r\nevidence.  Six representatives of the  Council  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Advocates and  Solicitors  Society\r\n\r\nwere heard and given the opportunity to listen  to\r\n\r\na  recorded  tape  of the evidence  given  by  the\r\n\r\njurors.  They  were also given the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexamine these jurors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence heard by the Select Committee\r\n\r\nstrengthened and confirmed Government's view  that\r\n\r\ntrial by jury in capital cases should be abolished\r\n\r\naltogether.  In  one  case it  appeared  that  the\r\n\r\nforeman  of  the jury had innocently  delivered  a\r\n\r\nmistaken  verdict. Three members of the  jury  had\r\n\r\nvoted  for murder, and four for culpable  homicide\r\n\r\nnot  amounting  to murder. Such a  verdict  would,\r\n\r\nunder  our law, result in a retrial. Instead,  the\r\n\r\nverdict delivered was an unanimous verdict for the\r\n\r\nlesser  offence. When the foreman  returned  home,\r\n\r\nhis  conscience  pricked him and  subsequently  he\r\n\r\ninformed  the Deputy Registrar of the  High  Court\r\n\r\nabout  the mistake. But nothing could be  done  to\r\n\r\nrectify  the  mistake  as  the  jury  was  functus\r\n\r\nofficio.  In  the second case after  an  unanimous\r\n\r\nverdict for murder had been delivered, one of  the\r\n\r\njurors  was very upset when the sentence of  death\r\n\r\nwas  passed. He was under the impression that  the\r\n\r\naccused would at the most be given a sentence  for\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nearly all the ten jurors said that they\r\n\r\nwere  reluctant to serve on juries and would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  happier  had they not been  called.  It  was\r\n\r\napparent   that   a  few  did  not   have   enough\r\n\r\nunderstanding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the English language to follow the proceedings\r\n\r\nin court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Bar Council, after having heard\r\n\r\nthe  evidence  and having examined some  of  these\r\n\r\njurors,  submitted a further note on this Bill  to\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In July of this year when the Council's original\r\n\r\nMemorandum  to the Select Committee was submitted,\r\n\r\nthere  was no positive evidence available  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  apart  from  the statistics  showing  the\r\n\r\nrelative  number  of  convictions  and  acquittals\r\n\r\nwhich  would give any reliable information  as  to\r\n\r\nthe precise detailed working of the Jury System as\r\n\r\nit  is  at present administered in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nreason  for  this  was no doubt  the  longstanding\r\n\r\ntradition  that  what happens  behind  the  closed\r\n\r\ndoors of a Jury Room after the Jury has retired is\r\n\r\nnever  disclosed. It was because of this  lack  of\r\n\r\nevidence  that the Council urged in  its  original\r\n\r\nMemorandum  that  Government should  give  further\r\n\r\nconsideration to the issue as a whole in  a  wider\r\n\r\ncontext,  and  in  giving their  evidence  to  the\r\n\r\nSelect   Committee  the  representatives  of   the\r\n\r\nCouncil  canvassed  the  possibility  of  a   full\r\n\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July, the Select Committee has heard\r\n\r\nevidence  including that given by 7  members  from\r\n\r\none  jury and 3 from another, the substance of all\r\n\r\nof  which  and the actual transcript and recording\r\n\r\nof  the  greater  part  of  which  has  been  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  the  Council's representatives  and\r\n\r\nthrough them by permission of the Chairman of  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee to the remaining members of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil,  This evidence has to some extent  opened\r\n\r\nthe closed doors of the Jury Room. The details are\r\n\r\ncontained in the record of the proceedings of  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, and it would be superfluous  to\r\n\r\nset them out again in this Memorandum. Suffice  it\r\n\r\nto  say that if the state of affairs disclosed  in\r\n\r\nthe   evidence  is  typical  of  Jury  trials   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a whole, all members of the  Council\r\n\r\nare    satisfied   that   there    is    something\r\n\r\nfundamentally wrong with jury trials as  they  now\r\n\r\noperate  and that some remedial measures  must  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at this stage that opinions among\r\n\r\nindividual  members  of  the  Council   begin   to\r\n\r\ndiffer.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bar then reiterated that the majority of\r\n\r\ntheir  members  still felt that  the  Jury  System\r\n\r\nshould  be retained. On the assumption that  their\r\n\r\nviews  for the retention of the Jury would not  be\r\n\r\naccepted,  the Bar made further suggestions,  most\r\n\r\nof which have been accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result, in all capital cases:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The accused will be tried by a Court of two\r\n\r\nJudges, one of whom shall be the presiding Judge.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Both Judges must agree that the accused is\r\n\r\nguilty as charged before he can be convicted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If they cannot agree, he shall not be\r\n\r\nconvicted of that offence but may be convicted  of\r\n\r\nany  lesser  offence  based  on  the  same  facts,\r\n\r\nprovided, of course, both Judges again agree.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Upon all questions relating to procedure and\r\n\r\nthe  admission  or rejection of evidence  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of a trial, the presiding Judge shall have\r\n\r\na casting vote in the event of disagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would put it to the House that\r\n\r\nthe  case for the total abolition of the Jury  has\r\n\r\nbeen  proved beyond reasonable doubt,  as  can  be\r\n\r\nseen from the Report of the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the basic principles of\r\n\r\ndemocracy is that \"justice must not only  be  done\r\n\r\nbut  must be seen to be done\". While I agree  that\r\n\r\ndoing  away  with the jury system might  save  the\r\n\r\ncourt   some   precious  time,  because   a   jury\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  laymen may sometimes  be  slow  in\r\n\r\ngrasping  the complicated points of law,  I  would\r\n\r\nmaintain  that it is better to waste some precious\r\n\r\ntime  of the court than to stop the clock unjustly\r\n\r\nand  perpetually  for  the  accused.  Whether  our\r\n\r\nactions  are  considered wrong or seriously  wrong\r\n\r\ndepend on the yardstick used to measure them.  And\r\n\r\nwhen  a  man's  life is at stake for some  offence\r\n\r\nthat  he  has been charged with, such  as  murder,\r\n\r\nthen  the yardstick used to measure him should  be\r\n\r\nthe  yardstick that he and other common people  of\r\n\r\nsociety use to measure themselves. Whilst  I  hold\r\n\r\nour  Judges in high respect, I maintain that trial\r\n\r\nby  jury  under the guidance of the judge  is  the\r\n\r\nleast  we  can give to a fellow man before  he  is\r\n\r\ncondemned to the gallows, and I am sure that it is\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrule  rather  than the exception  that  the  Judge\r\n\r\nagrees with the verdict of the jurymen. For  every\r\n\r\ncase in which the jurymen had unanimously given  a\r\n\r\nwrong  verdict, therefore, there must  be  a  case\r\n\r\nwhere an experienced Judge could also have given a\r\n\r\nwrong verdict. In such a case, it is not so much a\r\n\r\nfailure of the system as a human failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed fortunate that we have a panel of\r\n\r\nJudges  who  are  strong enough to  pass  judgment\r\n\r\nwithout  fear  or  favour. But with  the  best  of\r\n\r\nintentions, we cannot say this for all time in the\r\n\r\nfuture, perhaps 20, 50 or 100 years to come. While\r\n\r\nwe are sure that our Judges are not subject to any\r\n\r\nGovernment  pressure,  we  cannot  be  sure  about\r\n\r\nfuture  Judges. The retention of the  jury  system\r\n\r\nis,  in  my  opinion, the best guarantee  for  the\r\n\r\npresent and for the future, for it is less  likely\r\n\r\nthat  all  seven jurymen can make the  same  wrong\r\n\r\njudgment  at  the same time and it is  not  likely\r\n\r\nthat any future government could apply pressure to\r\n\r\nall  the  seven jurymen who are selected from  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of life. Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect\r\n\r\nto the Minister, I cannot support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It will also  meet\r\n\r\nour   citizens'  demand  that  the  administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery should provide sufficient safeguards  to\r\n\r\nprotect their rights and liberty so that they  can\r\n\r\nsafely go about their business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will also reduce the possibility of\r\n\r\nerror  in  a trial where a man's life is at  stake\r\n\r\nand ensure that in a murder trial both the accused\r\n\r\nand  the murdered person will receive justice. The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  referred to  the  evidence  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect   Committee's  Report   when   the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee heard evidence from some ten members  of\r\n\r\nthe jury who had served in two recent trials. I am\r\n\r\nsure  if  Members  go through the  record  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee, they will see for themselves the things\r\n\r\nthat  happen in the jury room in Singapore. And  I\r\n\r\nam  sure they will join us in wishing to see  this\r\n\r\nBill  passed as soon as possible so that  a  trial\r\n\r\nfor  a  man's  life is not reduced to  a  game  of\r\n\r\nchance.  Sir,  we have to ensure that  justice  is\r\n\r\ndone  to an accused person on the basis of whether\r\n\r\nor  not he has actually committed the offence, and\r\n\r\nnot  whether  he is able to engage a good  lawyer.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a  suggestion to  raise  the  academic\r\n\r\nqualification  or the standard of English  of  our\r\n\r\njuries  as a solution to the problem, But I  doubt\r\n\r\nif  this  will really help. We have had a  special\r\n\r\njuror  who was a professional man trained overseas\r\n\r\nand  yet who fumbled over the terms commonly  used\r\n\r\nin  a murder trial. It is a matter of attitude. It\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  of understanding the fact  that  at\r\n\r\ntimes there are certain unpleasant things in  life\r\n\r\nwe just have to do. That really is the crux of the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave of the House to refer to the\r\n\r\nsubmission  of  a local journalist  and  also,  as\r\n\r\npointed  out by the Minister, that of  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nRegistrar of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh  Court. Both of them have intimate  knowledge\r\n\r\nof  the  working of the jury system, and  both  of\r\n\r\nthem were convinced that the jury system must  go.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course,  we  cannot  prevent  frustrated\r\n\r\npoliticians who have been left way behind  by  the\r\n\r\nprogress of time from attempting to make political\r\n\r\ncapital out of such an issue. I really do not  see\r\n\r\nthe  wisdom  of  such a move. One can  accuse  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   of  preparing  the  way   for   total\r\n\r\ndictatorship or totalitarianism, but one will soon\r\n\r\nbite one's tongue when one is permitted to hold  a\r\n\r\npublic rally in Fullerton Square on the issue over\r\n\r\nwhich  the accusation was made. It will be  better\r\n\r\nif   everyone  will  sincerely  search   his   own\r\n\r\nconscience and ask himself if the jury system  has\r\n\r\nreally worked well in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to conclude by expressing my full\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the Bill as reported by the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  I  have  no  reservation  at  all   in\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  Government on  this  issue.  Some\r\n\r\npeople    have    been   insinuating    that    we\r\n\r\nParliamentarians will not oppose the Bill for fear\r\n\r\nof  being  expelled  and,  therefore,  losing  our\r\n\r\nseats.  Let  me take this opportunity to  make  it\r\n\r\nclear   to   everyone  concerned   that   we,   as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people, will  support  the\r\n\r\nBill or, for that matter, any other Bill worthy of\r\n\r\nsupport, because  we realise  that  we  are  good\r\n\r\nenough  to administer our affairs, and, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  are bold enough to face the facts and have the\r\n\r\ncourage of our convictions. In this case, Sir, the\r\n\r\nfact is that the jury system has been proved to be\r\n\r\nunworkable in Singapore and we have the courage to\r\n\r\nsay so and to vote for scrapping it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you may recall that I rose to\r\n\r\nspeak against the Bill on its Second Reading. As a\r\n\r\nlayman, I had certain misgivings and I raised  two\r\n\r\nrelevant points to substantiate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy objection. The two issues I  raised,\r\n\r\nif I may quote, are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 'Singapore can ill afford the luxury of\r\n\r\nhaving three Judges to be fully occupied with  one\r\n\r\ntrial;' and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) I objected to clause 3 of the Bill which\r\n\r\nsought  to  amend Chapter 21, section 178  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in support of the second point, I also said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If three learned Judges cannot arrive at a\r\n\r\ndecision,  then  I suggest that some  doubts  have\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  and  I  feel the  case  deserves  an\r\n\r\nacquittal,  and  not another trial before  another\r\n\r\ncourt,  consisting  of three Judges  of  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt   other  than  those  who  had   tried   him\r\n\r\npreviously.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to the Bill as contained in\r\n\r\nthe  Report  of the Select Committee have,  in  my\r\n\r\nview,  taken care of the objections that I  raised\r\n\r\nthen, instead of the luxury of having three Judges\r\n\r\ntrying one case, now we have the bare necessity of\r\n\r\ntwo Judges sitting in one case at a time. In fact,\r\n\r\na  member of a legal firm which almost exclusively\r\n\r\ndeals  with  criminal cases has advocated  in  his\r\n\r\nwritten memorandum trial by two Judges instead  of\r\n\r\nthree. My objections to clause 3 of the Bill which\r\n\r\nsought to amend Chapter 21, section 178, have also\r\n\r\nbeen  met.  The  Bill  as  amended  now  reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where the two Judges fail to reach an unanimous\r\n\r\ndecision  as  to  the guilt of an accused  charged\r\n\r\nwith an offence in respect of which punishment  of\r\n\r\ndeath  is  authorised  by law,  he  shall  not  he\r\n\r\nconvicted  of  that offence but may,  if  the  two\r\n\r\nJudges  agree, be convicted of any lesser  offence\r\n\r\nof  which he could have been charged based on  the\r\n\r\nsame facts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that where the failure to reach an\r\n\r\nunanimous decision as to the guilt of the  accused\r\n\r\nrests  on  the ground that one of the two  Judges\r\n\r\nhas  acquitted him by reason of the provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection  362 of this Code, then the accused  shall\r\n\r\nnot  be convicted of the offence with which he has\r\n\r\nbeen charged but shall be dealt with in accordance\r\n\r\nwith the provisions of section 363 of this Code.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if the two Judges do not\r\n\r\nunanimously agree on the guilt of the accused, the\r\n\r\naccused  has  to  be  acquitted.  With  this   new\r\n\r\namendment,  no accused person will be tried  twice\r\n\r\nfor the same offence or placed in peril\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  his  life twice as originally proposed in  the\r\n\r\nBill\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, the Report o the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  has  taken  care  of  both  the\r\n\r\nobjections  which  I  raised  during  the   Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had the privilege of being a Member of the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee which considered the Bill.  After\r\n\r\nhearing the views expressed by the various persons\r\n\r\nwho gave oral evidence before the Select Committee\r\n\r\nand  reading the representations submitted,  I  am\r\n\r\nthoroughly  convinced that  jury  trials  are  not\r\n\r\nworkable  in  Singapore. Sir, we also  heard  oral\r\n\r\nevidence from some persons who had sat as  jurors.\r\n\r\nWe  heard  that  in  one  case  involving  special\r\n\r\njurors, who   were  supposed  to  possess   high\r\n\r\neducational  qualifications, the foreman  declared\r\n\r\nthe  verdict  to  be unanimous,  as  the  Minister\r\n\r\npointed out earlier, when in actual fact there was\r\n\r\nnot  even  a majority decision. One juror  claimed\r\n\r\nthat the accused person should have been acquitted\r\n\r\non  the  grounds of self-defence when neither  the\r\n\r\nprosecution nor the defence ever raised the  issue\r\n\r\nof self-defence, as there was no question of self-defence at all. Another juror admitted that he did\r\n\r\nnot pay much attention to the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the language used in our courts is English.\r\n\r\nWe  had  a special juror who was classified  as  a\r\n\r\nspecial   juror   because   of   his   educational\r\n\r\nqualifications  and  yet who pronounced  the  word\r\n\r\n\"unanimous\" as \"universe\" and \"culpable  homicide\"\r\n\r\nwhich sounded like \"cumable suicide\". Sir, in  the\r\n\r\ncase  where  the  foreman  wrongly  announced  the\r\n\r\nverdict  to the Judge, his fellow jurors  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  any  qualms about it but happily  went  home\r\n\r\nwithout  attempting to draw the court's  attention\r\n\r\nto the foreman's mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One foreman said he was trembling, sweating and\r\n\r\nwas  nervous on the day the trial ended. In  reply\r\n\r\nto  a  question  whether he and his fellow  jurors\r\n\r\nwere  able  to follow the evidence, he said  about\r\n\r\none  or two or maybe three did not seem to be able\r\n\r\nto  follow  the case properly. A leading  criminal\r\n\r\nlawyer,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  also  gave  oral evidence after  hearing  the\r\n\r\nrecorded testimony by the jurors, freely confessed\r\n\r\nthat,  \"I  recognise that three out of  the  seven\r\n\r\njurors  I  heard did not strike me as  having  the\r\n\r\nquality for responsible judgment.\" Sir, if amongst\r\n\r\nthe  seven jurors, three did not follow  the  case\r\n\r\nproperly,  I  submit it is not worth  having  jury\r\n\r\ntrials.  We were also told by people who had  been\r\n\r\njurors  that one man amongst the jurors  can  sway\r\n\r\nthe decision of other jurors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one juror who was so influenced perhaps by\r\n\r\nthe  Perry Mason series in our T.V. programmes said\r\n\r\nthat  in the case where he was a juror, if it  had\r\n\r\nbeen  tried in an American court the accused would\r\n\r\nhave  been acquitted if he had a good lawyer.  And\r\n\r\nthis  was the very same juror who had voted for  a\r\n\r\nverdict  of  not guilty. But when  he  found  that\r\n\r\nthere was a tie in the voting, he immediately said\r\n\r\nto  the foreman, \"Can I just change my verdict  to\r\n\r\n\"Manslaughter\"?\" Sir, he was convinced the man was\r\n\r\nnot guilty, but on finding that there was a tie in\r\n\r\nthe  voting, he immediately decided to vote for  a\r\n\r\nverdict  of guilty. The foreman in that case  said\r\n\r\nthe juror had changed his mind immediately and the\r\n\r\njuror  himself  admitted that it  took  him  about\r\n\r\nthree  minutes  to  change his mind.  On  his  own\r\n\r\nadmission,  within three minutes, he  had  changed\r\n\r\nhis mind from letting a man free to sending him to\r\n\r\ngaol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another juror, though she knew that the foreman\r\n\r\nwas  going  to  announce a verdict different  from\r\n\r\nthat  arrived  at  by the jurors, disclaimed  her\r\n\r\nresponsibility   by   justifying   in   her    own\r\n\r\nwords:\"..if  we continued arguing, it would  never\r\n\r\nend.\" One juror, when asked for her reaction  when\r\n\r\nshe  heard the incorrect verdict conveyed  to  the\r\n\r\nJudge, said, \"I think we had done our duty. We had\r\n\r\ncast our vote and that is that.\" Sir, an incorrect\r\n\r\nverdict  had been given and this juror  maintained\r\n\r\nthat she had done her duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in that particular case, as the Minister\r\n\r\npointed out earlier, the verdict reached was  four\r\n\r\nin favour of culpable homicide and three in favour\r\n\r\nof guilty of first-degree murder. Sir, you are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naware,  and  as the Minister pointed out  earlier,\r\n\r\nthat  we  need at least a five to two majority  to\r\n\r\ncall it a majority decision. The foreman announced\r\n\r\nthat  there was an unanimous verdict for  culpable\r\n\r\nhomicide and the accused was accordingly sentenced\r\n\r\nto  imprisonment. The interesting point is, we may\r\n\r\nask  ourselves, what if the voting had taken place\r\n\r\ndifferently?  If  four had voted  for  murder  and\r\n\r\nthree  had voted for culpable homicide and if  the\r\n\r\nforeman had announced that there was a verdict  of\r\n\r\nguilty of murder, then the accused would have been\r\n\r\nsent  to the gallows. A grave and irreparable  act\r\n\r\nof injustice would have been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another member of the legal profession, who\r\n\r\nrepresented the Council of the Singapore Advocates\r\n\r\nand  Solicitors  Society, after having  heard  the\r\n\r\nrecorded  testimony of seven jurors,  also  freely\r\n\r\nconfessed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After hearing the tape and reading the\r\n\r\ntranscript  that  was handed to  us,  I  find  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the transcript very shocking. Never had\r\n\r\nI  imagined  that this was the level  of  the  so-called  richer  experience and understanding  that\r\n\r\nthe  juries  are being credited with. If  this  is\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the whole of the  jury  system,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say,  Sir, that the jury  system  is  not\r\n\r\nworking at all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after having the benefit of hearing some\r\n\r\njurors and having read the written representations\r\n\r\nfrom  members of the legal profession as  well  as\r\n\r\nothers,  I have no doubt whatsoever that the  jury\r\n\r\nsystem  has not worked and will not work  properly\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  In  fact, a member  of  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession in his written submission admitted that\r\n\r\nif  he had committed a crime, he would rather have\r\n\r\na  jury  try his case in the hope that his counsel\r\n\r\nwould either confuse the jurors sufficiently so as\r\n\r\nto  cause  them  to disagree among themselves,  or\r\n\r\nsucceed in setting off an emotional chain reaction\r\n\r\nby   appealing   to   their   pity   or   sympathy\r\n\r\nirrespective  of the justice of the case.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  he said, if he were not  guilty,  he\r\n\r\nwould   choose  a  Judge  because,   through   his\r\n\r\nexperience and training, he would have  a  greater\r\n\r\nability to discern the truth.

The end result of this deliberation, Sir,\r\n\r\nis the modification of certain basic provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  Two  Judges would try  an  offence  in\r\n\r\nrespect   of  which  the  penalty  of   death   is\r\n\r\nauthorised  by  law - a presiding  Judge  and  one\r\n\r\nother.  The decision of the court as to the  guilt\r\n\r\nof  the accused in respect of such a charge  would\r\n\r\nbe  arrived at unanimously. Failure to  have  such\r\n\r\nunanimity  would bar conviction on the charge  but\r\n\r\nwould  allow a conviction on a lesser offence  and\r\n\r\nonly  if  the  two  Judges agree  that  the  facts\r\n\r\njustify   such  a  conviction.  All  interlocutory\r\n\r\nquestions  would  be determined by  the  presiding\r\n\r\nJudge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, it cannot be doubted that these\r\n\r\nsuggestions  have been received in the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nwanting  to  make the system work efficiently  and\r\n\r\neffectively, and the purport of the Bill cannot be\r\n\r\nimputed to be otherwise. Sir, that the jury system\r\n\r\nhas  not  been working as expected, I  think,  has\r\n\r\napparently the agreement of the members of the Bar\r\n\r\nCouncil.  This  turn  of  mind  came  after  their\r\n\r\nmembers  became  informed of the deficiencies  and\r\n\r\nerrors of the jury system by the jurors themselves\r\n\r\nin Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case referred to by the Minister, the\r\n\r\nforeman of the jury gave vent to an expression  of\r\n\r\nacute   dissatisfaction  with  the  system.   This\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction presumably surfaced because of the\r\n\r\nBill  and  the existence of a Select Committee  on\r\n\r\nthe Bill which provided a much-awaited opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  a change of the system, the efficacy of which\r\n\r\nthis  juror, at least, had grave doubts. Sir, this\r\n\r\nis  a  disclosure which has come in the 143rd year\r\n\r\nof the practice of the jury system in our country.\r\n\r\nThe  lucid  details given by the Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah   opposite  are  sufficient  to  cause   a\r\n\r\ndisturbing  disillusionment about the efficacy  of\r\n\r\nthe  system  to which we have subscribed  for  all\r\n\r\nthese years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would not our conscience be assailed by the\r\n\r\nvision  of  more shocking errors and inability  of\r\n\r\nour  jurors in the trials which they have hitherto\r\n\r\ndetermined  in the course of those 143 years?  Are\r\n\r\nwe   to   gloss   over  these  very  disconcerting\r\n\r\ndisclosures with the argument that there is always\r\n\r\nscope for improving the quality of our jurors, and\r\n\r\nthat   we  should  retain  lay  participation   in\r\n\r\ncriminal  adjudication in our system, or that  our\r\n\r\nJudges  would  be  progressively  incompetent   to\r\n\r\ndecide  on  questions of fact  as  they  would  be\r\n\r\nremoved  from the experiences of the  common  man?\r\n\r\nThis last argument, as far as I am concerned, Sir,\r\n\r\nappears to imply that our Judges would lose  their\r\n\r\nmemory of all social and cultural experiences with\r\n\r\nthe  common man immediately upon their appointment\r\n\r\nas  Judges of the High Court. Besides, how removed\r\n\r\ncan  any  Judge be from the realities of life  and\r\n\r\nfrom  his  physical experiences in  a  society  as\r\n\r\ncompact and as exposed to mass media as ours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the urgency of the moment is to\r\n\r\nprevent  a repetition of the kind of grave  errors\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Telok Blangah has undertaken\r\n\r\nto  inform this House, particularly the kind  that\r\n\r\nthe foreman of the jury in one case had committed.\r\n\r\nThis  foreman  undoubtedly had wrestled  with  his\r\n\r\nconscience  and  finally confided  to  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of the High Court that he  had  made  a\r\n\r\nserious mistake.

It  is  essential  to  our\r\n\r\nsystem  of administration of justice that  justice\r\n\r\nbe  meted  out in our courts of law in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith   law,  explicit  written  law,  by  men   of\r\n\r\nintegrity trained for the purpose, and there  can,\r\n\r\nin  this  scheme of things, be no  place  for  the\r\n\r\nintrusion,  in the shape of the jury, of  elements\r\n\r\nof  prejudice or subjective, emotional, irrational\r\n\r\nnotions  of  what  justice should  constitute.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we have sad modern evidence of the nature of\r\n\r\ntrial  by popular prejudice in the people's courts\r\n\r\nof  totalitarian states where popular  justice  as\r\n\r\nagainst  justice in accordance with law has  taken\r\n\r\nits ultimate horrendous form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In removing the jury, we remove the final\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  this element from our system  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  indeed venture to state that  the  step  we\r\n\r\ntake  today  is  logical in  the  context  of  the\r\n\r\nrational  drive  against the jury that  is  taking\r\n\r\nplace, no doubt circuitously, in other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemocratic states where the rule of law  operates.\r\n\r\nI might here add that the state of Israel does not\r\n\r\nhave jury trials, and I am sure that not even  our\r\n\r\neminent  jurist, who recently charged at Fullerton\r\n\r\nSquare  that  the last nail was being driven  into\r\n\r\nthe  coffin of our basic freedoms, would seriously\r\n\r\ncontend that Israel was a totalitarian state  that\r\n\r\nhad destroyed the one thread in the history of the\r\n\r\nindividual's struggle for freedom,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fullerton Square oration as reported in the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times of Wednesday, 17th December,  1969,\r\n\r\nwhile  it  showed elements of Messianic  prophecy,\r\n\r\nwas alien to the modern critical temper and was so\r\n\r\nunhistorical that it made one sad to think that an\r\n\r\notherwise brilliant legal mind was unable to  face\r\n\r\nand  accept  facts  as they were.  If  the  proper\r\n\r\nlessons  were drawn from history, the  categorical\r\n\r\nassertion that the jury was an obstruction to  the\r\n\r\nexercise of absolute power by the executive of the\r\n\r\nGovernment   could  not  have  been   made.   This\r\n\r\nproposition has never been true in Singapore and a\r\n\r\nstudy of the treason trials in England would  show\r\n\r\nthat it was also not true in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the gravest danger in seeking to run the\r\n\r\naffairs of state on the basis of pretence.

That because of its very anonymity,  the\r\n\r\njury sieves out personal whims and animosities  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and provides the best system known\r\n\r\nof  impartial justice?

So\r\n\r\nmany  factors arise from the nature and set-up  of\r\n\r\nour society, partly because of the educational and\r\n\r\nintelligence  aspects, and partly because  of  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial content of our community  where  each\r\n\r\nmember of a particular community carries along his\r\n\r\nsuperstitious  and traditional  beliefs  into  his\r\n\r\npractical life, that the jury system seems  to  be\r\n\r\ninadequate  in ensuring that justice  is  done  in\r\n\r\ntrials of capital offences in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pregnant juror, for instance, may not vote for\r\n\r\na  verdict  of guilty if she knows that that  will\r\n\r\nsend  the  accused to the gallows  for  fear  that\r\n\r\nsomething  would  happen  to  her  unborn   child.\r\n\r\nHowever,   the  fact  that  almost   everyone   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  except those with special professional\r\n\r\nand  political  interests who think  in  terms  of\r\n\r\neither  commercial or political interests  instead\r\n\r\nof  the  interest of justice, has not  voiced  any\r\n\r\nobjection  to  the  abolition  of  this   un-Asian\r\n\r\nsystem,  I presume, means that the people are  all\r\n\r\nbehind  the Government to see that this system  is\r\n\r\nscrapped once and for all,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many lawyers agree that the standard of our\r\n\r\njurors  has gone down because many jurors  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a sufficient standard of education to enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  possess enough intelligence to mete  out\r\n\r\njustice adequately. Quite a number of them are not\r\n\r\nso   conversant  with  the  use  of  the   English\r\n\r\nlanguage.  As  has already been mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah just now, one juror,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, who appeared before the Select Committee\r\n\r\ncould  not  understand  what  \"culpable  homicide\"\r\n\r\nmeans.  He even pronounced it as \"cumable suicide\"\r\n\r\ninstead of \"culpable homicide\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  this  happened to many others who  served  as\r\n\r\njurors  because of lack of education  or  lack  of\r\n\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the very system that Mr David Marshall\r\n\r\nfought so hard to prevent its abolition. He  tried\r\n\r\nto  tell  the  people  that men  of  the  \"cumable\r\n\r\nsuicide\" type could offer better justice than  the\r\n\r\nJudges  themselves.  Of course,  we  know  why  he\r\n\r\nprefers  the jury to stay. After all,  under  that\r\n\r\nvery  system, he has got acquittals in many murder\r\n\r\ntrials  to  his credit. He was also so angry  with\r\n\r\nthe  Bill that he not only attacked the Government\r\n\r\nat his luncheon speech on Wednesday last, but also\r\n\r\nin  the  same rally he attacked the press for  not\r\n\r\npublishing his previous criticisms on the Bill, He\r\n\r\nalleged that the press did this out of fear of the\r\n\r\nGovernment. If the press did not really give ample\r\n\r\npublicity to his grumbling about the issue, it was\r\n\r\nprobably because they knew that his grumbling  was\r\n\r\nmore  of  a  political nature motivated  by  self-interest than professional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my profession is\r\n\r\njournalism  and,  like many other journalists,  we\r\n\r\nfeel  hurt  when  someone who is a  non-journalist\r\n\r\nlike  Mr Marshall tells us what to do in  respect\r\n\r\nof  assessing  news value. I would  ask  that  the\r\n\r\njournalists  be left alone. They know  how  to  go\r\n\r\nabout  their  work. Similarly, no journalist  will\r\n\r\ntell  Mr  Marshall  how  he  should  conduct  his\r\n\r\nclient's defence to win his case in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a number of journalists, including many who\r\n\r\nhave been court reporters for years, have told  me\r\n\r\nthat  they  are in favour of abolishing  the  jury\r\n\r\nsystem.  Therefore, for Mr Marshall to  say  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  only one or two men in  Singapore  who\r\n\r\nreally  want  to abolish the jury  system  is  not\r\n\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after having read the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee's Report, I think I am more  than\r\n\r\nconvinced that the system of trial by jury is  not\r\n\r\nworkable,  particularly in  our  multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual society.

When a man's life  is  at\r\n\r\nstake,  the  trial  should  take  as  long  as  is\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing further to add in view of the\r\n\r\nother speeches made in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Rajaratnam:</b> In general, our diplomats on\r\n\r\nfirst  appointment  are  given  general  training,\r\n\r\ncomprising lectures as well as attachments, before\r\n\r\nbeing  posted  overseas. The  attachments  are  to\r\n\r\nvarious  divisions  of  the  Headquarters  of   my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and to the various departments concerned\r\n\r\nwith  trade,  information and consular activities,\r\n\r\ne.g. the  Trade  Division  of  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nFinance,  the  Customs,  Marine,  and  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartments,  and  the Registry of  Citizens.  The\r\n\r\nlectures arranged follow a set pattern, but, where\r\n\r\nrelevant,  trainees also attend courses  organised\r\n\r\nby  the  Extra-mural  Studies  Department  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore. Advantage is also  taken\r\n\r\nof  visitors,  from  time  to  time,  for  ad  hoc\r\n\r\nlectures to be arranged. Briefings on protocol and\r\n\r\netiquette  are  also arranged.  Thus  the  present\r\n\r\ntraining arrangements are as systematic as can be,\r\n\r\nwithout  the  setting up of a separate  diplomatic\r\n\r\nservice  institute. Even then the  more  practical\r\n\r\naspects  of  diplomacy  will  have  to  be  learnt\r\n\r\nthrough attachments and later on the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplementing all these, advantage is taken to\r\n\r\nsend   specially  selected  officers  to  overseas\r\n\r\ncourses   such  as  those  run  by  the   Carnegie\r\n\r\nEndowment for International Peace, UNITAR  (United\r\n\r\nNations Institute for Research and Training),  and\r\n\r\nthe institutes run by various governments such  as\r\n\r\nthose of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  India.

Nor  is  it\r\n\r\npractical  to  have one stationed in another  city\r\n\r\nbecause  our  students are scattered over  a  very\r\n\r\nwide  area.
