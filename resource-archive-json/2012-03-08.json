      </span>:\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for his question. The operator\r\ninspects sections of the track each night to check if the tracks\r\nand its components are in good condition. This includes the rail\r\nclips that secure the running rails to the timber sleepers. Any\r\nclip that is observed to have broken off is replaced immediately\r\nupon detection.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-38b94707-2d5b-466c-ab91-f83ef59beba1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ec6ccfb9-7acb-483f-9181-5bb12a5348c7__id-38b94707-2d5b-466c-ab91-f83ef59beba1\"><!--a--></a>The clips do break from\r\ntime to time. However, as the clips are connected at intervals along\r\nthe entire running track, a single broken clip ought not to affect\r\nthe safety of rail operations significantly, as the other clips\r\ncontinue to secure the track. Following the dislodgements, SMRT\r\ncarried out a check of the entire system and assessed that the safety\r\nof the system had not been compromised and that normal train operations\r\ncould continue.

Ultimately, the discretion rests with the Court to decide\r\nwhether an accused person should be allowed to leave our jurisdiction\r\ntaking into account submissions by both the prosecution and the\r\ndefence.

Their efforts are to focus\r\non attracting the foreigners rather than the locals. In this regard,\r\nwe have spoken to the casinos. They are also forthcoming to acknowledge\r\nthat it is not in their interest to target the locals.

Indeed,\r\nthis is a concern for us. If the foreign workers and foreign work\r\npass holders have applied for the self-exclusion order and after\r\nthat, still enter the casino, this means they are either breaking\r\nthe rules or circumventing it by other ways, this is a serious problem,\r\nwhich brings me to two points. First, it goes back to the point\r\nI mentioned just now about the sense of ownership. Even if we force\r\npeople to sign the exclusion order, if there is no sense of ownership,\r\nthen that individual might find all sorts of way to circumvent this\r\nwhich is unhealthy. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-58588941-e7ce-467d-b5ea-11dc81546c88\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-b6312994-fbfb-4d3c-9df3-7a95c6437347__id-58588941-e7ce-467d-b5ea-11dc81546c88\"><!--a--></a>The other part of the\r\nequation, as the Member has rightly alluded to, is that we will need\r\nto strengthen our enforcement to make sure that when such cases\r\nhappen, we will have to take serious actions because they are not\r\ntaking care of themselves and, at the same time, affecting the wider\r\nenvironment.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-625d11e8-5ce1-4a21-a5e0-15ff2810f17a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-b6312994-fbfb-4d3c-9df3-7a95c6437347__id-625d11e8-5ce1-4a21-a5e0-15ff2810f17a\"><!--a--></a>How to detect this? There\r\nare few layers, as the Member has suggested. One, if the employer\r\nknows the individuals concerned breaking this rule \u2013 that means\r\nthey are going to the casinos, despite the fact that they have signed\r\non to the self-exclusion orders \u2013 then the employers can work very\r\nclosely with us to make sure that these names are given a higher\r\nsignature so that we really look at them very carefully and take\r\na serious look. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7fd93a08-3639-4a16-a7e6-58f229202890\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-b6312994-fbfb-4d3c-9df3-7a95c6437347__id-7fd93a08-3639-4a16-a7e6-58f229202890\"><!--a--></a>The other measure that\r\nwe would need to step up is with the casino operators to make sure\r\nthat their list of exclusions are kept up-to-date and that it is\r\nalways the latest that they can possibly have and to step up the\r\nenforcement. We will need to do a few steps in order to manage the\r\nproblem. But at the end of the day, I must emphasise that we want\r\nto do all these to protect our people, to help the vulnerable groups.\r\nBut the people involved must also take a certain sense of ownership.\r\nIt will be very sad for us to see those examples that the Member\r\nhad given, whereby they sign the self-exclusion order, yet they\r\nfind all sorts of ways to bypass the exclusion orders themselves.\r\nBecause the larger issue is not just casino or not casino. The larger\r\nissue is one of gambling.

Of course, there are also areas where we can improve upon.\r\nBut, overall, I would say that, on balance, I am satisfied that\r\nwe do have an excellent education system. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2267</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9df34793-64fe-4e48-aab2-38078a9d794f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9df34793-64fe-4e48-aab2-38078a9d794f\"><!--a--></a>Next, Sir, let me thank the Minister for\r\nthe focus on values and character development in schools.

During my dialogues with parents, many\r\nparents have also expressed support for this emphasis.

Values like honesty, kindness, gratitude,\r\nfairness and forgiveness rank as the top five values which the survey\r\nrespondents hold close to their hearts. The survey also suggested\r\nthat parents play the most important role in character education\r\nof a child, with teachers or schools ranked equally high. Sir, I\r\nurge MOE to continue in its efforts to ensure that these values\r\nare constantly affirmed by our schools to the students. School leaders\r\nand teachers must take the lead to share such values at every teachable\r\nmoment with their students. And this can be done not just during\r\nCIP events or Kindness Week but, on a daily basis, during CCAs like\r\nsports, arts and music periods or during everyday class lessons.\r\nWhere possible, the schools should also rope in parents to be involved\r\nin their child's character development as well. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-dc35ef8e-5736-4364-959f-52c6dd085434\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-dc35ef8e-5736-4364-959f-52c6dd085434\"><!--a--></a>This brings me to the\r\ntopic of schools and how they prepare our students for the future.\r\nSir, many parents are anxious about the schools that their children\r\nget into.

I am sure for many Members in\r\nthis House, July is the time when we all wait eagerly for such appeals.\r\nAbout a week or two ago, the <em class=\"ph i\">Straits Times </em>ran an article\r\nabout possible changes to the Primary 1 priority scheme. Since then,\r\nmany parents have expressed their concerns about the possible changes.\r\nSir, it is a sensitive topic. I can see both the strengths and weaknesses of\r\nboth sides of the arguments. In fact, I have parents who were thinking\r\nof whether they should buy a property near a branded school because\r\nthey were wondering whether there would be changes to the priority\r\nscheme. I do not think there is an easy answer. I would urge MOE\r\nto consider a review of the scheme. So, I pass the buck back to\r\nMOE.

However, while moral\r\ndecisions and actions of teachers cannot be compromised, teachers\r\nalso cannot be expected to be the sole provider of values education\r\nto children. Parents and the society at large have equally important\r\nroles to play in demonstrating and nurturing desired values in our\r\nchildren. Hence, the framework for Character and Citizenship Education\r\nshould not just require teachers to demonstrate desired values within\r\nthe curriculum and in school, but should also require parents' involvement\r\nin imparting and nurturing these values in children, as well as\r\nthe commitment and participation of community partners and the society\r\nat large. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2270</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-97ea3141-5e21-4fd1-9f4d-1698e5462ec5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-97ea3141-5e21-4fd1-9f4d-1698e5462ec5\"><!--a--></a>Much has been done to create opportunities\r\nin our education system for students of different backgrounds and\r\nabilities to ensure equity among them, such as the different educational\r\npathways for varied abilities, lateral transfers between academic\r\nstreams and assistance schemes, such as the School Breakfast Programme,\r\nLearning Support Programme, Financial Assistance Scheme and Opportunity\r\nFund. However, there are still areas where work is to be done. For\r\ninstance, the establishment of the two specialised schools for Normal\r\n(Technical) and the various specialised independent schools might\r\ngive rise to greater segregation amongst students of different abilities and\r\nacademic streams, unless there are dedicated efforts to ensure they\r\ncan integrate and work with one another. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-972a8a25-a586-43e9-9eae-eed37dada82b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-972a8a25-a586-43e9-9eae-eed37dada82b\"><!--a--></a>I would like to propose\r\na review of the Gifted Education Programme where students as young\r\nas nine years old are streamed, to select and smaller classes of\r\nhigher ability students taught by specially-trained teachers.

A <em class=\"ph i\">Straits Times </em>article\r\nlast month reported more parents taking their Primary school kids\r\nto see psychologists after doing badly in school tests, some as\r\nyoung as Primary 2. The purpose of PSLE and other major exams appears\r\nto be to sort students into different streams and into different\r\nschools.

However, there are parents, like\r\nmyself, who can accept that our children need not fight to be in\r\nthe best schools. The current system offers us no choice at all\r\nbecause of the dreaded consequence of the child doing badly in a\r\nmajor examination at aged 12. Many parents feel their child's future\r\nis determined by the PSLE. Many private schools globally already\r\nthrough-train students from Primary to Secondary, including overseas\r\nschools based on the Singapore curriculum. Some of these schools\r\nhave done well in international tests despite not subjecting students\r\nto standardised examinations at Primary 6.

With such schools, Primary education\r\nneed not be focused on grinding out results just for PSLE and schools\r\ncan spend more time on values-based education. The post-Primary\r\nsection will eventually prepare students for a recognised examination,\r\nnamely \"O\" levels, \"A\" levels or even the International Baccalaureate.\r\nBy that time, students are more mature and better able to handle\r\nstress.

Because if we want to align the schools\r\nto be more value-based and less academic \u2013 or I would say still\r\nacademically-focused but more value-based \u2013 how do we get rid of\r\nthis connotation? Is there a way to do this and how do we manage\r\nthis issue? Moving forward, all students should be recognised and\r\ntreated in the same way, at the same level, and recognised for their abilities,\r\nand different types of abilities at different levels.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-57d95706-4185-4b29-82a8-e0a653ea98b8\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-57d95706-4185-4b29-82a8-e0a653ea98b8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-0c993c1f-2a54-4f67-9760-a083068344be\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0c993c1f-2a54-4f67-9760-a083068344be\"><!--a--></a>The Tuition Syndrome</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fb122653-bbba-4b0a-978b-7c6829d0c574\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-fb122653-bbba-4b0a-978b-7c6829d0c574\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, Singapore has not been called a tuition nation for nothing.\r\nThe tuition industry was estimated to be about $800 million in 2008;\r\nthe size could well be more than $1 billion by now. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-b785b56e-712a-43bf-be79-525816c460b4\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-b785b56e-712a-43bf-be79-525816c460b4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-e3484867-0a51-4fb2-bec0-f081096a28b0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e3484867-0a51-4fb2-bec0-f081096a28b0\"><!--a--></a>12.30 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f7231821-75a6-4191-a6fa-3b44477f1e7b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f7231821-75a6-4191-a6fa-3b44477f1e7b\"><!--a--></a>Almost every student,\r\nrich or poor, receives some form of tuition outside the normal school\r\nhours.

The income limit\r\nfor eligibility for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) will\r\nbe raised from $1,500 to $2,500.

We will also similarly introduce a Per Capita Income\r\ncriterion and update income tiers for the Independent Schools Bursary\r\n(ISB), so that Independent Schools remain affordable to all.

I recently visited Kheng Cheng School, and saw how\r\ntheir staff work hard to fulfil its founder's vision, I quote, \"to\r\nuplift the children in the community through education\". Within\r\nthree days of a student joining the school, each form teacher makes contact\r\nwith the parent, and through this interaction is able to understand\r\nher students better and can more actively reach out to needy students.\r\nThe school then adopts a comprehensive approach to the learning\r\nof students from needy backgrounds, a point which Mr Baey asked\r\nearlier. For students needing academic support \u2013 Kheng Cheng runs\r\neffective Learning Support Programmes for Primary 1 and Primary\r\n2 students weaker in literacy and numeracy. Now, this is an example\r\nof a Learning Support Programme for Mathematics for Primary 1 students\r\nand this class has seven students, a specialised programme to help\r\nthe students level-up in numeracy.

We do this through: (i) resourcing schools\r\nto offer customised programmes that best fit the needs of their\r\nstudents, (ii) raising the professional standards of teachers across\r\nthe system, (iii) encouraging learning and innovation across schools,\r\nand (iv) promoting partnerships between school and community. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e1cb6a0d-8a40-4ad9-8dd3-7e7a21362521\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e1cb6a0d-8a40-4ad9-8dd3-7e7a21362521\"><!--a--></a>First, resourcing schools.\r\nProgrammes, such as Holistic Assessment, Values in Action, Programme\r\nfor Active Learning (PAL) and bilingualism, are implemented across schools\r\nand serve to build a strong foundation in holistic education for\r\nall. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d8408abe-60f6-45d0-ad30-291c8674dbce\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d8408abe-60f6-45d0-ad30-291c8674dbce\"><!--a--></a>In addition, as part of\r\nour student-centric approach in developing the varied interests and\r\nabilities of our students, we have a variety of programmes in each\r\nschool, and a variety of schools across our system. For example,\r\none, to cater to different academic abilities and interests, we\r\nhave programmes such as the Learning Support Programme, N(T) Mark\r\nII, Gifted Education Programme and the Integrated Programme. Various schools\r\nalso offer Applied Subjects, language elective programmes, Art and\r\nMusic Elective Programmes. Two, to encourage peaks of excellence\r\nand allow schools to develop varied niches, we also have the Programme\r\nfor School-Based Excellence and Niche Programme. These niches can\r\nbe in terms of sports, aesthetics, national education or in cognitive\r\nareas. Three, schools can also tap on funds such as \"Time Out Fund\"\r\nand Opportunity Fund to support their initiatives to better engage\r\nstudents. Four, we also have specialised schools catering to specific\r\ntalent in Arts, Sports, Mathematics and Science and Technology.\r\nThe Junior Sports Academies also nurture budding sportsmen and sportswomen.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1bb3713c-897c-4ba9-9596-ba7ca8e7af67\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1bb3713c-897c-4ba9-9596-ba7ca8e7af67\"><!--a--></a>We do not adopt a single\r\nmodel in delivering these varied programmes in our schools. Rather,\r\nour focus is on what is effective and developmentally appropriate. Some\r\nprogrammes like the GEP, which Mr Yee Jenn Jong had spoken about,\r\nrequire a centralised approach at the Primary level so that there\r\nis a critical mass of students. What we learn in GEP is extended\r\nto other high ability students who can benefit from it and I should\r\npoint out that it is not right to assess the success of the GEP\r\nprogramme solely by the PSLE results. In fact, the GEP precisely\r\nis to help develop different talents and different peaks of excellence\r\nand allow a different form of learning.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2295</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-956e2f3a-ebce-4b96-bb04-a6aaf93c9b57\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-956e2f3a-ebce-4b96-bb04-a6aaf93c9b57\"><!--a--></a>At the same time, our overall level of\r\nresourcing, across all schools and across all levels has been significantly\r\nincreased. We now have about 32,000 education officers, an increase\r\nof 4,000 from five years ago. It is not just about more teachers,\r\nbut also better teachers \u2013 through more stringent selection and\r\nprofessional development. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-99e868be-eeba-420a-984a-0a38cc96ce57\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-99e868be-eeba-420a-984a-0a38cc96ce57\"><!--a--></a>We have also started a\r\nnew Allied Educator Scheme in 2009 and have grown the total number\r\nof AEDs to 2,200 today. Ms Denise Phua will be glad to know we will\r\nbe further increasing this. This means that, over the past five\r\nyears, each school has, on average, about 10 more teachers. In addition,\r\neach school now has an average of six Allied Educators.

Teaching is a calling and it is about touching lives.\r\nI know many of the teachers have gone beyond their call of duty\r\nto go the extra mile for the students. In some cases, it takes hard\r\nwork and a long time before the students respond, yet, many teachers\r\ndo not give up. They stand testimony to the power of the mission\r\nand make the learning experience meaningful to many of our students. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-22700385-accc-4fc3-986f-0f1eece255a6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-22700385-accc-4fc3-986f-0f1eece255a6\"><!--a--></a>A demonstration of this\r\ncalling in many of our teachers is the strong professional pride\r\nteachers take in improving their craft. For example, since we started\r\nthe Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), almost 300 learning communities\r\nhave been established for teachers to learn from each other within\r\nand across schools. The N(T) Professional Focus Group (PFG) is one\r\nsuch platform where teachers expand their repertoire of strategies\r\nto enrich their students' learning by learning from each other as\r\nwell as experienced practitioners and partners.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e076583c-2989-4eae-8809-eadec3007931\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e076583c-2989-4eae-8809-eadec3007931\"><!--a--></a>In addition, last year,\r\nour teachers and Allied Educators collectively developed the ethos\r\nof the teaching profession to signal their commitment to their calling.\r\nWith this dedication, it is no surprise that, every year, on Teachers'\r\nDay, we see the outpourings of appreciation of the good work of\r\nteachers by our students and parents. And I am very glad to receive\r\nmany emails commending the good work of our teachers. Sir, I want\r\nto thank Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Dr Intan Azura as well as Ms Irene\r\nNg for the affirmation of the good work of our teachers earlier. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f6db7083-ad95-40cf-a92f-fb749a7c5d68\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f6db7083-ad95-40cf-a92f-fb749a7c5d68\"><!--a--></a>The third way that we\r\nare levelling up across all schools is to encourage learning and innovation\r\nacross schools. Schools share best practices through a variety of\r\nplatforms, including the annual MOE ExCEL Fest. For this year's\r\nExCEL Fest, over 20,000 educators, school staff and members of the\r\npublic will come together to share and learn about the many good\r\nefforts and innovations in our schools. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-40f24437-fbf2-482b-a351-3c866ea48ae1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-40f24437-fbf2-482b-a351-3c866ea48ae1\"><!--a--></a>The Innovation Adoption\r\nPlatform was initiated at ExCEL Fest last year to facilitate collaboration\r\nand diffusion of innovations across schools.

So, while we continue to consider the feedback,\r\nour schools will make a concerted effort to reach out to parents\r\non the programmes they have and engage parents in developing our students\r\nholistically.

For our children and our future workforce\r\nto stay ahead and to stay relevant, maybe our education system can\r\nbe stretched further, and we can perhaps look to test some new models.\r\nI have mentioned the collage model in my last speech.

We have indeed invested in education\r\nto equip our young people with future-relevant skills underpinned\r\nby strong values. Singapore's education system is well admired and\r\nscores highly in global rankings, such as PISA.

Yet,\r\nthese are the essential qualities for success in the competitive\r\nglobal playing field. It has led me to ponder these questions: what\r\nare some meaningful outcome indicators that show how well our education\r\nsystem is nurturing our young for the unpredictable future? Besides international\r\nrankings, are there measurable outcomes to indicate if our young\r\nones are indeed well prepared to meet challenges beyond academic\r\nexcellence? For example, will they be able to adapt nimbly to changes\r\nand new demands brought about by global forces? Today, the playing\r\nfield for our young Singaporeans entering the workforce is being\r\nre-drawn at a faster pace. Technology can make today's jobs obsolete\r\ntomorrow. Thirdly, what benchmark should we set to give our children\r\nthe foundational skills that will prepare them for life? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c8179018-d321-4a28-a07d-26f2891d7223\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c8179018-d321-4a28-a07d-26f2891d7223\"><!--a--></a>May I suggest that MOE\r\nconsider benchmarking our education efforts against the following\r\nthree indicators? Number one, our students' degree of self-motivation.\r\nThis inner desire is the engine house for lifelong learning. The\r\nself-directed learner gains confidence and has the drive and curiosity\r\nto explore and discover new things. Number two, state of mental\r\nand emotional well-being in our students. Having a healthy mental and\r\nemotional state will help our young people meet future challenges.\r\nThe Institute of Mental Health (IMH) revealed that more than one\r\nin 10 Primary school students here had emotional and behavioural\r\nproblems in 2010. As pressure from studies and stresses of life\r\nbecome an unbearable burden not only for children, and parents suffer,\r\nour society and economy will also be adversely affected in the long\r\nrun. Lastly, a measure of outcome to consider is the love for learning.\r\nThis is the joy found in the pursuit of learning for learning's\r\nsake. A passion for learning is a lifelong skill that will stand\r\nour children in good stead. Even as adults today, we continue to\r\nlearn, unlearn and relearn.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-90a7e045-ea99-48f0-a6be-2699ef231cf6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-90a7e045-ea99-48f0-a6be-2699ef231cf6\"><!--a--></a>I believe that MOE has\r\nplaced great emphasis on making our children future-ready.

It is generally recognised that children between the ages of\r\nthree and seven have a strong developmental and cognitive ability\r\nand that this can best be nurtured through play and interaction\r\nat those ages. The pre-school years are thus a very critical period\r\nfor the development of our children. They lay the foundation for\r\nour children's education, prior formal schooling. There have already\r\nbeen recent movements by the Government to recognise and accredit\r\npre-school education through the efforts of SPARK and MCYS.

In the process, they gained a stronger sense of what\r\nit means to contribute to the community, and further developed their\r\ncharacter and resilience, as well as leadership and team spirit.

And because the places in these universities are taken up\r\nby what they call \"eternal\" students, it creates a bottleneck for\r\nnew students, who have to wait around one to two years before they\r\ncan actually matriculate.

CPE\r\noffers a voluntary EduTrust Certification\r\nscheme for higher-quality private institutions to differentiate\r\nthemselves. But this is just the first step in distinguishing quality\r\nfrom baseline requirements. EduTrust provides prospective students\r\nwith a measure of confidence that processes are in place to run\r\na sound organisation and student interests are well looked after.\r\nWe will have to do more to encourage private institutions to focus\r\non quality outcomes. This is a challenge that regulatory agencies\r\naround the world face. If the same quality benchmarks for public\r\nuniversities are applied to private institutions, there may not\r\nbe a viable business case for many of the programmes offered in\r\nsuch private institutions.

The Committee is studying some of these ideas to see if\r\nwe can adapt and apply them in the Singaporean context to make loan\r\nschemes more attractive as an additional source of financing for\r\nUniversity education, on top of the direct grants and bursaries\r\nprovided by the Government. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-70a0e08f-579f-4db4-b889-67309e307256\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-70a0e08f-579f-4db4-b889-67309e307256\"><!--a--></a>Mr Chairman, over the\r\nnext few years, the Committee envisions a more diversified university\r\nlandscape with multiple \"best-in-class\" institutions, including\r\ntop-notch research- and teaching-oriented universities as well as\r\na good mix of full-time, part-time and work-study degree programmes,\r\nto meet the wide spectrum of Singaporeans' needs and preferences.\r\nAt the same time, we must maintain the quality and affordability of\r\nuniversity education, and ensure good employment outcomes for all\r\nour graduates.

Today, access to pre-school is almost universal\r\n\u2013 more than 99% of Primary 1-going children attended pre-school.\r\nWe are now making a greater push to enhance quality. Recently, MOE\r\nlaunched the Singapore Pre-School Accreditation Framework (SPARK),\r\na structured approach to assess the quality of the teaching and\r\nlearning, administration and management processes in our pre-school\r\ncentres, and to identify their strengths and areas for improvement.\r\nThis is what the SPARK logo looks like. So if you are looking for\r\na good pre-school centre, look out for the ones with the SPARK accreditation.\r\nToday, 69 pre-schools are SPARK-certified. One example is Ascension\r\nKindergarten. The principal tells us that the SPARK assessment has\r\nhelped them to review their teaching environment and teaching strategies,\r\nand thus improved their ability to meet the learning needs of every\r\nchild. I am glad to note that 53 more pre-schools have applied for\r\ncertification in this year's first application window, and I encourage\r\nmore to do so in the coming months.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2319</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-076a9c6a-750e-48f4-8d68-32f83c4ce9e4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-076a9c6a-750e-48f4-8d68-32f83c4ce9e4\"><!--a--></a>MOE pro-actively helps all pre-school\r\ncentres to enhance their quality.

And then when they learn about, for example, the <em class=\"ph i\">macaranga</em> plant\r\nthat proliferates in our forest, they learn that there is a win-win\r\nrelationship because there are armies of ants in the plant that\r\nactually protect the plant and receiving food and shelter at the\r\nsame time \u2013 again, an example of inter-connectedness.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2322</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-64617a6e-6c2d-4b60-85a0-18597efe771a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-64617a6e-6c2d-4b60-85a0-18597efe771a\"><!--a--></a>The second value, \"ekistic relationship\"\r\nthat I mentioned, is when students learn that in our tropical rainforest,\r\nit is where all our plants and herbs are where we originally got our\r\nfood, how we fed ourselves, how we obtained our medicine \u2013 it is\r\nnot for nothing that our rainforests are called \"the pharmacy of\r\nthe planet\".

Firstly, on the Bilingualism\r\nFund. Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew mooted the establishment\r\nof the Bilingualism Fund, to which he personally donated $10 million.\r\nThe community rallied to his call. In particular, the Chinese community\r\nleaders and organisations responded with great enthusiasm and donated\r\ngenerously towards this national objective to benefit our younger\r\ngeneration. Three months have already gone by since the Fund was\r\nset up last November. I would like to find out from the Ministry\r\nof Education how it proposes to manage and utilise these funds.\r\nAre there any current plans and developments?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-64110333-5340-49c2-91db-00be7ef7b0cd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-64110333-5340-49c2-91db-00be7ef7b0cd\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, how to continue\r\ngrooming bilingual and bi-cultural talent. Everyone, from the Government\r\nto the community, is diligently promoting the grooming of bilingual and\r\nbi-cultural talent for Singapore. Language is the vehicle enabling\r\nculture to be effectively transmitted; in this regard Mother Tongue\r\neducation is extremely important in instilling traditional core values.\r\nLearning of Mandarin is a good example. When I was young, the anecdote\r\nof Yue Fei's \"\u7cbe\u5fe0\u62a5\u56fd\" or \"Loyalty to the\r\nCountry\" taught me about the meaning of national service; after\r\nreading about \"Oath of the Peach Garden\" in Romance of the Three\r\nKingdoms, I deeply understood about maintaining trust and integrity\r\namong friends; as I read Mencius' saying on \"Of the three transgressions\r\nof filial piety, the worst is severing the family line\", I came\r\nto understand the importance of filial piety and raising a family.\r\nThese moral values, having been deeply instilled in me while learning\r\nmy Mother Tongue, will never be forgotten.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2333</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7e4edf6e-a736-4440-9cea-b57799582bd1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7e4edf6e-a736-4440-9cea-b57799582bd1\"><!--a--></a>Former Prime Minister\r\nLee Kuan Yew mooted the establishment of the Bilingualism Fund with\r\nthe primary objective to enhance Mother Tongue language proficiency among\r\npre-school children.

As\r\nschool children at the Primary and Secondary levels need to study\r\nthe Mother Tongue and face examination pressures, they naturally\r\nwork harder at learning the Mother Tongue in the hope of scoring\r\nhigh marks during examinations. When they enter pre-Universities\r\nor Polytechnics, Mother Tongue is no longer a compulsory subject.\r\nOnce the examination requirement is waived, many young people tend\r\nto ignore Mother Tongue language learning.

Secondly, whether\r\nthey will consider increasing the number of hours that children\r\nuse MTL in schools every day. Besides MTL lessons, can teachers\r\ncontinue to use MT to converse with the children during break time,\r\nso that indirectly, the children can listen more, speak more, learn more\r\nand use the language more? Thirdly, we can broadcast cartoons produced specially\r\nfor local pre-schoolers through MediaCorp's OKTO Channel, to entice\r\nthem to learn MTL in an entertaining and relaxing way.

Mr Alex Yam spoke about the experience of\r\nsome parents in enrolment. MOE monitors the enrolment figures of\r\nSPED schools closely to ensure that there are sufficient places\r\nto cater to students of different disability types. We have committed\r\n$150 million towards the upgrading and building of the 20 SPED schools\r\nin the past decade, and will continue to invest in increasing capacity where\r\nrequired. Metta School, which caters to students with mild intellectual\r\ndisability, will be able to take in another 150 students from 2013\r\nafter its new extension block is completed. With the refurbishment\r\nof the former Chong Boon Primary School, Pathlight School added\r\nan additional 100 places at the start of 2012 and will be able to\r\nprovide an additional 200 places by the end of 2013. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e00421c2-dc0d-431a-b93a-990f72a4bc25\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e00421c2-dc0d-431a-b93a-990f72a4bc25\"><!--a--></a>Beyond expanding capacity,\r\nwe recognise the need to improve the experience of parents seeking\r\nto admit their child into the SPED school that is appropriate to\r\nhis or her needs. MOE will set up a Multi-Agency Advisory Panel,\r\ncomprising specialists and professionals from MOE, the health sector,\r\nthe NCCS as well as the different SPED schools. The Panel will develop\r\na standard application process for all 20 SPED schools. And it will\r\nhelp facilitate admission for children with less straightforward\r\nlearning profiles into the appropriate SPED school. With the standard\r\napplication process, parents would not have to make multiple applications\r\nto different SPED schools \u2212 only one will be required.

Bilingualism in pre-schoolers is also nurtured through their\r\nday-to-day communication with parents and caregivers at home, or\r\nthrough exposure to educational media programmes.

Firstly, he questioned whether the\r\nPAP Community Foundation (PCF) Kindergartens will become the main beneficiaries\r\nof the Fund. Mr Chairman, in actual fact, work on the Fund is in\r\nits nascent stage. But since Mr Low raised his concerns, I am happy\r\nto respond to his queries. Naturally, the use of the Fund should\r\nbe centred on the needs of the child, not of the organisations and,\r\nin particular, on students who do not have good opportunities for bilingual\r\nlearning beyond the kindergarten or childcare centre setting due\r\nto their family environment and financial situation.

I would like to highlight that, having been named as a\r\nFund for Bilingualism, naturally the Fund seeks to enhance bilingual\r\ncompetencies. We should, of course, focus on the learning of MTL.\r\nWhy? Because for many children from English-speaking families, learning\r\nMTL is considerably difficult. However, Singapore's socio-linguistic environment\r\nis also complex, and we do, indeed, have a group of students who encounter\r\ndifficulties in learning English.

I have two sets of questions for two of the cuts.\r\nThe first is regarding the Primary to Secondary Integrated Programme\r\npilot. The Minister said that \"we will be transferring the pressure\r\nto Primary 1\". Does the Minister not agree that when that happens,\r\nit means that this pilot is very successful and it is time to actually\r\nopen more of such pilots, just as we have done so when we did the secondary\r\nto college integrated programme? The Minister also said that in\r\nFinland, 40% of the students go to vocational stream at Grade 9.\r\nI am not sure why this was raised as a problem by the Minister.\r\nIs it because the Minister thinks that going to the vocational stream\r\nis actually under achieving?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3ef08cbd-02f7-4721-a1b3-5582bfe13d30\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3ef08cbd-02f7-4721-a1b3-5582bfe13d30\"><!--a--></a>In speaking with Finns,\r\nI actually found that parents and students, they choose the vocational\r\ntrack by choice because in Finland, the salary differential between\r\nthe vocational stream and professional stream is not as great as\r\nin Singapore. So, the higher percentage may not mean that they are\r\nunder performing. Is the Minister open to dialogue with schools\r\nand parents to see if they actually want such a track because when I\r\ndid my survey, I found that there is a significant number of educators\r\nand parents who are interested and I heard that \u2013 perhaps the Minister\r\ncan confirm that \u2013 one aided school even approached the Ministry\r\nfor discussion on this several years back. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-45977e99-cc26-4afe-bf72-f15252f21853\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-45977e99-cc26-4afe-bf72-f15252f21853\"><!--a--></a>The second is related\r\nto the GEP cut. The Minister questioned my use of the Primary School\r\nLeaving Examination (PSLE) and GCE \"A\" level scores as a means of\r\nassessing the performance of GEP students. I would like to ask the\r\nMinister, are these not the same data the Ministry of Education\r\nlargely relies on currently to channel our students into different\r\nacademic streams and into schools and also in the Award of Scholarships? Does\r\nthe Minister not agree that parents today perceive the nine GEP\r\nschools as being \"the\" good schools, as evident by the rush for\r\nplaces in these schools? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8976ac4e-e25d-4357-883f-7397d6c173e1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8976ac4e-e25d-4357-883f-7397d6c173e1\"><!--a--></a>On the point that we need\r\ncritical mass to put them into the centralised nine GEP schools,\r\nI want to clarify specifically that I am not asking for GEP or accelerated\r\nlearning <em class=\"ph i\">per se</em> to be abolished but I am asking for centralised\r\nGEP to be scraped, and in place of it, being disseminated to different\r\nschools.

First, on his point about his\r\nproposal for an Integrated Primary 1 to Secondary 4 programme, I\r\nhave made two points. First, that we will be transferring the pressure\r\nto Primary 1. Second, he mentioned my point about Finland that at\r\nthe end of Grade 9, 40% are on the vocational path. I want to use\r\nthat to illustrate a very basic point, which is that in our system,\r\nwe have many pathways and many options. This has been enhanced over\r\nthe years and the results have been very good across the entire\r\nsystem. In the last few years, MOE had done major review of Primary\r\nand Secondary education. In fact, Senior Minister of State Ms Grace Fu, who is\r\nhere, led the review on the Primary education. That is after very extensive\r\nconsultations with educators, specialists, parents and the broader\r\ncommunity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2343</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0e083b19-56dd-4891-bf14-5ca82cf13b5c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0e083b19-56dd-4891-bf14-5ca82cf13b5c\"><!--a--></a>As a result of the review,\r\nyou will find that in all Primary schools now, we are implementing\r\na very wide range of very important and interesting programmes.\r\nI mentioned about PAL, the Programme for Active Learning. I mentioned\r\nabout the learning support in order to raise numeracy and literacy.\r\nWith the additional bilingualism effort at pre-school, we will continue\r\nto enhance that. Schools are given a lot more resources to level\r\nup. I also announced earlier that we have now five major measures\r\nto level up the lower and middle income families. And I have also\r\nannounced significant changes to Edusave.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bb68c34e-8175-47c7-ba33-c7c059ac70a6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bb68c34e-8175-47c7-ba33-c7c059ac70a6\"><!--a--></a>So, across the entire\r\nsystem, changes are being made.

At this point, with so many initiatives,\r\nwe must focus on good implementation. I have also mentioned how\r\nin our system, that over 93% of our students are moving on to post-Secondary\r\neducation. In my second set of remarks, I also mentioned how vocational\r\npathways and technical pathways are very important. In fact, I deeply\r\nbelieve, as Mr Zainudin Nordin has mentioned, that the ITE and Polytechnics\r\nare crown jewels of our system.

Schools now have Direct School Admission (DSA),\r\nin order to recognise a wider range of talent; in order for us to\r\ndevelop a whole slew of different skills, aptitudes and talents. That\r\nis how we have been doing it. Admission into schools like SOTA,\r\nfor instance, requires students to show the aptitude and interest\r\nin the arts, similarly admission through sports. So, if you look\r\nat the entire system, we have created many, many more options, pathways\r\nand opportunities for our students.

As I have mentioned in\r\nmy speech earlier on, this is because MOE encourages all Singaporean\r\nchildren, as much as possible, to be enrolled in national schools\r\nas this helps to build our national identity, common spirit and\r\nsocial cohesion in each successive generation.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9acf35b4-e7c5-48cd-8c2a-d572442f0cf7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9acf35b4-e7c5-48cd-8c2a-d572442f0cf7\"><!--a--></a>At the same time, I agree\r\nwith Mr Zainal Sapari when he mentioned earlier that <em class=\"ph i\">m</em>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">adrasahs</em> play\r\nan important role for our Muslim community. And, indeed, not just\r\nthe Muslim community as he mentioned; in our broader Singaporean\r\ncommunity. It is for this reason that MUIS channels community funding\r\nto support the <em class=\"ph i\">madrasahs'</em> school operations, teacher training\r\nand development, curriculum development and administrative support.\r\nIn partnership with MUIS, MOE also seconds up to two MOE teachers\r\nto MUIS to advise on curriculum development and our National Institute\r\nof Education also conducts customised training programmes for <em class=\"ph i\">madrasahs</em> school leaders\r\nand teachers. All these with a view of ensuring that educational\r\noutcomes are good for all our students.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-109fb80d-4249-4f54-ba47-93db3770bcc4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-109fb80d-4249-4f54-ba47-93db3770bcc4\"><!--a--></a>The Member also asked\r\nabout the 5,000 over students who do not get Edusave.

First, on the tuition syndrome, as the Member has\r\nsaid, a positive aspect is that our parents have high aspirations\r\nand that we are a higher achievement society. Our society values\r\nachievement and that is by itself a good thing. But the negative\r\naspect, which we all must be aware of, is that it imposes greater stress\r\non our children. They have less time for rest and it may take away\r\nthe joy of learning. As Ms Low Yen Ling and Asst Prof Eugene Tan\r\nsaid earlier, really, at the end of it, our students need to be\r\nlifelong learners, and the love for learning, the joy of learning,\r\nmust be a critical part of our education system. So, I fully agree\r\nwith Ms Denise Phua that, indeed, we have to focus on that.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e90ef429-99d9-4570-8e74-6222815cb82d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e90ef429-99d9-4570-8e74-6222815cb82d\"><!--a--></a>I think what MOE can do\r\nis, first, make sure that our homework policy is well understood\r\nacross all our schools and is well implemented. Second, I will continue\r\nto push for our schools to make sure that we set tests at the appropriate\r\nstandards. Importantly, I agree with the Member's point that it\r\ncannot just be an MOE's responsibility. I think it requires the\r\nefforts of the entire community and in particular, parents.

Ms Denise Phua asked what we intended\r\nto do with the experience of NorthLight school. Indeed, our intent\r\nis not to duplicate another NorthLight. NorthLight serves as a trail\r\nblazer for us to learn and because of the very innovative pedagogy,\r\nbecause of the flexibility that was given to the school for them\r\nto re-think their curriculum, to re-think their pedagogy and to\r\ninfuse the learning with a great deal of socio-emotional learning,\r\nthe school has shown how we can reach out more effectively. Earlier,\r\nsome Members had also spoken about how some students learn differently.\r\nMr Laurence Lien mentioned about kinesthetic learners and so on.\r\nWe are taking the experience from NorthLight school, studying it\r\nvery carefully to see how that can help us improve learning outcomes\r\nright across our school system. Sir, our intent in all these is\r\nvery simple, that we want to find ways and means for which we can\r\nreach out to our students, encourage them, motivate them and find\r\nthe best way to motivate each and everyone to learn basic competencies,\r\nto learn lifelong skills and to be the best that he can be. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-fb9f864d-ac17-4d8b-a30b-07ec03254b42\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-fb9f864d-ac17-4d8b-a30b-07ec03254b42\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4bef6a52-7502-46bc-a3f5-bbca5d73dd82\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4bef6a52-7502-46bc-a3f5-bbca5d73dd82\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Lim Biow\r\nChuan, can I invite you to withdraw your cut?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-d204cd56-c547-444d-9ec6-df14e8e0a260\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-d204cd56-c547-444d-9ec6-df14e8e0a260\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8e23793f-8cc0-4a6d-be3a-d1cc5a004d29\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8e23793f-8cc0-4a6d-be3a-d1cc5a004d29\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman,\r\nSir, I thank the Minister, the Minister of State, the two Senior\r\nParliamentary Secretaries for all their replies and clarifications.\r\nI also want to take the opportunity to thank the Permanent Secretary,\r\nSecond Permanent Secretary as well as all the staff of MOE for their\r\nhard work and support in providing the answers to the Members' concerns\r\nand queries.

Certainly, there\r\nare a number of programmes and schemes to provide assistance to\r\nour citizens who are already or would be affected by the economic\r\nslowdown. The Work Support Programme (WSP), ComCare Transitions\r\n(CCT) scheme and the Public Assistance (PA) scheme, are some laudable\r\nexamples. These programmes have been most useful and are high in\r\ndemand, especially during times of financial turmoil. Indeed, there\r\nwere most applications for the WSP and the PA scheme in 2009, about\r\nthe time when Singapore was most hit by the global financial crisis.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9809b49e-18a8-4064-924d-0d8fc0a902fa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9809b49e-18a8-4064-924d-0d8fc0a902fa\"><!--a--></a>For last year though,\r\nthe number of applications for WSP and CCT scheme seemed to be on\r\nthe rise again. Yet, the percentage of rejected applicants remained\r\nas high as the other years. The bulk of the rejected applications\r\nwere due to either the applicants having sufficient income or other resources\r\nthey could tap on, or that they could not provide the supporting\r\ndocuments and other reasons. Understandably, the financial assistance\r\nmeted out by these schemes are based on who needs it more, as well\r\nas being limited by the amount of resources we have. As much as\r\nour Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Voluntary Welfare\r\nOrganisations (VWOs) are doing their best to help these people,\r\nSir, is there a role, and I am sure there is, for the Ministry to\r\nplay an even more active part as well?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2348</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8f03f7e4-ac97-4531-8cd4-90fd17463fc3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8f03f7e4-ac97-4531-8cd4-90fd17463fc3\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the global uncertainty\r\nmay lead to workers being retrenched while others will suffer a\r\ndrop in income.

Two quick questions: how is the Ministry intending\r\nto help such affected workers and their families, should the economic\r\nslowdown happen and when there is this need? Also, how does the\r\nMinistry intend to support our CDCs, our FSCs and the other VWOs?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-46a01705-43fe-4bbb-99a0-a7e883d39dcc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-46a01705-43fe-4bbb-99a0-a7e883d39dcc\"><!--a--></a>My main concern here is\r\nthe inequality that we see in Singapore, and this appears to be\r\non the rise. Over the last few days, many Members have raised various\r\nsuggestions on how to reduce this inequality \u2013 some Members proposed\r\na higher tax for those who can afford it; some called for an increase\r\nin tax for those with more than one car, others ask for tweaks in\r\nthe Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) formula and others. I am supportive\r\nof such calls to use the tax system to make life a little bit more\r\nexpensive for the rich, and to channel these monies to the poor.\r\nBut for today, I want to make a simple proposal, which is to increase\r\nthe tax deductions for charities. Sir, I want the rich to willingly\r\nand compassionately help those causes they believe in, whether it\r\nis for children, for education, for nature. In this regard, I ask\r\nthe Government to consider upping the tax deductions for donations\r\nto any charity from the current 2.5 times to three times and to\r\nmake this a permanent feature.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e19ae286-c079-4609-9875-44755e15e916\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e19ae286-c079-4609-9875-44755e15e916\"><!--a--></a>Sir, aside from the wages\r\nmade, we need to address inequality through other means.

In our helpline centres like the ComCare Call Centre\r\nin Clemenceau Avenue, there are only about 16 staff manning 25 lines,\r\nand the helpline, I believe, receives about 2,500 calls on average per\r\nmonth. In 2009, the centre received the highest number of calls\r\nat almost 29,000.

Since\r\nthe formation of CLF in 2003, the partnership has grown from strength\r\nto strength, therefore reflecting that it is a platform which is\r\nconducive for people to come in and do projects. Top-down, bottoms-up,\r\nit depends on how you look at the glass. As far as we are concerned,\r\nit is an effective platform because today, as I mentioned in my\r\nreply, we have 130 partners, including many non-Muslim organisations,\r\nwho have decided that coming together on the CLF will help their\r\nMalay beneficiaries in terms of getting out of the dysfunctionalities\r\nthat they may face.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cbea9098-e2d7-48de-bb93-4b450fbc3804\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cbea9098-e2d7-48de-bb93-4b450fbc3804\"><!--a--></a>I think the more important\r\npoint is, let us work together on this platform that we have created.\r\nSometimes we should not confuse between chairing the network and ownership\r\nof the CLF. The CLF is owned by the community because the leaders\r\ndecided in 2003 to form the CLF. That is why, every year, we have\r\na convention to present to the community leaders our report. Before\r\nthe convention, the CLF Secretariat, which is housed in MENDAKI,\r\nmeets the community leaders to update them on the progress of each programme and\r\neven if there are new emerging trends that need to be discussed, we\r\nhave presented them to our leaders. So really the process is consultative\r\nand thus far I have not received any major complaints about how\r\nthe structure of the CLF has inhibited anybody from coming in. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-46429217-b9cb-4f1d-8180-8f17d4b9a981\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-46429217-b9cb-4f1d-8180-8f17d4b9a981\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2369</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-10090b9e-efe4-49f4-aa8b-4e8564f72296\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-10090b9e-efe4-49f4-aa8b-4e8564f72296\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>\r\n                  </span>: May I\r\nask the Minister, apart from the interest-free loans given to the\r\nMalay students who are keen on getting their university education\r\nabroad, will he consider offering bursaries to these students equivalent\r\nto what we would have given to the Malay students studying in the\r\nlocal tertiary institutions?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-98e00e29-a00f-47b6-9c19-ce7c20e7c415\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-98e00e29-a00f-47b6-9c19-ce7c20e7c415\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-01357496-e873-4a77-8475-10a056d0d15d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-01357496-e873-4a77-8475-10a056d0d15d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, it would be difficult for us to replicate the kinds of schemes\r\nthat are available out there because our funds are limited. What\r\nwe do every year is that based on the TTFS \u2013 and I want to remind\r\nthe House that we are just managers of the TTFS because the policy\r\nis decided by the Government, in close consultation with MENDAKI\r\n\u2013 based on the savings, we basically re-channel the savings back\r\nto the loan scheme. I cited the example of a girl who is studying\r\nlocally in a medical school, who could not get the TTFS because\r\nat that time, based on the income level and her family background,\r\nshe could not avail of the TTFS but she took the interest-free loans\r\nand she managed to graduate with a degree in medicine.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c8f169f4-1720-4485-a5b2-23673dbb95c2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c8f169f4-1720-4485-a5b2-23673dbb95c2\"><!--a--></a>The most important point\r\nis that, are there schemes out there to help? What we have been\r\ndoing over the last few years is reviewing our loan schemes so that\r\nthey are more targeted. For example, we have moved a lot more resource\r\nto help some of the Polytechnic upgraders who, for one reason or\r\nanother, despite excellent results, could not get a place in local\r\nUniversities. They have to travel to Australia, Canada or the US to\r\nget a degree and we decided to help them through interest-free loans.\r\nThey have accepted these and they are given a six-month period after\r\nthey graduated before they start repaying the loans. So, really,\r\nwe do not see this as a constraint. But our funds are limited. And\r\nbecause the loans are interest-free \u2013 and it is a revolving fund\r\nbecause we have to depend on the past recipients to return the money\r\nso that I can loan it to future recipients \u2013 given the time value\r\nof money, you will actually have an amount which is decreasing over\r\ntime because of inflation.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-278fcc1c-fc39-48e5-a593-a62af5426b76\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-278fcc1c-fc39-48e5-a593-a62af5426b76\"><!--a--></a>But it has served the\r\ncommunity well. The more important point is that if we need to really\r\nsend our kids overseas, we need to plan ahead \u2013 buy an insurance\r\npolicy and do other things that we can do to help our children secure\r\nbetter future if they have to go overseas. This is something which\r\nis being encouraged even by the Government. But at the same time,\r\nwhat we have done in MENDAKI is, any Malay or non-Malay but as long as\r\nthey are Muslim students who walk through the doors of MENDAKI and\r\nneed assistance, we will do our best. We do two things \u2013 one, we\r\nexplore what we have internally and if we cannot satisfy the students'\r\nneeds, we will then explore externally. We have written on behalf\r\nof the students to foundations like the Lee Foundation, Tan Kah\r\nKee Foundation, even other generous bodies to see whether they could\r\noffer some kind of support.

In fact, in about\r\nthree weeks' time, I will be going to my annual <em class=\"ph i\">haj</em> meeting\r\nto appeal again to the Saudi Government for an increase in quota,\r\nwhich has not changed for many, many years. But we are grateful\r\nbecause the Saudi Government has always relented in giving us additional\r\nquota. Even the additional quota is not sufficient because the demand\r\nis quite huge. But we will continue to work together. The most important\r\nthing is that there is a registration system that MUIS has put in\r\nplace to allow would-be pilgrims to plan ahead, whether it is this\r\nyear or next year. You can put in and join the queue and for MUIS\r\nto process this together with the agencies \u2013 the travel agencies\r\nand the Association \u2013 to make sure that the pilgrims who are going\r\noverseas to perform their <em class=\"ph i\">haj</em> are well-taken care of.

Sir, with this year's budgetary increase in\r\nsocial spending, our social safety net is cast wider but is it stronger?\r\nMuch will depend on how well the gap between planning and execution\r\nis monitored and closed. I wish to highlight just three gaps which\r\nI urge MCYS to address. First, many helping hands. The strengthening\r\nof the \"Many Helping Hands\" model to more effectively help those\r\nin need was highlighted by Minister of State Mdm Halimah Yacob herself\r\nwhen she was a backbencher. We are all aware that some people get\r\nmultiple or overlapping help; some are under-served and yet there\r\nare those who fall through the social safety net. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-767bcca0-1447-4faf-a6cb-9eef46dc6d0d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-767bcca0-1447-4faf-a6cb-9eef46dc6d0d\"><!--a--></a>We often speak of the\r\nneed to be client-centric but the many helping hands such as the\r\nCommunity Development Council (CDC), the Family Service Centre,\r\nthe grassroots, MPS volunteers, and other helping hands do not seem\r\nto be very much to confirm the strategies and division of duties\r\nto help, especially the families with chronic need. There is a strong\r\nneed for a systems integrator approach to manage help more effectively. Strengthening\r\nthe many helping hands and funding the use of tools such as case-management\r\ntemplates, social eco-maps and residents' databases must be a priority, and\r\nI urge MCYS to look into it.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b138ff4f-9d4f-4e2d-be0d-b545223b64f3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b138ff4f-9d4f-4e2d-be0d-b545223b64f3\"><!--a--></a>Next, on a more rigorous\r\nsearch for leadership talents and partners. Sir, the author of \"Good\r\nto Great\", Jim Collins, highlighted the need to get the \"right people\r\non the bus\" for any organisation to be great. The social service\r\nsector is no different. More than money, the sector needs more proven,\r\navailable innovative leadership talents. The appeal of taking the\r\npath of least resistance \u2013 getting safe and familiar partners who ironically\r\ncould have contributed to some current poor outcomes for the clients\r\n\u2013 should be resisted. I urge MCYS to embark on a more robust, rigorous\r\nand systematic search for the right leadership talents and VWO partners\r\nto help fulfil its mission.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4655535c-c292-4b28-9cdf-7899f84514d1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4655535c-c292-4b28-9cdf-7899f84514d1\"><!--a--></a>Lastly, on innovation.\r\nSir, the social service sector has often been given a badge of compassion.\r\nWe need to complement this with the badge of innovation to see even better\r\noutcomes.

In many cases, however, clients do not require these\r\ncounselling services as they do not face any other social or family\r\nissues. Take client A for example, she is a homemaker with three\r\nschool-going children. The husband is the sole breadwinner, drawing\r\na take-home pay of about $1,500. The children do well academically\r\nsince our client is able to supervise the children's studies at\r\nhome. The family also has minimal arrears because they budget their\r\nexpenses carefully. Yet, they could use some assistance to ease\r\ntheir financial burden especially since a substantial portion of\r\nthe family's household income goes to the children's school and\r\ndaily expenses. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a5ace9c7-f931-4204-9775-4102c7029aea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a5ace9c7-f931-4204-9775-4102c7029aea\"><!--a--></a>Sir, making casework and\r\ncounselling a compulsory criterion in SPMF applications could potentially\r\ndeter people like client A from applying for financial assistance\r\nunder the SPMF as they might find it a hassle to go through the\r\ncasework and counselling process when they do not have any issues\r\nto work on. Yet, the financial assistance could make a huge difference\r\nin enhancing the family's quality of life, thereby allowing the children\r\nto better focus on their studies. From an administrative perspective,\r\nwe should also free up our social workers from having to conduct\r\ncasework and counselling for clients who do not really require the\r\nservice, so that our social workers can focus their efforts on more\r\nurgent and complicated cases instead. I would therefore like to\r\nsuggest that the casework and counselling should only be required\r\nfor SPMF applicants, only when the social workers assess that there\r\nis a real need for it. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-975ec640-c1be-49d0-b832-f91d2d8f5554\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-975ec640-c1be-49d0-b832-f91d2d8f5554\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-01f26a31-97dc-47fd-9bab-9d47c9246255\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-01f26a31-97dc-47fd-9bab-9d47c9246255\"><!--a--></a>Standardised Definition\r\nof Low-income</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cde183c7-6c61-4c30-8627-bb417b5b1008\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cde183c7-6c61-4c30-8627-bb417b5b1008\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol) </strong>\r\n                  </span>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcLang\">(<em class=\"ph i\">In Mandarin</em>):\r\n[<em class=\"ph i\">Please refer to Pg 2420 for <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=043_20120308_S0016_T0025.pdf\"\">Vernacular Speeches</a>.</em>]</span> Mr Chairman, the Lien Centre\r\nfor Social Innovation at the Singapore Management University released\r\na report last year titled \"Unmet Social Needs in Singapore\".

Let me start with the cut on the social\r\nsafety net. Budget 2012 has helped to improve and strengthen Singapore's\r\nsocial safety nets in many ways, but I think one of the fundamental principles\r\nunderlying this is still the many helping hands approach. And this\r\nmeans that there are a great many different agencies involved \u2013\r\nthere are too many acronyms here for me to name \u2212 but these include\r\nHEPAS, CEPAF, CCFA, ICCP, HSP, HOPE, SCFA, CCT, ComCare, PAWIS.\r\nThere are a lot of acronyms there. I was hoping for two things in particular:\r\none, it would be nice if these many helping hands could be a little\r\nmore integrated; and, second, I was hoping that this more integrated\r\napproach can be implemented on a more localised level. Because I\r\nthink it is only at the local levels that we know very clearly what\r\neach household needs. So, I hope that MCYS can take these points\r\ninto account. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2378</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-833bcd00-80a3-4ffb-9bbf-9c7233ec7cd4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-833bcd00-80a3-4ffb-9bbf-9c7233ec7cd4\"><!--a--></a>Elderly</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5e0d92c4-767c-4a8c-8b42-df578acd1953\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5e0d92c4-767c-4a8c-8b42-df578acd1953\"><!--a--></a>The second cut I will\r\ndeal with is on the elderly. Budget 2012 is an inclusive Budget. There\r\nare many initiatives focusing on the elderly. I think this is very\r\ngood. But one of the things that many people get very emotive and\r\nupset about is when they see the elderly working in menial jobs\r\nsuch as cleaning, and so on. And I think there is a sense of outrage\r\nthat, perhaps, these people should be treated better. This leads\r\nto a couple of very specific questions. The first question is, what\r\nkind of support is there to ensure that the elderly have the option\r\nnot to work if they are unable to, and what support can be given\r\nto them. Second, it is not just about giving support to the elderly\r\nbut also in trying to build communities. So, what type of communities\r\ncan we build for the elderly? There has been a lot of unhappiness\r\nin the news about elderly day care centres being built in various\r\nneighbourhoods. What can we do to overcome this resistance to create\r\nactivity centres for the elderly? Of course, the final point is,\r\nnot all elderly do not want to work; some of them do want to work.\r\nAre there any steps in place to help them perhaps get better skills\r\nor to avoid discrimination if they so choose to work?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-3714fc89-2057-44ae-a803-76264b4ecc29\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3714fc89-2057-44ae-a803-76264b4ecc29\"><!--a--></a>Social Service Sector</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-045bc9e7-f160-4a09-b9c8-fce97e4054ea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-045bc9e7-f160-4a09-b9c8-fce97e4054ea\"><!--a--></a>The final cut I have is\r\non the social service sector. The social service sector is one that underlies\r\nmuch of the implementation of the social safety net. Some of the\r\nearlier speakers have said that the lack of social workers is probably\r\ngoing to be a rising concern. There are a couple of things that\r\ncan be done. One of the reasons that we might have a shortage of\r\nsocial workers is probably because of the wages of social workers. Obviously,\r\nif we provide higher wages, hopefully, more people will come into\r\nit. The second, of course, is to get a recruitment campaign which,\r\nI think, MCYS is doing right now. But I am not sure if that is enough\r\nto meet the shortfall. We understand from MCYS' press release in <em class=\"ph i\">The </em>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">Straits\r\nTimes</em>, just recently on 21 February, the expected shortfall\r\nof 200 social workers and there are only 800 registered practitioners.\r\nSo this seems like we need to increase the numbers by at least 25%,\r\nwhich is quite substantial. So, I would like to know what steps\r\nare in place to attract more people to this profession. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-7e943990-77fa-462a-8f94-190d37b44ac7\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-7e943990-77fa-462a-8f94-190d37b44ac7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-15633a43-0d65-4be6-95a3-b4af7719187e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-15633a43-0d65-4be6-95a3-b4af7719187e\"><!--a--></a>6.45 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-d3704b65-73d3-4b5b-a804-7a0fd89cc552\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d3704b65-73d3-4b5b-a804-7a0fd89cc552\"><!--a--></a>Social Workers and Caregivers</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ae5a38f1-039b-4526-b6f5-95b6e76e5a7b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ae5a38f1-039b-4526-b6f5-95b6e76e5a7b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, the\r\nwork of a social worker is a notable job that requires great sacrifices\r\nbut, unfortunately, the social service sector in Singapore is facing\r\na shortfall of about 200 social workers as revealed recently by\r\nthe Minister. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b2b5e18e-0ec7-4849-a939-f0927406bc7b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b2b5e18e-0ec7-4849-a939-f0927406bc7b\"><!--a--></a>Perhaps, this is where\r\nwe need creative solutions to alleviate the burden on the 800 dedicated\r\npeople who are registered social workers in Singapore.

I would suggest that if it is a case of Government outsourcing\r\nto the sector, that Government funds the specific programme fully,\r\nand let the charities raise and apply funds raised from the public\r\nto working on experimental and non-standard programmes. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2384</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5f925b0b-c66c-4500-a907-95e11efa097c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5f925b0b-c66c-4500-a907-95e11efa097c\"><!--a--></a>A calibrated approach is to treat charities\r\nin a differentiated way. There could be two or three tracks, such\r\nthat those which are more independent and autonomous, and have shown\r\na successful track record of innovating are treated differently\r\nfrom others that are still doing a good job but who prefer to focus\r\non running standard programmes. And we can experiment with more\r\nfunding for the former, and less active guidance and more co-creation\r\nwith the Government. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7a1a626e-f577-4993-95ca-2a28d547b385\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7a1a626e-f577-4993-95ca-2a28d547b385\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, there is a need\r\nto avoid the over-professionalisation of services. With the foreign\r\nlabour restrictions and ever increasing social needs, the supply\r\nof labour cannot possibly keep up with its demand, even if you pay\r\nmore. This is where I believe volunteerism needs to play a much\r\nstronger role. In fact, too many charities cast their mission too\r\nnarrowly and miss out on many potential volunteer opportunities.\r\nThis is sometimes the result of over-professionalisation of the\r\nservices they provide. Yet, numerous human services would not be\r\nas effective if they were merely professionally provided, as the\r\ncompassion provided by the volunteers can be an integral part of making\r\nthat service effective. Charities must recognise the benefits of\r\nengaging the community in their efforts and invest in better volunteer\r\nmanagement. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-718afcb6-ae75-454d-ab44-9187a77008f0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-718afcb6-ae75-454d-ab44-9187a77008f0\"><!--a--></a>Finally, I would like\r\nto talk about community development and empowerment.

It looks at how people from various levels of the community\r\ncan step up to be active contributors. It counteracts the predominant\r\nneeds-based approach to development, which presents a one-sided\r\nnegative view that often compromises community capacity building\r\nand social inclusion. And it rests on the principle that the recognition\r\nof strengths, gifts, and assets of individuals and communities is\r\nmuch more likely to inspire positive action for change than an exclusive\r\nfocus on needs and problems. The key to the ABCD is in the power\r\nof local associations to drive the community development process,\r\nidentify community assets and then connect them to multiply their\r\npower and effectiveness. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-33a6941b-0308-4fdf-a3bb-242ca63a6d1c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-33a6941b-0308-4fdf-a3bb-242ca63a6d1c\"><!--a--></a>The NVPC is experimenting\r\nwith this approach.

We introduced\r\nthis concept to the committee of the Children's Village in Bukit Timah\r\nwhere they were trying to build a cohesive village concept to replace\r\nchildcare centres. And the core committee engaged parents of pre-schoolers\r\nby holding a Parents' Night, a meeting where the organisers prepared\r\nno agenda and the agenda was entirely decided by parents and volunteers.\r\nThis experiment worked very well with many enthusiastic parents\r\ncontributing ideas and executing the ideas, like storytelling sessions,\r\nfamily outing days, and this went well beyond the committee's preconceived plans.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-168c49ea-a9d1-4269-90f4-b0159dbce746\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-168c49ea-a9d1-4269-90f4-b0159dbce746\"><!--a--></a>NVPC has since tried to\r\nintroduce the ABCD concept to other communities.
