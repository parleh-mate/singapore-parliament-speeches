The reasons are clear. Singapore has always benefited from being a bridge between East and West, and we must sustain that position. China's ascendance in the world makes this role indispensable for Singapore's future. We have to engage with China and be part of the flow of ideas, business and culture between China and the world. Equally fundamental is the fact that we are an Asian society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mother tongue languages give us our sense of identity and confidence as a people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective is to encourage every Chinese Singaporean to study the Chinese Language (CL) in school for as long as possible, and to as high a level as he is capable of. Students are required to study the language throughout their school years, and in junior college. &nbsp; We recognise that not all students have the same natural abilities in the languages, or the same home language backgrounds. By providing the option of taking the language at the Higher Chinese (HCL) or CL 'B' level, the curriculum allows different groups of students to go as far as they can achieve with reasonable effort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We provide incentives for students to take the language at the Higher Chinese (HCL) level if they are capable of doing so. These incentives are working well. Following the easing of the eligibility criteria for HCL earlier this year, we now have about 6,900 students taking HCL at Secondary 1 this year, an increase of 24% compared to last year.&nbsp; More students are also taking HCL in primary schools. This increased interest does not support Mdm Ho's perception that students see Chinese as an obsolete subject.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the junior colleges, fewer students are choosing to repeat their examinations in CL at the 'AO' level, after their first year, following the change in university <p align=left>Column: 11<p>admission requirements. However, more students in JC1 are now taking CL as a full 'A' level subject (CL 'A') and HCL, both of which count like any other 'A' level content subjects for university admission. &nbsp; As part of the new JC curriculum in a few years' time, MOE is also studying the introduction of&nbsp; a 'China Studies' elective, which could cover economic and social issues in contemporary China, besides Chinese culture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the examinations, incentives and entry requirements, we have to do more to help students develop an intrinsic interest in the Chinese Language and culture. They must be motivated to learn the language for its own worth, enjoy learning it, and want to continue using it after they leave school. We are shaping an appropriate curriculum and innovative teaching strategies in schools to help students develop this interest. But it will also need the active support and encouragement of parents, to help our children recognise the usefulness of the language to their children's&nbsp;future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese Language Curriculum and Pedagogy Review Committee, chaired by Mr Wee Heng Tin, &nbsp;is taking a thorough look at our CL curriculum.

What we have been doing so far is not to make Chinese easy.&nbsp; What we have been doing is to allow for a differentiated approach, recognising that students come from different home language backgrounds and&nbsp;have different linguistic intelligences and&nbsp; abilities.&nbsp; So we have a more variegated curriculum in place now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upshot of the changes that we have recently&nbsp;introduced is that&nbsp;they have&nbsp;allowed a&nbsp;larger number of students to now take Higher Chinese.&nbsp; There is also a small number taking CL 'B' and we should allow them to do so and not hold them back from doing so.&nbsp; Those who have real difficulty and despite great effort are unable to cope with the regular syllabus should be allowed to go further using CL 'B' rather than be turned off.&nbsp; But the main change that we have introduced in the last several months is to&nbsp;open the doors wider to students to do Higher Chinese, and it is working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many more students are now taking Higher Chinese compared to before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we can be quite encouraged by the response from our students and parents to the changes.&nbsp; It is clear that they take the language seriously.&nbsp; They are encouraging their students to go far and we should continue to push this along by reforming our curriculum, teaching methods, assessment system, so as to ensure that it is not just a matter of passing examinations and meeting entry requirements but of enjoying the language, taking a real interest in it and wanting to use it after they leave school.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 14<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

A good number of schools have stepped up efforts to engage the majority of their students in sports. We are encouraging this amongst more schools. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the <I>school</I> level, we will leverage on the House System to allow more students wishing to participate in games at a recreational level.&nbsp; With the assistance of student sports leaders, we expect that at least 70% of secondary school and JC students will have the opportunity to be involved in at least two sports events per year organised by the Houses. &nbsp; It is not the exact number that matters but the fact that the schools are taking this seriously, such as&nbsp;through the House System, and&nbsp;feel that there is opportunity to create a lot more interest and participation among the students.&nbsp; We are also encouraging schools to use PE lessons to teach a variety of sports and games skills.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We launched a Student Sports Coaching Course and a Student Sports Official Course earlier this year. This year we hope to train&nbsp;100 student sports coaches and officials in each of four games, namely, basketball, netball, soccer and touch rugby. They will assist their teachers by coaching their peers in school in basic sports skills, or help officiate in intra-house sports competitions. &nbsp; The scheme provides these students with additional opportunities to develop leadership abilities as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From next year, workshops in schools will be conducted for student leaders in badminton, table tennis, tennis, volleyball and floorball.&nbsp; Over time and with experience, we hope to widen this programme to more sports and games, depending on demand.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools can also tap on adult volunteers, especially parents.

The second question is:&nbsp; can the Minister also consider adding more bonus CCA points to sports and uniformed groups compared to the more passive CCAs than&nbsp;are presently proposed to encourage higher participation in what is generally acknowledged as useful activities in terms of ruggedness, teamwork and leadership qualities?&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister, with regard to participation in house sports and activities and so on, would that be considered for CCA points?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 18<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on facilities, overall our schools have access to quite good sports facilities compared to almost any other country you can think of, both within their school premises as well as in the cluster of schools or in the community.&nbsp; But we will keep track of this and, where we feel there is a need for better facilities in certain schools or in certain zones, we will see what we can do. There is of course a manpower constraint in schools and we do not want to over-burden our teachers with more responsibilities in CCAs. What we are doing basically, and what many schools have already done, is to allow for greater participation&nbsp;in sports, first, by way of involving student leaders; second, by involving parents, and third, by appropriate distribution of teachers' duties.&nbsp; And some schools have shown that this can be done very effectively. They have very high rates of participation in sports, especially amongst students who are not representing the school in inter-school competitions but would like to take part in&nbsp;sports on a recreational basis.&nbsp; So it can be done, and we are sharing best practices amongst the schools on how we can best spread sports participation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also provided some incentives for schools to take this seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new ranking system will look not just at excellence in sports&nbsp;at inter-school competitions but also the&nbsp;breadth of participation in sports and other physical activities. This will be one of the criteria&nbsp;by which we will assess schools in their ability to provide a holistic education to their students.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not want to go too far in using bonus points and&nbsp;the CCA grading system as a means of influencing behaviour. We have made some modest changes to the system, first, to recognise the fact that those who represent Combined Schools and&nbsp;Singapore have to put in very long hours and go through tremendous effort,<p align=left>Column: 19<p> and they deserve credit for doing so. So we have up their points slightly.&nbsp; We have also chosen to encourage students who currently take a Core CCA in the performing arts or clubs or societies, to consider taking a sport as a second CCA. It is not a full CCA - a second CCA means you take it for about 15 weeks or so, enjoy yourself, learning the basic sports skills, take part in some competitions within the school.&nbsp; And for those who would like to take that sports as a second CCA and who are not good enough to represent the school, we will nevertheless give them some CCA points.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are modest changes to the points system.&nbsp; At the end of the day, students would have to do what they love, they have to do what they like and take it seriously. That is what we encourage every student to think&nbsp;about.&nbsp; Do not just take a CCA for the points.&nbsp; They are not doing&nbsp;themselves any justice&nbsp;if they do that. They should think about what they really like to do and take it very seriously. We are providing some incentives for those who are not very good at&nbsp;sports, ie, not good enough to&nbsp;represent the school, to take it as a second CCA as a recreational acitivity, and we will give them some recognition for it.&nbsp; But there is a limit to what we can achieve through the points system. Students should ask themselves what they like and go ahead and do it.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister about the the new Uniformed Group that is to be run by MOE and MHA. Can I ask the Minister how different it will be from the present uniformed groups being run now like the girl guides, scouts and so on?&nbsp; My second question is:&nbsp; while I support fully this move towards getting more students involved in sports and uniformed groups, can I ask the Minister why is there a need to have a new Uniformed Group now, <p align=left>Column: 20<p>especially since the present ones are having trouble already in attracting young students to their fold?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; Our sense is that there is no trade-off in introducing a new Uniformed Group. We are not going to be drawing students away from existing uniformed groups.&nbsp; In some schools, it is a matter of leadership resources. By creating this new group, we are able to tap on new leadership resources, including the MHA organisations.&nbsp; I think it provides something different from what the existing uniformed groups provide.&nbsp; The National Civil Defence Cadet Corps will gear students in exercises on emergencies and such activities. There will be some overlap in activities with existing uniformed groups but it will provide for broader variety of options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also some students who do not find the existing uniformed groups to be their cup of tea but would like something like the new Uniformed Group. We have done a survey and&nbsp;found some interest. The schools that have responded positively to this are keen to start it up, not so as to decant students away from existing uniformed groups but as a way of increasing overall participation. So let us try it out. We are starting out with eight schools.&nbsp; I think it will work well and we will take it further from there.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)</B>:&nbsp; Two supplementary questions, please.&nbsp; Most schools go for selection process, even for CCAs.&nbsp; In view of the emphasis on CCA for mass participation, would&nbsp;it&nbsp;demolish this selection process?&nbsp; The second question is that&nbsp;we understand some of the community activities can be considered as part of the CCA programme of&nbsp;MOE.&nbsp; How many of such community activities have already been selected,&nbsp;and&nbsp;what are they?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mdm Cynthia Phua's first question, <p align=left>Column: 21<p>\"demolition\" is not a word customarily used by Education Ministers.&nbsp; We encourage, we enthuse and we provide opportunities.&nbsp; I think that is what schools are trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; The schools might have been overly selective in the past, partly because of resources, and because they have focused on excellence.&nbsp; We would like to encourage participation but I would like to leave it to each school to decide what they can do within their resources.&nbsp; The spirit is there. The schools are keen to encourage participation and we have given them some incentives to do so now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mdm Phua's second question on community CCAs, I do not have the details here but all of us can tell from what we see around us in our constituencies and CDCs, that there is already a fair bit happening. Some of them are the initiatives of the CDCs or the constituency grassroots, but a lot of it is coming from the schools themselves.&nbsp; There are service learning clubs and other initiatives in the school.&nbsp; By getting the school students more involved in the community,&nbsp;quite apart from the existing welfare-related activities that have existed for some time, they would be getting more engaged&nbsp;in&nbsp;something productive and constructive in the community.&nbsp; It is working well.&nbsp; I do not think it needs very hard pushing because the schools&nbsp;and the community organisations are&nbsp;enthusiastic.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister about sports injuries.

Then, there is a terminal operator who pays for part of the security, for example, the security at the access control and pre-board screening.&nbsp; That is borne by the terminal operator.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But users do pay for security at the airport.&nbsp; Passengers pay a fee of $21 for using the airport, of which $6 is a Passenger Security Service Charge.&nbsp; If we apply the principle of shared costs, and using the principle from the airport,&nbsp;we can&nbsp;see that for&nbsp;rail and road transport, both the operators, the Government and the commuter may have to pay for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Whereas in this case, it is the security of the facilities that we are talking about, and the security guards are not scanning or checking the baggage of persons and so on.&nbsp; Would the Minister of State not consider expanding the definition of the term \"installations\" in the train stations so that police officers could be deployed without the employment of security guards?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan (for the Minister for Transport):</B> Sir, I fully agree with the Member that there is a need to give ample notice to traffic of road works.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is empowered to control works on public streets through the Street Works Act (SWA) and Street Works (Works on Public Streets) Regulations.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Regulations, all utility agencies and contractors working on public streets are required to comply with the Code of Practice for Traffic Control at Work Zone (COP), which sets in place a set of comprehensive measures for those who work on public roads. &nbsp; The COP outlines clear standards and procedures and provides guidelines to utility agencies and contractors on the acceptable traffic control requirements needed to ensure the safety of the workers, motorists and pedestrians. &nbsp; LTA also chairs the monthly Road Opening Co-ordination Committee (ROCC) meeting with representatives from the National Parks Board, Traffic Police, HDB, JTC and the various utility agencies to emphasise the importance of road works traffic safety measures through the sharing of lessons learnt and good practices.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the COP, agencies must erect or provide early warning notices to motorists approaching the work zone.&nbsp; In <p align=left>Column: 26<p>addition, the COP also requires lane changes to be demarcated with orange cones or water filled barriers, depending on the nature of the diversions or road openings. &nbsp; These are supplemented by advance warning signs, placed at least 20&nbsp;metres from the work zone. &nbsp; On major highways, bright orange signs with alerts such as caution, arrows to show the diversion of the roads, works ahead, etc, are located at least 100 metres&nbsp;upstream, so that motorists would be aware of the situation and to exercise care and caution. &nbsp; As vehicles tend to be travelling at a higher speed on the highways, truck-mounted attenuators and orange cones also have to be provided just prior to the work zone, to help absorb the impact if vehicles should miss all the advance notices and still crash into the work site.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may wish to note that the LTA reviews and updates the COP regularly by drawing on the experiences of developed countries in traffic control and safety practices. &nbsp; LTA also regularly educates the road users on these measures, to ensure that they are able to react appropriately when faced with the various traffic control measures.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to adhere to the COP renders errant contractors in violation of the Street Works Regulations and penalties in the form of a system of fines and demerit points will be meted out. &nbsp; In the last&nbsp;three months, 71 contractors had been fined for not complying with the COP.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the COP is comprehensive, it is only as effective as the contractors and workers who implement it on the ground. &nbsp; To ensure proper implementation of the COP, LTA also conducts regular audits to identify sites with poor traffic control. &nbsp; Motorists can also play their part by calling LTA's hotline if they spot unsafe practices at road works so that these practices can be made right as soon as possible. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

I am just wondering whether a system can be implemented whereby even before they commence the actual work, somebody from LTA&nbsp;physically attends and ensures that adequate notice is given to oncoming vehicles.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;after an accident has taken place, it is no use worrying about what measures that were not in place.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Over the last six months, there has been no accident at any of the worksites.&nbsp; Of the 71 offences that were committed, because LTA audits the sites, they were all minor.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;offences were detected because members of the public called LTA, and LTA went down and noticed these minor infractions, fined the contractors, and the practices put right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether the COP is adequate,&nbsp;from an individual point of view, it is very hard to say.&nbsp; I, for example, was driving to work today and because of this question,&nbsp;I looked at all the signs at a construction site at the AYE.&nbsp; There were 10 signs.&nbsp; Usually, I see the first sign and I assume that there are road works, and I do not see all the other nine signs, but there were nine signs.&nbsp; In addition to that,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 28<p>there was another sign that says \"Road Works Over\".&nbsp; And&nbsp;to keep you happy, there is one more sign which says, \"Have a Good Day\" with a smile.&nbsp; Whether this is excessive or not, I do not know.&nbsp; I am not a safety engineer.&nbsp; The safety engineers in LTA go around.&nbsp; They look at standards around the world and they try to put best practices in place.&nbsp; If anyone knows of better practices than what our safety engineers in LTA know, I am sure they will consider it.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First, let me clarify that the new One Motoring portal is a merger of three separate existing portals, namely, the One.motoring, Traffic.smart and OnePay Hub portals.&nbsp; These portals provide useful services such as information on COE bids and car numbers available for bidding, road tax renewal, real-time traffic information and electronic payment options for fines and administrative fees. Collectively, they have more than&nbsp;two million page views and handle more than 300,000 online transactions per month.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the contracts for the hosting and operation of these three portals will expire this year, LTA took the opportunity to consolidate them for greater synergy and, at the same time, derive possible commercial benefits by outsourcing them to the private sector. A tender was called by LTA, and Green Dot Internet Services Pte Ltd (GDIS) won the contract.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, LTA incurs a cost of $6.3 million for hosting, operating and maintaining the&nbsp;three portals separately for a period of&nbsp;five years. The new 5-year<p align=left>Column: 30<p> contract will cost a total of $3.9 million or $780,000 annually. This represents a cost saving of about 40% for LTA, or about $500,000 annually. The remaining $1.1 million is a budget set aside under the contract for future enhancements that may be needed. It will only be payable as and when the enhancements are identified and implemented.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the new contract amount represents a significant cost saving over the current cost of running the three portals separately. In addition, integrating the three portals into one will make it more convenient for motorists, the motoring industry and members of the public, as they only need to go to one single site for a whole range of comprehensive motoring and traffic information.</p><div style=\"mso-element: footnote-list\"><br clear=\"all\">&nbsp;</div></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister of State for the answer and for the effort to actually merge the three websites into one and to facilitate users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is implemented as three websites merged into one and the tender has been called, what are the next three bids from the tenderers who&nbsp;tendered for&nbsp;this contract?&nbsp; I suppose Green Dot is actually the most expensive tender in this case, why was it&nbsp;selected?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</B> Sir, he&nbsp;assumes wrongly!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty companies purchased the&nbsp;tender documents.&nbsp; Companies such as Satyam Computer Services, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft (Singapore), etc, bought the tender documents.&nbsp; Two companies finally submitted their tenders.&nbsp; Of the two, Green Dot&nbsp;submitted the lower tender.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS--><p align=left>Column: 31<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Question stood in the name of Ms Indranee Rajah -</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in\">6.&nbsp; To ask the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the total number of illegal immigrants caught trying to enter&nbsp;Singapore through the various checkpoints over the past&nbsp;two years and (b) what are the measures being taken to deal with the problem of persons trying to enter&nbsp;Singapore illegally.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in\"><B>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</B> Question No. 6, Sir.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc.

The Police Coast Guard (PCG) has stepped up both sea and coastal patrols, acquired new high-speed patrol boats, and uses advanced equipment such as radar and electro-optical surveillance systems to monitor our waters and to intercept illegal immigrants.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker Sir, there has been some increase in the number of females below the age of 20 abusing drugs over the past three years. In 2001, 65 young female drug abusers <p align=left>Column: 34<p>were arrested. The number increased to 83 in 2002 and fell to 70 last year. The number of first-time young female abusers arrested increased slightly from 55 in 2001 to 60 last year.&nbsp; Overall, the number of young drug abusers has declined from 196 in 2001 to 191 last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the types of drug being abused, synthetic drugs were the predominant drugs consumed. Of the 218 young female drug abusers arrested in the last three years, 156 or 72% were arrested for consumption of synthetic drugs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is under control but we will press on with our efforts to tackle the drug abuse menace resolutely, adopting a multi-pronged approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first prong is preventive education.&nbsp; Potential drug abusers, especially the younger ones, must be steered away from being entrapped by drugs. In recent years, we have enhanced our preventive efforts with respect to synthetic drugs. The dangers of abusing synthetic drugs are constantly publicised, with many of the activities targeted at youths. For example, CNB conducts talks, competitions and other activities such as drama retreats and camps to highlight the harmful effects of synthetic drugs. In addition, the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and CNB have been organising the annual \"Clubs Against Drugs\" Campaign, to enlist club operators to promote the anti-drug message to their patrons who are mainly young adults. NCADA also mounted a media campaign against ketamine abuse in March this year, specifically targeting at youths. We will press on with our preventive education efforts. As part of this effort, we will also publicise our strict laws as set out in the Misuse of Drugs Act against the trafficking, manufacture, possession and consumption of synthetic drugs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 35<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second prong is enforcement. Synthetic drugs are closely associated with the night entertainment scene which young people are involved in. We have enlisted the help of operators in our fight against drugs. For example, in February this year, CNB conducted a briefing for licensees and operators of nightspots and entertainment outlets to remind them of their social and legal responsibilities to keep their premises free of illicit drug activities. CNB also regularly conducts island-wide operations to round up synthetic drug abusers. The number of raids at various night entertainment outlets has been stepped up .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third prong is rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of drug abusers will help prevent them from returning to their drug taking habits. Currently, convicted synthetic drug abusers are sent to prisons and do not benefit from the rehabilitative programmes that opiate abusers undergo at the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRC).&nbsp; We have reviewed this and will be introducing a DRC regime for synthetic drug abusers in lieu of imprisonment. This will offer them a more focused rehabilitation programme which will minimise the chances of them going back to drugs.&nbsp; In addition, the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-offenders (CARE) Network provides aftercare support services for these abusers after their discharge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Sir, we will take this multi-pronged approach and press on with our fight against drug abuse.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B>&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to what extent have collaborative efforts been mounted in schools to educate girls and boys on the issue of drugs.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 36<p>\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

As part of their overall package, pensionable officers receive lower CPF contributions than non-pensionable officers.&nbsp; Political appointees are also on pensions because their terms of service follow those of Administrative Officers.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In other words, their CPF may run out before the citizens die whereas qualified Ministers are taken care of by the taxpayers' money until they die.&nbsp; Am I right to say that?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Hsien Loong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And when a person retires, he has a choice of having a pension stream for the rest of his life or taking a commuted lump sum at the point of retirement.&nbsp; In fact, as a matter of fact, nearly everybody who retires prefers the commuted lump sum.&nbsp; Because you take a lump sum, you invest it, you do what you want.&nbsp; If it runs out, it runs out.&nbsp; There is no free lunch.&nbsp; If you do not have your CPF, you have the pension.&nbsp; If you have the pension, you have less CPF.&nbsp; So it all adds up to a finite amount.&nbsp; The Member's implicit question is: are the Ministers enriching themselves again?&nbsp; And the answer is, we are going on market terms and, if anything, we are paying below what the market is.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In this respect, GLCs&rsquo; overseas investments are no different from those by non-GLCs.&nbsp; GLC investments are guided purely by financial considerations and are subject to market discipline and scrutiny, as is the case with investments by any other commercial entity.&nbsp; The Government does not seek to guide or influence these investment decisions.&nbsp; This is one reason why our GLCs have generally performed well against their industry peers regionally and globally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving the GLCs free to operate on a commercial basis has helped to maximise their benefits to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> economy and Singaporeans.&nbsp; The GLCs&rsquo; overseas investments have generally sought to complement their core businesses and strategies.&nbsp; For instance, SingTel acquired Optus - a key player in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s telecommunications market - as part of its overall strategy to become a leading regional telecommunications operator.&nbsp; SingTel now has two main hubs - in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> - providing a wide range of communications services and diverse sources of revenue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it makes commercial sense, GLCs have also teamed up with local enterprises to compete abroad or to complement their local operations.&nbsp; Temasek, for example, bought into some<p align=left>Column: 39<p> SMEs in their growing phase, such as Osim and Hyflux.&nbsp; GLCs also use SMEs extensively as contractors or sub-contractors.&nbsp; For example, SIA has been working with home-grown advertising agency Batey Ads for many years to establish SIA's brand internationally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GLCs and their investments help to build and nurture internationally competitive businesses.&nbsp; This in turn enhances <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s economic resilience.&nbsp;

However, this is a temporary situation.&nbsp; I think it arose as a result of a sharp drop in the demand and, since then, we have reduced the supply and we have cut back on the building of new HDB flats.&nbsp;

the benefits that the sellers can get from the sale of flat.&nbsp; With all these changes, perhaps it is time for the Minister to consider a policy review of this 30-month time bar&nbsp;to a shorter period, so that at least it will not be such a long holding period for those who are affected.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 42<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is the reason why we have a time bar.&nbsp; Whether it is 30 months or whether it should be less, from time to time, we do review our policies.&nbsp; At this point in time, I see no need to change this policy.&nbsp;

They have a certain position that they are taking, in terms of the interest rates, and so on and so forth.&nbsp; I know for a fact that an insurance company, NTUC Income, does offer reverse mortgages.&nbsp; But I am told that it is currently not very popular with HDB lessees.&nbsp; One of the reasons is that the terms under which it is offered&nbsp;are not very attractive.&nbsp; And again, this is something that the company has to decide whether it is able to offer better terms so as to attract more people to come.&nbsp; This is not a decision for HDB to take.&nbsp; In fact, HDB has since last year stopped the issuing of mortgage loans for certain categories of people.&nbsp; So it is really not HDB's role to offer mortgage financing, or in this case reverse mortgage financing, to its lessees.&nbsp; I think its job should be to provide public housing, to frame policy on public housing, to provide loans for first timers and to make sure that first timer families are adequately provided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the retirees, there are other provisions being made, including some of those that I mentioned earlier,eg, allowing lessees to sublet their flats totally.&nbsp; We can&nbsp;relax those conditions even further, if necessary.&nbsp; But that must be one of the options, that after you no longer need a big flat, you should have a means to downgrade to a smaller one, or to live with your children and make use of the money for your retirement needs.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;there are options available.&nbsp; It is best for the private sector to provide such financing.&nbsp; Yes,&nbsp;HDB will facilitate such schemes to the maximum extent possible.&nbsp; But it will not provide such schemes.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS--><p align=left>Column: 47<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They&nbsp;are encouraged to live with their parents for mutual care and support.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government recognises that there are some older Singaporeans who remain single and may prefer to live on their own.&nbsp; To meet the housing needs of this group, HDB has implemented two housing schemes, ie,&nbsp;the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme and the Joint Singles Scheme,&nbsp;for citizen singles who are 35 years old or above to buy resale HDB flats.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

There is currently no intention to lower the minimum age.&nbsp; Younger singles below 35 can buy a HDB flat together with their parents.&nbsp; Those who wish to stay on their own have other housing options, such as renting a flat or room from the open market.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As a clarification for Mr Chiam, singles are not allowed to buy new flats.&nbsp; They are only allowed to buy resale flats.&nbsp; The reason for that is very simple.&nbsp; New flats are only for those who can form a family unit.&nbsp; So, that is a very clear-cut policy.&nbsp; What the&nbsp;Member was asking&nbsp;was whether we are going to lower the 35 age limit to 30 for singles to buy resale flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an entirely different matter.&nbsp; So, I think the third question is quite irrelevant.&nbsp; It does not matter whether we have 20,000 or 30,000 empty flats, because singles are not eligible to buy those flats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question was whether I think at age&nbsp;30 they are&nbsp;mature enough&nbsp;to live alone.&nbsp; Absolutely!&nbsp; There are people who are 18 and are quite mature and are able to live on their own, and there are people who are 50 who are still not mature and cannot live on their own.&nbsp; That has&nbsp;absolutely nothing to do with this policy because, if you want to live on your own and you are mature enough to do so, by all means do so.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, you cannot do so in a HDB flat.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;rent a flat, rent a room and you can do whatever you like, but&nbsp;we need to keep this 35-year-old age limit for HDB flats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first question is whether I agree that a single at 30 living in her own flat is more marriageable or more desirable.&nbsp; Maybe, maybe not.&nbsp; But, again, that has nothing to do with this policy because, as far as this is concerned, we are saying that at age 30, 31, 32, 33 or 34,&nbsp;they are still&nbsp;likely to get married, their&nbsp;chances of getting married are still good.&nbsp; Therefore, there is no need&nbsp;to change this policy.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does the Minister realise that this social policy of forcing young couples to get married in order to buy a HDB flat is one of the main causes of marital divorces in recent years?&nbsp; People are buying HDB flats for the wrong reason.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But the Member asked whether we should be divorcing HDB's role as&nbsp;a service provider from&nbsp;it being a social service agency.&nbsp; The simple answer is that we are providing subsidised HDB flats,&nbsp;the subsidy is for a reason, and there are many social reasons why we formulate HDB policies.&nbsp; The singles policy is just one of them.&nbsp; The ethnic integration policy is another.&nbsp; The mixing of 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats so that people from different socio-economic backgrounds live together so that there is greater social harmony and bonding is yet another.&nbsp; So, HDB policies have all along been designed to promote family values and achieve social objectives.&nbsp; It is not something that is new or it is not something that is only for the singles.&nbsp; So, wherever it is desirable, the Government will do so, and it will justify the subsidy, ie, the money that it is giving out from the taxpayers.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a whole series of questions, but I will try and answer them in general.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, hospital care is a very complex organism, with so many different people involved and with specialists in different areas.&nbsp; In the hospital, the doctors are also involved in multiple functions.&nbsp; They not only look after patients, they also teach and present papers at international meetings.&nbsp; So, although a patient is under the care of a certain consultant, quite often the patient does not see the consultant.&nbsp; He goes to the clinic, but the consultant may be&nbsp;presenting a paper at a meeting or he may be doing an emergency operation.&nbsp; But what the patient wants, very often, is a familiar face.&nbsp; They very much&nbsp;like to see the same person time after time, so that they know this doctor remembers the complaint that they had&nbsp;eight, nine or 10 visits ago.&nbsp; Really, that is a function of primary care.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 53<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what a patient should do is that he should have a general practitioner, someone whom he can see all the time and who understands all the complaints.&nbsp; What too many patients do, is that&nbsp;they go to a specialist clinic, once they have a problem, say, a heart problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;They try and make use of the specialist as their primary physician and expect that every time they go to the clinic, he will be there.&nbsp; This is very hard for a hospital to provide, because of the very nature and complexity of hospital care.&nbsp; So, to ensure that when you go to a clinic, the doctor at the clinic is able to read the writing that was written before and the doctor remembers all the complaints over the last 10 visits, really, a lot of patients who are currently going to our specialist clinics and trying to make use of our specialists as their primary physician, should switch their focus and think of the general practitioner as their primary physician, the one who is going to be their friend, confidant and help them navigate through the complex&nbsp;system in modern healthcare.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore introduced National Service 37 years ago in 1967, just two years after independence.&nbsp; With a small population, we needed National Service to build up a credible SAF in order to deter potential aggressors and protect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our small and vulnerable nation. This remains as vital today as it was in the early days of our nationhood.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peace and prosperity that Singapore has enjoyed over the past four decades have been built on the dedication of the generations of National Servicemen who have served since then.&nbsp; About 680,000 Singaporeans have served <p align=left>Column: 56<p>National Service in the Singapore Armed Forces, Police Force and Civil Defence Force.&nbsp; Sons now follow their fathers through this rite of passage in which our boys become men as they learn to defend our nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans understand and accept the need for National Service.&nbsp; Our young men want to do their best when they serve.&nbsp; They put in the extra effort in order to take on the challenge and responsibility of becoming commanders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Review of full-time National Service duration</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duration of full-time National Service depends on two factors:&nbsp; how long it takes to train soldiers and commanders to be operationally proficient in their duties, and how large a standing force we need, ie, how many full-time units we need for defence and contingency purposes during peacetime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1971, we have required National Servicemen who are promoted to the rank of Corporal and higher to serve 2\u00bd&nbsp;years of full-time National Service while all other National Servicemen serve for&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; All National Servicemen who have attained A-level and Diploma qualifications or higher are promoted to at least the rank of Corporal and therefore serve 2\u00bd years of full-time National Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the Ministry of Defence has periodically reviewed the training methods and operational deployment requirements. We want to ensure that, on the one hand, the SAF is always ready to carry out its missions, while on the other hand, National Servicemen spend no more time than is necessary to carry out their NS duties.&nbsp; In other words, we aim to keep the period of full-time National Service not longer than what is necessary for our defence needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF has recently carried out a thorough review of the full-time National<p align=left>Column: 57<p> Service duration.&nbsp; MINDEF has concluded that it can reduce the full-time National Service duration for those who currently have to serve 2\u00bd years by six months, to two years, while maintaining the operational readiness of the SAF and its ability to fulfil its mission. This means that all National Servicemen will therefore serve 24 months or two years of full-time National Service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two key factors come together to make such a change feasible now.&nbsp; First, the key driver for this change is the Transformation to the 3rd Generation SAF and second, the key enabler for this change is a surge in the National Service intake over the next 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Transformation to the 3rd Generation SAF</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have steadily built up the SAF into a potent fighting force, operating modern, sophisticated and technologically advanced systems.&nbsp; As I informed Members in the Committee of Supply this year, MINDEF will be moving beyond this to transform the SAF over the next decade into the 3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp; The 3rd Generation SAF will be a military force that makes greater use of superior technology in areas such as comprehensive surveillance, battlefield awareness, precision strike and network-centric warfare.&nbsp; The 3rd Generation SAF will rely less on numbers of soldiers and more on the higher education levels and capabilities of our National Service soldiers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this transformation will take a decade to unfold, it is already underway and bearing fruit. One example of this is the Apache Longbow helicopter. The Apache's radar, guided missiles and data links between helicopters are an example of battlefield awareness, precision strike and network-centric warfare.&nbsp; The Apache transforms the battle into an asymmetric helicopter versus tank battle, allowing tanks to be destroyed at long range.<p align=left>Column: 58<p> Another example is the Army's new Primus self-propelled howitzer, which requires only one-third of the crew but is far more mobile and delivers greater firepower.&nbsp; Our investments in research and development and new systems will pave the way for such transformations not just at the unit and tactical level, but also at the operational and strategic levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transformation of the SAF is the key driver that allows us to transit to a shorter National Service duration.&nbsp; With the transformation of the SAF, more National Servicemen will be deployed in positions which are more challenging and make better use of their education and training, while serving a shorter period of full-time National Service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Surge in NS intake</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second key factor is the coming surge in the National Service intake. This is the enabler that allows us to make the transition to a shorter National Service duration now.&nbsp; There will be a 15% to 20% increase in the annual intake of full-time National Servicemen over 10 years starting from 2006.&nbsp; This surge is a result of the higher number of births per year starting in the 'Dragon' year of 1988 and lasting till 1997.&nbsp; This surge in NS intake over the next 10 years will allow us to maintain our operational readiness and standing force requirements even as we move to a 24-month National Service system and carry out the transformation towards the leaner 3rd Generation SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Maintaining SAF operational readiness</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For officers and section commanders, a 24-month full-time National Service period is needed.&nbsp; This will allow for up to 12 months of training and at least another 12 months of deployment for operational duties. For non-commanders, a 24-month period is sufficient to train a battalion for <p align=left>Column: 59<p>operations and to meet our standing force requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Improvement in training effectiveness</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF's training and operational standards will be maintained even with the six-month reduction.&nbsp; Over the years, the SAF has significantly improved its training effectiveness through the introduction of new systems and technologies.&nbsp; For example, today, a recruit at the new Basic Military Training Centre in Pulau Tekong learns how to shoot on the Individual Marksmanship Trainer which is within marching distance in his camp.&nbsp; His shooting technique can be analysed, corrected and improved on in this marksmanship trainer before he goes to the live-firing range.&nbsp; In the old days, a recruit could spend&nbsp;the whole day out at the range, mostly waiting for his turn to shoot just ten rounds, and at the end, he would not really know why he shot well or why he shot badly, nor&nbsp;how to improve.&nbsp; Simulators and trainers have also proven effective for drivers, tank crews and signallers.&nbsp; And we have provided more efficient and focused training for commanders with the introduction of wargaming systems.&nbsp; The use of such simulators, war games and Computer Aided Instruction has enhanced training effectiveness while saving time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF's operational readiness and its ability to achieve its mission will also be maintained.&nbsp; The investments we are making in transforming to the 3G SAF and the new capabilities we are developing will enable us to maintain a strong SAF and reduce our dependence on large numbers of full-time National Servicemen.&nbsp; This reduced NS duration of 24 months will be sustainable over the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to thank Members of this House for their continuing strong support for national defence. Despite the <p align=left>Column: 60<p>economic challenges Singapore has faced in the last few years, this House has remained fully committed to national defence. This year, the budget caps of all Ministries were reduced by 2%, except for MINDEF.&nbsp; And Members of this House have, during the Budget&nbsp;Debate, robustly reaffirmed the need for a strong SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Implementation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now address the implementation details. MINDEF will implement the revised 24-month full-time NS duration with effect from the batch of National Servicemen who will be enlisted in December 2004, ie, at the end of this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To minimise transitional anomalies where servicemen who enlist later complete their full-time NS before those who enlist earlier, there will be a graduated reduction in duration for batches enlisted earlier than the December 2004 batch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who are enlisted between June and November this year for 2\u00bd years of full-time National Service will get a four-month cut in full-time NS duration. Full-time National Servicemen who are currently serving their 2\u00bd years of service will get up to a two-month cut in service duration.&nbsp; I said \"up to a two-month cut\" because the earliest date that the ORD for these in-service National Servicemen can be brought forward to will be 30th June 2004, to allow time for the units to do their administrative out-processing arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full-time National Servicemen returning from disruption to serve out the balance of their 2\u00bd years of full-time National Service will also be given a corresponding cut in their NS duration based on the cohort in which they were enlisted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 61<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be no change for those serving two years of full-time National Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current eight-week reduction in National Service duration given to National Servicemen who have attained a pre-enlistment fitness level of at least a NAPFA Silver will remain.&nbsp; This eight-week reduction for fit enlistees will be granted in two parts - four weeks at the beginning of their service during the Basic Military Training phase and four weeks at the end of their full-time National Service period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Home Affairs will be implementing the corresponding changes for National Servicemen currently serving in or who will be enlisted into the Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Civil Defence Force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF will be working with our local universities to better align the university intake schedules from 2007 when the first batch of National Servicemen serving the new NS duration completes their full-time National Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the rapid advance of technology and new war-fighting concepts have made it possible for us to carry out&nbsp;a transformation to the 3rd Generation SAF and reduce the duration of full-time National Service.&nbsp; The surge in National Service intake over the next 10 years enables us to maintain the SAF's operational readiness while making this transition.&nbsp; A strong National Service system, with dedicated and committed National Servicemen, both full-time and in the operationally-ready service, remains the bedrock of our defence to guarantee the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude by thanking all our National Servicemen who have served<p align=left>Column: 62<p> over the years in the defence of our nation.&nbsp; I would also like to thank the parents, wives, girlfriends and other family members for the support that they have given to our National Servicemen. Those who have served are the role models for our future National Servicemen.&nbsp; Their dedication and commitment made it possible for Singapore to enjoy the peace and security, which is the foundation for our prosperity and progress, and made us the nation that we are.&nbsp;

What motivated this change is that the transformation that we have been making in the SAF over the last few years has begun to bear fruit.&nbsp; We are more confident that the technologies available, the systems that we have fielded, will be able to give the SAF that edge as these technologies unfold and become fielded over the next 10 years.&nbsp; With our National Servicemen who are highly educated, well motivated, we are confident that they will be able to master these new technologies and systems and deliver for Singapore a defence which is even more capable than the one that we have today, notwithstanding the reduction in National Service period.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what I do hope is that with this period of National Service of 24 months, our servicemen doing their full-time National Service will be even more motivated to give of their best during this period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the turning point?&nbsp; There was a confluence of two factors.&nbsp; The 3G SAF is the driver for this change which leads us to this reduction in National Service duration and a leaner SAF.&nbsp; The enabler was the surge in the National Service intake which will be taking place in the next 1-2 years lasting for 10 years.&nbsp; This allows us to do this transformation while maintaining the operational readiness of the SAF.&nbsp;

What this 10-year surge provides us with is the ability to do this transformation and maintain our operational readiness at the same time.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can refer Members to the chart that I distributed on total National Service full-time resource, the average level of National Service resource for the past 15 years, from 1990 to the year 2005, was 19,100 annually.&nbsp; Over the next 10 years, we expect it to be 24,300, and in the 10-15 years after that, we expect it to come down but not to as low a level as it is today.&nbsp; We expect it to come down to about 20,600, based on current estimates and even current estimates of our total fertility rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And we know that many of the young men who come into National Service today really want to do their best.&nbsp; Many of them strive very hard to become commanders and officers.&nbsp; This is a very good sign.&nbsp; So, this is really not a response at all to any public pressure on National Service.&nbsp; In fact, what it does is that it draws on the very strong public support for National Service, the very <p align=left>Column: 65<p>strong motivation of our young men to do well in National Service, to give them more challenging and demanding things to do so that they can give us a better defence.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Of course, from&nbsp;a purely defence point of view, I would like to have as long a time as possible, but it is incumbent upon the Ministry of Defence when we have a National Service system to ensure that the length of National Service is always sufficient to meet our defence needs but, at the same time, it is not longer than it is necessary for our defence needs, and that must be the primary consideration.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Minister whether&nbsp;the training itself would now be intensive for those who have to be compressed from 2 1/2 to 2 years, and also whether the Minister will consider sending them more on peacekeeping missions to make sure that they are indeed operationally ready to face any conflict situations and we hope that they will not be tested in war.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 66<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is that the House has supported MINDEF in its increased budget, because we want to see a strong SAF.&nbsp; And with the change that has been announced today, there will be small savings.&nbsp; Although that is not the motivating factor for the change, can I ask the Minister whether he can assure and enlighten the House on how the budget of MINDEF will be spent to ensure that indeed despite the changes announced today, MINDEF will be stronger and continue to build up its capabilities to deter and to defend Singapore.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:RAdm Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, to some extent, the training will be more intensive and, in fact, this is something which has been happening over the years.&nbsp; For example, we have much more mechanisation in the Armed Forces today.&nbsp; And to train&nbsp;an armour crew is more complex and more complicated than training&nbsp;infantry men, and we have many more armour crewmen today.&nbsp; But because we have very much improved training systems, like our armour simulator, we can take our crewmen and give them very high value and very intensive training and good feedback in that training in a relatively short period of time.&nbsp; So our tank crewmen can actually do the equivalent of a battle with their tanks whilst sitting in the simulators within one or two hours when, previously, they would have had to take out their tanks, drive out for one or two hours administratively to the training areas to conduct an exercise before coming back again for one or two hours administratively.&nbsp; So, from that point of view, you can say that the training is more intensive.&nbsp; It makes better use of time and is much more effective.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will we send our people for more PKOs?&nbsp; I must say that PKOs have been very useful for the SAF in developing its operational doctrine and giving it<p align=left>Column: 67<p> operational experience.&nbsp; And where this fits in with our national objectives, we will do so.&nbsp; But for National Servicemen, the principle that we have followed for PKOs is that we have asked them to volunteer for these PKOs.&nbsp; And I am glad to say that a good number of National Servicemen have done so. This speaks well of the SAF and speaks well of our National Servicemen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will there be savings from this reduction in NS period?&nbsp; That was not the primary consideration at all, I should say.&nbsp; In fact, whatever savings that we may get from the reduction, we will absorb completely because of the increase in the number of National Servicemen coming into the SAF.&nbsp; As I said, that was not the primary consideration.&nbsp; We will put in as much as we need to for defence.&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have done in the Ministry of Defence's budget is to place high priority on transforming into the 3rd generation SAF.&nbsp; And if you ask me where would I put the marginal dollar today, I would prefer to put the marginal dollar into investment in transformation of the SAF rather than putting the marginal dollar into more people.&nbsp; Indeed, I informed the House in the Committee of Supply that we are putting aside 1% of the defence budget for experimentation.&nbsp; And I am glad that many Members of this House actually took up my invitation to visit the SAF Centre for Military Experimentation a couple of weeks ago.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, why 24 months of National Service and why have we not been able to cut it shorter for those who, for example, are currently serving 24 months of National Service?&nbsp; As I explained, we need to maintain&nbsp;sufficiently large units in order to have a standing force to meet our peacetime contingencies.&nbsp; Our units are made up of both \"A\" level and diploma National Servicemen as well as those who do not have \"A\" levels and diplomas.&nbsp; So they are mixed units.&nbsp; We need about 12 months in order for the men to complete their individual as well as collective training to reach a sufficient level of proficiency for the whole unit.&nbsp; And after<p align=left>Column: 69<p> that, we need to have enough units who are operationally ready in order to meet these peacetime contingencies.&nbsp; Our estimation of the situation is that we need the units to serve for one year after they have been trained for 12 months in order to have sufficient units to meet our peacetime contingency requirements.&nbsp; If we were to reduce the period of National Service below 24 months, even for some of the soldiers, what it would mean is that there will be gaps in those units which will not be filled, and those units will not be able to fulfil their operational duties.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Anyway, I do welcome this move because it benefits the nation and the future batches of National Servicemen.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any&nbsp;consequential impact from this change of policy, eg,&nbsp;will there&nbsp;be any change or impact on&nbsp;the early disruption scheme?&nbsp; In the past, a person going for tertiary education, who had only a few more months to serve, was allowed to get his NS disrupted,&nbsp;go for his tertiary education, then come back and serve National Service for one or two months.&nbsp; In this case of a&nbsp;shorter NS period, could&nbsp;the Ministry&nbsp;still allow some disruption, so that students do not need to wait for a full year and&nbsp;have their school's programme affected?&nbsp; So, please do consider whether to continue with the early disruption scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is whether it has any impact on the period for reservist<p align=left>Column: 70<p> training. At the moment, there is a limit of 40 days.&nbsp; Usually it is shorter for yearly reservist training.&nbsp; In fact, I hope there is no increase in the reservist training period as a result of the shorter full-time training period.&nbsp; On the contrary, as the Minister has said, if&nbsp;modern technology could allow training to be more efficient, maybe, as a collateral, the reservist training period could be reduced further as well.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I should take Mr Chandra Mohan's point first, because I think that is an important point.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had National Service since 1967.&nbsp; At that time, we had two battalions of soldiers.&nbsp; In fact, not all of them were Singaporeans; many of them were not Singaporeans.&nbsp; We had no air force and we had, I think, one ship, the old and much beloved RSS <I>Panglima</I>.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 72<p> We would not be able to have the defence force that we have today without National Service - not just full-time National Service but also National Service for those who have finished their full-time service and gone out into the operationally-ready National Service force.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a population base of three to four million people, we will never be able to have a force which is sufficient to provide for our own security and defence in the situation that we are in.&nbsp; I think that you only need to look at the armed forces of countries which are of about the same population size as we are to realise that it is just not possible to have an armed forces of sufficient capability for our needs, based only on a regular force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do, however, have many committed regulars in the SAF, and they do duties which require a longer period of professional service and training.&nbsp; So, many of our people in the Air Force and in the Navy, for example, are regulars, and they have a much higher proportion of regulars than in the Army.&nbsp; In the Air Force, of course, all our fighter pilots are regulars, although we have some who, after their regular service, continue flying with the Air Force in their operationally-ready service.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will need to continue to depend on National Service for our defence needs for a long, long time to come, unless there is a fundamental change in our strategic circumstances, which I do not see happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank Mr Leong Horn Kee for his dedicated service in National Service, and also his son.&nbsp; He asked about disruption.&nbsp; The basic principle which we follow today, and which we will continue to follow,&nbsp;is that for people who are in the same cohort, we will allow them to go to university or higher education at the same time in the same year, basically.&nbsp; What it does mean is that we will be less liberal with disruption, because it is a shorter<p align=left>Column: 73<p> period and most of the students should be able to go on to higher education within the same year.&nbsp; So, there will be less need for disruption.&nbsp; But, at the same time, we will be less able to give disruption because the period is already shorter.&nbsp; But I do not see any great difficulties.&nbsp; There should not be any cases of students who, with the new duration of National Service, will go to higher education later than they do today.&nbsp; As I said, we will be discussing with our own universities to see what kind of changes in the schedules would be possible.&nbsp; But, of course, we cannot influence the academic calendars of universities in the northern hemisphere, for example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact on reservist training was also a question which Mr Leong Horn Kee and Dr Warren Lee asked about.&nbsp; In fact, I think reservists have already seen some impact on their training.&nbsp; Members may not be aware, but in April last year, we did make a change to our reservist training cycle.&nbsp; We used to have&nbsp;eight high-key years and&nbsp;five low-key years in a 13-year cycle.&nbsp; In April 2003, we changed that to&nbsp;seven high-key years, three low-key years, and three BIT (Basic Individual Training) years where the serviceman is called up for one to two days of basic proficiency refresher.&nbsp; So there has been an adjustment in the requirements for training for operationally-ready National Servicemen.&nbsp; And, again, these adjustments were made consciously and with the defence needs in mind to ensure that this would be sufficient for our defence needs, but that we do not call upon our operationally-ready National Servicemen for more than is necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee asked&nbsp;whether we can do improved matching for our National Servicemen so that we can make better use of the resources that we have.&nbsp; In fact, we&nbsp;constantly try to do so.&nbsp; Medical classification is imperfect as a science.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we tend to err on the side of caution.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not able to deploy them in all the <p align=left>Column: 74<p>areas that perhaps they could be deployed in.&nbsp; We have, for example, been relaxing our eyesight standards for various vocations.&nbsp; We have even been relaxing some of our medical fitness requirements for some vocations because there is more mechanisation in some of these vocations.&nbsp; So that means that we can deploy more of our people in such vocations.&nbsp; And, indeed, in many of our vocations, what we do require are people with better</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Currently, all auxiliary police forces, except for the CISCO Auxiliary Police Force, are regulated under section 71 of the Police Force Act and the Police Force (Auxiliary Police) Regulations.&nbsp; The CISCO Auxiliary Police Force is regulated by section 12 of the CISCO Act.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these Acts and Regulations, the auxiliary police officers in these auxiliary police forces are vested with a wide range of police powers, for example, search, arrest and the right to bear and discharge firearms.</p><p><I>New Operating Environment</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the increasingly complex security environment since September 11, the security measures at the various critical infrastructure and key installations have been stepped up.&nbsp; However, it is not possible for the Singapore Police Force to do everything and be everywhere.&nbsp; To ensure sustainability of our security measures in the long run, the owners of critical infrastructure and facilities must assume some responsibility for their physical security and protection by engaging auxiliary police forces, instead of relying solely on the Singapore Police Force.&nbsp; For example, CISCO Auxiliary Police Force supports the Singapore Police Force in ensuring safety and security of Singapore by providing armed security services to power stations and <p align=left>Column: 77<p>Government buildings.&nbsp; They also assist in crowd and traffic control for large scale events, such as the Chinese New Year Carnivals at Chinatown.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with the exception of the CISCO Auxiliary Police Force, all other auxiliary police forces can only exercise police powers within the limits of the areas owned by, or under the control of, the entities that own and operate the auxiliary police forces.&nbsp; For example, the Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS) Auxiliary Police Force may only operate within the confines of Changi Airport.&nbsp; This limitation on the areas of jurisdiction of the auxiliary police forces is no longer satisfactory.</p><p><I>Establishing auxiliary police force</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 86 will empower the Singapore Police Force, with the approval of the Minister for Home Affairs, to authorise the creation of auxiliary police forces that may operate commercially anywhere in Singapore, subject to specific conditions relating to ownership and the management of the auxiliary police forces.&nbsp; These conditions are necessary to ensure that only trusted agents may operate and manage auxiliary police forces in Singapore.&nbsp; Apart from being a Singapore-owned company, the Minister's approval is required for a change in ownership or substantial shareholder, so as to ensure that control of auxiliary police forces remains within Singapore's control and in good hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By allowing more auxiliary police forces to operate islandwide, we will increase the pool of armed security officers that can support the Singapore Police Force in ensuring safety and security of Singapore.&nbsp; At the same time, we would also be introducing competition into the armed security industry, unlike currently where only CISCO is allowed to operate islandwide.</p><p align=left>Column: 78<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the liberalisation of the armed security industry, it is no longer tenable for CISCO to remain as a statutory board under the Home Affairs Ministry competing with other auxiliary police forces.&nbsp; In view of this, the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to corporatise CISCO, to create a level playing field for all players in the armed security industry.&nbsp; With its corporatisation, CISCO will be freed from the various obligations and restrictions placed upon it as a statutory board under the Ministry of Home Affairs, and may allow market forces to determine its business ventures and decisions completely.&nbsp; Other auxiliary police forces will receive the assurance that CISCO will not enjoy any preferential treatment arising from its status as a statutory board.&nbsp; More details on the corporatisation will be announced when they are ready.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, this does not mean that with the opening up of the industry, there will be a proliferation of auxiliary police forces that will operate commercially anywhere in Singapore.&nbsp; While the Ministry of Home Affairs will allow market forces to determine the number of players the industry can support, a significant increase in the current number of auxiliary police forces in Singapore is clearly undesirable from both the security and economic viewpoints.&nbsp; Having too many players may result in an environment where industry standards are lowered as the auxiliary police forces respond to competitive pressures by cutting corners in order to win contracts.&nbsp; Thus, we will&nbsp;probably be allowing only two to three auxiliary police forces to operate islandwide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Limiting the powers of auxiliary police officers</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, auxiliary police officers do not perform all the functions of a regular police officer.&nbsp; They do not undergo the same intensity of training as police officers.&nbsp; Their entry requirements are also<p align=left>Column: 79<p> different.&nbsp; Because of these factors, there is a need to exercise further controls on the auxiliary police officers and impose practical limits on the exercise and scope of police powers by them.&nbsp; Such limits are necessary since auxiliary police officers will only need selected police powers in the course of their professional duties.&nbsp; This will distinguish them from the regular police officers.</p><p><I>Stronger regulatory controls</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existing Police Force Act does not contain provisions to hold the auxiliary police forces accountable to the operational standards and requirements as determined by the Singapore Police Force and to regulate competitive behaviour between the auxiliary police forces.&nbsp; This is because the existing auxiliary police forces, with the exception of CISCO, operate only within the confines of their workplace and cannot operate islandwide.&nbsp; However, the new provision on auxiliary police forces will allow them to operate islandwide if they meet the standards set by the Singapore Police Force.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed Bill will allow the Singapore Police Force to issue directives relating to operational standards in armed security services, as well as codes of practice relating to competitive behaviour and market conduct.&nbsp; To enforce these directives and other requirements, the Singapore Police Force will have powers to conduct audits of the auxiliary police forces in the areas of operations, training and staffing.&nbsp; The Bill provides for punitive measures against anyone who obstructs such audits.&nbsp; In addition, auxiliary police forces will be required to seek approval from the Singapore Police Force before undertaking any new armed security services.&nbsp; This will ensure that auxiliary police forces can provide the service adequately.</p><p align=left>Column: 80<p><p><I>Stronger disciplinary measures</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Singapore Police Force Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The proposed Bill provides for a comprehensive range of sanctions against auxiliary police forces as a whole, and against office bearers in the auxiliary police forces, when discipline and procedures have been breached.&nbsp; The sanctions include financial penalties for anti-competitive behaviour, which were modelled after the Telecommunications Act and the Media Development Authority of Singapore Act.&nbsp; The disciplinary measures that may be undertaken against errant or negligent auxiliary police officers have also been enhanced.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Powers of mobilisation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Home Affairs is also taking this opportunity to amend the Act to enable it to tap the auxiliary police forces to augment the homeland security when necessary.&nbsp; Currently, the Ministry can only mobilise CISCO auxiliary police officers in the event of a crisis.&nbsp; MHA does not have such powers over other auxiliary police forces, whose officers constitute an important and strategic resource in an emergency or crisis.&nbsp; Clause 97 of the Bill empowers the Ministry to mobilise any auxiliary police officers to support the Government during any peacetime contingency and crisis situations.&nbsp; Clause 98 ensures that auxiliary police forces whose officers are so mobilised are fairly compensated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to enhancing controls over auxiliary police officers, the Bill also makes other amendments and change outdated provisions in the existing Act.&nbsp; I shall briefly mention the main ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 81<p><p><I>Deployment of officers overseas</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police Force Act currently provides for the deployment of police officers to other countries, only if it is for the purpose of escorting and guarding of prisoners, or to Malaysia for any purpose.&nbsp; Clauses 20 and 56 of the Bill will widen the scope of this provision by allowing police officers to be deployed outside Singapore.&nbsp; Clause 56 also allows for the voluntary overseas deployment of Police National Service full-time officers, Police National Service officers, and officers of the Volunteer Special Constabulary.&nbsp; The revised provisions in clauses 57 to 59 will also allow disciplinary procedures to be invoked against breaches committed by officers while on overseas duty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Rationalising outdated provisions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill proposes to repeal sections 44 to 48 of the Police Force Act pertaining to the deployment of Malaysian police force officers in Singapore.&nbsp; These provisions, which pre-dated Singapore's independence, are no longer necessary since in practice any such deployment will require Singapore's consent.&nbsp; The provisions have not been used since Singapore's independence.&nbsp; Even without these provisions, there is already excellent cooperation between the Singapore Police Force and the Royal Malaysian Police on operations, investigation, training and information exchanges pertaining to criminal cases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other minor changes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of other minor changes have been made.&nbsp; Outdated references to three classes of police officers, \"subordinate officer\", \"inspector\" and \"gazetted officer\", have been deleted.&nbsp; The Police Force Bill has been aligned with the Constitution, and now reflects that the Public Service Commission is invested&nbsp;with the power to appoint senior police officers.&nbsp; The range of service offences and disciplinary measures for police<p align=left>Column: 82<p> officers have also been updated to remove outdated forms of punishment, whilst ensuring that they are adequate to maintain high standards of discipline.&nbsp; The procedures for a Committee of Inquiry, including its composition, powers and conduct, have been updated and aligned with that of the other uniformed services.&nbsp; Likewise, the provisions related to powers, duties and discipline of National Service police officers have also been updated.&nbsp; We have also taken the opportunity to refine the list of statutory duties of a police officer to better reflect the core functions of the Singapore Police Force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, given the prevailing security climate, this Bill will enhance the physical security and protection of our critical infrastructure and key installations by raising the standards and performance of the auxiliary police forces, through regulated and open competition.&nbsp; It will also free up the Singapore Police Force to focus on its core duties while empowering it to maintain adequate controls over the auxiliary police forces and mobilise them when needed, to support the Government during any peacetime contingency and crisis situations.&nbsp; With these changes, we are confident that the armed security industry will be a competent and responsible partner of the Home Team in ensuring homeland security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</B> Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill that repeals and re-enacts the current Police Force Act.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police is now a highly professional organisation well supported by the public in general.&nbsp; It has achieved an excellent reputation for its fight against crime and terrorism.&nbsp; In so far as this Bill seeks to update the law on the main police force, I do not see any cause for concern.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 83<p> Indeed, the Bill seeks to enhance the disciplinary procedures and create new offences.&nbsp; These will no doubt make the police force an even more professional and trustworthy organisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my main concern is with regard to the auxiliary police forces (APFs).&nbsp; The Minister has assured us that there will not be that many auxiliary police forces, and that there will be quite a number of checks and controls over such organisations.&nbsp; The intention, as I understand it from the Minister, is to allow owners of key installations and organisations to engage commercial auxiliary police forces, rather than to rely on the main police force.&nbsp; The Minister sees such auxiliary police forces as partners in their role to enhance and maintain Singapore as a secure and safe place to live and work.&nbsp; The Bill envisages that there will be several such forces, and that they are allowed to compete for work.&nbsp; Such forces can also be mobilised by the Ministry for contingencies and emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just have a couple of concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, such organisations as the auxiliary police forces would be commercially based.&nbsp; So, costs do become an issue.&nbsp; Would the increase in the number of such APFs create an even more serious demand for suitable manpower?&nbsp; Will such auxiliary police forces be allowed to employ foreign employees as officers?&nbsp; If so, how do we know whether such employees would be reliable and trustworthy?&nbsp; Screening them for past employment records would prove to be difficult, as it involves foreign authorities.&nbsp; These officers might be armed but, hopefully, not going to be dangerous.&nbsp; I hope there will be enough checks in place to control this problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Bill envisages that in times of emergency or other peacetime <p align=left>Column: 84<p>contingencies, the auxiliary police officers can be mobilised by the Ministry and they will then have the full powers of police officers.&nbsp; What safeguards do we have that they will be responsible in the exercise of such powers?&nbsp; The Minister explained earlier that the auxiliary police officers would not have the same standards of training and recruitment as the ordinary regular police officers, and they are not subject to the same disciplinary procedures, nor are the offences the same as those in the main police force.&nbsp; So, in effect, they are given the powers and privileges of police officers but not subject to the same strict regimen of discipline and proper conduct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister can assure this House and the public that such auxiliary police officers will perform their duties responsibly and that there will be sufficient checks in place to ensure that the officers in such organisations would be reliable and disciplined in their approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these comments, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> Sir, I wish to comment on clause 4 of the Bill which states the functions and the duties of the police force.&nbsp; The functions and duties of the police force are so wide that the police can be used by the authorities as they like, and even can be misused, especially in Singapore where the Government is so powerful.&nbsp; For this reason, I would like to see clause 4 amended&nbsp;by inserting a new paragraph (q) to clause 4(2) as follows:<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The duties of the police force shall be to take lawful measures for maintaining a neutral stance in all its dealings and it shall not be seen to be working with or used by any political party or used for any political purposes.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not making this suggestion without any substance.&nbsp; As an Opposition <p align=left>Column: 85<p>Member, I have experienced the misuse of the police, and I really think that the amendment is necessary for the good of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I have not been dealt fairly by police officers during my years in politics, especially during election time.&nbsp; I have also recently seen the police being&nbsp;used by grassroots organisations in their house-to-house visits in my constituency, and I have also seen the police officers being ordered by a senior grassroots officer not to answer a question I put to that police officer in regard to the places where the police officers have escorted grassroots leaders in their walkabouts and their house-to-house visits.&nbsp; As a Member of Parliament and a representative of the people, surely I have a right to ask a police officer a legitimate question and not be over-ruled by a grassroots leader.&nbsp; But, unfortunately,&nbsp;such a situation exists in Singapore, ie, a grassroots leader can order a police officer not to answer lawful questions put to him by an MP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Singapore wants to remake itself, the first step it should take is to tell the whole world that it is not a police state.&nbsp; For this, the Government can do it by entering in the statute books that the police in Singapore is neutral.&nbsp; The police shall not take sides at all.&nbsp; In the dispute of a person, the police in Singapore must be neutral.&nbsp; The police shall not take&nbsp;sides at all,&nbsp;whether&nbsp;the person supports the Opposition or the ruling party.&nbsp; Only when this is done can the people of Singapore be confident that the police shall be neutral.&nbsp; If this is not done, the people shall always have a lingering doubt, and the Remaking of Singapore programme shall be doomed to failure.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I also feel that, during elections, the police does not seem to be fair to the Opposition in terms of controlling election activities.&nbsp; It is<p align=left>Column: 86<p> important that the confidence of the public in the police must not be eroded.&nbsp; Otherwise, the question would arise as to&nbsp;whom the&nbsp;police should serve, as they are being paid by&nbsp;the people through taxpayers' money.&nbsp; It is an important question.&nbsp; I hope the Minister will clarify to assure the public that the police is serving Singaporeans and not only the PAP, and that it is not under the order of the PAP as a party.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have three points of concern on</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>this Bill. The first point of concern is the liability of the Government for acts of auxiliary police officers.&nbsp; Clause 105(1) provides that any act done by an auxiliary police officer shall be deemed to be an act done in the course of his employment with the company or statutory board who employs him. Clause 105(2) further provides that the Government will not be responsible for acts of auxiliary police officers.&nbsp; Clause 105 is not new in that it re-enacts the existing section 71 of the Act.&nbsp; However, one crucial difference is that the role of the auxiliary police force (APF) is now expanded.&nbsp; Under the existing section 71, the role of the APF is to safeguard life and property within designated areas. That was in the old Auxiliary Police Force Act.&nbsp; But now under the new Bill,&nbsp;clause 86(1)(c) and (d) provides that an APF may now be called upon to assist the&nbsp;Singapore Police Force and any&nbsp;Government departments. And clause 97 of the Bill even provides that the Commissioner of Police can mobilise&nbsp;members of the APF for police duty.&nbsp; In such a situation where the APF officers are acting on the instruction of Government, should not the Government be liable for the acts of the auxiliary police officers?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, on the punishment for disciplinary offence by the police officers, clause 95(1) of the Bill provides that when an auxiliary police officer has committed a disciplinary offence, instead of dealing with the case internally, he <p align=left>Column: 87<p>could be prosecuted in court.&nbsp; If he is prosecuted, then the sentence will be a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment of up to two years or both.&nbsp; By comparison, for a State police officer, clause 41(2) provides that if there is no specific sentence for the offence, the general punishment for a State police officer prosecuted for disciplinary offence is a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment of up to six months or both. Could the Minister clarify why the sentences for both SPF officers and APF officers are not the same?&nbsp; Is there a reason why APF officers are exposed to more severe punishment and sentence than the State police officers for similar offences?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my final point concerns clause 91 which aims to ensure&nbsp;fair market competition in the armed security industry in Singapore. Clause 91(1) states that any agreement, practice or conduct which distorts market competition, or which amounts to an abuse of a dominant position by any APF is not allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under&nbsp;clause 91(3), such practice or conduct is void.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, clause 91(7) allows the Commissioner of Police to exempt any APF employer from anti-competitive practice, such&nbsp;that the Commissioner can allow an APF employer to abuse his dominant position in the market.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify what kind of situation will justify the Commissioner to allow such a behaviour?&nbsp; And if other APF employers are affected by the Commissioner's decision to exempt the dominant player, do they have any recourse or is the Commissioner's exemption final?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, as Prof. Chin rightly pointed out, liberalisation of the armed security industry will lead to an increase in the demand for auxiliary police officers.&nbsp; The concern is whether this would lead to a lowering of standards.&nbsp; I would like to assure Prof. Chin that the<p align=left>Column: 88<p> current recruitment criteria will not be lowered.&nbsp; In addition to the criteria on educational qualifications and physical attributes, new applicants will need to undergo the various security screening and be cleared by the Singapore Police Force before they can be recruited. This would also apply to foreign applicants who have to furnish a certificate of no criminal conviction or its equivalent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern that he may have records that the Police does not have in Singapore can be addressed by this certificate of no criminal conviction issued by the home country of the foreigner concerned.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further address the point that competition&nbsp;may lead to a lowering of standards and control, &nbsp;the Singapore Police Force will be setting up a regulatory unit to oversee the auxiliary police forces and the auxiliary police officers. This unit will ensure that the standards will be maintained and that the auxiliary police officers will not abuse the powers given to them in the course of their work.&nbsp; The following measures will be taken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, through testing.&nbsp; With the liberalisation of the armed security industry, the auxiliary police forces will be allowed to set up their own training school or unit, as long as they are able to meet the criteria and standards set up by the Singapore Police Force.&nbsp; To ensure that high training standards are maintained, the Singapore Police Force will put in&nbsp;place a comprehensive certification and testing process.&nbsp; The auxiliary police officers will be required to pass written and scenario-based tests as well as shooting tests.&nbsp; The assessment syllabus will also include physical fitness, protective security, Police procedures and the relevant aspects of the law and handling of firearms.&nbsp; The whole assessment process will ensure that only well-trained auxiliary police officers are deployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it is through the use of directives.&nbsp; The control of standards will<p align=left>Column: 89<p> be strengthened through directives issued by the Police Force which will then lay out the operational standards and the requirements. The Singapore Police Force will also carry out regular&nbsp;ground&nbsp;inspections and audits to ensure&nbsp;strict compliance&nbsp;with the directives. Controls and checks will include assessing the general proficiency&nbsp;levels of the auxiliary police forces.&nbsp; When gaps such as failures to ensure adequate training of the officers are identified, the auxiliary police forces will be required to take steps to close them,&nbsp;failing which sanctions may be imposed. These sanctions could range from written warnings to imposing&nbsp;financial penalties&nbsp;or, in the worst case, suspending&nbsp;the auxiliary police force from providing armed security services.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, through an enhanced disciplinary&nbsp;framework. While the auxiliary police officers will be trained and briefed on the exercise of their Police powers, there will inevitably be \"black sheep\". The Singapore Police Force would introduce an enhanced disciplinary framework that will allow the auxiliary police forces to take appropriate measures against the errant or negligent auxiliary police officers. Senior auxiliary police officers will also be subject to the same disciplinary proceedings as regular officers and subject to disciplinary action by the Singapore Police Force.&nbsp; In the case of the junior auxiliary police officers, the Singapore Police Force will have oversight of the disciplinary proceedings by the auxiliary police forces.&nbsp; In addition, the errant auxiliary police officers may also be prosecuted in court and&nbsp;the penalty, in this instance, has been enhanced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, through restricting the powers of the auxiliary police officers.&nbsp; Under the current Police Force Act and the CISCO Act, all auxiliary police officers carry arms and have the powers, protection&nbsp;and immunities of police officers of corresponding rank within the&nbsp;specified areas of jurisdiction.&nbsp; These powers can<p align=left>Column: 90<p> be exercised even when&nbsp;they are not on duty.&nbsp; Under the new legislation, auxiliary police officers will only be able to exercise their powers when they are on duty. Such limits will help to ensure that the auxiliary police officers do not abuse the Police powers. With all these measures, we will ensure that the standards are upheld and only well-trained auxiliary police officers are deployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming to Mr Chiam's comment,&nbsp;it is a&nbsp;serious allegation&nbsp;that our regular police officers have not been neutral.&nbsp; I think that is&nbsp;not a fair comment.&nbsp; Our police officers uphold the highest standard of conduct, as well as professionalism. They treat all alike, whether he is a foreigner, a citizen, the ruling party or the&nbsp;Opposition party. All individuals in Singapore must observe the law.&nbsp;It is the&nbsp;police officers' duty to uphold the law and to ensure that law and order is maintained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The instance cited by Mr Chiam of police officers accompanying grassroots leaders on house visits is not something&nbsp;new and only done for the ruling party.&nbsp; It is part and parcel of the grassroots leaders' role in helping to educate the public on crime prevention. That is the role of the police officers, not as escorts for grassroots leaders on house visits. They do not serve that purpose. When the police go on such rounds with grassroots leaders or with advisors on the ground, it is purely for the purpose of promoting&nbsp;crime prevention, as well as to get to know the residents. That is&nbsp;what&nbsp;they have been doing for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mr Chiam's specific&nbsp;incidence on&nbsp;why his question was not answered by the Police,&nbsp;I cannot give him an answer unless he writes to me specifically and tells me what actually&nbsp;took place,&nbsp;and I will have it investigated.&nbsp; Our police officers, as far as&nbsp;public surveys are&nbsp;concerned, year by year,&nbsp;have received high marks from the public.&nbsp; Just from<p align=left>Column: 91<p> Police records of publicly-assisted arrests,&nbsp;we are quite proud of our statistics.&nbsp; 40%-50% of the arrests made in Singapore are done with the help of the public.&nbsp; If he goes to any other country in this part of the world, I do not think he can hear that kind of confidence that the public has on our police force.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should do nothing to undermine the sense of confidence that the public has in them.&nbsp; If there are other specific instances where Mr Chiam felt aggrieved that he has been slighted by the Police, please write to me and let me know, and I will have it investigated. The same goes for Mr Low.&nbsp; He complained that during the elections period, Opposition Members were treated unfairly.&nbsp; I can tell&nbsp;him that PAP candidates also felt that the Police treated them very unfairly by not allowing them to do certain things.&nbsp; But that is the job of the Police, to ensure that it is fair and&nbsp;neutral to all parties concerned and not just to the ruling party's candidates.&nbsp; Let&nbsp;me&nbsp;state&nbsp;quite categorically that the police officers act without fear or favour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low has specific comments on the clauses.&nbsp; On the liability of the Government for acts done by the auxiliary police force,&nbsp;if the auxiliary police officers are fulfilling a commercial contract and they are doing a job, that certainly must be&nbsp;the responsibility of the individual employer.&nbsp; Of course, in a situation where they are mobilised to assist the Government, then they have to obey the instructions of the Government.&nbsp; And&nbsp;in the course of their duties, something does happen and it is during mobilisation, then the Government will have to take care of the problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the punishment of the auxiliary police officer and the regular police officer, for the regular police officer, this has not been changed because this is&nbsp;the existing provision. For the auxiliary police officer, under the old provision,the <p align=left>Column: 92<p>  punishment was $500 and an imprisonment term for a short period. But the recent case shows that this is totally inadequate and that even this $500 is totally out of tune with today's times.&nbsp; And since the law has not been amended for some time, it therefore has to be updated and there must be good reasons why there is this difference between the regular police officers and the auxiliary police officers because the regular police officers are also subject to the Police's General Orders, as well as to other disciplinary rules and proceedings of the civil service and the Police Force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On fair competition and&nbsp;whether the power given to the Commissioner to exempt dominant&nbsp;players will be abused or not, let me assure the Member that it is not the intention to abuse the power of the Commissioner by exempting certain dominant players.&nbsp; For example, if Mr Low has in mind CISCO, let me say&nbsp;that CISCO will be&nbsp;treated no differently from any other auxiliary police forces if the other auxiliary police forces so decide to compete in the open market like CISCO. Right now, I know that there is already an existing one formed from several other auxiliary police forces into one new company called Ateos.&nbsp; They will be competing with CISCO in the marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that if they believe that they have been done in, because the Commissioner has been unfair, the matter will be raised and will be looked into.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, I would like to clarify with the Minister.&nbsp; He said that the Government will be responsible.

We are already a major arbitration centre,&nbsp;but our aim is to make Singapore the location of choice for arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further promote this objective, we have reviewed the requirement for foreign counsel to appear jointly with a Singapore lawyer. There is no similar restriction in the laws of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Australia. It is a requirement which has put us at a disadvantage with jurisdictions that do not have it, and it may be a factor against the use of Singapore as an arbitration venue. Foreign parties are more likely to recommend or choose a place with less restrictions. To be competitive in this field, we need to remove this requirement, and allow foreign counsel the choice of appearing without local counsel.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 97<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me stress that this amendment does not mean that local lawyers will be excluded altogether. Foreign counsel may still choose to appear with a Singapore lawyer, for example, where there are complex issues of Singapore law. If they choose to appear on their own, it would be prudent for them to engage a Singapore lawyer for advice on Singapore law.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Legal Profession</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me&nbsp;move on to another key amendment. Under our current system, Singapore lawyers who are admitted to practise in Singapore are required to apply for a practising certificate (PC) from the Supreme Court on an annual basis.&nbsp; The current PC regime requires practising lawyers to practise in a law firm or law corporation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Law Society has proposed a new class of conditional de-linked practising certificates for \"locum lawyers\".&nbsp; It is a common practice in the United Kingdom for solicitors to be employed as locums, who may have associations with more than one firm. Barristers in the UK work on their own account, and they are not restricted to taking work from a single firm of solicitors. Under the UK system, specialists may offer their skills to multiple firms. Such specialists are able to develop and strengthen their expertise through a broader range of work than may be available in a single firm. Law firms have more flexibility to build expertise in specialist areas, especially when the current volume of work may not justify a full set of specialist lawyers. The UK system also allows firms&nbsp;to fill casual vacancies with freelance solicitors, eg, arising from maternity leave or when the sole practitioners are on leave or if they are ill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a scheme will promote specialisation, minimise the loss of talent and improve manpower allocation. It will<p align=left>Column: 98<p> also allow the market to tap the large pool of solicitors who have left active practice for one reason or another, for example, to start a family. I believe it might also reduce the number of young lawyers leaving practice.&nbsp; It is envisaged that like doctors, the locums will also be useful for general practitioner's work, particularly in areas like conveyancing, family law, personal injury and debt recovery.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there will be safeguards&nbsp;in place. Locum lawyers will be covered by insurance taken out by the law firms or corporations engaging them. A locum lawyer will not be allowed to deal with client's moneys and must have at least&nbsp;three years' legal experience. He may be required to complete a professional development course prescribed by the Council of the Law Society if his experience is not within&nbsp;three years of the application for a PC.&nbsp; He must also be a permanent resident or citizen of Singapore, and must practise under the supervision of a lawyer in the Singapore law firm or law corporation that engages him.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, holders of de-linked practice certificates will continue to be practitioner members of the Law Society, and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the Society and the Supreme Court in ethical and disciplinary matters.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In closing, Sir, let me say that we are confident that this new scheme will strengthen our legal industry,&nbsp;and I believe it&nbsp;will ultimately be&nbsp;for the benefit of those who require legal services.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I am a newly retired lawyer and I am eligible for application for a locum solicitor practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that it was only last year, at the opening of the Legal Year, that the Law Society mooted the idea of allowing locum practice in local law firms.&nbsp; In England, of course, locum solicitors have been in practice for more than 10 years.&nbsp; When the Law Society suggested to introduce locum practice in Singapore, its object was mainly to allow small and medium-sized law firms to tap the specialist knowledge of the more senior lawyers who have retired and who can still contribute to a project taken up</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>by the small and medium-sized legal firms which otherwise would not have been able to do so.&nbsp; And&nbsp;being small, these firms do not have the requisite expertise in that area of the law.&nbsp; However, it is noted that a lawyer can practise as a locum only if, within the last five years, he has an aggregate practice for not less than three years as a solicitor.&nbsp; I think the three-year period as a solicitor can hardly make one a specialist or expert in any area of the law.&nbsp; Such a lawyer is probably more suited to practise as a locum in a general practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the law seems not to be in line with the intention of the Law Society as regards tapping the expertise and legal knowledge of old retired lawyers.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rules, which I understand that the Law Society has drafted, are comprehensive and they cover all aspects of locum solicitor practice, including prevention of conflicts of interest.&nbsp; The definition section allows a locum solicitor to work in more than one firm at the same time.&nbsp; Under such a situation, a conflict of interest can easily arise for that solicitor.&nbsp; Therefore, a set of strict rules for locum practice is necessary to prevent problems of conflict of interest and other problems.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 100<p>There must be many retired lawyers who have expert knowledge of certain areas of the law but are too tired to work full-time.&nbsp; Their expert knowledge is still very marketable.&nbsp; The locum practice will allow them to take on temporary jobs which may suit them very well and also at the same time, meet the needs of small and medium-sized firms when there is a surge of work and they need lawyers with specialist knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the availability of expert professional help from locums, small and medium-sized firms need not forgo business which may not be their regular line of work.&nbsp; I welcome the locum practice especially at this time when many lawyers choose not to go into practice.&nbsp; They said that legal practice is too stressful.&nbsp; This Bill will help to make up for the dwindling numbers of lawyers who want to go into legal practice.&nbsp; I hear that the Law Society has already drafted a set of rules to govern and control locum practice.&nbsp; The rules, I understand, cover the areas of clients' money, risk management, insurance and indemnity, confidentiality, privileged information, supervision and special licence in relation to locums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that when this Bill is finally enacted, the Law Society shall allow locum solicitors to take up half-yearly practising certificates and the membership fee shall only be a token fee, to encourage more young lawyers who are not in practice to take up&nbsp;locum practising certificates to give them a chance to keep in touch with the law.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 100<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The introduction of locum solicitor into the Legal Profession Act widens the pool of available legal talent in Singapore.&nbsp; Many of the legally trained law graduates, who have been admitted as advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore and who are not in full-time legal practice currently for various reasons, can now practise, so&nbsp;to speak, on a part-time&nbsp;or on an ad hoc basis as a locum solicitor once this Bill becomes law.&nbsp; This amendment would, hopefully, encourage some lawyers who have retired and do not wish to practise on a full-time basis to come back to legal practice as locum solicitors.&nbsp; This would minimise the waste of legal talent, especially amongst bright lady lawyers who become housewives in order to take care of their young children.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A locum solicitor is an advocate and solicitor engaged in employ on a temporary or freelance basis by one or more law firms, law corporations or solicitors practising on their own account.&nbsp; He or she is an employee.&nbsp; In introducing locum solicitor, the legal profession must ensure, through the rules to be introduced under the Legal Profession Act and especially under section 25 of the LPA,&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; the protection of the public as far as clients'&nbsp;money is concerned and the need for insurance coverage for negligence by the locum solicitor.&nbsp; This presumably will be covered by the employer law firm; (b) the need for the locum solicitor to keep up with the law and keep pace with continuing legal education to give proper <p align=left>Column: 102<p>legal opinion and legal advice to clients; (c) prevention of conflict of interest when a locum solicitor is allowed to be engaged by more than one law firm; and (d) disciplinary matters for professional offences under the LPA and the general law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 4 relating to the new section 26(1A) seems rather stringent in that a person would not qualify to be a locum solicitor unless he or she is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident of Singapore and, in the period of five years immediately preceding the application, has been a solicitor in practice or a legal officer for a period of not less than three years, or has completed such training within such time as prescribed by the Council of the Law Society of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; May I suggest, Sir, that it would be fairer if the period of five years is deleted or the duration be extended from five to, say, 10 years so that more lawyers can practise law on a locum or part-time basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst we are encouraging locum solicitors, may I also take this opportunity to ask that, in order to give greater opportunities and&nbsp;to increase the legal pool of practitioners, we consider amending the relevant sections of the Legal Profession Act and the Legal Profession (Qualified Persons) Rules.&nbsp; Many of our law graduates from recognised foreign universities with Second Class (Lower) and Third Class Honours, and with Third Class Honours from the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore cannot be admitted to the bar.&nbsp; This has deprived these young Singapore citizens of the chance to practise law in Singapore as private practitioners.&nbsp; Their dignity, pride and self-esteem must have been affected adversely for having done not so well either abroad or locally in NUS.&nbsp; Their parents, spouses and siblings must have been saddened by this deprivation.&nbsp; Please re-look at these restrictions, Sir.&nbsp; Give<p align=left>Column: 103<p> these graduates a chance to practise law.&nbsp; After all, there are many law graduates who fall into these categories but who were older law graduates and were not caught by these rules which were introduced in the 1990s, and who are successful practitioners and had even been appointed judges.&nbsp; A good degree holder may not turn out to be a good legal practitioner, and a bad degree holder may turn out to be a good legal practitioner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 35 of the LPA is being widened to allow foreign lawyers to do any arbitration work in Singapore without doing so jointly with a Singapore advocate and solicitor.&nbsp; We in Singapore are opening up the legal profession to foreign lawyers to do arbitration work in Singapore, except having any right of audience in any Singapore court.&nbsp; This is in line with the requirement of the World Trade Organisation and the General Agreement on Trade and Services for the various professions to open their doors for non-Singaporeans to compete.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with this, Sir, our Government should do its level best to ensure that there is a level playing field amongst other World Trade Organisation member nations.&nbsp; It would be encouraging if foreign countries like Malaysia and other ASEAN countries, who are WTO members, England and the United States of America, Australia and Canada could do likewise and open their doors for our Singapore lawyers to practise in their countries.&nbsp; I believe that some of these countries do allow but there may be stumbling blocks by way of immigration and work permit or employment pass restrictions.&nbsp; Our Government should play an active role in minimising these obstacles so that more of our younger lawyers can practise in different jurisdictions and become better and more versatile lawyers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 104<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, Sir, the proposed amendments are to be welcomed and I support the same.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Chiam and Mr Chandra Mohan for their comments and support of the Bill.&nbsp;If I may turn to some of the specific points raised by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I am sure I speak for all Members in wishing Mr Chiam many happy years of lucrative locum practice!<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he commented on the three out of five years' requirement.&nbsp; And, here, there seems to be a difference of views between Mr Chandra Mohan and himself.&nbsp; Mr Chiam felt that the three out of five years' restriction seems not to be in tandem with one of&nbsp;the Law Society's objectives of locums being possibly a means of tapping specialists.&nbsp; In three out of five years, one may not be able to say he is a specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Mr Chandra Mohan thought that was a bit too rigorous.&nbsp; So, there you are, you can have many different approaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I believe the answer to Mr Chiam's question is that this locum practitioner is not being proposed only for one objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several objectives.&nbsp; Of course, it could lead to a specialist who is a locum and whose knowledge can be tapped.&nbsp; But it also serves several other objectives, like people who have to leave the profession on a temporary basis but yet their services are not entirely lost to the profession.&nbsp; While we are on this point, in answer to Mr Chandra Mohan, let me say that three out of five years is&nbsp;a balance because it is intended to signify that the person has not been completely out of touch with practising or with the law.&nbsp; I think if it is three out of 10 years, one could say that it is a risk that he has been completely out of touch with the law.&nbsp; So we can have a debate on that, but I think three out of five years is not an unreasonable requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 105<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mr Chiam and Mr Chandra Mohan talked about the need to ensure that there is avoidance of conflict of interest.&nbsp; Mr Chandra Mohan also said that we must ensure that&nbsp;public interests must be safeguarded.&nbsp; I completely agree, including areas of handling of clients' money, continuing legal education, and so on.&nbsp; I referred to these points in my speech and I believe the Law Society is mindful of these considerations and they will be taken care of in the rules.&nbsp; And I would add that the Ministry of Law will pass on the suggestions to the Law Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;So as we monitor this new system and see how it operates in practice, I am sure that they will have to make modifications and adjustments to the rules as we go along.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam also mentioned some suggestions as to the length of the tenure of the practising certificate, whether it can be half a year, reduced fees, and so on.&nbsp; Let me say that my purpose here in coming to Parliament is to make an amendment which will enable the introduction of the locum practice.&nbsp; The details of the administering of the scheme, I must, of course, leave it to the Law Society, and trust that they will have&nbsp;sufficient oversight of the actual operation of the new system</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>and ensure that, while it meets the objectives, at the same time, public interest is protected and the requirements are not so burdensome that it puts off the very people that we want to bring back into association with legal practice.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chandra Mohan raised two other points.&nbsp; The first&nbsp;point is&nbsp;not very germane to this Bill.&nbsp; But he asked whether I can have a look again at the requirement for graduates who want to practise law to possess a Second Class (Upper) Honours degree or a Second Class (Lower) Honours degree depending on whether he graduated abroad or from here.&nbsp; I believe Members will recall that I have mentioned&nbsp;in Parliament several<p align=left>Column: 106<p> times&nbsp;on the reasons why we introduced this requirement sometime ago, as a result of the Committee on the Legal Profession, chaired by the Attorney-General.&nbsp; It was a two-fold objective to relate to the number of graduates as well as to maintain certain standards.&nbsp; In other words, when a student intends to embark on law studies, he knows at the very outset that, if he intends to practise law, then this is the standard that he ought to obtain when he graduates,&nbsp;ie, Second Upper or Second Lower, as the case may be.&nbsp; In the many years in which the system has been in operation, I believe it has worked well.&nbsp; Both students and parents have a clear indication, before they start the law studies, that this is the benchmark if&nbsp;they want to practise law.&nbsp;&nbsp; During these years when we revamped the system, we have also increased the number of overseas institutions which are recognised for this purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question he has posed is: because there may be a certain number who did not reach this benchmark it is unfair to them to be deprived of&nbsp;an opportunity to practise law.&nbsp; But if we were to easily change the system and to enable those who did not obtain the required benchmark or the standard to practise, then you will have a system made inoperable and the system will not be meaningful.&nbsp; He asked me to relook at it and&nbsp;my approach is we are always&nbsp;prepared to relook at any issue, or any institution, or any process that we have.&nbsp; But I do not want to raise false hopes because we have a system that is working and to allow those who do not have it to nevertheless practise, it means that the system will be rendered quite meaningless.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has asked about the amendment concerning arbitration.&nbsp; If his point is that the Government, when it makes any provision for foreign lawyer, as a general principle,&nbsp;should seek reciprocity,&nbsp;it is <p align=left>Column: 107<p>very difficult to disagree with him, and we always try to ensure that&nbsp;our firms and&nbsp;our lawyers&nbsp;get maximum access elsewhere.&nbsp; This particular amendment that I am proposing for arbitration to do away with the restriction, in fact, we have imposed restrictions that many other countries do not have it.&nbsp; So we are in fact bringing ourselves in line with many of the other leading jurisdictions.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They already have rules in the legal profession applicable to practitioners, generally speaking, on conflict of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;All those rules will apply to locum practitioners.&nbsp; But there may be situations peculiar to locum practitioners where the Law Society will have to devise additional rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;The example that he gave where, in one case, one firm is representing the plaintiff and another firm representing the defendant and the locum -&nbsp;because I have said that a&nbsp;locum can be a locum for more than one firm -&nbsp;I should think, subject to being corrected later,&nbsp;if he is working for the<p align=left>Column: 108<p> two law firms <I>in the same subject matter</I>, then&nbsp;obviously a question of potential conflict or real conflict of interest&nbsp;will arise.&nbsp;I am sure the Law Society's rules will take care of that.&nbsp;

In recent years,&nbsp; there has been a tremendous growth of IP-rich activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>:&nbsp; Private and public sector R&amp;D activities continue to bear fruit; the biomedical industry is making<p align=left>Column: 109<p> commendable strides; our companies are investing in branding and going international; and the Government has committed further funds to grow our media industry.&nbsp; As <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> moves forward towards an IP-rich economy, our IP legislation must likewise move in tandem.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0.1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> At the same time, the global IP landscape is changing.&nbsp; The standards set by the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or&nbsp;TRIPS agreement, have become a minimum standard which businesses and investors expect.&nbsp; We reached the TRIPS standard in 1999. Five years on, it is timely to update our IP legislative framework, to ensure that we meet the needs of the new industries we are grooming, as well as&nbsp;remain competitive in this fast changing IP landscape.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0.1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several amendments in the Bills are also connected with our obligations&nbsp;under the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement&nbsp;(USSFTA).&nbsp; When we started FTA talks with the United States in late 2000, we decided to carry out an extensive review of our IP legislation in conjunction with those talks.&nbsp; It&nbsp;gave us an opportunity to study the key features of the US IP framework, and to examine which are the ones relevant to us.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0.1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while we aspire to higher standards, we also need to be mindful that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies are at different stages of development.&nbsp; The concerns of our companies will be different, depending on whether&nbsp;they are or are not predominantly owners, or users, of IP.&nbsp; We have given special consideration to this.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;let me assure the House that as we provide greater incentives for innovation by strengthening the rights of IP creators and holders, we will also consciously provide safeguards to balance the needs of IP users.</p><p align=left>Column: 110<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0.1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me also stress that the proposed amendments were finalised after extensive discussions with numerous industry constituents, IP professional groups, and relevant Government Ministries.&nbsp; These discussions lasted almost two years.&nbsp; In addition, the IP Office of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;(IPOS) made available the draft Bills on its website for consultation and conducted a public engagement seminar for interested parties.&nbsp; All these have generated useful feedback,&nbsp;which we have incorporated some of the suggestions.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0.1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in; mso-list: none\"><I>Trade Marks (Amendment) Bill: overview</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0.1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I now turn to the specific provisions of the Trade Marks (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; This Bill will improve and provide more clarity on certain aspects of trade mark law,&nbsp;to enable the Registry of Trade Marks to be more efficient.&nbsp; The Bill also implements certain commitments of Singapore under the USSFTA.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0.1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998, we took a significant step to amend our Trade Mark regime, to modernise it in accordance with international standards.

Clause 20 of the Bill amends section 45 so that an exclusive licensee no longer has to involve the trade mark owner before proceeding with legal action to enforce his rights.&nbsp; Of course, Sir, the courts will still have the discretion to involve the owner if appropriate.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

Currently, in an infringement suit, a trade mark owner can either obtain damages or he can obtain an account of profits from the infringing <p align=left>Column: 113<p>party.&nbsp; Clause 14 will amend section 31 so that, where the court awards damages, the court is also empowered to make an order for an account of any profits attributable to the infringement that have not been taken into account in computing&nbsp;damages.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also proposed, for infringement cases that involve the use of a counterfeit trade mark, a new remedy of statutory damages that will complement the current process of assessing damages. &nbsp;This is because, in certain cases, it may be difficult to prove actual losses or obtain an account of profits. &nbsp;For example, some infringers may not keep clear records of their sales.&nbsp; Hence, a new section 31(5) provides that the trade mark owner can seek statutory damages. &nbsp;In such a situation, the court will assess the quantum of statutory damages on compensatory principles, taking into account the guidelines in section 31(6).</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

We will be making several amendments to enhance our border enforcement measures.&nbsp; For example, clause 30 amends section 82 to make it easier for the owner of a registered trade mark to rely on the enforcement mechanism under section 82.&nbsp; The new section 93A will confer additional powers on enforcement officers.&nbsp; Customs officers will be empowered to take immediate action if they detect any counterfeit goods in the course of their duties. These powers will be exercised judiciously by our enforcement authorities and they will continue to work in close partnership with the&nbsp;rights holders.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><I>Revised \"Fair Dealing\" provisions</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we strengthen the trade marks regime to provide greater protection for<p align=left>Column: 114<p> trade mark owners, we must also maintain the balance between trade mark owners and users.&nbsp; We have taken the opportunity, therefore,&nbsp;to review and clarify that certain uses of a registered trade mark will not amount to infringement.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.&nbsp; As the Minister has explained, this Bill, together with the next three Bills, is intended partly to implement the obligations undertaken by Singapore in the USSFTA.&nbsp; The US has always been crying out for more intellectual property protection and enforcement in Southeast Asia, which is perceived to be a region rife with pirates not just of the maritime kind but also of the digital kind.&nbsp; So, it is<p align=left>Column: 115<p> no surprise today to see that several Bills are introduced to shore up the laws protecting intellectual property rights.&nbsp; It brings us closer to the international conventions on intellectual property as well as the US on intellectual property.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Minister has discussed the general concept of intellectual protection in Singapore, I would just like to direct a question to him.&nbsp; Will the new laws be readily understood not just by MNCs and foreign investors but rather by our local companies and individuals?&nbsp; Will they work for our local companies and individuals' interests rather than MNCs' interests?&nbsp; Do our own consumers know why we are implementing such strict laws on intellectual property protection while Singaporeans can actually obtain pirated software at a fraction of the cost from shops just across the shores of Singapore?&nbsp; The need for respecting intellectual property rights is not so instinctively felt as, say, the right of an individual to be protected from physical harm or theft.&nbsp; What can be done to increase the awareness of Singaporeans to respect intellectual property rights even when it hurts their pockets?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, these Bills are very technical in nature, so I shall restrict myself to a very simple point on the Trade Marks (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether the concept of well-known marks is really relevant to Singapore or will it result in giving more protection to foreign marks, making it more difficult for our own businessmen, as it were, to build new products based on well-known marks.&nbsp; Are these amendments more relevant to the big MNCs&nbsp;I have referred to just now rather than our smaller local businesses?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> I thank Prof. Chin for his support of the Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 116<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has raised two main points.&nbsp; One is a general point,&nbsp;applicable to all these Bills,&nbsp;whether the average consumer or small company would be familiar with the rationale for these Bills and what more could be done to make them understand the concept&nbsp;as well as the need for such laws.&nbsp; I take the Member's point. This is something that both my Ministry and IPOS are mindful of.&nbsp; But as I have said in my main speech, we have taken care over a period of two years or so to have a fairly comprehensive consultation process with the industry, and&nbsp;it was not just with the big players,&nbsp;we also had discussions with the relevant people in the market.&nbsp; But the education process has to go on.&nbsp; It is a task which both the industry as well as IPOS and other authorities have to&nbsp;be engaged in continuously.&nbsp; People need to understand why a breach of intellectual property has to be treated in the same way as theft of physical property.&nbsp; It may not be immediately grasped by all, but the consequences are similar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from individual victims, the broader consequence is that we will not be able to compete with countries in attracting the kind of new businesses and investments we need if we do not have the kind of intellectual property&nbsp;legislative framework which is essential to attract the investors.&nbsp; And investors, especially those involved in the knowledge industry, will not go readily to a place which does not have the necessary legal norms and legislative framework as well as the necessary enforcement mechanisms.&nbsp; But let me assure him that we are mindful of this and that we will continue to be involved in this process of consultation and dissemination, particularly as I have indicated that there are other Bills and, as I will mention later in moving another Bill, that these Bills are not the sum total of all the amendments that we are going to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, in the course of the year, we may have other amendments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 117<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point that he has asked is whether the changes that we are introducing would really be for the benefit of the bigger companies.&nbsp; I do not think so, and my response to that is that all companies, whether big or small, should pay attention to how they brand themselves, and trade marks are an essential component of any branding strategy.&nbsp; The amendments in this Bill, in my view, should benefit all companies, whether they are SMEs or big MNCs.&nbsp; Protection of well-known marks is&nbsp;an existing concept in Singapore and, with these amendments,&nbsp;what is it really we are trying to do?&nbsp; I believe what we are trying to do is to give enhanced protection for well-known marks.&nbsp; And it is not just enhancing the protection to marks from a foreign company.&nbsp; Enhanced protection is given to a mark that is a well-known mark in Singapore.&nbsp; So a Singapore mark that meets the relevant criteria will qualify as a well-known mark and benefit from enhanced protection.&nbsp; And let me say in this connection that there are Singapore companies which are putting in substantial investments to develop their brands.&nbsp; Well-known examples, of course, are Singapore Airlines, Tiger Beer and Tiger Balm, which are household names in Singapore and many other countries.&nbsp; But if we want to do more, to encourage more companies to invest and create new products, then I think it is timely to have a regime that will give greater recognition to these brands and to future brands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These delays may occur either in the process of obtaining a patent grant or, in the case of a pharmaceutical product, in the process of obtaining marketing approval.&nbsp;Getting a patent grant can be a lengthy process. &nbsp;Patent offices have to conduct rigorous examinations on the invention, to determine if it is patentable. A delay in the grant of a patent can affect a company's ability to enforce its rights in any event of infringement. Applicants should not be prejudiced for delays arising from the patent office's processes.&nbsp; For this reason, should there by an undue delay on the part of the patent offices, we will compensate the patent owner by extending the term of protection correspondingly.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 119<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 36A(1)(c) further recognises that a patent term for a pharmaceutical product can be curtailed if there were unreasonable delays in the granting of marketing approval by the relevant authority. While the pharmaceutical product may have been granted a patent, the owner can only market the product in Singapore&nbsp;after the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has granted approval for the sale of the product in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;the drug discovery process is a high-risk and costly venture for pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp; I am told that in the&nbsp;United States, it takes US$400 million to bring a drug to market. Pharmaceutical companies depend very heavily on patent protection to recoup the investment and R&amp;D costs involved in developing new drugs.&nbsp; Unreasonable curtailment of the protection period will have significant impact on the company's business viability, as it will have a shorter period of market exclusivity.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

We want to assure the pharmaceutical industry that the patent period available to them in&nbsp;Singapore would not be unfairly shortened. &nbsp;Already, countries such as&nbsp;Australia, Japan and&nbsp;the United States provide for patent term extensions arising from delays in marketing approvals.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

Rather, countries with advanced patent systems have chosen to set out the expected standards in the laws.&nbsp; We too want to reflect the standards in our law, and thereby reassure patent owners that in <p align=left>Column: 120<p>the event of an unreasonable delay, they will not be disadvantaged in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is set out in the new section 66(2A).&nbsp; Under this new section, a patent owner will have a right to bring an action to stop a parallel importer from importing the patent owner's patented pharmaceutical product, if the product has not previously been sold or distributed in Singapore.&nbsp; However, once the owner brings in the patented product, the right to bring action ceases, and he will be subject to the same competitive pressures from parallel imports.&nbsp; This is a delicate balance we have sought to preserve between the interests of the patent owner and the interests of users of pharmaceutical products.&nbsp; Essentially, the patent owner has a \"first mover advantage\" in the Singapore market, but once he is in, will have to compete with the parallel importers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in drafting this amendment,&nbsp; we have given special consideration to ensure that no Singaporean would be denied adequate medical care as a result of this new right.&nbsp; Under new section 66(2)(i), a patented pharmaceutical product which is needed for the treatment of a specific patient in Singapore&nbsp;may, with HSA's approval, be imported specifically for use by that patient, even if the patent owner has not brought the pharmaceutical product into Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"><I>\"Bolar\" provision</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second refinement is the introduction of what is commonly known as a \"Bolar\" provision.&nbsp; The new sub-<p align=left>Column: 121<p>section 66(2h) allows a generic drug producer to carry out activities covered by a patent without the consent of the patent owner, provided the activities are carried out to support an application to HSA for marketing approval for a pharmaceutical product.&nbsp; This will facilitate the manufacture, sale and distribution of generic versions of patented drugs immediately after the patents for those drugs which have expired, something that would benefit consumers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"Bolar\" provision is not a new concept.&nbsp; In balancing the interests of right holders and the needs of users, the \"Bolar\" provision serves as a useful counterbalance to the Patent Term Extension.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Madam, I thank Prof. Chin for supporting the Bill.&nbsp; Indeed, Prof. Chin is correct. Patent is an important component of the IP regime that encourages research and innovation in Singapore. And this is borne out by the number of patents that has been filed which, in fact, has quadrupled from about 1,008 in 1994 to more than 8,000 last year. This is largely also because of the strong patent regime and other&nbsp;IP regimes that we have introduced in Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, it has been about 8-9 years since the patent regime was introduced because the Patents Act was&nbsp;enacted in 1995.&nbsp; There have not been major amendments to the Act.&nbsp; Therefore, this is, in a sense, the first major slew of changes basically to improve its workings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to assure Prof. Chin - as we have said before, and the Minister has explained the process -&nbsp;that there have been much consultations and, in particular, in terms of the process, for example, the introduction of the dual-track system is something that will inject much flexibility which patent owners, and even the players in the industry, will welcome.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IPOS has been very active in terms of reaching out to the industry and working with them,&nbsp;eg, the IP Academy has been running a lot of seminars.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure in this same vein, they will reach out to the industry, all the players, including the lawyers who practise patent law and the patent agents who have to do the technical specifications, to ensure that these changes will&nbsp;add value to the system, so that there will be more inventions that will be registered both here in Singapore as well as by Singapore entities elsewhere.&nbsp; I am confident that these amendments will be a big plus which the industry players have all worked together, and IPOS will continue to lead in ensuring that the amendments will be understood and properly applied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 125<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

The present amendments <p align=left>Column: 126<p>are one of two sets of amendments to the Copyright Act which we will move this year.&nbsp; A&nbsp;second Bill will be introduced in the later part of the year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Extension of term of protection for copyright works</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Copyright Act provides for a protection period&nbsp;which covers the life of the author and another 50 years after his death.&nbsp; This applies to literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works. Sound recordings, films and performances are protected for 50 years after the first publication. With clause 2(a) of the Bill, we will extend the term of protection by an additional 20 years for both categories of works. This will provide more benefits to our local creators and give a greater push for the development of Singapore's creative industries. Because international copyright protection works on the principle of reciprocity, a longer copyright term of protection will also provide benefits to local creators who export their works.&nbsp; They will now get to enjoy longer protection in countries which have a similar term of protection. This includes 33 other countries like the United States and European Union members, with more, I believe,&nbsp;following suit.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a timely move. Already, we are seeing bustling activity in industries like media design, film and TV production, and the arts and entertainment industries.&nbsp; With this extension of copyright term, we will be able to give our industry players a playing field that is levelled up to their overseas counterparts.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Provisions relating to copyright licences acquired by the Government and Government bodies</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment is related to an earlier announcement of a new Government policy where contractors will be able to<p align=left>Column: 127<p> own the IP generated from Government procurement contracts.&nbsp; As a general rule, from 1st July 2004 onwards, the Government will procure a licence to use the IP for its own purposes.&nbsp; The contractor will be able to own the IP, which means he can improve on it and build new products and services to generate more value-added activities for Singapore.&nbsp; As we implement this policy, we must make sure that the public interest is protected.&nbsp; The ability of Government agencies and statutory boards to deliver public services must not be affected, which means that we must ensure that Government and statutory board licences must continue to operate. Hence, subclauses 2(d) and (f) amend sections 194(4) and 195(3) so that these Government licences will still be binding on bona fide purchasers of the copyright. This win-win arrangement is a result of extensive consultation with Government agencies and vendors, and was also a recommendation by the Economic Review Committee&nbsp;last year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Repeal of Provisions on Compulsory Licence</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment repeals Part Six (VI) of the Copyright Act.&nbsp; This Part allows a user, under specific circumstances, to apply to the Copyright Tribunal for a compulsory licence to translate copyright works into our official languages.&nbsp; Internationally, we need to recognise that a compulsory licence that compels the copyright owner to make his work available should be used only in extreme circumstances. Furthermore, we have not received any requests for the operation of this section since its enactment in 1998. Therefore, to provide greater assurance to copyright holders, subclause 2(b) will repeal Part Six (VI) of the Copyright Act.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 128<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Registered Designs Act and Layout-Designs of Integrated Circuits Act</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I turn to the amendments in the Registered Designs Act and Layout-Designs of Integrated Circuits Act which will let exclusive licensees proceed with legal action without having to involve the owners.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my understanding that the Bill seeks to amend a number of past Acts that fall under the umbrella of intellectual property (IP).&nbsp; In approaching IP broadly, it is important to appreciate the extent to which competition is increasingly pre-eminent in our law.&nbsp; This was indeed acknowledged by the Minister earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the introduction of our intellectual property protection laws in the 80s and 90s, I am glad to note that Singapore has progressed up the ladder as a nation with an environment that encourages creativity and innovation and has correspondingly expanded the recognition of the value of IP in encouraging innovative activities.&nbsp; However, as we do this, it is important that we tread cautiously and not fall into the \"mousetrap myth\"&nbsp;.&nbsp; I am sure quite a few of us would have heard of this quote in one form or another:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 129<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If a man can ... make a better mousetrap than his neighbour, though he builds his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The quote may be somewhat ambiguous, but many construe it to mean that anyone who invents a new mousetrap will be wealthy, particularly if they can patent it.&nbsp; Well-informed patent lawyers know this as the \"mousetrap myth\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back briefly into history, this is a myth illustrated by the experience of Chester M Woolworth, president of the Animal Trap Company.&nbsp; In the early 1920s, the company sold a mousetrap for five cents.&nbsp; In 1928, Woolworth succeeded in improving the trap, but the improved version cost 12 cents.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Woolworth failed to consider that once a mouse had been caught, people usually disposed of both the mouse and the trap.&nbsp; Apparently, as consumers were obligated to clean and not discard a trap costing almost two and a half times more than Woolworth's other trap, sales were low.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A patent would not have improved the appeal of Woolworth's invention.&nbsp; Yet, each year, independent inventors spend millions of dollars on patents.&nbsp; If established manufacturers can make as big a mistake as Woolworth's, imagine the odds of commercial failure faced by those with less experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, in the context of a rapidly global environment, I believe it is critical, as the Minister does too,&nbsp;for us to keep pace with changing ideas about creativity, incentives and respect for individual inventions, and also with changes in the new communications media and markets, from printed books to digital television broadcasts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My modest discussions within the SME community, our creative sector, MNCs and academia reveal a general<p align=left>Column: 130<p> thumbs up for these amendments.&nbsp; The majority heralds the proposed amendments as necessary to be on par with other developed nations and also&nbsp;to gain wider respect of our IP protection environment.&nbsp; I share their optimism that these tools will enable our island nation to enhance its status as a beacon of strength in a fast transforming sea of change.&nbsp; These laws should help harness an individual's or a company's potential and provide a deterrent, at the very least, to unscrupulous business intentions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is noted that a relatively large portion of these amendments takes reference to the US-Singapore FTA, I do not believe that these amendments consequentially behove us to embrace the American or any western system. I note that in the numerous FTA negotiations we have held with the US and various countries, Singapore has always stood firm in safeguarding our country's interest and has, as far as possible, adopted an independent approach with its partner nations.&nbsp; Neither American nor European-centric, our nation has humbly found a position that is unique to our own.&nbsp; An example of this is our copyright protection, which is granted automatically&nbsp; -&nbsp; freeing us from the need to add the ubiquitous 'C' or copyright symbol to every document or speech.&nbsp; Not many may have realised this and therefore have chosen instead to follow the practices of our international counterparts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another clause allows our university students to access certain copyright materials without infringing on copyright laws.&nbsp; A 'Class' fee helps balance the academic needs of our universities without compromising the rights of authors and thereby creates a solution unique to our needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do have some concerns if the Minister could help clarify.&nbsp; First, is the extension of the copyright protection from the current 50 years to 70 years.&nbsp; At <p align=left>Column: 131<p>first glance, extending protection for creative work by an additional 20 years could be viewed as a step in the right direction.&nbsp; US lawyer Zechariah Chaffee noted in his 1945 <I>Reflections on the Law of Copyright</I> that, \"intellectual property is, after all, the only&nbsp; absolute possession in the world ... The man who brings out of nothingness some child of his thought has rights therein which cannot belong to any other sort of property.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as a nascent knowledge-based economy, I would think that this would inhibit the exchange and proliferation of intellectual property that should be brought to the public domain sooner for the benefit of consumers.&nbsp; I believe, Madam, our goal in formulating these laws is to strike a balance amongst the three forces that orbit this realm&nbsp; -&nbsp; the creator, the industry and the consumer.&nbsp; By creating a framework that nurtures an idea for an industry, the consumer inadvertently ends up paying for these additional safeguards. Whilst we are not disputing these benefits, as these&nbsp;are distributed, we must ask whether we are going too far in protecting the creator and industry without safeguarding the interests of the consumer, whose interest lies in securing dated material within a reasonable timeframe.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister could clarify the rationale for the extension.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another is the removal of requirements for marks to be visually perceptible.&nbsp; The Bill removes the requirement for a trademark to be \"visually perceptible\" before it is registrable.&nbsp; As a result, this may be interpreted to mean that sounds and smells may be registrable in Singapore.&nbsp; As interesting as the advancement may be for our regime, the mechanics of how such marks are to be described and protected have yet to be determined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 132<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given shorter product life cycles, quicker turnovers and rapid changes in technology, could we create an IP regime that parallels our changing lifestyles, our quest for new frontiers and our thirst for knowledge?&nbsp; Using the 20-year life of a patent as an example, could we find a 'sweet spot' where the 'costs' involved in filing a patent is commensurate with the technology it is designated for?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is generally what it all boils down to.&nbsp; A segment of our economy has emerged where ideas are now treated as property&nbsp; -&nbsp; to be bought and sold or bartered.&nbsp; Whilst the benefits of this are obvious, especially for large companies, how could we ensure that the SMEs can take advantage of this regime without incurring a large overhead?&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Our residents too must also understand the subtle message of these laws.&nbsp; IPOS' campaign to educate the majority of the ills of piracy is an excellent step towards trumpeting this message.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the average, the cost of filing a trade mark ranges between $1,000 and $5,000.&nbsp; For patents, it can run into a five-figure sum and could take years to finalise.&nbsp; On the understanding that the application process and the technicalities involved in filing trade marks and patents are quite complex, it is in our best interest to provide a means for the lone inventor or scientist with limited resources to affordably access this system.&nbsp;

Given its extensive reach, the Government plays an important role in setting the right tone for the private<p align=left>Column: 133<p> sector to follow.&nbsp; We must ensure that the public sector respects and adheres to these lofty goals that we wish to promote.&nbsp; Not too long ago, the case of an entrepreneurial team with an idea to vend food in mobile vehicles was 'adopted' by the URA and balloted to the general public.&nbsp; I feel such actions weaken our position as an example setter and should not be repeated again in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Madam, a parting thought as we warm ourselves to the league of nations with advanced IP laws.&nbsp; As we move forward and refine our IP law, could we consider evolving a culture where we balance the valuation of our creative capital with our Asian value system?&nbsp; Could we explore and find an approach that could take away or lessen the burden of our legal system and evolve an environment where ideas and creations are respected in our society in the spirit of fair competition, without always having the long arm of the law to intervene in such processes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Madam, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> I thank Dr Magad for his comments and strong support of the Bill, and for his feedback that those whom he&nbsp;spoke to gave a thumbs up for the Bill.&nbsp; But he has raised a few observations which I will deal with.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he was concerned with the increase of the copyright term of protection from 50 to 70 years.&nbsp; I believe he was concerned whether this was timely, whether we were balancing the needs of the creator, the industry and the consumer.&nbsp;And he was also concerned whether at the end of the day, the consumers will end up paying more and how we are going to strike a balance.&nbsp; Indeed, he is right.&nbsp; As with so many other things in legislation, we have to balance different interests.&nbsp; We have been mindful of this balance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 134<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me say that on&nbsp;the increase of the term of protection from 50 to 70 years, we have to recognise that internationally, if the copyright term for a local work has expired in Singapore, then other countries with a longer term of protection are not obliged to protect the Singapore work.&nbsp; So, are we worse off or better off?&nbsp; As we answer the question, we should not just take Singapore as it was in the past, or as it is now with a nascent creative industry, but we have to look ahead in relation to our objective of enlarging this area of industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our main export markets already provide for a longer term of protection.&nbsp; As I said, some 33 countries, including US, EU, already provide for a longer term of protection.&nbsp; So when we make this amendment, Singapore creators can enjoy longer terms of protection, not just in Singapore, but also in those countries.&nbsp; I think it is good for local authors, local artists, musicians, producers who have achieved, and some who are achieving, international recognition and whose works have been performed in the region and worldwide.&nbsp; Examples you are familiar with are the late theatre doyen Kuo Pao Kun's plays and Ong Keng Seng's pan-Asian theatre productions, to name just two examples.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of balancing the needs of creator, industry and consumer, let me say that the extension of the copyright term of production does give a greater incentive for more local works to be produced and exported.&nbsp; I would say that this can only be beneficial also for consumers in the longer time.&nbsp; There will be more works produced and over time, these works will enter the public domain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright fair dealing provisions present in the Copyright Act will continue to operate to ensure a balance between creators, industry and consumers.&nbsp; Let me<p align=left>Column: 135<p> say that there are exceptions such as for the purpose of research, private study, criticism or review, for reporting current events and for libraries and educational institutions.&nbsp; Let me assure the Member that we will continue to monitor international and domestic trends to ensure that the right&nbsp;balance is struck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked how can IPOS help so that the smaller players will not be disadvantaged or will be made familiar with the new laws.&nbsp; I think it is an important point that he has made.&nbsp; It is important to help our local businesses take advantage of the IP regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;IPOS has done its part and will continue to&nbsp;do so.&nbsp; It has launched a nation-wide IP awareness programme with public and private sector partners.&nbsp; IPOS has also developed various free tools to help companies become more savvy about managing IPs.&nbsp; I would not go into the details, but there are several programmes - Surf IP, Scope IP, IP&nbsp;101 Clinics, Working with Multipliers, IP Taskforce, and so on.&nbsp; And the statistics show that over the last eight years or so, there has been a steady rise in the total number of patents filed by Singapore residents.&nbsp; For example, patent filing by Singapore residents has grown by four times since 1995.&nbsp; And for trade mark applications, the numbers grew by 30% over the last three years, which I think is not insignificant a figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also raised the point about costs.&nbsp; We are conscious about the need to keep costs down and filing fees are benchmarked against other patent and trade mark offices.&nbsp; I would say that the patent and trade mark filing fees here are quite comparable or even less than those charged in other countries.&nbsp; But, in any case, these fees should be seen as a business investment since the fees enable the companies to get protection of their R&amp;D outcome and to market exclusivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 136<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He mentioned a point about the URA.&nbsp; I believe he was referring to the mobile food vendor service which was initially proposed by entrepreneurs.&nbsp; He felt it was not fair that the idea was taken away.&nbsp; I am not sure how that is germane to this Bill.&nbsp; The Government will actively play its part in developing a conducive environment for IP creation.&nbsp; I am not familiar with all the details of that case.&nbsp; But let me say, by way of clarification, that idea <I>per se</I> does not fall under the protection of IP laws.&nbsp; This is an international practice, and it is to ensure that IP laws do not constrain the development of new ideas.&nbsp; For patent protection, for example, an idea has to be translated into a product or process before it can be protected.&nbsp; For copyright, the idea has to be fixed in a tangible form, and only the expression is protected.&nbsp; As far as I can remember, in the URA case that he refers to, the idea of food vans in URA-managed car parks was not a new one.&nbsp; I believe&nbsp;that several other companies had approached the URA with a similar proposal.&nbsp; But I take his point, which is a more general point, about entrepreneurship.&nbsp; But it is not really directly related to the provisions in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe I have touched on most of the points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We did not want to inadvertently penalise this investor because of the extension of the copyright term to the new 70-year term.&nbsp; Hence, section 268 would have enabled such an investor to retain his ability to continue with his plans, as long as he pays an equitable remuneration to the right owner.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Very often, one would hear that an invention&nbsp;or a particular engineering design is being protected by patent rights&nbsp;while not often, do we hear that plant species can also be protected by law.&nbsp; Although we commonly hear that Singapore orchid growers name their hybrids after themselves or sell the naming rights to others,&nbsp;these orchid breeders, such as Teo Peng Seng and Yusof Alsagoff are however not protected by law if someone were to copy or clone their particular orchid plant.&nbsp; Even students in our schools doing orchid hybridisation programmes are now producing many orchid hybrids which are not protected by law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alongside with orchids are ornamental plants, like heliconia, hibiscus, croton, money plant, coleus, to name a few, which are useful plants for our environment and are used extensively in greening our landscape gardens and, certainly, in most household decorations.&nbsp; Such plants are in great demand and new varieties can be bred or obtained from spontaneous mutations.&nbsp; New breeds of ornamental aquatic plants are also being bred regularly and export demand is strong as in ornamental fish exports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to note that this Bill before us will to a certain extent solve the present problem of protecting certain plants by giving the person who discovered the plant variety a legal right to his discovery.&nbsp; Clause 21 of the Bill gives a grant of protection to&nbsp;a successful applicant in respect of his plant variety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the right of protection can now be granted to an applicant for any species discovered, it has created a potential commercial value for the result of research done in that it now becomes the personal property of the applicant.&nbsp; Clause 28 of the Bill provides for the possible assignment of a grant of protection and <p align=left>Column: 143<p>the grantee is entitled to prevent any person from carrying out propagation of the same species of plant without the authorisation of the grantee.&nbsp; This protection will help spin a whole new line of business in horticulture and will encourage tissue culture propagation on a wide scale.&nbsp; Research on new plant varieties will be encouraged with scientists having confidence that the findings are now being protected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Schedule to the Bill only lists the names of eight species of orchids, five species of aquatic plants and ornamentals, and two types of vegetables,&nbsp;it is my hope that this will&nbsp;grow in time to cover more plant genera and species, thus making Singapore an important centre for the registration of new plants.&nbsp; Techniques used in life science, such as hybridisation and DNA finger printing, can be applied to new orchid hybrids aiding in plant identification, while other genetically modified procedures can aid in more discoveries.&nbsp; For example, Dr Chia Tet Fatt from NIE has genetically engineered the world's first glowing orchid by splicing the firefly genes into the orchid plant, allowing the plant to glow in the dark.&nbsp; And by crossing these glowing orchids and other plants, more varieties of glowing orchids can be obtained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example of the application of this Bill would be in the area of ornamental foliage plants.&nbsp; New varieties of flowers and variegated leaves in heliconia and hibiscus can be quickly propagated and grown in the airoponic system developed by Dr Lee Sing Kong from NIE.&nbsp; Such airoponic system will also allow temperate plants to be grown in tropical Singapore and form an excellent complementation of resources and systems.&nbsp; Looking further, new breeds of vegetables with anti-cancer, anti-cardiovascular disease properties, as<p align=left>Column: 144<p> discovered by Dr Chia Tet Fatt, can be bred with lettuce and grown under the airoponic system, developed by Dr Lee Sing Kong.&nbsp; Such research in genetically modified vegetables, after being rigorously tested for safe consumptions, can be released to the public to be bred as new varieties and protected under the Plant Varieties Protection Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is very important if Singapore is to set itself going in the area of life sciences.&nbsp; And to tackle this subject with confidence, basic protection in plant research will need to be strengthened.&nbsp; Hence, the Bill sets me thinking of some areas that I will appreciate it if the Senior Minister of State could clarify.&nbsp; Firstly, what is not clear in the Bill is that if the grantee has sold, say, seeds of a particular variety, can he still have it protected even though he is no longer actively propagating the plant, while the new owner is propagating it under licence from the grantee, that is, can the grantee market his discovery under royalty while not actively propagating the seeds anymore?&nbsp; This is important as Singapore has limited farmland to propagate the plants and this function has then to be done in countries that have abundant farmland.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, if a company applies for plant varieties protection on, say, Variety A, and the application is turned down because the plant variety cannot be distinguished from other varieties, for example, Variety B,&nbsp;and if Variety B is protected, can the company still sell Variety A?&nbsp; Or would that be considered a violation of Variety B's variety protection?&nbsp; Lastly, how would the process of enforcement of a particular variety be carried out?&nbsp; Is it by a&nbsp;governmental agency or by the grantee himself?&nbsp; And what if the wrongful act is committed in another country?&nbsp; Hopefully, whatever it is, the process will involve industry players' sense of good business practice and ethics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 145<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New varieties of plants can be protected as it benefits the country economically and it would also encourage breeders and growers to confidently pursue their research in new plant varieties.&nbsp; The environment will also be the beneficiary as plant produces oxygen and promotes&nbsp;the well-being of all living things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Andy Gan for his support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He is a plant breeder, a rare breed.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made several interesting points and also asked a few questions, which I will take in turn.&nbsp; First, let me respond to Mr Gan's desire to see the plant varieties protection scheme grow, ie, extended to more plant species.&nbsp; He will be happy to note that, indeed, that is what will happen because, under the UPOV Convention, which we will accede to, we will have to extend protection to all plant species within 10 years of our accession.&nbsp; This will, as Mr Gan puts it, facilitate Singapore in becoming an important centre for the registration of new plant varieties.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member has asked three questions.&nbsp; The first is whether a plant variety is still protected if the grantee is no longer actively propagating the plant.&nbsp; Madam, the answer is yes, as long as the propagating material is maintained such that it remains available for further propagation and testing if necessary.&nbsp; Examples of propagating materials include seeds, cuttings and buds.&nbsp; This condition is set out in clauses 24 and 26 of the Bill and, again, springs from the UPOV Convention.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this new system is to spur discovery and the development of new varieties of flowers, vegetables, aquatic plants, which we can then all enjoy.&nbsp; Hence, we should encourage the breeders to ensure that&nbsp;variety continues <p align=left>Column: 146<p>to be available so that all of us can benefit.&nbsp; Who knows, one day, we may all be eating blue <I>chye sim</I>, as a new variety!&nbsp; But let me assure Mr Gan that our intent is not to make it onerous for the breeder to retain his right.&nbsp; Hence, it is not necessary for the breeder to propagate the protected plant variety on a large commercial scale, and this meets Mr Andy Gan's concern as to the scarcity of farmland to maintain the plant variety.&nbsp; Maintaining a plant variety can involve simple steps, such as maintaining some plants for the purpose of obtaining cuttings and buds or storing the seeds properly.&nbsp; Therefore, if such a breeder maintains his variety, he can then have the right to exercise his rights under this scheme, and the right will include marketing the variety under royalty, which is Mr Gan's point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is:&nbsp; if a company applies for protection and the application is turned down because the plant variety cannot be distinguished from another variety which is protected, can the company&nbsp;still sell a variety that is not protected?&nbsp; The key point here is that the application has been turned down.&nbsp; Under the UPOV Convention, and also provided in the Bill, a particular variety must be distinguishable from many other varieties before it can be considered for plant variety protection.&nbsp; The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), who are the technical experts in this matter and who will be the body conducting the technical examinations, has confirmed that when one plant cannot be distinguished from another plant, they are considered the same variety.&nbsp; Hence, under clause 29, protection is extended under a grant of protection to plant varieties which are not distinct from the protected plant variety, in respect of which the grant of protection is being made.&nbsp; Hence, if a company applies for protection for a particular variety but is told that this variety cannot be distinguished from another one that is<p align=left>Column: 147<p> already protected, it cannot sell its variety.&nbsp; Any unauthorised commercial exploitation of the protected plant variety will be considered an infringement of the grantee's right.&nbsp; This must be so, because this is the basis for introducing such a system in the first place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last question Mr Gan asked is how a plant variety right can be enforced.&nbsp; It is the grantee himself who enforces the right, which the new system gives him.&nbsp; The approach is no different from that under our patent system, which has generally worked well.&nbsp; Essentially, the grantee himself makes an assessment whether or not it is worth his while to enforce his rights against a suspected infringer, by commencing civil proceedings in court.&nbsp; Under this approach, as it is the grantee who brings the action, the onus is on him to prove that an infringement has taken place.&nbsp; If he succeeds, the court can order the infringer to stop his infringing activities, which is to give an&nbsp;injunctive relief, or to pay the grantee damages or to render an account.&nbsp; Indeed, this process is no different from many other countries, and it is also provided for under the UPOV Convention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mr Gan asked what if the wrongful act is committed in another country.&nbsp; Madam, the plant varieties protection system is territorial in nature, much like the protection systems for patents and trade marks.&nbsp; The intent is to ensure that IP rights owners - in this case, plant breeders - only file for protection in countries where the plant variety will be exploited.&nbsp; Therefore, in countries where the plant breeder has filed for protection, he can bring suit against infringers under the foreign country's jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have answered all of Mr Andy Gan's points.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all learn something new<p align=left>Column: 148<p> every day.&nbsp; I think this is something quite scientific and technical.&nbsp; But whatever it is, one day, we may very well be eating blue <I>chye sim</I>!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B> Madam, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998, the Government invoked the Control&nbsp;of Manufacture Act to regulate&nbsp;the manufacturing of optical discs, such as compact discs, video CDs and digital video discs.&nbsp; This was done in order to ensure that Singapore did not become a location for pirated disc manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure has been successful.&nbsp; The industry in Singapore has continued to grow and, supported by effective enforcement, illegal activity has been rooted out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill seeks to enhance the regulatory regime for optical disc manufacturing in Singapore.&nbsp; With Singapore's thrust towards a knowledge-based economy, it is timely to improve the regulatory regime for optical discs so as to keep pace with technological advancements and better protect the rights of intellectual property rights holders.&nbsp; In doing so, we will also be implementing Singapore's commitments under the USSFTA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 149<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the salient features of this Bill and, in particular, how these differ from the current regime under the Control of Manufacture Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we are introducing a licensing system.&nbsp; Currently, optical disc manufacturers are required to register with EDB.&nbsp; Under the Bill, manufacturers are required to obtain a licence from EDB.&nbsp; Currently, only a one-time registration is needed.&nbsp; Under the Bill, licences will be subject to renewal.&nbsp; A register of licences issued will be maintained by EDB and will be available for public inspection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Bill introduces new obligations for manufacturers.&nbsp; Currently, registered manufacturers undertake to observe a voluntary code of conduct not to engage in IPR infringing activities.&nbsp; Under the Bill, manufacturers will have to imprint on optical discs a code that identifies them as the manufacturer of the discs.&nbsp; Exceptions to this obligation can, however, be authorised by right holders.&nbsp; It will also be an offence to falsely apply another code or&nbsp;any mark&nbsp;resembling such a code.&nbsp; Manufacturers are further required to keep records of their orders and purchases for inspection upon request.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third feature concerns enforcement.&nbsp; Enforcement responsibilities for any breaches of obligation under this Bill will be undertaken by the police IPR branch.&nbsp; Authorised officers and police officers will now be empowered to carry out inspections of licensed premises, both with and without notice.&nbsp; Licensees will also be required, upon written request, to provide samples of optical discs to any authorised officer, police officer, owner of copyright or right-holder organisation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we have enhanced penalties under this Bill.&nbsp; The new penalties are in line with those pertaining to similar offences in other jurisdictions, as well as those under Singapore's Copyright Act.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 150<p> The Bill also provides for forfeiture of goods and/or the revocation of licences under certain circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, this Bill will enhance the competitiveness of our industry by boosting its reputation in terms of intellectual property protection.&nbsp; Rights holders will be more inclined to award manufacturing contracts to plants in Singapore because they are subject to a licensing system that is more robust.&nbsp; Further, some of the requirements under the Bill, such as the requirement to imprint a manufacturer's code, are already required in commercial contracts.&nbsp; Other jurisdictions, such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have already introduced similar legislation.&nbsp; In addition, in drafting this Bill, MTI has been careful not to impose unnecessary or onerous conditions on the industry while ensuring at the same time to&nbsp;put in place an effective system to deter potential infringers.&nbsp; Application fees for licences will be kept to modest levels, and applications for renewal of licences will incur no additional costs.&nbsp; The manufacturers' code to be adopted will be based on the internationally accepted standard that the industry is already familiar with.&nbsp; Inspections by authorised officers will also be carried out with minimal disruption to legitimate manufacturers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in conclusion, a strong IPR regime is consistent with Singapore's objective of becoming a knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; It will also contribute towards enhancing our attractiveness as a destination for IP-related investments, thus creating more and better jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; This Bill is a useful addition to the comprehensive range of effective IP laws that Singapore already has in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 151<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Like the earlier Bills that were debated in this House this afternoon, this Bill is to enable us to fulfill certain obligations arising from the US-Singapore FTA.&nbsp; The FTA's chapter on IPR includes several obligations related to pharmaceutical products.&nbsp; While most of the IPR-related amendments have just been made in intellectual property laws, including the Patents Act, some amendments to the Medicines Act are also required.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three obligations in the FTA which impact the Medicines Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The first obligation effectively means that no marketing approval should be granted to a generic product before the expiration of the patent term of the innovated product unless with the consent of the patent owner.&nbsp; In order to fulfill this obligation, a new section 12A will be inserted into the Act to allow the Health Sciences Authority to consider the patent status of the product when deciding whether or not to grant marketing approval. Section 12A will also allow HSA to request an applicant to submit patent-related information when he makes an application for marketing approval.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second obligation effectively means that there must be a mechanism whereby a patent owner will be notified of the identity of any party seeking marketing approval of a generic product while the innovated product's patent is still in force.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 12A will also serve to fulfill this obligation by enabling HSA to request the applicant to notify the&nbsp;proprietor of the patent.&nbsp;This will apply mainly in situations where the&nbsp;generic product owner challenges the validity of the patent and HSA will take into&nbsp;account the action taken by the patent owner to defend his patent before continuing to process the application.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another amendment related to the second obligation concerning notification and disclosure is the new section 19C which will allow HSA to publish information on the product licence's application it has received should it be necessary to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 153<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third obligation effectively means that HSA may not approve a generic product&nbsp;based on the safety and efficacy data of the innovated product during the period specified.&nbsp; In order to comply with this obligation, a new&nbsp;section 19B will be inserted, stating that the HSA may not grant marketing approval for a similar product on the basis of&nbsp;the grant of an earlier approval for a period of five years from the date of the&nbsp;earlier approval unless with the consent of the holder of the&nbsp;earlier approval.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the proposed new sections 12A, 19C and 19B, section 16 of the Act will be amended to allow HSA to revoke the marketing approval of a product if it is subsequently established that a product does indeed infringe a patent or&nbsp;when the declaration on patent-related information is found to be false.&nbsp;&nbsp;To further strengthen the&nbsp;integrity of the approval mechanism, section 20 of the Act will also be amended to make it an&nbsp;offence for an applicant to submit a false declaration in support of this application. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides these IPR-related amendments, this Bill also makes a technical amendment to section 54 of the Medicines Act in relation to the control of oral dental gums.&nbsp; These are chewing gums intended for use in promoting dental health or oral hygiene.&nbsp; This also arose from our obligation under the US-Singapore FTA to allow the sale of some medicinal and oral dental gums subject to Singapore's health laws and was in fact implemented earlier in January this year. This amendment is intended to clarify for the avoidance of doubt that the powers conferred on the Minister to make orders under section 54 of the Act do also apply to oral dental gums and include powers to restrict their sale and supply only by prescription or under the supervision of a pharmacist.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 154<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, this Bill is to enable Singapore to comply with certain obligations under the US-Singapore FTA mainly on the protection of intellectual property rights in respect of pharmaceutical products. These amendments will also strengthen Singapore's protection of pharmaceutical patents and bring us in line with international practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Medicines (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; This Bill seeks to amend the Medicines Act (Chapter 176) to implement certain obligations undertaken by Singapore under the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement conducted in 2003.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given Singapore's focus on being a medical and research and development hub, the safeguarding of rights on patented drugs, ie, the protection granted to an innovator to prevent others using copying or making the invention, would be highly desirable even if these were not a requirement under the United States-Singapore FTA.&nbsp; Research and development activities are laborious, time-consuming and expensive.&nbsp; Innovators should be encouraged and protected by our laws to safeguard their efforts.&nbsp; Moreover, advancement and new discovery would mean better drugs to comb the frontier of diseases. This will auger well for us in our endeavour to excel in research and development in the pharmaceutical field. This Bill thus will bolster Singapore's resolve to create a suitable environment for a medical and research and development hub.&nbsp; In point of fact, Madam, quite a number of pharmaceutical giants have set up their regional hubs in Singapore with research units, a moving factor for their doing so being the good regulatory environment <p align=left>Column: 155<p>apart from the high quality medical technology and the remarkable infrastructure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 amends section 54 to allow chewing gum for sale to promote dental health or oral hygiene. May I ask the Minister whether this will result in proliferation of many varieties of chewing gum flooding the market?&nbsp; Madam, manufacturers may take advantage of this relaxation and vend them aggressively in a lucrative market of a previously-banned product.&nbsp; How is the Minister going to address this potential environmental hazard by amending this Bill concerning chewing gum?&nbsp; May I ask the Minister why such chewing gums are already available in the market even before the implementation of this Bill?&nbsp; In order to prevent inconsiderate discarding of chewed gum, will the Minister require the manufacturers of gum for sale in our market to print environment-friendly messages on the wrappers to remind users on proper disposal of used gums?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalty for offences under section 20(1), (2), (3) and (3A) is a fine of $5,000 and/or imprisonment of up to two years. Madam, this penalty is rather low for offences under section 20(3) and (3A).&nbsp; This may seem reasonable based on the maximum penalties allowable under the Medicines Act, but offenders under this section who may be caught under the Penal Code or other Acts, ought to have their penalty based on the more established Acts so that there can be consistency in the imposition of penalty for such similar category of offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill and the current Medicines Act, Madam, do not provide for situations where it calls for additional data to be given to the licensing authority even after granting of a product licence.&nbsp; Will the Minister consider inserting an additional new clause for such a requirement?&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 156<p> Madam, situations may arise when such an action is necessary and I would like to cite, as an example, the case of New York State suing a drug giant recently over a drug called \"Paxil\".&nbsp; The civil lawsuit contends that the drug company engaged in persistent fraud by not telling physicians that studies showed that Paxil not only did not work in adolescents but may also be linked to cases of suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, there is a need to address intentional selective disclosures to the detriment of consumers at any time.&nbsp; How does the Minister plan to ensure this?&nbsp; Do our regulations provide safeguards against the dumping of disputed drugs in our market, especially after they have been rejected by those countries with more stringent rules?&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this Bill should not be drafted only to comply with the commitments made under Article 16.8(1) of the USSFTA.&nbsp; It should be drafted, more importantly, to have the interests and the safety of the consumers in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments to section 16 state that the licence can be revoked by way of a request to the licensing authority.&nbsp; I feel that to revoke the licence, it should be done by way of a written request. This is to prevent any dispute as to whether that request was made by the licensee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister can clarify the points raised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Madam, let me first thank Dr Lily Neo for her strong support of the Bill. She did raise a number of questions.&nbsp; Let me respond to them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, chewing gum.&nbsp; We banned chewing gum in 1992 for very good reasons.&nbsp; Irresponsible disposal of the gum created an unnecessary problem for our cleaners and when it led to jamming of MRT train doors, it even posed a public safety risk for the passengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now had 12 years&nbsp;of freedom from this sticky problem. We have no intention of<p align=left>Column: 157<p> welcoming them back.&nbsp; In fact, some foreign cities are seriously contemplating banning chewing gum as we have done.&nbsp; The concession we made on chewing gum for the bilateral FTA is therefore a very limited one. It certainly will not lead to a flooding of our market with the gums.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, what we have done is merely to create an exception for gums with therapeutic value. Their sale will then&nbsp;be subject to our health laws and regulation.&nbsp; In this way, we can expect a slight increase in consumption of gums but this will be for their therapeutic value and not for their recreational value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Environment Ministry and the Transport Ministry have, in parallel, introduced stiffer penalties for any indiscriminate disposal of used gum.&nbsp; This is to remind all that we have no intention to return&nbsp;to the&nbsp;bad, old sticky days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo suggested that we require gum manufacturers to print environment-friendly messages on the wrappers.&nbsp; I happen to have one here with me&nbsp;and it has&nbsp;a pictorial message on responsible gum disposal with a tagline \"Keep your country clean\".&nbsp; But whether such a message will be effective, frankly speaking, I doubt it very much, because unlike cigarette packs, which are large enough to enclose lively pictures and pictorial messages, the wrapper is really too small to provide for any effective messages. Therefore, I think the most effective method of preventing these old problems from coming back is to continue to ban those chewing gums and only to make a small concession for those with therapeutic value.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, it will not be appropriate to use the Medicines Act to enforce environment-friendly messages.&nbsp; The Medicines Act can only enforce product labelling requirements which address health and safety concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the timing of this particular FTA obligation, the concession on chewing <p align=left>Column: 158<p>gum was implemented in January this year through a set of subsidiary legislation under the existing section 54 which is actually legally adequate.&nbsp; But just to avoid any doubt, the proposed section 54 (1A) will make it crystal clear that the existing powers under section 54 do apply to dental chewing gums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now reply to the questions on the main amendments pertaining to greater IPR protection for patent holders.&nbsp; On the question of penalties, Dr Lily Neo felt that a fine of $5,000 seems rather low.&nbsp; The maximum penalty, as currently prescribed in the Medicines Act, is a fine of $5,000 or two years' imprisonment or both. For the current amendments, we have merely followed this prescription.&nbsp; But I take Dr Neo's comment that the existing penalty quantum seems low.&nbsp; We will review the penalties of all the offences as part of a larger review of the existing medicine legislation to bring them in line with other health and environmental protection laws in due course.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On new section 16, Dr Neo felt that the licensee's request to revoke a product licence should be a written request.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; In fact, this is the intent.&nbsp; Any revocation of a product licence is a process not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; And any such request will need to be made formally in writing supported by appropriate documents.&nbsp; This is actually implied, as all official correspondences with the Health Sciences Authority have to be in writing.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Dr Neo raised the question of additional data.&nbsp; Let me clarify that new section 19D covers all safety and efficacy data provided by the applicant regardless of whether it is data submitted at the point of application or additional data requested by HSA in order to approve the application.&nbsp; The current clause is therefore sufficient.&nbsp; But the obligation on<p align=left>Column: 159<p> protection of safety and efficacy data does not extend to additional data submitted after a product has been registered, as this was not included under our obligation for the bilateral FTA.&nbsp; When applying intellectual protection measures, it is necessary to balance the interest of the innovator companies with that of the companies producing generic medicines.&nbsp; I think we heard a fair bit of this question of balance about an hour ago when other Bills were being debated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there is no uniform international practice with regard to the protection of additional data submitted after the initial registration of a product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr Neo mentioned the Paxil case with Merck&nbsp;Sharp &amp;&nbsp;Dohme.&nbsp; The two issues are quite separate.&nbsp; This protection of data is a concession given to a patent holder, so that if I am the patent owner, whatever safety efficacy data I supplied to the regulator, no third party can come in and&nbsp;free ride on my data. It has nothing to do with consumer safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paxil case is quite different.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a case of IPR dispute.&nbsp; The legal proceeding is being processed.&nbsp; So we do not know what the outcome will be.&nbsp; But from press reports, the New York Attorney-General's point of view is that&nbsp;certain information has not been fully disclosed to the public, and therefore he is now taking up the case with the drug company.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But in the process of bilateral negotiations, and because of lobbying by certain companies in the US, we made a concession for dental gums to be sold under the supervision of pharmacists.&nbsp; But we stood firm on our requirement that we are banning chewing gum and therefore it will not be possible for anybody to just walk into any pharmacy and purchase gum, such as an over-the-counter drug sale.&nbsp; And that is why we put in procedures which will make it more difficult to purchase such chewing gum, and that is why we require, for example, buyer's particulars to be taken down by the pharmacist.&nbsp; Occasionally, we do&nbsp;auditing to make sure that there&nbsp;is no excessive sale of this particular oral dental gum.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

May I ask the Minister which regulations provide safeguards against the dumping of disputed drugs in our market?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> That was not quite&nbsp;what I said.&nbsp; What I meant was that the protection of data supplied by patent owner has nothing to do with safety of consumers.&nbsp; Patent rights and data protection rights are two different pieces of intellectual property rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most patent Acts allow for a period of 20 years' protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I invented something, over the 20-year patent period, nobody can infringe my patent.&nbsp; So this is one IP right.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second right is data protection which concerns&nbsp;the drug registration process.&nbsp; Having secured a patent,&nbsp;you still need what is called marketing <p align=left>Column: 161<p>approval for a product licence from the drug regulator of any country that you want to market to.&nbsp; And when&nbsp;you submit the application, you have to produce all the clinical trial results to show that the product is, firstly, safe; and, secondly, effective.&nbsp; So safety and efficacy data will have to be produced to the regulator.&nbsp; But having produced the data to the regulator, the regulator has a certain obligation, which is to make sure that&nbsp;the data&nbsp;are not openly disclosed, because otherwise trade secrets may be released to third parties who can then free ride on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, data protection is provided in that light.&nbsp; The data&nbsp;are derived from&nbsp;clinical trials on safety and efficacy.&nbsp; This amendment&nbsp;is about protecting these rights of the patent owner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(b) how will these programmes benefit workers in general; and (c) how will SLF be classified henceforth.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SLF was set up to support the labour movement in Singapore.&nbsp; The funds of SLF have been derived from the union movement, mainly from subscriptions by union members as well as contributions from its co-operatives and investment income.&nbsp; Trade unions are exempt from income tax.&nbsp; So SLF was granted IPC status, and was exempted from tax. According to the Charities Act, 80% of the revenues must go towards charitable activities. However, most of the labour movement activities are not considered charitable activities under the Act. Therefore, during the review of SLF in December 2003, the decision was made to forgo its charity status to enable SLF to better focus on its original mission of supporting the labour movement as enacted under the SLF Act in 1977 and it will continue to do so.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLF provides extensive support to the labour movement, for its activities ranging from financial assistance, to training sponsorship and recreational facilities.&nbsp; SLF will also be embarking on sponsoring training awards for union leaders who are selected for part-time or full-time studies in local diploma or degree courses. Lastly, SLF is working closely with NTUC to roll out new programmes to benefit workers in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked how SLF will be classified. SLF will continue to be classified as a statutory board. Like any other statutory board, SLF will be required to contribute a percentage of its annual accounting surplus to the Government's Consolidated Fund.&nbsp; However, workers' contribution to SLF will be exempt from the requirement to contribute to the Consolidated Fund.&nbsp; MOF is currently working with SLF on an appropriate basis for its contribution.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLF is a small statutory board with nine full-time staff. It relies primarily on NTUC to implement many of the programmes to help workers in Singapore. This is an efficient system that avoids duplication and enables SLF to remain trim.&nbsp;</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
