Members to raise elucidatory questions on the statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a recent ministerial statement, some of the questions asked of the Hon. Minister seemed to go beyond the confines permitted. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly clarify the procedure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions on a ministerial statement must be confined solely to the contents of the statement. They should not be prefaced with unnecessary statements or be framed in such a way or manner as to invite or to provoke a debate. Debate on a ministerial statement is irregular. If any hon. Member feels that only a debate would satiate his mind on the issues in the ministerial statement, there are avenues open to him, one of which is to file a substantive motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to make it clear that the rules governing the contents of Questions to Ministers are generally applicable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Executive powers)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

I did not say that the Constitution would be amended \"to enable a future President to share powers with the Prime Minister\". Those were the words of the Straits Times journalist who had paraphrased my speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I said was: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The President will be vested with veto powers in certain areas. He will not have the powers of President Reagan. The Prime Minister will remain the Chief Executive of the country. But in areas where the President is vested with veto powers, the Prime Minister has to have his concurrence. The areas which we have in mind relate to the use of the country's financial reserves. These reserves, including those accumulated \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by previous governments from the same party, cannot be freely spent without the President's agreement. The President, for example, may withhold his consent if the Cabinet proposes to spend the reserves on wasteful programmes or projects. This way, we have an additional safeguard against our financial reserves being squandered by a potentially profligate government.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question for the First Deputy Prime Minister. But, first of all, could I ask him whether he does not think it improper, or perhaps uncalled for, to take issue with me on what is reported in his own paper, the Straits Times? I never saw any correction of this report from the First Deputy Prime Minister. But I will let that pass. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the First Deputy Prime Minister, first of all, was there any reason why he went to the other side of the world to speak on a matter that concerns the people of Singapore primarily, without first discussing the proposals with the people of Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought the Member for Anson has jumped up to apologize to me for having not read my speech carefully. Instead he has taken issue with the Straits Times and me for not having corrected the wrong reporting. The Member for Anson should have read my speech which was also published in the same issue of the Straits Times. My speech was also telecast. So he owes me an apology rather than the other way round. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I go to Boston to make a speech on a matter which concerns Singaporeans? The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy organizes conferences on ASEAN. Last year it was a conference on Singapore, the year before it was on Indonesia. It was a seminar wherein other speakers were also invited. I thought the main interest of the audience would be the political future of Singapore and I therefore delivered a speech on a matter which I believe was of great interest to the audience. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything wrong with a Minister making a speech which concerns Singaporeans in a country outside Singapore? The Member for Anson himself went to Penang to talk on human rights, and he \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> was in Jakarta to talk about the plight of the foreign workers in Singapore.

The distinction is this. He has double standards. I do not have double standards. But that is not the important point of the debate this morning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred to areas related to financial reserves. I did not go beyond what the Prime Minister has said on this issue in Singapore. We are concerned with the protection of financial reserves. How we protect these financial reserves is a question that is being studied by the Auditor-General, Accountant-General and the Permanent Secretaries who have to refine the plan to make it workable. Hence I used the words \"areas related to financial reserves\". The matter has been discussed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in Singapore. I did not raise anything new in Boston. I was merely projecting ourselves into the future for the Americans who have an interest in the future of Singapore. I did not go into areas which the Member for Anson, in his own mind, thought I had gone into. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the First Deputy Prime Minister in a position now to define these areas? That is what I am asking. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson is long on questions and short on memory.

And in the last 12 months, there were only four other cases where similar penalties had to be imposed on the parking wardens. You must understand that HDB is the largest car parking authority and HDB controls more than 200,000 car park lots. The warden has to look after, patrol and ensure that parking in these more than 200,000 car park lots is orderly. A large number of HDB wardens are performing this duty. And HDB, by and large, has good parking wardens and, therefore, disciplinary action taken against wardens is very rare.

It was deducted from him. Is the Minister not aware that there is a subtle difference between the man paying up $20 and it being compulsorily deducted from his salary? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is: will the Minister tell us whether these four cases that he referred to related to vehicles of PAP MPs? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is: would the Minister tell us whether this particular Member has a season parking ticket which he was required to display in his housing estate car park where the car was parked, and whether or not it was displayed at that time? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, the penalty imposed on the parking warden has been paid by the parking warden. It has been deducted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Was it deducted? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Has been deducted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> It has been paid by the warden. As I understand it, the warden had asked the senior officer for a deduction of the penalty. And the senior officer in charge of the case even helped the warden. The warden pleaded for a deduction of the penalty, and the senior officer in charge, I think paid $10 on behalf of the warden. So the warden paid only $10. And I was told that subsequently this warden had been advised by someone to return the $10 back to the senior officer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> By the Member for Anson! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> On the second question, this particular car, EU3803K, in fact, is an MP's car and has an MP's car label which entitles him to park in HDB estates. On top of that, he has also purchased a season parking ticket. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> For his own estate? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> For his own estate. In fact, that is not necessary. Any Member of Parliament who has an MP's car parking label does not need to purchase a season ticket. So, in short, this particular car has two labels entitling him to park in the HDB estate; one is the MP's car parking label, the other one is the season ticket. And HDB officers investigating this case were satisfied that the Member of Parliament had displayed the MP's label on his car. In fact, the HDB senior officer had personally checked the car and found that the MP's label was stuck on the windscreen and there was only one mark on that windscreen, and the mark was an old mark, not sort of newly stuck on. So the senior officers investigating the case were satisfied that there was negligence on the part of the car parking warden and, therefore, a penalty was imposed on him. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered my other question, the second question, whether the four other cases also related to motorcars of PAP MPs.

[Laughter] I know you find it very funny. There is no question of this man having been advised by me to return the $10. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, will you please sit down. There is no reason for you to make an excuse. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am not making any excuses. He is giving wrong information. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> But you are not asking any supplementary question. You are making excuses. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> No, I am not accusing the Member for Anson. I just mentioned that he has been advised by someone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's other question whether these four persons were PAP Members of Parliament, my answer is that one of them is a PAP MP and three are not. I am very reluctant to disclose the details for the simple reason that I do not want the parking wardens to misuse their authority by issuing tickets to the people for whatever reasons to cause them inconvenience. So I would like the public to know that wardens are not allowed to misuse their authority to inconvenience the public. Therefore, the public, if aggrieved, can appeal to the HDB and the HDB administration will take action against the wardens who have misused their authority. So I am quite reluctant to discuss who made the complaint to the HDB. If the Member for Anson is trying to debate on this, it may frighten the public away from writing to the HDB to provide the evidence or information on the misuse of authority by the wardens. Because the people may worry that if they write to the HDB and the warden goes to see the Member for Anson and the Member brings this matter up in Parliament, their names may be exposed. They would rather not get themselves involved in the debate or politicking of the Member for Anson. Therefore, I am very reluctant to give him the information. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Specious answers! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, perhaps the Hon.

The affected shop tenant can opt for priority allocation of an alternative shop at concessionary rental similar to those offered to resettlement cases. Alternatively, the tenant can choose to retain the existing shop and resume business after the project has been completed. In the latter case, he will need to pay only 20% of his current rental during the first six months of the project. Thereafter, he is not required to pay any rental until the completion of the project. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, is the Hon.

On the other hand, they do not engage in campaigns to influence Singaporean opinion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a few publications, a small minority, that have sought to influence Singaporeans by colouring the truth to stir up feelings on local issues, even on sensitive local issues such as race and language, and seek to manipulate local opinion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing law, the Government can impose a ban on the entry or circulation of such publications but this is not necessary. A ban may be misrepresented by such publications as fear of exposing our people to their reporting. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign newspapers and publications are owned and published by foreigners who have no interest in our welfare or long-term survival. They are ordinarily based overseas and are outside our legal jurisdiction. They have no responsibility or obligation to ensure our political stability or economic progress. When such publications consistently attempt to manipulate local opinion and interfere in our domestic politics for their own ends, including that of generating controversies to increase circulation of their publications, then we should take steps to prevent them from doing so at our expense. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are amending the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act so that foreign publications can be declared a gazetted publication if they interfere in our domestic politics. Such publications would be allowed restricted sales but unrestricted circulation in Singapore so that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singaporeans can read for themselves what others say about us. It would also educate our population on the motives of others.

I do not see how it is in the public interest to name individual companies which are already generally known and have been published because, as I have said earlier, these forward contracts, however imprudent one might consider them, are neither illegal nor disallowed by SES rules. As far as the investing public is concerned, the SES as a whole is guaranteeing all trades. Therefore, their interests are looked after. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister concede, and he would appear to have conceded, that it was imprudent, on the part of these stockbroking companies to have entered into forward contracts, although the Minister says they may not be illegal? Well, that is a matter to be decided. But would the Minister not agree that if the public are informed about this, then they would avoid companies which imprudently transact business on the stock market? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue of imprudence or improper propriety is a matter which is under investigation. So I do not think one should prejudge this. It is precisely for this reason that I think it will be inappropriate for me to quote individual names because, in the context in which they have been raised, it would imply guilt of some form. As far as the investing public is concerned, all these dealings with the Stock Exchange are now guaranteed. So it is quite unimportant which company he is dealing with. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, what is the rationale for asking all stockbroking firms to guarantee the so-called lifeboat fund? Why should the firms which operate strictly within the rules and bye-laws of the Stock Exchange of Singapore be made to bail out those who were probably too greedy in the first place and got themselves into trouble? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I should explain the actual application of the lifeboat fund. It is not, in fact, to bail \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> out any individual stockbroking company. That is not the intention at all. It is quite possible that companies which have been imprudent will, in fact, fail. The lifeboat was put together to ensure that individual trades entered into by the investing public will not incur a loss. That is the sole purpose of the fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a broker company is in difficulties and has to draw upon the fund, the fund being a credit umbrella provided by banks has to be fully repaid, either jointly or severally, by the stockbroking members. So it is in no way to be interpreted as a bail-out.

The rationale was that, since remisiers are part of the stockbroking community, the deduction of the commission would go into a fidelity fund which benefits all members of the stockbroking community so that trades can be guaranteed and the public would be reassured and therefore would continue to trade on the stock exchange. This is the basic reason. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister has misunderstood the point. It is not the remisiers who have brought about this whole fiasco but the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> owners of certain stockbroking firms. And does not the Minister feel that there is no justification that people who are not involved in any way are being made to pay a penalty by way of 25% of their income? Where is the justice? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the arrangement is between the stockbroking companies and their remisiers.

This includes not only the purchase price of the flat but also the interest on the housing loan and various legal and administrative fees. The total CPF savings utilized is therefore usually much more than the purchase price of the flat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having purchased the flat entirely with his CPF savings, it is reasonable that the CPF member should pay for its renovation, maintenance and repairs with cash. These are normal expenses often of a recurrent nature, connected with the ownership and use of properties. I am therefore not in favour of allowing CPF savings to be used to defray such expenses. Besides, being difficult to monitor and administer, such expenses will encroach on the member's CPF savings which he will need for his old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer to keep the CPF scheme as simple as possible and only make fundamental changes if there are good reasons for doing so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister explain why he is not in favour?

I would rather that my Ministry review the whole issue of CPF thoroughly and fundamentally, and only make fundamental changes if necessary, rather than allowing small changes to nibble away at the scheme; because by so doing, we may lose sight of the basic objective of the CPF scheme which is to provide for the old age financial security of members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our studies have shown that even expenses which appear relatively minor, coming at the front-end of the CPF scheme, tend to have a significant impact on the old age savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does not the Minister realize that, in fact, CPF money is being used for legal costs and other costs related to transfer of title?

This temporary measure will assist the economy to recover and preserve jobs. The CPF rate will be restored after the economy has recovered from the current recession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the temporary cut in the CPF rate of contribution are being finalized. As the main intention is to reduce wage cost to regain our international competitiveness, the employer's rate of contribution to CPF must be reduced. It is also likely that the Special Account will be suspended so that the 4% contribution can go to the Ordinary Account for use in servicing housing loans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies indicate that most CPF members will not have difficulties servicing their housing loans if the cut in the employer's rate of CPF contribution is not too large. A consequence will be that there will be more members whose monthly CPF contributions will be less than their HDB loan instalments. However, a large majority of the additional members affected in this group will have CPF balances which will be sufficient to make up the shortfall for several years. Other HDB buyers who may have difficulty paying additional cash could apply to the HDB to have their housing loan periods extended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for buyers of private properties, Credit POSB and other financial institutions will be asked to lengthen their loan periods if necessary. Those who have more than $15,000 in their Medisave Accounts will be able to make use of the excess CPF savings, when it is channelled to their Ordinary Accounts, for servicing their housing loans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also considering to move the CPF interest rate towards the market rate. This will be in line with our policy to allow CPF members greater flexibility in investing their CPF savings. The HDB mortgage rate will be reduced correspondingly and this will help to ease the burden on the HDB home buyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum:</b> Does the Minister agree with the view expressed earlier that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the reduction in the CPF contribution should be undertaken only as a last resort, ie, after all the other measures to lower operating costs have been implemented? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I should make clear that the fact that the Government has made this decision does not in any way imply that the economy is at rock bottom, not by a long shot. The fact is that the Government has reviewed thoroughly all the various possible measures that can be taken, some of which like the reduction of rates and charges have already been taken. The Economic Committee will be completing its report shortly and there will be other measures recommended. The conclusion after all these studies is that it is best to cut the rates now on a temporary basis. In the process we will then compress the period of recovery and speed up the process by stimulating the economy to recover as soon as possible. It does not make sense to wait until the market forces work their way through. So it is in that context that we should see this cut. 12.00 noon \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Question Time is over. Ministerial statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SUSPENSION OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE OF SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The problem of the Pan-Electric Industries and those of the Stock Exchange attracted wide public interest. I therefore propose to give the background in some detail to Members of the House so that they can see the issues concerned in their proper perspective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, some background on Pan-El. Pan-El is one of 122 Singapore incorporated companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). At the time trading in its shares was suspended on the Stock Exchange, Pan-El had a market capitalization of some $230 million, just under 1% of the total market capitalization of all Singapore companies listed on the SES. The main business of the company is in three areas, namely, marine salvage/offshore supplies, hotel/travel services and property development. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current recession has undoubtedly affected Pan-El's main business, they are not the sole, or even the main, cause of Pan-El's problems. These problems arose principally as a result of a series of massive forward share deals which Pan-El had entered into, utilizing funds borrowed from banks. These forward share deals, which totalled some S$140 million, had resulted in losses to the company of an estimated $40 million at the time its shares were suspended. These losses were greater than Pan-El's entire 1984 pre-tax profit of just over $40 million, and led to its defaulting on a $7.5 million loan repayment which was due on 18th November 1985. This default, and subsequent revelation of its massive forward share liabilities, eventually induced creditor banks to call in the receivers after the failure of the first attempt to rescue the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Koon Swan, with interests in Pan-El held, through Sigma Metal, signed on 11th December 1985 a rescue agreement with a consortium of Pan-El creditor banks to undertake the following:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Relieve Pan-El of all its outstanding share purchase obligations by 31st December 1985. This was substantially completed on 31st December 1985; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Inject a total of $40 million into Pan-El by 31st March 1986 in order to restore Pan-El's liquidity and allow it to continue operations. As of today, a sum of $20 million has been transferred to Pan-El. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing measures should improve prospects for restoring Pan-El to financial viability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the setting up of the Supervisory Committee, the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) operated under a self-regulatory system in which the affairs of the SES were managed by a committee consisting entirely of brokers. It set its own trading rules and was not obliged to submit returns to the MAS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the problems facing Pan-El and its liabilities in forward share contracts first came to light around 15th November, it became evident that a number of stock- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> broking companies were heavily exposed to the Pan-El group and its associated companies, with exposures to Pan-El reported at around $140 million and total forward contract exposures estimated at around $600 million. These revelations led to widespread concern amongst banks lending to the stockbroking community (as the aggregate capital funds of all stockbrokers stood at $350 million). There was fear that some brokerage houses could become insolvent if Pan-El and its associated companies failed to honour their forward share contract obligations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matters came to a head on 30th November, when the Pan-El rescue negotiations collapsed and creditor banks called in receivers and managers. With this development, the threat of broker insolvency was very real as no assurance could be obtained from lending banks that credit lines would not be withdrawn. In the circumstances, the Committee of the Stock Exchange, after consultation with the MAS and leading local banks, decided to suspend trading temporarily with effect from 2nd December. It was a difficult decision as the damage to the SES and Singapore's reputation was recognized. However, a two- s was considered paramount and superseded all other considerations, including repercussions flowing from a suspension. Without a lifeboat fund and the assurance it gave, defaults by a number of brokers was considered almost inevitable, and this would have led to the withdrawal of credit by banks, leading to more defaults. The ensuing panic amongst investors would have led to a forced suspension of the Exchange under chaotic conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress again that the lifeboat fund is not meant to bail out \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> individual stockbrokers who have become or may become insolvent through their own imprudence. Such brokers will still fail. Rather, the lifeboat is there to ensure that the obligations of the members of the Stock Exchange as a whole are fulfilled. The fund is a credit umbrella put up by banks and any drawdowns against this fund would have to be repaid with interest by SES member-firms, individually or collectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying cause is over-trading on the part of a number of brokers who have taken positions or have provided financing for customers in amounts greatly in excess of their capital resources. The problems are centred around some $600 million worth of forward contracts which mature between December 1985 and June 1986. Due to the prolonged decline in stock market prices, many of these contracts could involve losses for end-buyers upon maturity. If end-buyers default, losses will fall immediately on the brokers, and subsequently on lending banks if the brokers then fail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present position is that the aggregate capital funds of all Singapore stockbrokers stand at S$350 million, with another S$70 million in the process of being raised. These funds, together with the S$180 million line of credit in the lifeboat fund, should meet all contingencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the practice of entering into forward contracts is not specifically prohibited by SES rules prior to 6th December 1985. What went wrong was gross over-trading greatly in excess of capital funds, thus greatly increasing the risk. The risk was aggravated by heavy concentration in certain shares and by exposure to particular clients. Such practices are distinct from market-churning or price-rigging which, if discovered, would be in contravention of the Securities Industry Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of December last have shown that the SES, as presently constituted, has proved unable to exercise effective self-regulation. A new Securities Industry Act will be presented to Parliament later today, incorporating new regulatory measures adapted from the Bank- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ing Act in Singapore and securities industry regulations currently in force in the United States and Australia. The new Act, when approved by Parliament, will provide a sound basis for the development of Singapore's capital markets in an increasingly complex financial environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It aims to provide a refurbished SES with the autonomy to manage its day-to-day activities, while providing Government with the mechanism to identify and act against malpractices. A draft of the new Securities Industry Act was given to the SES in June last year. However, implementation was held up due to strong objections raised by stockbroking companies. Discussions with the SES were continuing when events were overtaken by Pan-El's problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to provide Members of this House with some background facts on the importance of the stock market and its position in our financial system, so that the problems of the Stock Exchange can be viewed in proper perspective. Based on 1984 data, the salient facts are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The stockbroking industry contributed 0.6% towards Singapore's GDP, out of 12.2%, contributed by the financial services sector as a whole. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Employment in the stockbroking industry accounted for less than 5% of the total employment of around 35,000 in the financial services sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Total loans extended to the stockbroking industry by the banks was just over S$1 billion, or 3% of the total loans extended by commercial banks to non-bank customers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Total market capitalization of the Singapore and Malaysia stock exchanges was around S$70 billion, accounting for about 1% of the capitalization of the major stock markets in the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Annual turnover of the Singapore stock market was around $8 billion, or 0.6% of turnover on the major stock markets in the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Foreign ownership (excluding Malaysian) of Singapore shares accounts \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for less than 8% of the total market capitalization of Singapore registered companies listed on the SES. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing facts show that the stockbroking industry in Singapore is a relatively small component of the Singapore economy and that foreign investments in Singapore shares have historically been low. The latter arises not only because the stock market capitalization of Singapore/Malaysian shares is small in world terms but also because turnover is even lower, due to the fact that many quality shares are tightly held by local institutions and are infrequently traded. This has tended to discourage the wider participation of foreign equity investors, who have found our markets to be insufficiently broadly based. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should put into perspective alarmist reports in the foreign press which have suggested that the present problems of the Stock Exchange will drive away foreign investors and lead to a collapse of the Singapore financial system. The truth is that foreign investors have never been very important players in local stock markets nor have they been actively solicited, primarily because of the thinness of local stock markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the stock market industry in Singapore to contribute more towards our economy. The reforms proposed under the new Securities Industry Act will provide the necessary regulatory framework for the long term growth of a healthy capital market in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a number of questions by way of clarification. Firstly, why was the new Securities Industry Act not introduced much earlier, especially in the years when we began to launch Singapore as a financial centre? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Hon. Minister pointed out that foreign ownership of Singapore shares amounts to only 8% or less than 8% of the total shares. Is this direct ownership, or does it include indirect ownership through holding companies? The question is very important. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, he mentioned the combined Singapore-Malaysian capitalization of $70 billion. What should be of concern to this House is the way in which the capital markets of the two countries, Singapore and Malaysia, are so heavily integrated, and obviously the crisis that he alluded to, the Pan-El case, had its genesis in manipulation by somebody in Malaysia. What is there to prevent future occurrences of this sort? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any more questions? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I noted that the Minister would like to see the development of a healthier securities market in Singapore. Bearing in mind that our present stock market is a rather small one, thus allowing speculators ample opportunities to rig the market as he said earlier, would he not then consider allowing more companies to be listed on the stock exchange so that we have a broader based market, which means in fact easing the regulations for listing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, as regards Pan-El, is the Minister aware that there were investigations into insider trading in this company as far back as February 1984, or was it 1985? Will the Minister say what was the result of those investigations into this insider trading? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, about the massive forward share deals of $140 million entered into by Pan-El, will the Minister say whether the MAS was or was not aware of these massive deals in forward contracts on the part of Pan-El? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, regarding the Stock Exchange itself, the Minister said that it is self-regulatory. Are we to understand that the MAS had no one on the Committee of the Stock Exchange of Singapore? Although the Minister said that they were not obliged to submit reports, will he say whether the MAS was exercising any supervision at all over how the market was operated by the Committee? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has occurred to me that since the SES is a market for both Singapore securities and Malaysian securities, has the Minister for Finance consulted his \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> counterpart in Malaysia in moving the Securities Industry Act? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask one more question? May I ask why if the new Securities Industry Act was already drafted by May of last year, it was not presented to Parliament and then sent to a Select Committee so that the SES Committee could make its representations? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, may I ask one more question? One of the reasons for the Pan Electric fiasco was obviously the fact that there was insufficient corporate disclosure. Would the Minister consider introducing legislation to require companies to disclose more frequently and timelier their corporate debts? And would he also require the companies to submit audited accounts on a more regular basis than is required at present? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister has said that forward trading was not an infringement of the law, but does MAS realize that people from across the Causeway were using this method to raise funds where they were unable to do so, or at least not at the level from banks? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I would take the questions in turn. I hope I have got all of them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the question from the Member for Whampoa. Why was not the Securities Industry Act introduced much earlier? I think the reason was, in the earlier days, the SES was under a self-regulatory system which was operating quite sensibly and so there appeared to be no immediate requirement to tighten the rules, in the sense that the stockbroking business is different from banks. You do not have deposits of money under fiduciary responsibilities. Technically speaking, a stockbroker is no more than a commission agent. So if they had confined their activity to collecting commissions, none of this would have happened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago, the MAS, as a result of instability in the financial system worldwide, embarked on a major programme of reform for the legislation in the Singapore financial system. Over this period, we have in fact passed amendments to the Acts - the Banking Act, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Monetary Authority of Singapore Act, the Companies Act, Finance Companies Act. Wehave created SIMEX in order to regularize gold trading, and we have issued proper guidelines for merchant banks. The remaining pieces of legislation would have included amongst them three: firstly, the Securities Industry Act, the Insurance Companies Act which is now being passed at Second Reading today, and finally the Futures Trading Act. With the completion of all these changes in legislation, I think we will be well placed to withstand future shocks in the financial system. Unfortunately, because the Stock Exchange was a relatively small component of the financial system, it was left to the tail-end of the process. In retrospect, we should have brought it forward. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question regarding foreign ownership, the figure of 8% was a result of surveys conducted by the share registry on companies' ownership, entitlement. So wherever we can, we try to identify holdings. There is a problem, of course, of holding companies where the exact ownership can be a little uncertain. So that figure could be not totally correct, regrettably. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the linking of the SES and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and the fact that some of the manipulation originated from Malaysian sources, the way to stop it would be when we pass this new Securities Industry Act which, as you will see from the provisions, would impose a number of prudential controls on the stockbroking community which will stop any imprudent speculation on financing. And also it will allow the MAS to have direct access to stockbrokers books and demand information along lines of the powers which MAS now has in obtaining access to banking information. I think, if properly implemented, this should effectively stop such malpractices. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question from the Member for Alexandra, should we not allow more companies to be listed. I think there are quite a large number of companies already in the pipeline, waiting for listing. I do not think we should ease listing requirements unduly because we want only good companies to be on the Exchange. However, for the more speculative companies, we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are considering a second register which would impose less restrictions, provided the investing public recognize that the companies on this register are more speculative. It is hoped that this can be implemented sometime this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of corporate disclosures, this is indeed one of the ways to stop manipulation not by the Stock Exchange but by unscrupulous directors who are responsible for the management of public companies. That is one of the biggest problems one faces and corporate disclosures will indeed help in this direction. However, I should make the point that investors with their shares in public companies should pay a great deal more attention to the management of these companies and ask many more questions, and particularly press their auditors to ask questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question from the Member for Anson, I think the first question was investigation into insider trading in Pan-El. Indeed, I think this took place in early 1985 and this was reported through, I think, anonymous letters of complaint from people inside the company. The matter was referred to the Stock Exchange Committee for investigation, which was the proper procedure in those days at that time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The result? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The result was inconclusive as a lot of insider trading provisions are difficult to implement because the self-regulatory system does not permit the Stock Exchange Committee to demand books or to call witnesses to testify. The new Securities Industry Act would give MAS considerably more powers to investigate matters of this type. As a result the conclusions were, I think, not only this one, but many other insider trading investigations came to nought simply because there was insufficient evidence to permit prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was: was MAS aware of massive forward dealings? The answer is yes, except that we did not know the size of these share dealings involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> In fact, it came to the attention of the MAS as early as February 1985 as a result of an anonymous complaint or complaints regarding the Alfa-Pacific stockbroking company. Again, because of the self-regulatory system, the complaints directed to the MAS were referred to the SES Committee for investigations. Unfortunately, again the investigations were inconclusive and the answer given to MAS was that forward contract trading was not prohibited by SES rules. And at that time, MAS had no powers to interfere in these regulations. Hence, the need for a new Securities Industry Act. Although we were aware at that time of the presence of forward dealings, we were unaware of the pervading nature of these large contracts amongst a number of brokers. And we could not be aware of this because the SES was not obliged and, in fact, did not supply any form of returns to the MAS. Again, a defect of our regulatory system which I think one has to admit now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was: did MAS have anyone on the SES Committee? The answer is no. The SES Committee is made up entirely of stockbrokers, no outsiders either. And this is one of the facts which the MAS was very unhappy with and prompted a review of the regulations which led to the drafting of the new Securities Industry Act because it was patently difficult for brokers to regulate themselves where self-interest was involved. It is a totally contradictory situation which is very difficult to resolve. Although it has been commonly used and quite successfully in other parts of the world, particularly in UK, this is one of the reasons why we continue to allow it here because there were no obvious transgressions until recent years. It may be that we should have imposed regulations earlier but it is often easy to be wise after the event. Although we and the MAS have been accused of being far too tough on regulations, this is one area where perhaps we will want to toughen up, in time anyway. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the Securities Industry Bill which was drafted not implemented? I think the reasons were that the draft was circulated to brokers in end May/early June last year and the complaints were vociferous because they saw that this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> would tie their hands and would impose regulations. And there was generally the fear that MAS would again, like people accuse us of doing, introduce overkill. As a result, we had to go back to them and talk extensively and it is this consultative process which makes introduction of legislation time consuming. We could, of course, have rammed it through but you can imagine the uproar which would have occurred had it taken place. We would have been accused for different reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Rochore's question. Has MAS consulted Malaysia on amendments to the Securities Industry Act? We have not consulted our counterparts in Malaysia directly on the changes although we have kept them informed. Our understanding is that Malaysia also intends to introduce legislative changes probably around April this year. Their provisions are not dissimilar to ours. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question of the Member for Potong Pasir. Indeed, now that we know the size of the contracts, it is quite evident that this was a device used by some speculators as a source of fund raising. And this is the reason why it has now been stopped by the supervisory committee and will not be allowed under the rules of the new Securities Industry Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, a few supplementary questions. From the Ministerial Statement and the Minister's reply, it is obvious that there are three sets of problems that we have to contend with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the regulation of the Stock Exchange, and hopefully the new Bill would take care of the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is foreign manipulation, and here is the difficult part because most people who buy stocks for speculation do not bother to have them registered at all. So going to the Registrar of Companies to find out who owns what stock is a waste of time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part which needs attention is the disclosure by company directors to their auditors and to the authority in question. Obviously, the difficulty in the case of Pan-El stems from the fact that forward trading was not reported to the auditors at all. I do not know the law at all, whether \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they are liable to criminal prosecution, but obviously there is a loophole there that needs to be closed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister on these forward contracts whether he agrees that, in accepting these forward contracts, the stockbroking companies were advancing monies against the shares deposited with them and they were charging premium which, for all practical purposes, was interest on the monies advanced. And the rates for the interest were excessive in some cases. Has the MAS or the Government considered whether there have been violations of the Moneylenders Act? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> First, the question from the Member for Whampoa in regard to the three problems involved. Regulations, as I said, will be covered under the new Act. Foreign manipulations, it is difficult to trace. Indeed this is a problem although I would point out that it is not necessarily foreign manipulation. I think Singaporeans are equally capable of manipulations. So it is a general problem. Disclosure by directors and reporting to the auditors, that is indeed something which is being looked into - whether the auditors might not be more liable for not, in fact, getting all the facts to the attention of the shareholders. It is not a local problem. It is a world-wide problem. I think there have been a lot of suits involving auditors and directors for mismanagement. It is a complex and difficult problem. One of the provisions of the new Securities Industry Act will be to require auditors to report much more fully on all matters of interest to shareholders. This is similar to the provision under the Banking Act. This requirement is a Singapore innovation and initially it received quite adverse publicity. But now it is beginning to be generally accepted by regulatory authorities world-wide including, I think, both the UK and Hong Kong. External auditors are now required to report much more fully on the affairs of the companies which they are auditing. In this connection, I think the responsibility of directors is important. The matter is, in fact, under investigation. In the case of Pan-El, it is by the Commercial Affairs Investigation Department of the Ministry of Finance. When violations of the Companies Act or the Securities Industry Act \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are discovered, the law will take its normal course. Unfortunately, in the case of Pan-El, one of the directors is no longer in Singapore and he is currently being looked for by Interpol. Without his presence, investigation into the affairs of Pan-El is very difficult but nevertheless it is being done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of forward contracts, the matter is being investigated by the supervisory committee and if there are any violations, they will be attended to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SECURITIES INDUSTRY BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Reading \n  <br>12.38 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intitled \"An Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to the securities industry and for purposes connected therewith and to repeal the Securities Industry Act 1973 (No. 17 of 1973) and section 158 of the Companies Act (Chapter 185 of the Revised Edition)\".

Jayakumar (Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is related to the other two Bills, namely, the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill and the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill. The amendments in these Bills are being \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enacted at the request of the Judiciary. Their main purpose is to increase the jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts. At the opening of the Legal Year in 1985, the Chief Justice disclosed that the High Court had to cope with well over 100% increase in workload over the last five years. He also stated that the Courts will not be able to maintain the present waiting periods between the setting down and trial if the lower Courts' jurisdiction is not increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the provisions of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill, Sir, the last time that the civil jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts was increased was in 1976 when the jurisdiction of a District Court was extended from $5,000 to $10,000 and that of a Magistrate's Court from $1,000 to $2,000. The very considerable increase in the number of cases filed in the High Court in the last few years has resulted in a corresponding increase in the waiting period between the date of setting down and the date of trial of an action in the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will further increase the monetary limit of the civil jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts and thereby help to ease the congestion in the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will increase the civil jurisdiction of a District Court from $10,000 to $50,000 in respect of actions founded on contract or tort and actions for recovery of money under any written law. In respect of actions for the recovery of immovable property, the Bill will increase the jurisdiction of a District Court to try such actions where the annual value of the property does not exceed $50,000 or the rent payable does not exceed $48,000 a year or $4,000 a month. The limit of the probate jurisdiction of a District Court is also being extended from $50,000 to $250,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed increase in the jurisdiction of the District Courts will enable many cases presently dealt with by the High Court to be transferred to the District Courts where they can be dealt with more expeditiously. An additional number of District Judges will be appointed to deal with the corresponding increase in the work-load of the District Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister indicated in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, the purpose of this Bill and the other two Bills that follow is to reduce the workload on the High Court and to reduce the time lag between the setting down of a case and its hearing in court. Mr Speaker, Sir, we support any measures to reduce the time delay in the hearing of cases. It has been said that delayed justice is no justice and that it is important, especially for the business community, that cases should be heard and dealt with as expeditiously as possible. But what I am worried about, Mr Speaker, Sir, is, the shifting of the delay from the High Court to the Subordinate Courts. Now, the waiting time in the High Court is about 18 months to two years before a case can be heard. The waiting time in the Subordinate Courts, Sir, is seven to eight months from the date when dates are taken for the hearing of cases. But invariably three or four months would elapse, perhaps not as many as three to four months but at least two months, would elapse before dates are assigned for a hearing. So you have in the Subordinate Courts at the moment a waiting period of almost a year (11 months to 12 months) for a case to be heard from the date a summons is presented to the Subordinate Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the Registrar of the Supreme Court, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I think it was also mentioned by the Honourable the Chief Justice at the opening of the Legal year that about 60% of the cases that have been listed for hearing in the High Court relate to claims under $50,000 and that they would be transferred to the Subordinate Courts once this Bill becomes law. That is going to increase the load of the Subordinate Courts to a considerable extent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad for the assurance made by the Minister that there will be steps taken to increase the number of District Judges and the Courts. This assurance was also given by the Honourable the Chief Justice at the opening of the Legal year. But may we know from the Minister a bit more about the increase in the personnel and the courts? It seems to me that we probably will need as many more District Judges as we have at the moment. Does the Minister think that there will be appointed as many \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more District Judges as there are at the moment? And do we have the court rooms for these District Judges? Perhaps the Minister could elaborate a little bit further on the measures that will be taken to increase the personnel and the court rooms in the Subordinate Courts. Because, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the result is simply to move the delay from the High Court to the Subordinate Courts, we are getting nowhere, and it will be discrimination against the smaller claims in favour of the larger claims. I do not see why the smaller claims should be discriminated just because they are under $50,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one aspect on which I wish to speak, Mr Speaker, Sir. The other aspect is perhaps of far more importance, and that is, about the appointment and tenure of District Judges under our Judicial system. Mr Speaker, Sir, the increase in the jurisdiction that is now being offered to District Judges under the Bill is five-fold. Their jurisdiction is being increased from $10,000 to $50,000. They are more or less, if I may say so, being equated to the High Court Judges. Their appointment, their promotion, transfer and discipline,is at the moment vested in the Legal Service Commission. Under the Constitution, the Legal Service Commission is the body responsible for the appointment, promotion, transfer and discipline of Legal officers. And District Judges come under the Legal Service of the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice is the Head of the Legal Service Commission, and the next member of the Commission is the Attorney-General. After that, we have the Chairman of the Public Service Commission. Then we have a Judge and then not exceeding two other members of the Public Service Commission. So we have a Legal Service Commission that is predominantly composed of persons who are outside the Judicial Service. The Attorney-General is not a part of the Judicial Service. He is, in fact, a part of the Government, the Executive. The Judicial officers are just the Chief Justice and the one other Judge who is appointed by the Chief Justice to sit on the Legal Service Commission. They are responsible for the promot- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ion, appointment, transfer and discipline of District Judges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have several times in this House and outside tried to impress the supreme importance of the principle that the Judiciary must be seen to be immune from the displeasure of the Executive. In other words, they must be seen to be completely independent of any pressure from the Executive. That is cardinal in any administration of justice. If that principle is lost sight of, and there is a feeling that the Judiciary is not completely immune from the displeasure of the Executive, then, Mr Speaker, Sir, you have an erosion of confidence in the administration of justice in the country. And if you have an erosion of confidence, then it could only prove disastrous for the society in which justice is being administered. It is of the utmost cardinal importance that the Judiciary and not just the High Court but also the Subordinate Courts are seen to be immune from the displeasure of the Executive so that they may administer justice according to law and according to their conscience,without any fear of any displeasure from the Executive. But this is not possible, Mr Speaker, Sir, if they are aware that their appointment, their promotion, their transfer, depends not just on the Chief Justice and the Judge of the Supreme Court, but depend on whether the Attorney-General considers they are good enough or not; whether the Chairman of the Public Service Commission considers they are good enough or not; and whether the other two members of the Public Service Commission consider they are good enough or not. So there will be a tendency, and you cannot help it, for the District Judges to look over their shoulders and to worry whether they will be, in the discharge of their functions, incurring the displeasure of the Attorney-General or the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this has more poignance or significance when we come to the administration of criminal law and criminal justice in this country. I know there is another Bill which relates to the increase in the jurisdiction of the District Courts in the administration of criminal justice, and I will speak further on this when we debate that Bill. But I would \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> commend to this Government that it is high time we took another look at our judicial system, particularly the Judiciary. I am not talking simply of the High Court but also of the Subordinate Courts. As I said, the District Judges, under the new Bill, are being given considerable jurisdiction, jurisdiction which has until today, or until this Bill becomes law, been exercised by Judges of the Supreme Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, Mr Speaker, Sir, the position is quite different. I do not know what the present jurisdiction of the county court judges in England is, but I venture to think that, with the increase in the jurisdiction granted to our District Judges under this Bill, our District Judges will probably have more jurisdiction than the county court judges. In England the county court judges are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor, although he may be a Member of the Cabinet, wears, as has been said, three hats, and one of these hats is as Lord Chancellor. He acts independently of the Cabinet and they have a long tradition in this. The Lord Chancellor alone is responsible for the appointment of the judiciary - the High Court, the County Courts, the Crown Courts - and there can be no suggestion of any pressure, or influence, by the Executive or from the Government. I would commend to the Government that they should consider very seriously now creating a subordinate judicial service, particularly for the District Judges. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I do not know whether I mentioned this morning that, as it stands at the moment, the District Judges, being \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> members of the Legal Service, are freely transferable from serving as District Judges to either the AG's Chambers or to any other Government department. I mentioned, Mr Speaker, Sir, the position in England and was commending to the Government that it is time we thought of setting up a Judicial Service for Subordinate Courts; and if that is not considered necessary for all the Judicial officers in the Subordinate Courts, at least for the District Judges. We could have within that service itself avenues for promotion in that service and finally elevation to the High Court Bench. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a provision in the Constitution for the protection of the Supreme Court Judges. They may not be removed except for cause, either for misconduct or infirmity or whatever reason. They may also not be removed unless their case has been referred to a tribunal consisting of Judges, and for this purpose the President is empowered to recruit Judges from the Commonwealth. Forgive me that I should be talking about the British system and the Commonwealth. I hope I would not be accused of being an Anglo-phile but our judicial system stems from the British system, and this is why I refer to it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be necessary, and I would commend it to the Government, that there should be a similar restriction placed on the removal of District Judges from their posts. This would then guarantee their tenure and make them less apprehensive about their future in the Service and to enable them the better to discharge their functions as judicial officers without any worry in their mind but to do their best according to their conscience. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other point, and that is about the quality of District Judges. May it not be said or may it not be thought for one moment that I am trying to detract from the quality of our present District Judges, but their jurisdiction will be increased, as I said, fivefold. Under the present Act, the only qualification is that they should have five years as a qualified person either in practice or in the Legal Service. The Government may consider the time has come perhaps to increase the period before qualified persons qualify \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> themselves to be appointed District Judges. I see that in England even the Registrars of the County Courts have to have at least seven years' experience before the Lord Chancellor appoints anyone to the post. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, finally, of course, there is the question of remuneration. If we are going to create a service exclusively for District Judges, then we have to see that they attract the best men into that service and that they be paid not excessively but adequately so that they may not feel the need to look to other pastures but will be quite content to stay within that service until retirement or until elevation to the High Court Bench. I would ask the Minister and the Government to give these matters their consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not much experience in the law and neither have I any personal experience in appearing before the Subordinate Courts as the Member for Anson does. But can I take this opportunity to seek some clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of this Bill, does it mean that if, for instance, some political party owes us Members of Parliament money as a result of a libel action or otherwise, we are able to get judgment faster and get paid sooner, and not like the former Member for Paya Lebar who has to wait for years before he can see his money? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may comment on the points raised by the Member for Anson. His first point relates to the question whether, with the passage of this Bill, the delay in hearing cases in the Supreme Court will be transferred to the Subordinate Courts. In reply, I wish to say that I have discussed this very question with the Registrar of the Supreme Court and I have been assured that this will not be the case because seven new judicial posts will be created. They have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and, in addition, six new courts will be added and these should be ready by the middle of this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his long speech on the Subordinate Courts and the District Judges, it really boils down to this. In his view the Magistrates and District Judges are appointed, transferred, and emplaced by the Judicial and Legal Service Commission, and that although the Judicial and Legal Service Commission has a special place in our Constitution,and although it is chaired by no other than the Chief Justice, he is against the system because he considers that it is not immune from the displeasure of the Executive. This is, of course, an innuendo that the District Courts and District Judges are not independent, a view which was pervaded not long ago, as Members will recall, by a newspaper, the Asian Wall Street Journal, and which led to contempt proceedings, a view for which the person responsible for the Asian Wall Street Journal apologized to the Court. So I need not say anything more except to add that this system of Subordinate Court Judges being appointed by the Legal Service Commission chaired by the Chief Justice has been in operation for a very long time. It has worked satisfactorily and there are no good reasons why we should change that now, notwithstanding what the Member for Anson has said. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has referred on many occasions during his speech to the system in the United Kingdom, and he has pointed out that County Court Judges in the United Kingdom are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor in England is a Member of the Cabinet. So I take it that from his approving reference to this that he would prefer the Minister for Law in Singapore to be in charge of appointment - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister not aware that I said that the Lord Chancellor wears three hats and that in his appointment of Judges he does not appoint them as a Member of the Cabinet? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> We can also give other hats to the Minister for Law to make him on par with the Lord Chancellor in England. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also commented on the quality of District Court \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Judges. I do not think it is just a question of increasing the number of years of service. It is a question whether the Legal Service Commission is able to attract the best for the District Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, his question on remuneration. This is, of course, tied up with his other point and proposal of the Subordinate Court judiciary, and therefore I need not comment on that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by the Member for Queenstown, hopefully, the answer is yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

The Bill also provides for an appeal from a decision of a Magistrate Court to the High Court in similar circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 34(1)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act is for consistency. At present no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal where the amount or value of the subject matter in the trial is less than $1,000.

At present a District Court has jurisdiction to try all offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed seven years or which are punishable with fine only. The Bill will extend the jurisdiction of a District Court to try all offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed 10 years. In addition, the Bill will empower a District Court to try all offences, except an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> offence punishable with death, where the Public Prosecutor applies to the Court to try any such offence and the accused has so consented to be tried. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also enhance the general power of a District Court to impose sentences of imprisonment and fine. At present a District Court can impose imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and fine not exceeding $5,000. Clause 4 of the Bill will empower a District Court, to impose imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years and a fine not exceeding $10,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill does not affect the specific jurisdiction and powers of a District Court conferred by legislation, such as the Misuse of Drugs Act, and other legislation which exceed those provided by the Criminal Procedure Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister indicated, this Bill is in line with the Bill which we have just taken through all stages, with the difference that this \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill seeks to give the District Judges greater jurisdiction in criminal cases. I wonder whether the Minister is in a position to tell us what would be the increase in the workload for District Judges in criminal cases with this amendment. How many cases would then be transferred or brought before the District Courts in excess of what they are already hearing at the moment? I make the same remarks about the need, and particularly in criminal cases, to see that cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible, and that there should be no further delay caused in the hearing of criminal cases as a result of the District Judges being overloaded with work. Criminal cases should take priority over civil cases, and I hope that that will be borne in mind by the Ministry and by the others who regulate hearings in the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I spoke on the earlier Bill and about the independence of our District Judges, I said I would have something more to say when we come to discussing this particular Bill, the Criminal \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill. And before I move on to say something more, I propose to say that more than in civil cases there is a need, a greater need, that the public should have confidence in the administration of criminal justice. If there is no confidence, or if that confidence is eroded even in a small measure, then the result would be the collapse of the society. Because if you have no faith in the administration of criminal justice which seeks to punish members of the society, then you begin to lose faith in the society itself. So it is as important as that, the administration of criminal justice. Because that, as I said, seeks to apply sanctions against members of the society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned, speaking on the other Bill, about the free transferability of District Judges from the courts to the Attorney-General's Chambers or to other departments. The Minister, in replying, would seem to dismiss the idea that there is any compulsion or there is any fear felt among District Judges about displeasing the Executive. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the beginning of 1984 a Senior District Judge, and he is the head of the Subordinate Courts, a man whose next elevation should be the High Court Bench, delivered judgment in a criminal case. Some months later, he was removed and he was transferred to the Attorney-General's Chambers. That was not a promotion. As I said a minute ago, a promotion would have been to the High Court Bench. Prior to that, two Senior District Judges (one of them in his time was not designated a Senior District Judge but was designated First Magistrate), two incumbents of that post, were elevated to the High Court Bench as permanent High Court Judges. A third one was also elevated, except that his appointment was made temporary and he held the appointment of a High Court Judge for two years at a time. I suppose, for completeness sake, I should mention there was another transfer of an incumbent of that post to the Attorney-General's Chambers to a post which was higher than the post that he was occupying as Senior District Judge. He went there as Acting Solicitor-General or may even be to the substantive post of Solicitor-General. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this particular case, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Senior District Judge, a very senior \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> qualified man, was removed from that post and transferred to the Attorney-General's Chambers, to a post not higher than the post of Senior District Judge but to a post which was on level with the grade that he was then holding in the Legal Service. This is what I was talking about when I spoke on the earlier Bill. It did not need a foreign journal to say that that transfer was a demotion. May I say that many people in Singapore thought that that transfer was a demotion for that District Judge. So much for the independence of the District Judges who administer the criminal law. I would ask the Minister to consider this seriously because this is a matter which concerns the confidence of the people in the administration of criminal law and justice in this country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may elaborate further, there is another instance; perhaps I should have classified that \"the case\" is my own case. I have no personal pecuniary interest in this but I must relate my experiences in this House. In 1985, when a re-trial was ordered on one charge, the trial was originally fixed for hearing before a particular District Judge in the Subordinate Courts. That District Judge had never been in the AG's Chambers. He had had a long tenure as District Judge. But a month before the trial began, the solicitors were informed, when they appeared, that the case would be transferred to the Senior District Judge who had replaced the Senior District Judge who tried the case in 1984. And this Senior District Judge had come from the AG's Chambers. The solicitors were not told the reason except that the particular District Judge, who should have heard the case and before whom the case had been fixed originally, had been selected to attend a conference abroad. Well, I know District Judges must attend conferences, but it might be illuminating to know who decided that he should attend a conference abroad which clashed with the hearing of this case. So the result was that the case was transferred from a District Judge, who never had anything to do with the AG's Chambers, to another court where the Senior District Judge, as I said, had come not too long before that from the Attorney-General's Chambers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to have to say this, that was not the first time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> There were at least two other instances, and I know this personally. There was one case where, after a decision was given, the man was transferred. That was about four or five years ago, and there was one case much earlier than that. These decisions were not acceptable. So what independence of the Subordinate Judiciary is there if the public see these things happening? The District Judges are under threat or fear of being transferred from their posts when they administer justice, whether it is civil or criminal. That is why I say that it is important, I see it as of cardinal importance, that if we are to maintain the structure of our society as a democratic society, as a stable society, as a society in which every member can repose confidence, then the Subordinate Court Judiciary should be seen to be immune, as I said, from the displeasure of the Executive. Unfortunately, the public do not see that at the moment. The public see that the District Judges are not immune and that they may suffer the displeasure of the Executive. So whatever the Minister may say, the public have a different impression. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I wish to bring up is the question of appeals. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill, we have now increased the amount before which an appeal may be taken from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court. Previously, it was $500 and now it has been increased. So the limit for civil cases in the Subordinate Courts which bars them from appealing is $1,000 or $2,000, whatever it is. But once they go up to the High Court and, provided the claim is $2,000 or more, they can take their appeals to the Court of Appeal. And if they are still not satisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal, they can go up to the Privy Council without leave. I say \"without leave\" advisedly because it has been held by the Privy Council that the leave stipulated in the Judicial Committee Act is merely a formal leave and that there is no discretion in the Court of Appeal to refuse to grant leave in civil cases where the amount qualifies for appeal to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have a situation where a man with a $5,000 claim in the High Court can go right up all the way to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> But the position is completely different when it comes to criminal cases. And now, Members, we have just been asked to give jurisdiction to the District Judges to try criminal cases where the maximum punishment provided is 10 years. But as the Minister has pointed out, there are a number of other Acts which provide for heavier punishment than 10 years and which have given the jurisdiction to the District Judges. And, as he also pointed out, except for capital cases where the death sentence is mandatory, the District Judges may try any case provided the Public Prosecutor makes the application and the accused consents. So we have the position that District Judges can try criminal cases of great magnitude except for cases which carry the death sentence, and they can impose sentences up to seven years under the Criminal Procedure Code. But under the Misuse of Drugs Act, they can impose much more. They can put a man away for 20 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what remedies does this man have if he thinks that the conviction is wrong, that it should be looked at? At one time, Mr Speaker, Sir, in criminal cases, one could go right from the Magistrates' Courts to the Privy Council. Even a simple criminal case could be taken up to the Privy Council by a person if he thought that he had been wrongly convicted. But today, Sir, if a person is convicted in the Subordinate Courts, he may be sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, he may be sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, what remedy has he got? It is not that he has not got any remedy. He can appeal under the Criminal Procedure Code to the High Court. It goes before a single Judge of the High Court. There is a provision in the Criminal Procedure Code which provides that if the Public Prosecutor requests, it can be put before three Judges or if the Judge himself thinks it should go before three Judges, it can be put before three Judges. But normally it goes to a single Judge. So we have an appeal from one District Judge and now we are giving him jurisdiction almost equivalent to the High Court Bench, from him to another single High Court Judge and it stops there. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should qualify that and I will qualify it. There is a provision in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which provides that an accused, after he has been convicted in the Subordinate Courts and has appealed to the High Court and has his appeal dismissed, may apply to the Judge who heard the appeal to refer questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal. He may apply and the Judge who heard the appeal himself has to decide whether he would allow the reference on the questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal. And if the Judge refuses to refer the questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the man cannot take his case up to the Court of Criminal Appeal. But, and this is where it is so unequal in this society, Members of this House, if the Public Prosecutor asks the High Court Judge - for example, if the High Court Judge should allow the appeal and acquit the man - to refer the questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal, then the Judge has no discretion. He must refer those questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and so the Court of Criminal Appeal becomes seized of the matter and there it can be heard by three Judges sitting together and deliberating on the matter. But an accused person has not got that right. This is why I said the administration of the criminal law and justice here would appear to be unequal. It is weighted in favour of the Prosecution and it discriminates against an accused's remedies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much to be said for a two-tier system of appeal. I think it is important, particularly in the serious criminal cases where a person is tried before a District Court and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment or five years' imprisonment. We are concerned with the man's liberty. Do we equate his liberty to below $2,000? We allow an appeal to the Privy Council in civil claims for $2,000 but a man who is sentenced to seven years' imprisonment may not appeal. Is that the price we put on a man's liberty? Is that the value we attach to the freedom of the individual? We should think about this. Why this undue preference for monetary claims and not enough attention being paid to the claims of liberty and freedom of the individual in this country? The only thing we can do about this is to provide automatically a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> right of appeal for an accused person, who has his appeal from a Subordinate Court dismissed by the High Court Judge, to the Court of Criminal Appeal. I know the answer may come from the Minister that in that case the Court of Criminal Appeal will be inundated. There will be so many appeals coming in. Every accused person will want to have another bite. But why not, if he thinks it should be looked at again. One answer to this fear that the Court of Criminal Appeal may be inundated with appeals if that is allowed would be to restrict appeals from the decision of a High Court Judge sitting on an appeal from the Subordinate Court to appeals which raise substantive questions of law. This can be done where the Counsel certifies that there are questions of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that the Minister is perhaps aware that the Court of Criminal Appeal itself has the power to dismiss summarily any appeals if it thinks there are no substantive questions of law involved and all are pure questions of fact. 0So there is enough power in the courts to administer this, so that the Court of Criminal Appeal is not inundated with criminal appeals from all and sundry persons. But what is important is that the administration of criminal law and justice should be seen to be done fairly and to protect the individual and that he is not harshly prevented from seeking his remedies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned the provision in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which provides for reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal. I said that it was purely left to the appellate judge to decide whether he should refer the questions to the Court of Criminal Appeal. I asked the Registrar of the Supreme Court if he would let me have the number of cases since the provision was enacted in which reference was permitted by the appellate judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal. He said he was unable to give me the number of cases. But I know myself over the past few years that most of the applications were refused so that the accused had no further way of testing his convictions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is also to be found in the Malaysian Supreme Court of Judicature Act. The Minister may be aware that in 1982 or so the Malaysian Parliament \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> amended that provision to enable an accused person who has his appeal dismissed by the High Court to make an application, not to the judge who heard the case but to the Federal Court, as it was then known, for the questions to be brought before it. That is an improvement so that the three judges then can decide whether those questions are questions that should be brought before them and not left to the decision of the judge who tried the appeal himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have taken up your time, but I would urge the Minister to give consideration to this. As I said, it is important that in our administration of criminal law and criminal justice, we should be seen to be acting fairly, and that the scales are held fairly between the prosecutor and the accused, that the Prosecution is not given undue advantage over the accused. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code and the Subordinate Courts Act is to increase the jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts. The reason is there are too many cases in the High Courts. By bringing over the cases to the Subordinate Courts, the number of court houses and the judges there will have to be increased. I wonder if the Minister could tell us whether, to solve this problem, the Government is considering increasing the number of Judges in the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to reply to the Member for Potong Pasir, it will be helpful if he is present in the House in the discussion of the Bills in which he has an interest.

Replying to the Member for Anson, I do not have the figures for the criminal cases which would be now going to the Subordinate Courts, but I understand that they are in the minority and the majority of cases would be the civil cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rest of what he has said, it is in fact a regurgitation of what he said in the Second Reading of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill. Although he has made a long speech on the importance of appeals and administration of justice, clearly, Sir, his is a jaundiced view. For when he talks of the views of the public, what he really refers to is his own views. And his own views cannot be taken seriously or completely impartially here, for as he himself has said, that he is an involved party in the cases which he has referred to in this House. The Judge whom he refers to was involved in the case in which the Member for Anson was a party. So how can he expect this House to take his views as being serious. And really, Mr Speaker, Sir, he has decided who is fit for promotion and who is not fit for promotion. He says that particular Judge should have - this is his own words - \"should have been promoted.\" I do not know. I do not sit on the Legal Service Commission. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Minister for some reason known to himself clearly wants to completely misunderstand what I said. I did not say \"he should have been\". I said \"if he were to be promoted, the next promotion would have been the High Court Bench\". I did not say, \"You should have promoted him to the High Court Bench.\" Please try and follow what I said. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was taking notes up to a point after which I gave up, and I made it a point to put in quotes his words that this particular Judge \"should have been promoted\" had his transfer not taken place. I do not know. He may be worthy of promotion, he may not be. But these are, as I have said, matters for the Legal and Judicial Service Commission headed by the Chief Justice, and I would leave it to them to take the decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made a second point that all these transfers which he referred to were because the decisions were not acceptable. This is a statement which he should justify here as to how he comes to the conclusion without mentioning how many other transfers there have been in the past year, two years or three years. As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, these views of the Member for Anson, which he presents to the members of the public, is a jaundiced view of a person who has not had satisfaction in the courts as he would have liked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to appeals, he spent a great deal of time talking about appeals. I have one very simple question. How many countries are there in the world that he can refer to where there are appeals to the Privy Council in criminal and civil cases? I would like him to mention them, other than Singapore. That is the litmus test of our judicial system's independence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I have to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply because the vast majority of the points that he has made are not related to the contents of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered my question yet.

And if the Member for Anson or the Member for Potong Pasir have names to suggest to us, other than themselves, I will be willing to put it to the Prime Minister if there is such a suitable person. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister has asked me to reply to his point about which countries provide for appeals to the Privy Council in criminal matters.

So here you do not provide it. We have to go to the Privy Council for permission before we can take an appeal to it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister wants to know how many other countries provide for appeals to the Privy Council. Hong Kong is one. There are a number of other countries which still retain the Judicial Committee's Appeal. But the point is this. Would the Minister tell the House in how many countries does an appeal stop with the first appeal? And in how many countries does an appeal stop with the first appeal? Would the Minister tell this House in how many countries does the Public Prosecutor have an unqualified right of appeal from an acquittal? Would he tell us that? Would he also tell us in how many countries does the Public Prosecutor have a second right of appeal, as I told the House, in this provision, from the appellate judge's decision if the Public Prosecutor requests it? Will the Minister answer those questions? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to prolong this debate.

The body corporate of each estate would comprise all owners of the HUDC flats in the estate. The Act came into operation on 31st August 1984. So far, no body corporate has yet been constituted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the body corporate under the HUDC Estates Act are similar to those of the management corporations of private condominiums set out in the Land Titles (Strata) Act. The HUDC Phases I and II estates are different only in that the common property remains in the ownership of the HDB, the lessor. Several HUDC resident associations have made representations requesting that the common property be given over to them so that they may be placed on the same footing as owners of private flats. The Ministry of National Development has looked into the request and is agreeable to giving over the common property to the flat owners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HUDC Housing Estates (Amendment) Bill seeks to bring this into effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The Bill allows the HDB to lease the common property to flat owners of each estate as tenants-in-common. The lease will be for a nominal sum of $1 and for a term which runs concurrently with the leasehold term of their flats. All flat owners shall be deemed to have accepted the lease when it has been executed by the Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill further seeks to empower the Minister to amend the First Schedule of the Act which describes the land on which the HUDC estates are located. New HUDC estates may be included in the First Schedule in future for bodies corporate to be formed to manage these estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reflect a more intensive use of the common areas by the commercial units, the Bill requires owners of commercial units in an HUDC estate to pay twice the amount of the maintenance charges payable by owners of residential units. Other minor amendments in the Bill deal with the imposition of a penalty for breach of by-laws governing the running of the housing estates and the appointments and resignations of office bearers of the management committee of a body corporate. These amendments will help to ensure the proper management of the HUDC estates by the bodies corporate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Teh Cheang Wan].

But I am wondering whether, in fact, this is the right thing to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in effect, such a clause gives a blanket insurance to people who work for the MRTC or for our statutory boards. It actually means that should a mishap occur a victim cannot seek recourse against the erring person except against the Corporation. Sir, let me give an example. If an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> accident involving a train should occur, the victim or the family of the victim can only sue the Corporation and cannot sue the train driver for negligence because this clause would bar the victim or the family of the victim from seeking such a wide course of action. I am afraid such a clause might give a false sense of security to the people who work for the MRTC, and it might make them less conscious of the regulations governing safety which is of particular concern especially at a time when we are trying to inculcate safety consciousness. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for Alexandra for his concern on the subject of safety.

I am not sure how Members want to speak on these Bills. It may be better for the adjoining issues for discussion to be on the first Bill, although Members need not be precluded from speaking on the other two Bills, as I will be outlining the rationale in my speech on this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments are really a response to an issue of public interest and a response to voluminous public complaints and outcry. I think all Members are aware of the problem which illegal mini-turf clubs pose to the public and to the residents in our HDB estates. Large crowds gather at coffee shops and hawker centres on days when there are races. The proliferation of the illegal mini-turf clubs in housing estates has given rise to concern on the part of residents, concern that has been expressed in various forums, including this House. What is the impact of illegal mini-turf clubs? It has an adverse impact on the quality of life and on the environment in HDB estates particularly. It has ruined the residential environment. It has an unsavoury and an unpleasant effect on the residents, most of whom are law-abiding and want to live in peace and security. The crowds which gather and operators of illegal mini-turf clubs not only frequent the premises but also spill over into corridors and even staircases of the HDB blocks. Members of the public have experienced feelings of insecurity and anxiety and a sense of lawlessness is created. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year that has just ended, 1985, more than 1,750 complaints have been received by the Police from individuals as well as organizations, and including Members of Parliament; and more than 50 complaints from RCs and CCCs, urging action to be taken. Is it for want of enforcement action by the Police? No, Sir. The Police have taken action, and in 1985 more than 11,000 raids were conducted. Persons were arrested. But the problem is that there are serious deficiencies in our laws, laws which are subject to amendment today. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically three inadequacies in the law. One is that the penalties which are prescribed in the legislation have not been revised for more than a quarter century. And, therefore, this has made it not a deterrent and the operators of the illegal mini-turf clubs therefore operate without scant regard for the law. Second, there is no offence for running a betting information centre. I shall later distribute a photograph which will give Members an idea of what is the set-up in a betting information centre. Thirdly, Sir, the way in which these mini-turf clubs are conducted. The use of paraphernalia is such that documentary evidence is very difficult to obtain. So these amendments, therefore, are designed to respond to this problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that this was last raised in this House in early 1985 and I then gave assurance that the matter would be studied in a comprehensive manner. I outlined some of the problems, the inadequacies in the law, and that my Ministry would be presenting legislation later on to tackle this problem. The amendments, therefore, seek to meet this problem and to close the gaps in the laws which are referred to. I would like to stress that no new offences are created except for the offence of running a betting information centre and of obstructing police officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now turn to some of the amendments. First, with regard to the penalties. The proposed amendments are aimed primarily at the gambling operators. To deter the bookmakers and their agents, the existing penalties for various categories of gambling offences are enhanced, including the imposition of mandatory prison sentences for those concerned with the management or business of a common betting house or a betting information centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the amendment proposes measures against betting information centres. Mini-turf clubs depend on betting information centres to provide information on race results. At present, there are no specific provisions in the law under which persons involved in the running of betting information centres can be prosecuted. It is therefore proposed to amend the Bet- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ting Act to introduce specific provisions to deal with the problem of betting information centres and against those involved in the running of such centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as definitions are concerned, clause 2 of the Bill introduces certain new definitions and refines the interpretation section. In particular, it has included the definition of a betting information centre which is essentially a place \"kept or used for receiving or transmitting by telephone or other means any information relating to any horse-race or other sporting event for the purpose of betting or wagering in contravention of this Act.\" Such betting information centres are a recent development and are not covered in the Act. They are crucial in the illegal bookmaking network in that they supply mini-turf clubs and bookmakers with information on race results. The other new definitions are those of \"equipment\", \"sporting event\" and \"telecommunication system\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrust of these amendments is against the operators of these mini-turf clubs. Enhanced punishments will be introduced for these offences. The maximum fines will be increased significantly and there will also be minimum fines to ensure that the sentences are adequate as a deterrent. For instance, offences like bookmaking, running a common betting house and operating a betting information centre will carry a fine ranging from $20,000 to $200,000 and mandatory imprisonment which may extend to five years. Although illegal gambling operators will now face these minimum fines as well as mandatory imprisonment, those who use their facilities, the punters, will not similarly face mandatory imprisonment upon conviction. Instead, clause 5 only amends section 5 of the Act dealing with punters who indulge in illegal betting or wagering and provides for an enhanced penalty of a fine up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to six months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards presumptions, the Common Gaming Houses Act as well as this Betting Act have always contained presumption clauses. These pertain to offences like accepting or receiving stakes, dealing in lottery tickets as well as in situations where premises are presumed to be common gaming or betting houses. However, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> some of these presumptions have been overtaken by the increasingly sophisticated modern illegal gambling operations. They have to be brought up to date. A presumption clause has also to be introduced to deal with betting information centres which are crucial to mini-turf club operations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, could I kindly request the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a photograph. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of photograph distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police have found difficulty in prosecuting operators of common betting houses and betting information centres because the operators have devised ingenious measures to destroy evidence and frustrate the Police. The presumptions rely on the evidence of gambling paraphernalia to prove that a place is used as a common betting house or betting information centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the presumption for a betting information centre, a place will be presumed to be a betting information centre if it has three or more telephones or telephone lines and it satisfies one of the following conditions: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It is installed with a telecommunication equipment which is arranged in such a way as to suggest that it is being used for the receiving or transmitting of information relating to horse racing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A person within the place is found destroying records of results or dividends payable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Two or more telephone calls were received at the place enquiring about results, commentary or dividends payable. The owner or occupier of the place is presumed to be aware of its use as a betting information centre and anyone found therein is presumed to be assisting in the business of the betting information centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other presumption clauses. As I said, the update and refine of the presumptions are to be found in the existing legislation. I would like to stress that all these presumptions are rebuttable and will not apply if the accused person can provide a reasonable explanation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, this is a problem which has plagued residents in HDB estates. Residents have complained and asked for action to be taken. Action was taken but because of the inadequacies in the law, they did not have the desired deterrent effect. I think it is time for us to take action and that is the purport of these Bills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am basically not a gambler. I do not have any fondness for any form of gambling. I do not like to see my hard earned money taken away from me, neither do I welcome money which comes the easy way. However, I must also confess that I am not entirely stainless and innocent in this particular form of human vice. From time to time, I would have a go at the Singapore Stock Exchange known by many to be the biggest casino of all in Singapore. But that is more for the fun and the excitement of it than for actually making money; the idea being to prove that I am not a born loser and that I too could be as smart as the economist and the city analyst in making forecasts and investment decisions. But I would be boasting if I said that I was making money from the Exchange all the time. Only the other day, I had the misfortune of backing the SIA at the wrong time. I applied for and was actually allotted a few thousand shares. For weeks I have been licking my wounds when its price plunged below the issue price. But now I learn that my fortune has turned and that the SIA is finally taking off. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal horse betting and 4-digit gambling have grown at an alarming speed over the years. They permeate every nook and corner of Singapore. I fully support the argument that this form of gambling, if uncontrolled, would erode and finally destroy the moral fabric of our society and turn our people into a mass of heartless and senseless human beings. It creates a deceptive sense of prosperity and wellbeing when everything is, in fact, not going on well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I became aware of this phenomenon only in the year before last when, after a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> long spell of absence from the scene of Singapore, I was asked to organize a reception party for the walkabout of the First Deputy Prime Minister in my constituency. For weeks before the event, I was touring the area quietly myself and sometimes with the CCC members. We went to the hawker centres, markets and shopping areas. We found that even on Sundays at the designated time when the walkabout was supposed to take place, these places were actually bustling with activities. People were shouting, eating, and generally enjoying themselves. So we decided to stage reception points at these very crowded places, hoping to attract the biggest possible crowd for the welcoming ceremony. I thought we could never fail. The places were so packed with people and if we threw in a few lion dances to pull in an even bigger crowd, it would be an instant success. But came the day of the walkabout, I was shocked to find that the places which I expected to be packed with people were actually deserted as if a curfew had been declared earlier on. There were only some small children running about. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my term as an MP over the last 20-odd years, I have never known these places to be so quiet and peaceful and so lack of fellow human beings. Of course, it did not mean that the First DPM and I had suddenly become unpopular overnight and that people were avoiding us like the plague. It simply meant that the bookies and the 4-digit operators who had been using these places to stage their operations had decided to pack up and declare a holiday for themselves as a gesture of respect for the walkabout. Well, whichever way you want to interpret it. And the hawkers and the shopkeepers very sensibly had also decided to cut losses and to close shop because they knew that with the bookies gone, there would be less customers to serve and they did not want to waste their time. Of course, there were red faces among us all round. But it was an eye-opener for me to see how illegal gambling had taken over and changed the daily pattern of life in the housing estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is not entirely blameless in allowing this state of affairs to develop into such a ridiculous situation. The Singapore Turf Club, of course, is the biggest culprit, without which the illegal bookies would not have a base to operate. The other arm of the Government does not help by backing the Singapore Pools Pte Ltd in setting up 4-D centres all over the island. In March last year, the Ministry of Home Affairs was reported by the Straits Times to have called in the representatives of the Turf Club and the Singapore Pools to find out ways and means of making the best out of the punters. The Turf Club's General Manager, Mr Tim Thompson, was later reported to have said that his Club would do its best to help the authorities stop the illegal betting nuisance. Nuisance? Has he got the right to say that word? His Club is causing more nuisance to the public than all the others put together. Ask any motorist who has to return home on a Saturday afternoon after work, and he will tell you the nuisance of the long traffic jam he has to endure along Bukit Timah Road when it is a race day. Ask any houseowner who has the misfortune of having his bungalow situated in the vicinity of the Turf Club, and he will tell you the nuisance he has to put up with on a race day when all accesses to his house are blocked by illegally parked motor vehicles belonging to racegoers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of dollars of public money has been spent to improve roads leading to the Club, money which should have been better spent elsewhere. If this is not nuisance, what is? And every year we witness the scene of the Chairman or President of the Club playing Santa Claus by giving away cheques to charitable organizations from money which should rightly belong to the Government because the Government gave it the franchise to run races, which is almost equivalent to the right to print money. Of course, not exactly in the way which a former Workers' Party candidate was reported to have done - printing counterfeit American dollars. Now we are faced with a very curious situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your point of order? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is simple, Mr Speaker, Sir. That report talks of a charge having been made in court. So it is sub judice, Mr Speaker, Sir. And this Member, who perhaps should know better, does not seem to know anything about this. I thought his sojourn in London might have taught him something. He refers to this case and pronounces the man guilty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> No! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not got the right of a dictator who can do what the Member for Anson said I was doing. What I merely said, and if he has the ear to listen and understand it, is that this was what was reported in the newspaper. I did not say that he was guilty or not guilty. I said that it was reported in the papers that a former Workers' Party candidate had done this. It was reported in the newspaper. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Alleged. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Well, I don't know if it is alleged. But is it true or not true that the newspaper has reported such a story? Tell me, is it true or not true that a story has been published in the Straits Times on that particular day? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Member does not seem to understand the use of English. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, let me continue. Now we are faced with a very curious situation in which we are asked to pass laws to put the small operators in the hawker centres and coffee shops under heavy fines, and even to lock them up. But at the same time the Government-backed Singapore Pools and the Singapore Turf Club are busily putting up plans to set up even more betting shops all over Singapore. If you say this is logic, then you can say that black is white and white is black and no one would want to argue with you. What I cannot understand is that when one places a bet in a hawker centre, one is perpetuating, abetting, or even potentially committing a crime. But when one does it in a Government-backed or Turf Club run betting shop, no crime is committed. There seems to be no valid explanation why one is condemned and the other is condoned. I cannot understand it. The Chinese have a proverb for this. It says: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Zhi xu zhou guan fang huo, bu zun bai xing dian deng (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) The county official can set a blaze to the town but the common people are not allowed to light even a lamp. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling like other forms of human vices such as prostitution and alcoholism, should ideally be stamped out. But we all know that it is not possible to do so unless everyone is a saint, which no one is. So we tend to adopt the next best thing to do, ie, to try to control them and prevent them from getting out of hand. In the case of prostitution, I am sure the Anti-Vice Squad knows exactly in what districts it is most prevalent. But they prefer to keep all ears open and one eye closed! They know it is a waste of time to try to track down every prostitute and every brothel keeper in town. But neither will they go hand in hand with brothel keepers to run brothels. But in the case of gambling and betting, very curiously the Government is trying to suppress them on the one hand, but it is also going hand in hand with someone to set up more betting shops on the other. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the right solution to this problem lies in proper regulation and control and, if necessary, heavy taxation, because I believe mere suppression will not work. The tragedy of human nature is such that it is always striving to seek excitement, to want to escape from the harshness of reality and to indulge in some sort of a dream. Every nation has its own form of gambling. The Spanish have their bull-fighting. The British have their races. The Filipinos and the Indonesians have their cock fighting. The Thais have their fish fighting. The Chinese have their mahjong. And even the hardworking Japanese have their pachingko. We in Singapore seem to have taken up horse racing and 4-digit betting in a big way, not, unfortunately, without some encouragement from the Government. Remember, Toto and Singapore Pools were set up for just that purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, judging from the number of people going to these illegal gambling centres, such as hawker centres, markets and provision shops, there seems to be a demand for these forms of gambling as a pastime. Otherwise, it is not possible to explain why so many people at \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a given time are prepared to endure the noise and discomfort such as we find in these places. And I do not believe there is any major swindling going on. If there is, it will soon be discovered and discredited. The worst scenario would be when someone gets too lucky and he has placed an unusually large bet and the operator cannot pay up. In that circumstance, the operator would either go bust or abscond. But usually negotiations would take place and settlement would be arrived at for a certain percentage of the winnings to be paid, to the satisfaction of all parties, and life would go on. As far as I know, not many people have been put into financial straitjackets as a result of betting in these centres, legal or otherwise. And no lifeboat fund was ever heard of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern of behaviour of a gambler is such that if he has surplus cash, or what the economist calls \"disposable income\", he would bet and cherish a dream. If he has not got the money, he would just stand by the side and watch other people make money, hoping to share in the feast that would come at the end of the session in Happy Valley or in whatever place that is in vogue at the time. In the end, as the saying goes, fools and their money are soon parted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not arguing for the merits or demerits of these illegal gambling centres. My view is that they should be closed down. But so should those run by the Turf Club and the Singapore Pools, if our policies are to be logical and consistent. But since it is not possible to do so, we will have to find a way out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that since so many people patronize these centres voluntarily and at risk of being caught red-handed and locked up, there seems to be a demand by many people for their money to be parted. If that is the case, I think it is not beyond the ingenuity of the officials in the Treasury to devise a foolproof method in which this disposable cash can be systematically and effectively skimmed off and paid into the Consolidated Fund. What I mean is that apart from the 4-digit and betting centres run by the Turf Club and the Singapore Pools, the Government may \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> consider licensing out certain places to some syndicators to run as 4-digit or horse-betting centres, at the payment, of course, of a huge licence fee by the licensee plus the payment of a large cash deposit to safeguard against defaulting, plus whatever tax we want to impose on them from time to time. This may work out to be to the satisfaction of every one. The gamblers and punters will be happy. They will eventually lose their money. I have no doubt about it. But at least they will have the satisfaction of losing it in peace and in air-conditioned comfort. Later on, when they look back in time they can always console themselves by seeing their losses turned into flyovers, expressways and parks, in which they also enjoy. We, the non-gamblers, will be happy because we will enjoy the fringe benefit of paying less tax, hopefully. The Minister for Finance will be more than happy as this move would effectively have created a new revenue source for him to tap whenever he cannot balance the books. This may prove to be one of the remedies for our present economic woes. Later on when we find the system slightly getting out of control or that the syndicators have made too much money, we can always fine-tune it by increasing the licence fee or the tax or both. What we need is to impose heavy taxes on gambling in the hope to cure the gamblers out of their habit to gamble, to throw away money. The ancient Chinese have a phrase for it, and it is contained in only four characters. It is called yu jin yu zeng, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) Impose heavy taxes in order to prohibit certain undesirable activities. Just four characters. Very economical use of words and syntax. That is what is so wonderful about Chinese characters. That is why I always tell the Parliamentary Secretary for Education not to fiddle with them too much. The four characters convey the whole concept, strategy, philosophy and policy, of dissuading, restraining and inhibiting people from doing certain anti-social acts by imposing heavy taxes on such acts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not approve of people drinking. So we impose heavy duties on liquor. We want to dissuade people from smoking. So we have heavy duties on tobacco. Similarly we impose heavy duties and taxes on petrol and the purchase of motorcars. But \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> at the moment although we do not approve of people gambling there seems to be a lack of ways, or at least the present provision is inadequate, for heavy taxes to be imposed on it to restrain people from doing so. What we are doing is simply to close down the centres, fine the operators and put them in jail if they persist. This seems to be a negative way of doing things. A vacuum will undoubtedly be created but the people's instinctive urge to gamble has yet to be satisfied. In the end, the operators would go underground or go over the Causeway to Johore Baru, if what I heard from the grapevine is correct. What we are doing is like the great prohibition in the United States. They simply closed down the breweries and locked up the brewers without satisfying the need of some people to drink. So in the end they encountered all sorts of irregularities and criminal activities, culminating in the abolition of the prohibition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said or suggested just now is nothing out of this world. It has been practised in other countries, notably in the United Kingdom. There in the main streets of any town centre, you will find bingo halls, Mecca and Ladbrooke gaming houses side by side with supermarkets and boutiques and prestigious restaurants. They call themselves bookmakers, but they do not make books. They only make money out of the punters. They also call themselves turf accountants, but they do not do accounts except fiddling theirs so that the inland revenue officers find it difficult to squeeze more tax out of them. What I have described may or may not be practicable in our environment. The Chinese may prove to be cleverer cheaters than the British and eventually life for our enforcement officers may be hell in those circumstances. But whether or not this is the right approach only time will tell, but it costs us next to nothing to explore and to find out. Some of us on this side of the House may be old. A few chips in our memory might have burst. Sometimes we forget things, sometimes we say the wrong things. But the system is basically intact. The way of thinking and finding out things is still functioning well. And not all what we say is garbage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember it was only a few months ago when the Member for Rochore first \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> suggested in this House to reduce the rate of contribution in the CPF. That drew an immediate rebuttal from the Acting Minister for Labour and there were even calls for the Member to take further tuitions on economics from the Member for Leng Kee. Now, everyone on the other side or shall I say, our side, seems to be harping on the same tune wanting to reduce the CPF contribution. I am not sure whether the Member for Rochore is giving tuition on economics. If he is, I am sure there should be no lack of pupils. \n  <br>4.24 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have the answers to the issue of gambling. My learned senior colleague, the Member for Queenstown, has given us a learned discourse and I do not intend to compete with him. Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern is the form in which gambling has taken on today and its consequences to our residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Development Board, since its inception about 25 years ago, has placed great emphasis on the planning of our HDB estates. Today more than 80% of our population are housed in these estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public housing programme has been successful because it is aimed at catering to the social and recreational needs of the residents. In addition to providing the residential units, public amenities, such as schools, food centres, markets, town centres, libraries and parks, are also provided. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that our residents will be able to adapt to high density living, high rise living, the grassroots organizations such as Block Committees, Residents' Committees, CCMCs and CCCs have been nurtured. These organizations play the important role of ensuring that the human relations factor is not neglected. Programmes such as the Police Neighbourhood Watch Scheme and our Civil Defence programmes provide for security in the neighbourhood and aims at promoting self-help in an emergency. It is this integrated approach that has led to the success of our Public Housing programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, however, one disruptive factor has appeared on the scene, namely, gambling. Initially, and these were the years when the hon. Member for Queenstown was away, this was done discreetly in public places such as the void decks, markets, coffee shops and hawker centres. Over the last two years, however, the scene has changed. What is the situation today? Large groups of people, sometimes up to 70-80 persons, now converge at various centres during the weekends on race days, to carry on what has been termed as mini-turf clubs. These public areas, eg, hawker centres or coffee shops, are no longer safe nor accessible to the public. There are many complaints from our residents, as has been mentioned by the Minister, members of the public, and even the operators of coffee shops and hawker stalls. Police raids were increased, but became increasingly ineffective because the operations are now more sophisticated. Look-outs, mainly teenagers, were employed and this is the most worrying as our young are involved. The presence of even unmarked police cars, I am told, could be detected. Sophisticated telecommunications equipment are used. These illegal activities in a nutshell are being carried out openly in total defiance of the law and with total disregard for the interest of the majority. What is emerging is the picture of organized crime. Violence and even a stabbing incident was reported. If we look at the photograph that has been provided by the Minister, it would show definitely that this is the work of organized crime. It is against this background of organized crime that one must see the new measures to combat these mini-turf clubs being introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the issue before us today? Is it an issue of whether gambling is right or wrong? The answer to me is no. The issue is one of protecting our living environment. The issue is whether we want our neighbourhood, the public places, to be safe and accessible for all to use, or whether we allow a minority, the organized syndicates, to ruin our environment for their own selfish ends. It is this transformation of the mini-turf clubs to an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> organized operation that alerts us all to the urgency and seriousness of this problem. The revision of the laws will result in severe penalties for the operators of these syndicates. For the operators, in addition to heavy fines, there will be mandatory jail sentences. It is good that mandatory jail sentence has been reserved for the operators and not for the punters, for the aim should be to wipe out the operators. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the organized nature of these operations, we can expect that there will be intimidation of coffee shop owners or stall holders to allow their premises to be used for gambling. These persons may feel helpless or fearful of organized syndicates. I urge these persons to make police reports to protect themselves and their businesses. Not to do so may implicate themselves as part of the gambling operations with very serious consequences. In return, the authorities must be forthcoming in their reassurance to all who make these reports and provide them with adequate protection. This will be a dilemma to the innocent and I seek the reassurance of the Minister of offering protection and assistance to the innocent who are intimidated. I also urge parents to exercise care in that their teenagers will not be unwittingly involved in these activities. Even the \"look-out\" boys will face mandatory jail sentences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, may I reiterate that the main aim, to my mind, of these amendments is to protect our living environment. To this end, the penalty for involvement in gambling operations now carry a mandatory jail sentence. While we aim at the \"big fish\", our law enforcement officers must be sensitive to those who face intimidation by the gambling syndicates. This will indeed be a dilemma for the innocent. I await the reassurance of the Minister in this respect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Changkat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect to the Member for Queenstown, I beg to differ from the way he presented the issue before the House, especially at the beginning of his speech. What is discussed here is not the question of the small-time operators versus the big operators. The issue is really one of what advantages or, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> put another way, what practical considerations can be made with regard to the stamping out of illegal gambling. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us here do not condone gambling and I think we are not discussing the right and wrong of gambling here. Many of us would teach our children not to gamble. We would not condone these activities. But given the fact that every nation seems to have its own game of gambling, as the Member for Queenstown has put it, and given the fact that it is extremely difficult to wipe it out, I think we have to think of some practical requirements to contain the problem. The proposed amendments to the Bill would really give the Police the enhanced power to contain the problem. But we should note that the circumstances surrounding the introduction of the amendments were not only because the Police needed more power but also because members of the public have been complaining about this problem and have been repeatedly voicing their dissatisfaction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to hear that the quality of the living environment is given so much due emphasis here, and this has not only to do with the nuisance, the littering, the gathering of crowds, the disturbance, and that our children who grow up in this environment might somehow obtain a very tainted picture of society, but also the fact that members of the public have been voicing their opinion about the care of their own environment which is significant to me. So I want to bring the Government's attention to this point: in future when the Singapore Pools revolutionizes the techniques of gambling by computerization, then, when they consider the need to increase the number of outlets (and some of them would be in the housing estates), I do plead with the Government to give due consideration to the opinions of the residents as to the location of all these outlets and to the manner under which these outlets should be regulated. Because the right to a clean, good living environment belongs to the Housing Board residents as much as it belongs to the private housing estate residents, I therefore beg the Government to carefully consider the opinions of the public and the residents in future when this programme \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of computerized gambling is put into operation. The Town Councils, which might be instituted, should also consider the regulation of the social environment as one of its areas of concern, rather than just the physical environment as such. \n  <br>4.35 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I also make my position quite clear: that I am not a gambler nor do I favour gambling in any form. But what I do want to question here is the motive of the Government in the introduction of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because, as has been pointed out, there is legalized gambling. Last year, plans were announced of steps being taken to popularize legalized gambling and, as the Member for Changkat has pointed out, plans were announced of setting up betting centres for the Singapore Pools, even in housing estates. I do not want to repeat all that has been said by the Member for Queenstown and by the Member for Changkat. But it is these double standards of this Government that I find so abhorrent. What this Government appears to be doing is to say to our citizens: You must practise what I preach but you must not practise what I do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the Minister, however, did not put it on a moral plane. This is why I am questioning the motives. He proposed to put it purely on a social problem, an environmental problem. He said that this illegal gambling was posing an environmental social problem in housing estates. I would be the first to agree that that is something which we could do without in our housing estates. We do not want this environmental problem mushrooming in all housing estates. But if that is the only concern of the Government, then of course there is an answer to it and, that is, to allow, as the Member for Queenstown has said, people who wish to promote public lotteries or games of chance to set up their centres outside housing estates, license them and then collect the revenue from them for that. So I do not know why the environmental problem is posed as the main reason because, as has been pointed out, the Turf Club presents a problem, an environmental problem, to the people living there and to motorists, and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> proposed setting up of Singapore Pools betting centres in housing estates will equally present a problem. So it would appear that what the Government is saying to our citizens is: You may gamble with us but you may not gamble with anybody else. If you want to have a flutter, the only persons with whom you can have a flutter is us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to consider what has already been said and to try and be logical and consistent in the application of Government's policies and to state quite clearly what is the reason for this Bill. If it is a question of revenue, because the Government is losing revenue as a result of illegal gambling, then the answer is to license them, away from housing estates, and collect the revenue. Or is the motive of the Government to drive more and more gamblers to the Turf Club and to the Singapore Pools so that more revenue may be collected? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is presumptions. I know the Minister says glibly that the presumptions are rebuttable. But it has been observed, Mr Speaker, Sir, by many a Judge and no less than by Lord Devlin, a very distinguished jurist in England and I am sure the Minister for Home Affairs knows this, who has gone on record as saying that presumptions are odious. They reverse the burden of proof. Our system of law is that an accused person is innocent until he is proved and found guilty. Presumptions reverse this. It is, of course, very convenient, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the Police and for the Prosecution if our statutes which regulate or punish criminal activities are full of presumptions. Then you throw the burden on to an accused person. He has got to prove himself innocent. This is something completely alien to the system of justice that we have observed in this country. I know presumptions have been introduced before and this is not the first time. But there seems to be a growing tendency to pack our criminal Acts with presumptions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Law Society has presented a memorandum to the Minister. I take it that it was with his concurrence that they presented a memorandum to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> him. I hope that the Minister will give due consideration to what is set out in that memorandum, and perhaps will agree that this Bill should now be referred to a Select Committee so that the representation of the Law Society and others who are interested may be considered. We were only told this morning, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the draft of the proposed new Securities Industry Bill was sent to the Stock Exchange as far back as May for their comments and somehow they were not happy about it and so nothing was done. I am tempted to ask: Why is the Committee of the Stock Exchange given such special treatment? Here is the Law Society which has submitted a memorandum, I understand. Would the Minister agree that the Bill should now be referred to a Select Committee so that the Law Society may present its views and be heard on it and anyone else may present their views on this problem? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, about the punishment. Mr Speaker, Sir, we glibly talk about punishing the operators. Everybody knows that the people who get caught are the small people, people who are employed by these operators. It is the runners who collect and settle bets or those who assist a bookmaker, an agent. And now at this time of recession, when many are thrown out of employment, some of them may be forced to seek employment in this sort of thing. It is of course illegal but, as has been pointed out, it will be legal if they go and work for the Singapore Pools betting centres. What we are proposing to do is to punish these people, not the big operators, but the small people who are runners, who are agents, and who assist the promoter in any way to run a lottery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law as it stands now, Mr Speaker, Sir, a runner on conviction is subject to a minimum $500 fine. With the amendment, he is subject to a fine of $20,000. Likewise, an agent, who is subject to a minimum $500 fine under the present law, will, after this Bill becomes law, be subject to a minimum fine of $20,000; and it may go up to $200,000. Are these people, runners and agents, in any position to pay these fines? The result will be that they will be sent to prison. And there will be an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> overcrowding of our prisons, if you are going to enforce this Act with all the severity that this Government is capable of. So I hope more thought will be given to the purpose and the motive for this Bill, and that it should be considered not only by a Select Committee but also outside. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my qualified support to the three Bills in question. Other hon. Members have spoken of the bad social effects of gambling. In fact, Sir, there was a report in the newspapers recently about the aftermath of the introduction of the California State Lottery. It was found that some months after the introduction, the grocery stores in California reported a serious drop in their business. In other words, one can infer from that that many people were saving on their grocery bills in order to indulge in their gambling passion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so far nobody in this House has defined what is meant by \"gambling\" and who qualifies to be called a \"gambler\". Although many Members have claimed that they are non-gamblers, but if one were to look more carefully at the definition and some of the activities of hon. Members, one would find that there are many more gamblers than they would like to admit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Can you define it? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Yes, I will. A gambler is one, first of all, who has a short-time horizon. He is impatient to get some gains. Moreover, he is one who is prepared to incur high risk in the hope of very high returns. If one were to use this definition of \"gambling\" and a \"gambler\", one would find that Singapore is full of them. In fact, I believe that part of our economic difficulties stems from the fact that we have produced a very speculative environment in Singapore. If one wanted to, Sir, one could spend one's whole life-time gambling in Singapore, quite legitimately. There is the stock exchange, as the Member for Queenstown mentioned, there are the commodity markets, the futures markets, FOREX trading that one can engage in, many, many forms, including Singapore Pools and Toto, the Turf Club, and so on. One does not have to go to an illegal betting shop in order to gamble. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what does this do for us here in Singapore? I think it is bad, economically, because people are not putting their funds into productive investment. People want quick returns. They are willing to incur high risk in order to get it. So there is something fundamentally wrong with the attitude of the Singaporean. And something must be done in the educational system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have complained, Sir, in this House that we have all kinds of campaigns run year after year. But so far there has been no campaign against gambling. I do not know of any attempt in the schools to teach students the consequences of gambling. Are parents making the effort? But how could they, if they themselves are gambling on the stock exchange? We heard this morning of how Pan-El got so heavily involved in forward trading,and the stockbrokers are heavily involved in it to the tune of $600 million, and the whole system was on a point of collapse, but for Government intervention. The whole economy could collapse if one were to apply these principles or allow these principles to be operated without check. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, Sir, laws when they are instituted must be obeyed. But we find that people will obey those laws which they construe to be just and not unjust. If I were a gambler, I would find it very difficult to obey the set of laws that are being promulgated here today. Because, as the Member for Queenstown and others have asked, \"Why is it right for the Government to run gambling institutions, and why is it wrong for private individuals to run gambling institutions? Why are licences not given to private individuals and firms that want to run these shops? Why not give them the licences?\" These would be questions that they would pose to the Government. I think this must be resolved because people have a grievance against the Government. If the Government were to close the Turf Club and the Singapore Pools tomorrow, then people will obey the law. They at least feel that they can obey because it is a just law. I have complained of this double standard, and just because the Opposition Member uses the term, it does not mean I would not use it. Yes, there are double standards, and I think the Government better wake up to it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now clause 7, if I may refer to some details of the Bill. I am afraid, Sir, that sometimes in our zealous attempts to overcome problems, we might go overboard and innocent people and firms might be caught in unfortunate circumstances. If you read the provisions of clause 7, you will find that if I had a company that had more than three telephones and if any of my employees were to get information on the telephone twice, or two employees get information about the Turf Club operations for a particular day then, under the law, I am liable to prosecution or my firm is liable to prosecution; all the assets liable to be seized. And I am guilty unless proven otherwise. I think something must be done to restrict the scope of clause 7. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 10 seems to restrict the power of the President. There has been some concern in this House that we want to extend the powers of the President. So why are we reducing his power? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about double standards of the Government. Here, I would like to say that is really not the key point that is at issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically the Minister has come with the complaints that he has received as well as comments from grassroot and community leaders that the present law is inadequate to deal with illegal gambling and the mini-turf clubs. He is simply asking this Parliament to amend those laws. Whether legal gambling is moral and illegal gambling is immoral is not really the issue. In this respect, legality has nothing to do with morality. But I also join in the chorus to say that the Government should have no business in the provision of gambling. Perhaps they can put the controls, exercise the necessary supervision, as well as institute the necessary taxes and licence fees to be collected. The Government can, therefore, collect revenue through the normal way of taxation and should not be responsible in providing the instrument for gambling. In this respect, I would like to go as far as to say that the Government should perhaps close down the Singapore Pools Pte Ltd or even privatize gambling to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the extent of allowing enterprising businessmen, if they want to, to enter into this business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling in this respect as many have said, including the Member for Queenstown, is like drinking, maybe like smoking. There is nothing wrong with it in moderation. It is only in excess that we find problems. The Member for Whampoa quoted an example of the aftermath of the California State Lottery and the drop in the business of the grocers. If my memory serves me well, I think it was not so long ago that the former Member for Kreta Ayer and the former First Deputy Prime Minister once said in this House that you can take two sets of completely unrelated factors and create a correlation from them. While he is entitled to his inference that people are diverting money from the grocery bills to indulge in gambling, I think that is a matter that is very much open to - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. The hon. Member like other Members of this House obviously does not listen carefully to what I said. I merely reported what the newspapers said. I did not make any personal inference. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think he did say that you can infer from this. In any case, I fully support these three Bills because I think it will give more teeth to the Police to try to eradicate illegal gambling. I think we should bear in mind that it is not that gambling is wrong but that illegal gambling has many connections with crime. We should take a lesson from the USA when they had its prohibition and the business of providing drinks was left basically to the hands of organized crime. Historians today have said that it was during that period - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You have got it all mixed up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> It was this period that gave the very strong financial foundation to the Mafia, and to this day they have used that money to good use according to their objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do agree that presumptions in law are something that are quite odious and we should try to avoid as much as possible. Nevertheless, I think even with cur- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rent legislation having the presumptions, the Minister has come to this House to say that they are not sufficient, that the operators and the organizers of such mini-turf clubs have been caught by the Police and have, in fact, laughed at us in our courts and willingly paid the fines, and then next week go back to such operations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, should we therefore tie the hands and legs of our Police, other enforcement agencies and our courts to such an extent that we cannot move at all? Looking at the presumptions, I would say that if really you are not in the business of providing outlets for gambling or of running betting information centres, there is sufficient proof in other ways to show in court that you should not come under this legislation. After all, many of our legitimate organizations - the banks, the finance companies, and other businesses - have many many telephones in their offices, and I am sure they are not the ones to worry about the existence of three or more telephones. \n  <br>5.00 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would support the hon. Member for Anson to bring these amendments to the Select Committee for further consideration. And even as I follow the debate today, many Members here have shown concern. If we accept all the amendments here, there may be legal and social ramifications that may not have been intended by the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many important principles involved in these amendments. First, as has been drawn to the attention of this House, is presumptions. Normally, in a court of law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. But in this particular case, the onus of proof is placed on the accused person. Take the example of houseowners or occupiers of houses. If any appliance or instrument connected with gambling is found in his premises, it is for him to prove that the house is not used as a common gaming house. So house owners are in a very precarious position if we accept this kind of statute. I am sure there are many houseowners in this House. If you rent your house through the agents, you do not know whom he rents the house to. And \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> one day you receive a telephone call, \"Look here, there are instruments connected with gambling found in your house.\" I am sure you will get a decent shock of your life. Many people may not have the time to look into the tenancy of their house personally or who they rent it to? They leave it to the agents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of a presumption has got serious implications. Of course, under the previous Act, the Police will give notice to the owner of the house and say, \"Look here, your house is used as a common gaming place.\" So presumption introduced into the Act is very dangerous, and I would draw the attention of the House to the presumptions which they have to be aware of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been drawn to the attention of this House, another presumption is if you have three or more telephones in your premises. Nearly all offices in town would have three or more telephones, which includes connections. If somebody goes there and makes two calls in regard to gambling, there you are, you have to prove to the court your innocence, that the place is not being used as a betting place or a common gaming house. So these presumptions have got really serious implications. So much for presumptions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other serious matter, of course, is punishment. The punishment has been enhanced many times, a maximum of $200,000 and mandatory jail sentence. These are for bettors, for bookmakers, agents and runners. Why so serious a punishment? These are not drug offences or offences connected with dangerous weapons. And worse still, there is a minimum sentence imposed. This is another important principle which the attention of the House has to be drawn to. Because the Judges in our courts are affected by us, by Parliament, they cannot exercise their own discretion. They are there. They are the people who dispense justice. They can hear the case and they can decide for themselves. But when this law is passed, that discretion is taken away from them. Once a person has been found guilty, the Judge must impose a minimum sentence. From experience, heavy sentences meant to deter a crime do not normally work that way. Despite increasing the sentences, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> crimes do rise. This has been borne out by statistics. So why the heavy fine? Why the heavy sentence when it does not deter gamblers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out in this House, gambling does not seem to be an issue because gambling is allowed by the State. What this Bill attempts to do is to wipe out illegal gambling. In other words, what is the heavy penalty for? For the revenue that the Government is deprived of.If it is legal, the Government will get the revenue. If it is illegal, the Government cannot lay its hands on the earnings of gamblers. So they are punished for it. Is that the reason? Perhaps that would answer the question of the Member for Queenstown. He says there is no valid explanation why betting in Government approved centres are allowed and those at the hawker centres are not allowed. Is it because that the Government cannot lay its hands on the revenue of these illegal gamblers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with custodial sentences, people who are caught gambling will naturally try to contest the case. Because if they plead guilty, they will be jailed. So there will be more court cases arising from arrests. In other words, there will be a clogging up of our courts. There will be more such cases, and that means more manpower --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> A point of clarification, Sir. Would the Member for Potong Pasir please clarify whether the views he is expressing are his own or whether he is, in fact, not reading from a representation of the Law Society which was submitted to me?

Until I could see the similarity in the points, although a distance away from my chair, and I asked whether he was, in fact, reading points from the memorandum of the Law Society to which I have already given a reply. As Minister, I respect confidence with the Law Society in regard to my correspondence with them. They had given me a memorandum. I have replied to it. The Law Society has not made the exchange public. Neither have I. In fact, I would prefer the correspondence with the Law Society to be made public because it contains very serious errors, inaccuracies. I would leave it to the Law Society whether they want to publish their memorandum and my reply, side by side. But if the Member is relying on the Law Society's memorandum to point out legal points, I would say that he had better ask the Law Society for sight of my reply before he relies on it because I will have to demolish those points in the same way as I have done in my reply to the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is, in fact, the memorandum of the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> You don't have views of your own? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Well, I am coming to that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Did you get it from the President of the Law Society? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No, not officially. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> By what surreptitious means did you get it? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I just asked the secretary and the secretary forwarded a copy to me.

So I think it will be foolhardy for the Member for Potong Pasir to repeat points on which I have commented. And since it is not a public document, I would leave it to the Law Society whether they want to disclose both the memorandum and my reply publicly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this piece of legislation that we are about to approve has got very many implications which are serious in respect of principles which we should not lightly throw away. Therefore, I would support again the call by the Member for Anson to refer this matter to a Select Committee so that the Law Society and perhaps other members of the public could make further representations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the various Members who have spoken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me reply to the Member for Queenstown. Unfortunately he is not here. Perhaps I will wait for him to come back and deal with the Member for Potong Pasir, since it is fresh in the memory of all those present here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really regrettable, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a Member comes here pretending to express views of his own until it is pointed out that it is not so. That he is relying on some document presented to the Minister, I think he should have in all conscience - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am not giving way, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister is not giving way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would apologize. I should have revealed the source of it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Can I proceed, Mr Speaker, Sir. I think it is very misleading for a Member of the House to rely on an unpublished document sent to me as the Minister because the Minister himself has not revealed for the reason that I respect the correspondence I have with the President of the Law Society. I do not know on what basis the Law Society or its Secretary has chosen to pass a copy to the Member for Potong Pasir when it was not passed or distributed to any other Member here. If I am not mistaken, other Members have not received it. That is a separate matter which I hope the Law Society will choose - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is a matter for the Law Society to look at. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Right. But the question is, whether it was given to the Member for Potong Pasir and whether the Member for Potong Pasir has sought clearance for it to be divulged in this House. I have asked him on several occasions and he did not answer the question whether he had the authority to divulge it in the House. He, together with the Member for Anson, and certain other Members in this House are Members of the House and they are also members of the legal profession. Certain correspondence and certain information to which they may be privileged recipients, as members of the legal profession, but other Members may not be privy to it. And for him to rely on it, point by point, as if this was a great exposition of views of his own until I had to intervene and say that this was not so, it is a very disappointing conduct of a member of the House. And it is just fortuitous that, although my eyesight is growing old, I could see some resemblance between his speech and the document that I have seen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a big song and dance about the presumptions. He said that I am wrong in saying that apart from betting information centres and obstruction of police officers, no new offences are created. He says \"This is wrong. The Minister is wrong.\" Why? He refers to the Law Society memorandum and says, \"Ah, a new offence of loitering is created. The Minister is wrong.\" I will not divulge everything that I have said to the Law Society. I will just quote one portion to show how foolhardy it will be for him to rely on that his allegation, based on the Law Society memorandum, is that a new offence of loitering is created. My reply is as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is erroneous to say that a new offence of loitering has been created for the purpose of betting or wagering or bookmaking. The Law Society has failed to note that this offence in fact already exists, section 5(3)(b) of the Betting Act. The proposed amendment is merely a drafting amendment to reflect the position more clearly.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members have any doubt, let me point out section 5(3)(b) of the existing law, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any person who, inter alia, for the purpose of bookmaking or betting or wagering or settling bets frequents or loiters ...'. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how can it be said that a new offence of loitering has been created when, in fact, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this amendment recasts and re-enacts the offence of loitering which already is to be found in the existing law? I shall stop there, Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as my reply to the Law Society is concerned. I think the Member for Potong Pasir should have checked with the Secretary of the Law Society as to whether there was a reply from the Minister and whether he had the Law Society's sanction to refer to both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Anson. It is really incredible that he can make such a fast about-turn. Not so long ago he said that \"he appreciates the need for the Police to take action against any form of illegal bookmaking.\" I repeat \"any form of illegal bookmaking.\" Now he comes here and says, \"No, this is wrong. This is double standards.\" Well, I see he has a very quizzical look on his face. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> rose - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> You do not have to stand up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask you, first of all, to say what I said this afternoon? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I proceed? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on, Prof. Jayakumar. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On 25th March, 1982, if he checks the Hansard, col. 1610, in a discussion again on mini-turf clubs, he started off his exposition with this phrase: 'All I want to say is that whilst I appreciate the need to stamp out any illegal bookmaking, would the police take steps to ensure that innocent persons ...' are not caught at the same time? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, \"All I want to say is that whilst I appreciate the need to stamp out any illegal bookmaking\", now an about-turn.

Except for a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> very few of the amendments, most of the provisions on presumptions in the Bills are, in fact, redrafts of existing presumptions in the statutes. He has failed to understand that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have the preposterous argument that, because of the recession, we should allow illegal activities. Really, Mr Speaker, Sir. The effect of the argument is, please permit the flouting of these laws. What next? Perhaps he will argue that because of the economic downturn we should allow shoplifting to be carried out in supermarkets. Allow illegal bootlegging in contravention of our liquor manufacturing laws. And perhaps even printing firms - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A complete distortion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> - should be allowed to print counterfeit money to solve their cash flow. [Laughter.] \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You are not only going blind, you are going senile. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I come to the points raised by other Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown is still not here. His speech was interesting but rather contradictory because on the one hand he started off by saying that he is, in fact, against gambling. He wants the Singapore Turf Club and the Singapore Pools to be closed down. Shortly thereafter in his speech he advocated the establishment of more legalized outlets. Tax them, have a fat licensing fee, and so on. Perhaps there is some merit to the suggestion of the Member for Queenstown, and I think advocated by a few others, that there should be more legalized outlets. In a sense, this is a direction in which the Government has gone in that, like other countries, there is legalized and illegal gambling. Although I am prepared to consider the approach advocated by the Member for Queenstown, I think one point should be very clear. Having more legalized outlets, even privatizing them, is not going to solve your illegal gambling. Because there will be persons who will want to stay out of your controls of licensing, your controls of license fees, your controls of taxes, and the higher you raise the taxes, the more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> you have licensed outlets, there will be corresponding increase in illegal gamblers and a mushrooming of illegal gambling establishments. So it is a futile dream to think that the approach suggested by the Member for Queenstown, although it has merits and should be considered seriously, will be the solution to illegal mini-turf clubs. Therefore, even if we adopt the suggestion, there will still be illegal gambling and action will have to be taken because of the menace in the residential estates that I have mentioned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Fengshan referred to the provisions of the Bill. I am grateful for his support. He asked for assurance that those who are intimidated will be given protection. Indeed the operators of illegal mini-turf clubs do have connections with organized crime and secret society activities, and I do know of persons who have made reports to the Police that they have been intimidated and the Police have given protection. I give him that assurance that the Police will continue to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changkat referred to the Singapore Pools decision, and I think she counselled that in future extension of operation of Singapore Pools should have due regard to the sentiments of the residents. If I am not mistaken, the Minister for Finance did give an indication along these lines the last time this was discussed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa, I have answered his point about the legalized outlets - that this is a way which can be considered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his point about the three telephones, let me point out, first, that the very purpose why I distributed the photograph is to give Members a clear indication of what is the kind of situation which is going to be the target of police operations. Why is it three telephones and not 10 telephones or eight telephones? Because three telephones are the minimum for illegal mini-turf clubs to operate. One for receiving calls on the race results and at least two to transmit the results to the network of mini-turf clubs which the betting information centre is involved with. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out also that on that particular clause 7, the presumption is triggered off only when the police have entered the premises. So it is not a blanket provision where all offices are automatically presumed to be betting information centres if they have three or more telephones. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to clause 10, I think there is nothing sinister here. The present position is that the President, when he makes the Gazette notification, in fact, acts on the advice of the Minister. So this is really to streamline the situation. It makes no real substantive difference. The Minister, in fact, at the moment advises the President and the President acts on advice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think I have dealt with most of the points. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not told the House whether he agrees to send this matter to a Select Committee. I think there is enough concern to show that it should be sent to a Select Committee. From what I can see, it is definitely an over-reaction on the part of the Government to wipe out a social problem. If there is to be an overkill legislation, this is perhaps the legislation which can be classified as an overkill. So would the Minister please tell the House whether he would just stay the matter and have more further discussions on it? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry but may I reply to this complete distortion? As I said, it is probably the Minister is getting a bit too old. I thought he was going to reveal something so completely inconsistent with what I said this afternoon, but then what do we find? I thought he was going to bring something out of his bag. Instead we find a statement that I made - that whilst I support the Government's efforts to stamp out illegal gambling, I would urge the Government to take care that innocent people are not caught in the net. What have I said this afternoon that is inconsistent with that? Perhaps the Minister is unable to comprehend what I said. I am not advocating illegal gambling. I was questioning the motives and the double standards of the Government. That is what you should answer - the double standards which say \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that you can have a flutter with us, you can gamble with us, but you cannot gamble yourself. If you think that is something to live by, well, so be it; that is the Government's policy: double standards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is really no necessity to refer this Bill to a Select Committee. This Bill was published more than two months before this sitting. Ample time has been given for anybody who has an opportunity to read it, who has views on it, to give their views, and I do not see any need for reference to a Select Committee. In fact, Members would agree with me that we have to take action quickly before the problem gets out of hand. I do not think it is necessary for me to reply to the Member for Anson, as I have already replied previously. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I clarify with the Minister that he has completely misunderstood the suggestion that it be referred to a Select Committee? The merit in referring it to a Select Committee is that a body of this House considers the recommendations. We know that the Law Society have made recommendation to the Minister, which he has rejected. But he is not the Select Committee. The Select Committee considers the recommendations and it gives an opportunity to others, besides the Law Society, to make recommendations. I am astonished that the Minister cannot see the difference. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my earlier speech I have spoken at length on the problem generally and therefore I would not be repetitious but say that, as a consequence of the amendments to the Betting Act, amendments to the Common Gaming Houses Act are also necessary to bring the penalties into line. Otherwise, the suppression of mini-turf club activities might also see a surge in the offences covered under this Act. The penalties under the Act are also more than 25 years old and are totally inadequate to serve as a deterrent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 4 of the Bill enhance the penalties for those involved in operating or financing common gaming houses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill provide for enhanced penalties for the offences of gaming in a common gaming house, gaming in public, etc, which will carry fines of up to a maximum of $5,000 or imprisonment up to six months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main culprits in illegal gambling are those who assist in the carrying on of an illegal public lottery or allow any public place to be used for gaming or promote gaming in public. Clauses 3 and 6 of the Bill enhance the penalties particularly for these offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punters themselves will not face mandatory imprisonment upon conviction. Clauses 5 and 6(a) repeal and amend respectively sections 6 and 7(2) of the Act which deal with punters - punters \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> gaming in a common gaming house or gaming in public. They will face enhanced penalties of a fine of up to $5,000 or optional imprisonment for up to six months. Clause 7 of the Bill likewise also enhances the penalty for the offence of purchasing illegal lottery tickets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Common Gaming Houses Act deals with the situation where a place is presumed to be a common gaming house. Currently, if a police officer is obstructed whilst trying to gain admittance to a place or if gaming implements are discovered therein, or if people are observed escaping from a place on entry of the Police, it is presumed that the place is a common gaming house. However, under the amended section 15, a place will be presumed to be a common gaming house if gaming implements are discovered therein and any person found in such place or escaping from it shall be presumed to be gaming therein. However, obstructing a police officer is now treated as a separate offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill gives the District and Magistrates Courts the jurisdiction to hear and determine all proceedings under the Act and to impose the full penalties as provided in the amended Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are basically drafting changes. Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am just a little concerned that the raising of the financial penalties to a level which is much higher than hitherto might give opportunity for the gamblers to bribe police officers, and what measures does the Minister intend to take in such cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, here my concern is not so much with the mini-turf clubs which I think one really sees that are big time operators. But very often neighbours get together to gamble for the fun of it. They can also actually fall under the term of \"common gaming house\". I am sure we have heard many stories where gaming in one neighbour's house can lead to some form of arrest. Here, I am \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> therefore very concerned with the enhanced penalties on the common gaming house both in terms of the minimum amount of fines as well as the mandatory jail sentences. Would the Minister please assure the House that this clause is not meant for such situations? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not going to repeat what I said when talking on the Betting (Amendment) Bill but, of course, I stand by all that I said and it applies with equal force here. I again make the call - I know it will not be heeded - that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I make the point which has already been made about the enhanced penalty now for those who gamble in public. Previously the maximum fine was $500 and they were normally fined about $100 or $150. Now the maximum is lifted to a $5,000 fine. It seems to me to be unduly severe. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Whampoa raised a question as to whether the enhanced penalties would lead to a situation where police officers may be bribed. I think I can give him the assurance that, as a Minister as well as the Government, we take a very serious view of any form of bribery of any public servant and he will know, as well as the Members of the House will know, that the Government has never tolerated this at any level, whether under this law or any other existing law or whether under the proposed changes to the law, adequate steps will be taken, guidelines will be given and operational procedures will be taken to ensure that this risk is kept to an absolute minimum. And if it ever happens, of course, stern action will be taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has raised a question but I think I have covered it in my opening speech that the main thrust of this is against the illegal operators, ie, managers of gambling establishments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. I have already touched on this point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.- [Prof. S.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles are used by bookmakers and their agents as a means of transport in their illegal activities. Telephones installed in vehicles have also been used to place bets and to relay race results. It is therefore proposed to amend the Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act to provide for the forfeiture of vehicles used for illegal gambling activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill provides for some of the offences under the Betting Act and the Common Gaming Houses Act such as bookmaking, running a common gaming house, a common betting house, or running an illegal public lottery, to be included in the Schedule to this Act. If any vehicle is found to have been used in or for unlawful gambling, on application by the Attorney-General, a magistrate shall order that the vehicle be forfeited whether or not any person has been convicted of any offence under the gambling laws. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to update paragraph 1(c) of the Schedule. The Dangerous Drugs Ordinance has been repealed and replaced by the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973. Sections 5 and 6(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act are the corresponding \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provisions of Sections 4(2), 6, 9 and 12 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, again my concern is with the possibility of people losing their vehicles through no fault of their own, that is, when they themselves have not been shown to be guilty of the offence for which the vehicle is made seizable. The Member for Potong Pasir pointed out instances of owners of properties which are let out and where the tenant indulges in illegal gambling activities, and the owner is then taken to task. This, of course, applies with much more force in the case of vehicles. I understand the Minister to say that the Bill provides that, on the application of the Attorney-General, the court shall make the order. Well, is the owner going to be given an opportunity to make representations? And will the law provide that where the owner is shown to be completely innocent in the commission of the offence, will his vehicle be returned to him? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the amendment of the Road Vehicles (Special Powers)(Amendment) Bill, all loopholes, it would appear, would have been covered with these enhanced penalties. Probably, after all these enactments have gone through, after a period of time illegal gambling would probably be wiped out in Singapore. But, of course, there is the possibility of some of our gamblers going over to Johor to operate from there. But in Singapore it would appear that only legal gambling can exist. At the moment, anyone wanting to go and make a bet, would probably still have a pinch of conscience about it, knowing that gambling is wrong. They know it inside them that it is wrong. But without illegal gambling and with the introduction of computerized terminals, people can conveniently place or punch in 4-digit bets. Perhaps these terminals will be located at strategic points, probably at places in supermarkets where they are about to leave the market. Now, we know that in marketing, there is such thing as impulse buying, so that cigarettes and perhaps other items are placed strategically at the point where monies are paid. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Mothers going along with children readily will be punching in, gambling right in front of their children.

Does he want strong action to be taken against illegal mini-turf clubs and all the nefarious activities that I mentioned? Is he for? Or is he against? He seems to waffle. He was silent on the Common Gaming Houses Bill and all of a sudden realized he had better speak. Perhaps I should let him know that, in Potong Pasir, more than 60 complaints and reports have come from his residents. What is his answer to his residents? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> For the record, I am against gambling, of course. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Let the Member come out clearly with his arguments. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the other point mentioned by the Member for Anson, let me assure hon. Members that although section 4(1) \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act provides for forfeiture of road vehicles, there are safeguards in the law which prevent arbitrary exercise of the power. For example, first, the court must be satisfied that the vehicle has been used in the commission of a scheduled offence, or that the scheduled offence has been committed in respect of any article or any person found in such vehicle. If the court is not satisfied with these matters, no order for forfeiture can be made. Secondly, although the court may be satisfied that the vehicle has been used in the commission of a scheduled offence, or that the scheduled offence has been committed in respect of any article, or any person found in such vehicle, it cannot independently make an order for forfeiture of the vehicle. Order for the forfeiture can only be made by the court if the Attorney-General has first made a written application for the order. In this regard, the Attorney-General will consider available evidence and other relevant matters (in reply to a point made by the Member for Anson), for example, in the case of a stolen vehicle, where the owner of the vehicle has knowledge of the commission of the scheduled offences, and so on. These matters and the matter mentioned by the Member for Anson will be given careful consideration before an application for forfeiture is made. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on a point of clarification. I am sorry it is taking up the time of this House. But again, I am afraid, the Minister has not completely understood the purport of my objection. As he points out, the court has powers to seize the vehicle if it has been used in the commission of an offence. Then he points out that the other provisions are left to the Attorney-General to decide. The court has no discretion if the Attorney-General makes the application and the court finds that the vehicle has been used in the commission of the offence. My question to him was: should the court not be allowed to decide whether the owner was privy to the offence, and not just left to the Attorney-General? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have not changed the approach of the law here. What we have done is to include certain offences of the Common \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Gaming Houses Act and the Betting Act in the scope of the Schedule. And if one looks at the Schedule, it already includes some of the offences of the Common Gaming Houses Act. The approach of the law has not been changed. The law, in fact, has not been changed except to incorporate. And we have to do this because what will happen and what is happening now is that operators of illegal mini-turf clubs are using and will continue to use with increasing frequency vehicles for their purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>6.26 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1985\" to \"1986\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FINANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance (Amendment) Bill 1985 seeks to give legislative authority to the suspension of payroll tax with effect from 1st April 1985, as announced in the fiscal year \n  <br>\n  <br>1985&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget statement. Presently, the rate of payroll tax is stipulated in the Finance Act (Chapter 139) of the Revised Edition. It does not provide for suspension of tax collection. Clause 2 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Finance to prescribe the rate of payroll tax by an Order. The suspension of payroll tax would be effected if no rate of tax is subsequently prescribed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I think the hon. Members in this House would appreciate what the former Finance Minister did in suspending this 2% payroll tax, and this Bill is to give effect to that. But on the other hand, I think it is an opportune time for us to examine the rationale underlining a payroll tax and what would be the impact of a payroll tax because the Bill, as it now stands, really opens the door, or open the possibility for a future Finance Minister not only to introduce a payroll tax but it could be at a rate much higher than 2%. There is no limitation on the rate now - it could be 0%, it could be 10%, it could be 20%, so we are really giving a big blank cheque to the Finance Minister. And while the present Finance Minister is quite trustworthy, one cannot be sure that in future the Finance Ministers would be as trustworthy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of some concern to me, Sir, that some of the problems of our economy stem from the fact that labour costs have been too high and that has made our goods and services uncompetitive. If at some stage in the future, we were to reintroduce a payroll tax, this would add on to labour cost and it would clearly be undesirable. I do not think Government is short of revenue or of sources of revenue. In fact, I think the public sector as a whole has grown far too large and it is a time for cutting down and not expanding the role of Government. So I will urge the Government to reconsider this Bill at some stage and maybe take out altogether the provision for possible introduction of payroll tax. \n  <br>6.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to oppose this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the payroll tax was first introduced when we were part of Malaysia. It was a Malaysian Finance Act which introduced the payroll tax. When we came out of Malaysia on the 9th August 1965, it was left to us to determine whether any tax or laws should be continued. And speaking in this House as far back as 1983, I pointed out the debate that took place in this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> House on this very matter, the payroll tax. Then several Members and the Minister said that the payroll tax was a very unwise measure that was introduced by the Malaysian government. And that the then Singapore State Government had opposed the introduction of the payroll tax but, of course, being part of Malaysia, they could not do anything about it. But the Minister went on to declare that the Government would set aside the funds collected from the payroll tax for the welfare of the workers. They were not going to have it. It was not necessary for the Consolidated Fund to have the payroll tax paid into it. Singapore was not in need of the monies. But as I pointed out in 1983, those solemn words made by the Minister for Labour in a 1965 sitting of this House were completely forgotten the moment the sitting was over. Nothing was done about setting up a fund for the workers out of the payrol tax monies that were collected. And year after year, the monies were paid into the Consolidated Fund against this solemn declaration made by the then Minister in this House. And so it continued. When I asked the then Minister for Finance, the late Mr Hon Sui Sen, in this House, he said that he had no intention of giving up the payroll tax. But there were nevertheless protests against the imposition of the payroll tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another illustration of the sort of double talk that we have from this Government. In one breath, they say they did not want the payroll tax. It was not needed for the revenue. But having said that, they go on collecting it as part of the revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1985 in the Budget statement, the then Minister for Finance announced to the relief of several Members of this House, and I am sure to the relief of employers and people outside this House, that he had decided to suspend the payroll tax. I have the Hansard here, the sitting of the 8th March 1985 [Vol. 45, No. 7, col. 496]. He said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I now move on to the tax changes. In an Addendum to the President's Address at the Opening of Parliament, I stated that one of the objectives of the Ministry of Finance was to simplify the tax structure wherever possible.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would pause here and repeat again \"to simplify the tax structure wherever possible.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In line with this objective and to alleviate the burden of costs on companies, I have decided to suspend with effect from 1 April 1985, the collection of Payroll tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the other Members of the House thought. But I certainly was left with the impression that payroll tax was to be abolished, that it was going to be removed from our statute books. He did not use the word \"temporarily\". He did not say, \"for the next one year or two years.\" He said, \"I have decided to suspend ... the collection of Payroll tax.\" When I was speaking on the Budget statement, I pointed out to him that he had no powers to suspend the payroll tax under the Finance Act and that a Bill had to be introduced to abolish it altogether. Well, we never saw that Bill until this Bill was presented to the House. And what do we find? We now find that the Government has no intention of doing away with payroll tax. The Minister in March was saying that it was necessary to do away with it to simplify the tax structure. But obviously it now appears that they have got over that objection and they think it is not necessary to do away with the payroll tax to simplify the tax structure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is worse is this. This amendment now continues the payroll tax. But the sting is this. It now delegates to the Minister the rate at which the payroll tax is to be collected. I have - I am sorry that I keep saying \"I have\" - I have more than once in this House said that delegated legislation which gives the Ministers of the Government the power to levy tax or any charge or fee without the consent of Parliament was an abdication of the power of Parliament. It has been long established, and for which Parliament had to fight - I am sorry. Of course, I am referring to the English Parliament because this is the tradition we borrowed - Parliament had long to fight for the sole right to impose any tax or charge on the people. They resented the authority given to anybody else. And now the House of Commons has the sole right to impose tax, and attention has been drawn as far back as 1926 to the dangers of giving to the Ministers any \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> power to levy any tax as that must remain within the sole preserve of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing now in 1986? We are again abdicating. Parliament is abdicating its function when Parliament should decide whether any tax should be imposed and at what rate the tax should be imposed. We are abdicating that power to a Minister of the Government. Is that necessary? If that is to be the order of the day in Singapore, then we might as well do without Parliament. We can forget about Parliament. We can save the expense of paying Members of Parliament. We can save the expense of maintaining this House. But if we are going to preserve Parliamentary rule and the supremacy of Parliament, then we must not abdicate our powers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would say that this piece of legislation at this time when Singapore's economy is so bad is one of the worst legislation that is before the House. The Government's policy as has been published is to give priority to revive our economy. How does it do it? It has, of course, to cut down costs, increase productivity and also give confidence to business people and also to business people from abroad to invest here. Confidence is also important. How can you give confidence to business people when we have got such a piece of legislation? As the Member for Whampoa said, it is a blank cheque for the Minister to sign. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the limit of the payroll tax? This is the kind of signal we do not want to give to business people. How can you create confidence in business people when they come in and they do not know how much tax the Government is going to impose on them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen measures to reduce the Central Provident Fund, to cut down costs. But that is done half-heartedly, half measures. They say they are going to do it temporarily, two years. Any businessman will tell you that this kind of signal is not good for confidence. Anyone with money coming to invest in Singapore, they want something on long term, at least five years, if not permanently. At least, they can predict what the future situation will be. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Government says it wants to revive the economy. On the other hand, the steps taken contradict that. This is the sort of Government we have today. Perhaps the Minister for Trade and Industry who heads the Economic Committee can give his views on this. Does this kind of legislation give confidence to business people? If not, then he should oppose this Bill as I am opposing it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as to the question by the Member for Whampoa, I can assure you that the present Minister for Finance and future Ministers for Finance would not be so foolish as to impose taxes which obviously the community cannot bear. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is not the point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That is the point. That is exactly the point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is not. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I know what you mean. If Parliament decides that the law is inopportune or not practical, it can always legislate to remove it by a majority of the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to the question of the Member for Anson on Dr Tan's commitment to abolish the tax, I think the word he used was \"suspend\". The Oxford Dictionary will define \"suspension\" as a temporary measure and not a permanent change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of abdication of Parliament, I just mentioned the fact that Parliament always has the power to change the law by a majority. I do not think I need to go into a debate on this issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the questions raised by the Member for Potong Pasir. He said, \"What is the limit of the tax?\" The present limit is zero, as I have no intention of imposing the payroll tax and neither will I consider doing it if the economy cannot possibly stand it. In fact, it was suspended for precisely this reason. I think one must accept that the Government is not irrational. In fact, the best signal that the Government can give to foreign investors is precisely that we are willing to change our laws, our impositions, to meet circumstances. And everything we have done to date, in fact, illustrates this. [Interruption]. Is zero a killing? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> You have the powers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The powers will not be used unless they are necessary. This is merely a provision which allows us to change the tax system as we can do. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Don't you agree it is a blank cheque? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It is not a blank cheque. As I have mentioned earlier, you can always change the law. If the Government wishes to impose a tax it could, to meet the request of the Members for Potong Pasir and Anson, abolish I suppose, the payroll tax, and impose another tax called labour tax. It would have precisely the same effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That is not as practicable as you think. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The question really is this: the predictability of foreign investors' confidence is the pragmatic flexibility of this Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from 1985 to 1986. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may it be recorded that I voted against this Bill at all stages. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.48 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Insurance Act was last amended in 1973, significant changes have taken place in the insurance industry both here and abroad which necessitate a review and updating of the Insurance Act to ensure its relevance and effectiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore insurance market has grown in size and capacity. Larger and more complex risks are being written, reflecting the growth and development of our economy. The character of business has also changed substantially with offshore insurance business becoming increasingly important for the industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, the general insurance and reinsurance market has been experiencing a prolonged period of difficult market conditions. Over-capacity and high interest rates had resulted in very keen competition at uneconomic rates. Many insurers and reinsurers in Europe and the United States had suffered substantial underwriting losses. Some had even incurred net operating losses after investment income. In addition, London, the world's leading insurance centre, was troubled by scandals of fraudulent practices at the Lloyd's of London. In view of such developments, insurance supervisory authorities have become increasingly concerned with the security of insurers and reinsurers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the insurance business is such that no market can isolate itself from other markets. This is especially true of general insurance risks which can run into hundreds of millions of dollars in sums insured. For prudent reasons, each market has to reinsure with other markets to spread its risks. The supervisory authority has therefore, to watch developments in other major insurance markets which could impact on the security of reinsurers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed to describe the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to briefly describe the present market structure and size of the Singapore insurance industry and how it has grown over the years. There are presently 84 insurers registered to carry on insurance business in Singapore. Of these, 63 are direct insurers which sell insurance to the general public, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 16 are termed \"professional\" reinsurers and five are captive insurers. The \"professional\" reinsurers represent a new breed of insurers established over the last 12 years to promote Singapore as a reinsurance centre. Professional reinsurers provide insurance cover to other insurance companies. They operate principally on a regional or international basis. The captive insurers are of an even more recent development in Singapore. They are set up by foreign multinationals to provide in-house insurance services for their group of companies. It is our intention to promote Singapore as an attractive home for captive insurers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the registered insurers, insurance agents and insurance brokers are part and parcel of the insurance industry. These insurance intermediaries are not formally regulated under the present Insurance Act, except for 11 brokers and agents who are registered to deal with the Lloyd's market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1984, the total gross premiums written by the industry amounted to $964 million for general business and $333 million for life business. This compares with a premium income of $232 million for general business and $73 million for life business in 1975. In terms of growth, general business premium income grew at an average of 17% per annum over the last decade, while life business grew at 18%. Significantly, in 1984, 35% of premium income of general insurers was derived from outside Singapore. Offshore insurance business written by the industry in 1975 was negligible. The professional reinsurers contributed to more than half of the total offshore business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against such a background of developments in the insurance scene that the proposed amendments to the Insurance Act should be viewed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance (Amendment) Bill seeks to: (1) strengthen the financial position of insurers and their ability to meet their liabilities to policy owners and claimants; (2) improve the system of insurance supervision and control with the necessary flexibility for promoting insurance industry development; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> (3) protect policy owners' interests in cases of insolvencies; and, (4) reflect the transfer of the administration of the Insurance Act to the Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, we can all agree that the objective of this Bill is a very good one in providing greater protection, especially for policyholders. I particularly like clause 37 which makes provision for perhaps a greater release of insurance monies to dependants of those who die. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are some problems that I encounter with some of the clauses, particularly clause 5, if I may make reference to it. Clause 5 begins on page 3. On page 4, subsection 6 (2)(e) says that the licence can be withdrawn if: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the insurer proposes to make, or has made, any composition or arrangement with its creditors or has gone into liquidation or has been wound up or otherwise dissolved.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no difficulty with the latter part of this provision. It is only with the first part where the insurer proposes to make any composition with creditors. Sir, I fear that there may be economic circumstances where certain investments go bad temporarily or there are liquidity problems, in which case any company would be forced to make some kind of arrangement with its creditors. If this provision is stringently enforced, that will lead to the closure of the company in question. Then if we go further down on page 4 to subsection (j). It says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'that any of the officers of the insurer holding a managerial or executive position has been convicted of any offence under this Act;'. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this seems to be unduly stringent and not fair to the shareholders or the owner of the company in question. To be fair, Sir, nobody who runs a company can really guarantee that his employers will not contravene some law at some stage or other, particularly relating to the business in question. So I do not see why the licence should be withdrawn in such a case. Criminal proceedings can be taken against the officer in question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go further down to subsection (k) on page 4, it says that the licence can be withdrawn if: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the insurer has furnished false, misleading or inaccurate information, or has concealed or failed to disclose material facts in its application for registration.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this again were to be stringently imposed, then I think there would be circumstances where owners of insurance companies will be forced to fold up if some oversight has been done in its initial reporting of material facts or information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (l) on page 4 says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'that it is in the public interest to cancel the registration.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But \"public interest\" is nowhere spelt out. So presumably the Authority in question has the right to state any particular case as coming within the ambit of \"public interest.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 5, subsection (6) of clause 5 says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An order of cancellation made by the Authority shall not take effect until the expiration of a period of 14 days after the Authority has informed the insurer of the order.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see here any provision for appeal or a procedure for appeal against the Authority whatsoever. Sir, if you take this particular clause as a whole, then I am troubled by this question that there is no distinction made between a corporate entity as such and the owner or the shareholders of the entity. One could get a firm which is viable economically or it is profitable and it has a large number of employees and a large number of policyholders. If there were to be some violation of any or all of these provisions, the company could be closed down, just because some officer or some owner had violated some provision of this section . We had cases in the past where companies in Singapore had been closed down because the Authority wanted to penalize the owner and therefore the licence was withdrawn. I would have thought that the proper thing to do would be to institute criminal proceedings against the person in question and to allow the entity to be transferred to somebody else. Appropriate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> fines could be levied so that the person who committed a criminal act would not benefit from the arrangement. I think one has to look at the interest of Singapore in the construction of this Act and,more important, in the administration of this Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 on page 22, new section 19(A) sub-section (1). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the insurance agent or broker must not have beenconvicted of an offence \"involving fraud, dishonesty, or moral turpitude.\" I do not know what \"moral turpitude\" is in the context of this Bill, but clearly the attitude here is very unforgiving towards those who have at some stage in the past run afoul of the law. I want to make this point here, Sir, that if Singapore really wants to create an environment for business, it has got to be forgiving towards entrepreneurs who fail at some time in the past. By all means let us take those to court who have committed criminal acts but those who have erred unwittingly and who have been made bankrupt because of bad judgment should have a chance to start all over again. It is the environment which is important, and if we are going to introduce clauses like this then nobody would dare to come to Singapore to set up anything. If at some stage the record is dug up that so-and -so had some criminal record or some complaint of a moral nature, then theoretically the whole company could be closed down. I do not like it at all. I think it will stifle entrepreneurship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a few other points, Sir. First is the question of local versus foreign participation in the insurance business in Singapore. If one were to look at the statistics as presented in the Annual Report of the Insurance Commissioner 1984, one finds that whatever one uses as the criterion that only slightly more than half, or about half, the business is conducted by so-called local firms. I would like to ask the Minister in question what is the intention of Government. Is there the intention to promote local insurance companies just as we have had a conscious policy to promote local banking? Of course, there could be offshore activities going on at the same time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question that we ought to be concerned with is the extent of Govern- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ment participation in the insurance companies. Again, I am told there are about three companies owned by Government. I do not know whether that includes the NTUC Income as well. But just counting two of them that I know, for individual life, group life and general insurance, the amount of premiums commanded by these Government companies are not inconsequential - 80% in the case of group life, 23% for individual life and 26% for general insurance. I myself feel that Government should phase itself out of various commercial activities and perhaps the insurance area is one that they ought to get out of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question concerns the capitalization of the insurance industry - whether or not our firms are big enough to take on the kind of risks and to have the kind of sophisticated expertise or personnel to compete against very large insurance companies overseas. Then there is the question of whether we have enough personnel in Singapore to run the industry well. We have had very ambitious plans to develop Singapore into a sophisticated financial centre, but are we producing the requisite personnel in order to make this a reality? If we want to be a world-class economy, we must have world-class inputs. \n  <br>7.04 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have reservations on two or three clauses in this Bill and my reservations spring from the fears expressed by the Member for Whampoa. My reservations relate to the power now given to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to register any person who wishes to carry on insurance business in Singapore. Previously it was the Commissioner for Insurance. Now the power will be transferred to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law as it stands now, where the Commissioner refuses registration, anyone may appeal to the Minister and that is to be found in section 4(5)(a) of the present Act. But in the proposed amendment of section 4 contained in clause 3, paragraph (b), there is no provision for any appeal to the Minister where the Authority refuses to register a person who wishes to carry on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> insurance business in Singapore. I wonder what the reason for this is. Is it because it is intended that the person who is refused registration should have recourse to other remedies and of course I mean to the courts? I hope that is the intention, that anyone who is refused registration by the Authority can ask the courts to look at it, not on the merits, but to see whether the Authority has applied the Act strictly in accordance in refusing the registration and whether its judgment on the question on whether a person had misled the Authority is right or wrong. If that is their intention, then there should be a provision in this Bill providing for an appeal to the courts. But I cannot see it. So will the Minister be good enough to explain why the present appeal to the Minister is to be removed without any remedy being given to a person who is aggrieved by the refusal of the Authority to register his insurance business in Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if you move on to the proposed section 6 in clause 5 of this Bill, one finds that the Authority is given powers to cancel the registration. The Member for Whampoa has gone through the proposed section and I do not propose to repeat it. The powers are very wide. Again, there is nothing in the proposed section which allows an appeal against the Authority's decision. If one looks at the explanatory note, there is specific mention that the power of appeal to the Minister is being removed. It does, of course, require the Authority to give notice to the insurer of its intention to cancel and to hear him. But that is not good enough. Why have we removed the remedy of an appeal, albeit to the Minister, however inadequate? I have said many times that the appeals to the Minister are inadequate on a number of things. But why have we removed even that appeal? Is it also the intention here that the person who is aggrieved by the cancellation should be allowed to have recourse to the courts? I hope it is. If it is, then I would suggest that there should be another section allowing the person aggrieved to appeal to the court. And you find this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in clause 19 of the Bill. Clause 19 enacts a new section 19A after section 19, which says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Authority may by order prohibit any person from carrying on business as insurance agent or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> insurance broker in Singapore or from taking part directly or indirectly in the management of any insurance agent or broker in Singapore where the person has been convicted of an offence involving fraud, dishonesty, or moral turpitude or the Authority is satisfied that the person has been involved in any activity prejudicial to the public interest.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In subsection (2), it says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any person aggrieved by any order of the Authority under subsection (1) may appeal to the High Court.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is provided for in the case where the Authority prohibits persons from carrying on business as insurance agent or insurance broker in Singapore. Why is there not a similar protection given under clause 4 and clause 5 of the Bill? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one turns to clause 20 (Amendment of section 20) where the Authority is given power to cancel the licence of an insurance agent or broker issued under the Act, one again finds that there is no remedy provided for the insurance agent or broker whose licence is cancelled under the power of the Authority. Is there not some inconsistency in all this? In one particular case, the proposed amendment allows an appeal to the High Court. In all the other cases, it removes even an appeal to the Minister and does not go on to provide any appeal to the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the views expressed by the Member for Whampoa about the need not to unduly and harshly penalize people who perhaps unwittingly lapse into committing an error. But more important than that, it is vital, as I see it, that any decision of the Authority should be subject to a review, otherwise it erodes confidence among the business community and that is not something that we want in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the questions by the Member for Whampoa on how the law will be applied, I can give him the assurance that the intention is not to apply it arbitrarily because that clearly would not be in the interest of the Singapore industry and that it will be applied with discretion because the intention is not to kill the industry but rather to develop it. That is an assurance I can give categorically. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the right of appeal to the Minister which appears to have been withdrawn, I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> just would like to mention that the Minister also happens to be the Chairman of the Authority. So the appeal is almost automatic in this case. I am both Minister for Finance and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In fact, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is part of the portfolio of the Minister for Finance. As to the right of appeal generally, this is not a constitutional provision for any Ministry or authority to give automatic appeal in cases where a licence to operate a business is not granted. It is much like saying that there should be a right of appeal if request for a banking licence should be refused. There is no such provision currently under the Banking Act. The decision is made by the MAS using its best judgment on the qualifications of the applicant and the same applies to the insurance industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention in general terms that the provisions under these amendments have been thoroughly discussed with the members of the insurance industry as part of our consultative process, and it has taken many months to achieve the present result. And in this connection, I would like to respond to the insinuations of the Member for Anson during the debate on the Betting (Amendment) Bill. He suggested that the MAS had shown bias in giving special conditions or allowances to the Committee of the Stock Exchange to take considerable time for consideration of the proposed SI amendments. It is normal practice for the MAS to conduct extended consultations with people affected by proposed changes in law. It is essential in our view that such consultation should take place because it is clearly impractical to impose legislation which is unworkable or would destroy the industry it is designed to promote. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>7.16 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1985\" to \"1986\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 8 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year appearing in page 8, line 6, will be altered from \"1985\" to \"1986\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year appearing in page 10, line 29, will be altered from \"1985\" to \"1986\".

Does the motion have the support of any other hon.

I was then told, and the House ruled, that it was not a point of order and that I was not allowed to raise it without having given notice of any motion to this House of my intention to raise it. Of course, I accepted that ruling, and hence I gave notice to raise the motion at this sitting of the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hate to say this. But I am convinced that it is a point of order and that it should have been raised at the last sitting. I shall explain why it is a point of order further on when I elaborate on the Standing Orders. But may I say that I have it on no less an authority than Erskine May in his treatise on the proceedings of the House of Commons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this particular motion is not brought before this House, let me assure the Members, to save the petitioner from the consequences of any legal proceedings, although it may have that result. But that is not the object of this motion. My object goes much wider than that. It is the whole principle of parliamentary privilege that is at stake. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the Parliament (Privileges, and Immunities and Powers) Act, you find it enacted that Parliament shall be possessed of several privileges. And, of course, this means Members of the House, and not only Members but persons who take part in parliamentary proceedings are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> protected. And under the Parliamentary Privileges and Immunities Act, no proceedings in the House shall be questioned outside the House. No one shall be questioned outside the House for anything that he says in this House. And that is important, Sir, because Parliament consists of the representatives of the people. If there is to be frank, full discussion, uninhibited discussion on any matter that concerns the country or its inhabitants, then it is equally vital that that discussion should be protected from any sanction, from any quarter outside the House. That is, may I say, the cornerstone of parliamentary tradition and government. And Parliament has zealously guarded its privileges. It has throughout the ages fought for these privileges and refused to give up any of its privileges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if a Member thought that whatever he said in this House, whatever he said before the Committee, would be questioned outside the House, then there is a clog put on the Member and he will not be able to represent the interests of these for whom he was elected. Equally, I know it does not concern a Member and we are going to be told this does not concern a Member and I see that the Attorney-General falls into that error as well. I shall have something to say about the Attorney-General's opinion. The protection equally applies to any member of the public who takes part in any parliamentary proceedings. Sir, I do not have to spell this out. It must be abundantly clear to Members of the House that if any member of the public is invited to partake in parliamentary proceedings, to give some information to the House, to Parliament, and he does so, then he must be protected from any consequence of having done so that may put him in peril. Otherwise, Parliament will not get the information it needs from members of the public. It is as simple as that. If any member of the public thought, \"If I report something to Parliament, I might be faced with a court action or I might be faced with Police action\", then he will not report it to Parliament. And Parliament is there for that specific purpose, as the representatives of the people, to consider the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> people's complaints, the people's interests. So it is important that any member of the public who takes part in parliamentary proceedings is equally protected and he should be assured that he can impart information to Parliament, he can appear before Parliament, before any Committee of Parliament and give evidence without any fear that whatever he said would be questioned outside Parliament. I keep saying \"outside Parliament\" because Parliament itself may censure any Member for anything he says or does and equally may censure any member of the public if he abuses the privilege accorded to him by Parliament. But it is only for Parliament to decide whether a member of the public has abused this privilege and not for anybody outside. Otherwise, Parliament as an institution cannot flourish. We have already in our statute books the protection accorded to witnesses in court proceedings. Whatever a witness says in court is protected. Likewise, whatever he tells Parliament, Parliament is the high court of Parliament, must be protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier this afternoon about Parliament zealously guarding its powers of taxation. Equally, may I say that we should be zealous of the privileges that Parliament enjoys. Because once you give up those privileges, then the institution of Parliament will decay. The question that arises in this motion is that wide one - not the narrow one of trying to save the petitioner from the legal proceedings to which he has been subjected, but the much wider one - whether we, as Parliament, are zealous of the privileges and rights which are absolutely necessary for the proper functioning of Parliament? If we are to uphold the tradition of Parliament, then we must be zealous. We must uphold the right of any citizen in this country to come forward before Parliament and to say, what he wishes to say without fear of any sanction being brought against him. Otherwise, the whole purpose of Parliament is lost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is this that this petitioner is complaining? This petitioner was invited, and when I say \"was invited\", I do not, of course, mean that a special invitation was extended to him, that he was singled out, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> but he was invited as a member of the public to make representations to the Select Committee on a Bill that was before Parliament. And being a good citizen and being desirous of doing his part, he submitted a representation to the Select Committee on that Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was no doubt that he was taking part in parliamentary proceedings, albeit he was not a Member of Parliament. That, I assure you, is on the authority of cases which go back to the 18th century. He was taking part in parliamentary proceedings. He was invited by the Select Committee as a member of the public to make representations, and he did. So he was taking part in parliamentary proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he submitted his memorandum to the Select Committee, the Select Committee concluded its deliberations and published its report and, of course, it included the representation made by this man as an appendix to the report. And he then found that he was faced with legal proceedings in respect of what he said in his memorandum to the Select Committee. So he sought the protection of this House. He asked the House in his petition to declare that it would be wholly wrong to visit him with any sanction because of his having taken part in parliamentary proceedings. That is all he was asking. He was, in fact, saying, \"Well, you invited me, honourable Members of Parliament, through your Select Committee, to make representations and I did. And now I am faced with proceedings\". And so he asks this House to declare that he was taking part in parliamentary proceedings and that it would be a breach of parliamentary privilege for anyone to question him outside. But what do we do? What did we do to that complaint? It was referred to the Petitions Committee in accordance with Standing Orders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if your look at Standing Order 95(6) which relates to the Public Petitions Committee, you will find what the functions of the Public Petitions Committee are. According to Standing Order 95(6), the functions are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It shall be the duty of the Committee to consider all Petitions referred to it under the provisions of Standing Order No. 17 to classify such Petitions, prepare \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> abstracts thereof in such form and manner as shall appear to it best suited to convey to Parliament all requisite information respecting their contents and the signatures attached thereto and to report the same from time to time to Parliament.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you have it, the functions and duties of the Public Petitions Committee. It must be apparent to Members from what I have read that the function of the Public Petitions Committee is purely secretarial. They are simply to prepare the petition in such form and manner as shall best convey to Parliament all the information required. In other words, they have got to get information about whatever is said in that petition that is necessary so that Parliament may consider it when it comes to debating the petition. It is not, as I read Standing Order 95(6), for the Public Petitions Committee to decide whether the petition should be considered or not or even to decide on the merits of that petition. It is for Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this petition raises a matter of privilege. And I have it on the authority of Erskine May that if there is a matter of privilege that is raised, then it must be debated by the House. It must be considered by the House and not by a Committee. May I quote from the 19th edition of Erskine May at page 821: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Petitions affecting privilege. - Although the Standing Orders restrict debate to urgent cases, that restriction does not extend to a petition complaining of a matter affecting the privileges of the House, such a case being governed by the general rule that a question of privilege is always entitled to immediate consideration.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See how they take the questions of privilege? They take them very seriously. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Committee on Public Petitions - Formerly, all public petitions, except petitions regarding a personal grievance if dealt with under S. O. No. 101, or matters of privilege, stood referred under Standing Order to the \"Committee on Public Petitions,\" under whose directions they were classified and, when necessary, printed at length.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important part of this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that it is only petitions other than Petitions on matters of privilege which stood referred to the Committee on Public Petitions. You have got it there quite clearly. \"All public petitions, except petitions regarding a personal grievance ... or matters of privilege,\". Except petitions on matters of privilege, other petitions stood \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> referred to the Committee on Public Petitions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Erskine May goes on about the functions of this Public Petitions Committee, and he says later on: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It had, for instance, no power to investigate or report on the merits of any petition, or to interrogate representatives of government departments or other persons as to possible remedial action.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the 19th edition, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Perhaps I should inform Members of this House that in the House of Commons, the Public Petitions Committee has been dissolved, and now all petitions go straight to the Minister to be dealt with, except for matters of privilege. The Minister has to report on the petition to the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find in the 20th edition of Erskine May, Public Petitions, again what has already been dealt with in the 19th edition, the statement that the discussion of petitions relating to present personal grievances, \"the petition may be brought into discussion on the presentation thereof\". And they give the illustration of a petition that was presented in 1844. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is quite clear that this being a petition raising a matter of privilege should have been considered by the House or should have been referred to the Committee on Privileges. That it is a matter concerning a privilege is even acknowledged by the Public Petitions Committee in its Report, when they set out the head note that the legal proceedings be declared a breach of the privileges of Parliament. How did the Public Petitions Committee go about this? The Public Petitions Committee sought the advice of the Attorney-General on this. The Attorney-General gave his advice. His advice was that Parliament should not do anything about it. I am sorry to have to say this, but the learned Attorney-General is in error. He is abysmally wrong when he states in his advice: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The privilege of Parliament exists principally for the protection of Members of the House in the performance of their functions. Parliament should not, therefore, readily exercise its jurisdiction over any case involving Parliamentary privilege pending before the court where no Member or officer of Parliament is involved.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, parliamentary privilege extends to anybody, a member of the public who takes part in parliamentary proceedings. The Attorney-General would appear to have treated the whole thing as an invitation to Parliament to try and stop the court from hearing the case. That is not the purpose of the petition, and I do not suppose Parliament can just say to the court, \"You can't hear this.\" But that is how the Attorney -General has approached it. That this was perhaps an application to Parliament for a directive to be sent to the court not to entertain the suit. It is a complete misconception on the part of the Attorney-General. And may I say that his advice or report displays, as I have said earlier, abysmal ignorance of Parliamentary practice and procedure. He says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Parliament should not, therefore, preclude the court from determining the matter unless it is clear beyond doubt that there has been a breach of one of its recognised and established privileges and that the intervention of Parliament is essential at this stage to prevent obstruction or threat of obstruction to Parliamentary proceedings.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Parliament should not preclude the court\". The petitioner is not asking Parliament to preclude the court. The petitioner was asking Parliament to declare whether he was taking part in parliamentary proceedings and whether he was within the privilege of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee agreed with the Attorney-General's views. As I have said earlier, the Public Petitions Committee had no business to even consider whether the petition should be heard or not. It was not the function of the Public Petitions Committee but, I am sorry to have to say this, they have misconceived their functions and powers and reported in this Report that it would not be proper for Parliament to intervene in the legal proceedings against Mr Sivadas. That Report was tabled, was sent to all Members, but it was never discussed in this House. What is more pertinent is that this petitioner, who presented a petition to this House, was not even given a reply. I understood that until yesterday he had not been given any reply from the representatives of the people to whom he appealed to declare whether he was protected by Parliamentary privilege. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that it is a failing in courtesy on the part of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this House, but that is not what I am complaining about. I am complaining about the much wider principle which is at stake, whether we are going to take cognizance of the privileges of Parliament. This being a petition affecting a matter of privilege should be referred to the Committee on Privileges if that is the wish of this House. I am not saying it need necessarily be. It can also be discussed in this House in any debate without reference even to the Committee on Privileges. But in my motion, I have suggested that perhaps we should send the petition now to the Committee on Privileges because it raises privilege. It is important for the powers of this House, for the continuation of the institution of Parliament, that we should show our readiness to extend protection to persons who take part in the proceedings of this House at the express invitation of this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>7.56 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion of the hon. Member for Anson. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer the House to this Report of the Public Petitions Committee (First Session). This is a very brief Report, comprising of two pages. The Committee comprised seven Members from this House together with Mr Speaker in the Chair. I note that they held only two meetings and out of the two meetings one of the hon. Member was absent. This is to show how interested he was in these proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other observation I would like to make is that the whole Report comprised the joint opinions of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General. None of the views of any of the seven Members were recorded. I wonder why. Just now I was accused of not having a view. There are seven Members here who have not expressed their views at all, or are they too ashamed to have their views published? I think it is useful for us in Parliament to know what their views are. Having said that, I will refer to the issue at hand, and that is, Parliamentary privilege. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General would appear to agree that any proceedings in this House itself is a privilege, but he is not very sure that when a person presents a representation in one of these Committees whether it is privilege or not, whether it is covered by section 4 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. I would say that it is privilege. Why do we need the privilege in all these Committees? Then there would be freedom of speech. Anyone making a representation does not fear that it might end up in a legal suit. He must be protected by Parliament and he must be able to give his representations freely so that these Committees can gather the maximum information so that Parliament can function effectively. That is the rationale behind the privileges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it say in our Standing Order? If you look at Standing Order 104, it says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) In cases of doubt the Standing Orders of Parliament shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant practice of the Commons House of Parliament of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In any matter for which these Standing Orders do not provide the said practice shall be followed, but no restriction which the House of Commons has introduced by Standing Order shall be deemed to extend to Parliament or its Members until Parliament has provided by Standing Order for such restriction.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am going to read is that the practice in England is not a restriction. This privilege is a well accepted practice in the House of Commons, in fact, also in the House of Lords. This is Erskine May, 20th edition, at page 88: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The protection of witnesses etc concerned in proceedings in Parliament. Witnesses, petitioners, counsel and others are protected from molestation, threats or legal proceedings on account of what they may have said or done in either House or a committee thereof. Such persons may be regarded as being participants to that extent in proceedings in Parliament, which, as Article 9 of the Bill of Rights declares, 'ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament'. In practice, when such cases of molestation, threats or legal proceedings have been brought to the notice of either House, the procedure adopted for the protection of witnesses and others concerned has been that regularly employed in cases of breach of privilege and contempt.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there you are. That is the practice in both Houses of Commons and Lords in England. I will quote further at page 166: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Legal proceedings against witnesses \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Houses will treat the bringing of legal proceedings against any person on account of any evidence \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which he may have given in the course of any proceedings in the House or before one of its committees as a breach of privilege. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons resolved on 26 May 1818, [as long ago as that] 'That all witnesses examined before this House, or any committee thereof, are entitled to the protection of this House in respect of anything that may be said by them in their evidence.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cases cited there which I would not bother the House with. I think the point has been made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So under our Standing Orders it would appear that Mr Sivadas, when he presented his representation to the Select Committee on the amendments to the Companies Act, does have that privilege and I hope the House will take cognizance of that and vote accordingly for the motion. \n  <br>8.04 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would just like to say a few words before you put the motion to the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson as well as the Member for Potong Pasir have spoken at some length on the supremacy of Parliament, especially in relation to the question of privilege, and they have made a general principle on how we ought to jealously safeguard our supremacy in these matters and protect those who appear before Parliament. A general principle is good up to a point but it must be tested against the particulars of the case. So we cannot get away from the particulars of the case before us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has, in his usual fashion, made a case on the basis that the legal aspects of this are absolutely clear and that it is an open-and-shut case. This is to be expected, as I think any of us who have had dealings with lawyers would know that lawyers who appear in court are absolutely convinced and speak with great conviction of their case even though they may be defending a client who is guilty. Both the Members are quite entitled to their opinion. But I beg to differ. I would consider it wiser to put my confidence in the views of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General and the deliberations of the Committee on Public Petitions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject matter of the petition by Mr Sivadas is clearly set out in the Report of the Committee. The crux of the issue is whether Mr Sivadas is protected by parliamentary privilege under either section 4 or section 17 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. Mr Sivadas may well be protected. I am not denying that. On the other hand, he may not be. This depends on how the relevant sections in the law I referred to are interpreted. And interpretation of law is not as simple as the two Members would like to make them out to be, and this is precisely the issue which is now before the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Petitions Committee sought the views of the Attorney-General whose view is that the interpretation of the section should be left to the court. The court will consider the arguments presented before it and after deliberations come to a decision on the matter. Parliament can, of course, exercise its powers and make its own interpretation where the case warrants it, for example, where it involves the privileges of a Member of this House. But the Public Petitions Committee has, in my view, quite rightly concluded that the circumstances of this particular case do not warrant pre-emptive action by Parliament and therefore accepted the opinion of the Attorney-General that the court should decide on the matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Sivadas feels that his rights have been violated, he can, I am sure, make a cogent case in the court with the help, if necessary, of the Member for Anson and the Member for Potong Pasir in their capacity as lawyers. In the meantime, Members should accept the Report of the Public Petitions Committee and reject the motion by the Member for Anson. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If I may say so without being disrespectful to the Leader of the House, I did not expect him to be able to reply to the points that were made. I am sorry that the Leader of the House has completely missed the point probably because he is unable to answer the point that was made and therefore took the easy way out of completely ignoring it and pretending as though the point was not there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether it was the prerogative or the function of the Public Peti- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tions Committee to decide on the petition. I have pointed out for the information of the Leader of the House that Standing Order No. 95(6) does not give the Public Petitions Committee - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> That is your view. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> - the power to decide. He does not answer that. The Member for Potong Pasir referred the House to Standing Order No. 104 which says that Standing Orders shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant practice of the Commons House of Parliament of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - \"shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant practice of the Commons House of Parliament of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". I hope that is plain enough for the Leader and that he understands what that means. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I have, so has the Member for Potong Pasir, pointed out that if one looks at the practice in the House of Commons as presented by Erskine May, what does one find? I read this - I do not want to read it again - that if it is a matter of privilege it does not even go to the Public Petitions Committee. It is taken up by the whole House and debated. If the Leader says that the practice of the House of Commons is wrong, then perhaps he should put them right. He should write to the Speaker of the House of Commons and say, \"You know, your practice is all wrong. I do not think you should debate matters of privilege. You should send them to the Public Petitions Committee and let the Public Petitions Committee decide that.\" Would you like to do that and let us know what the reply will be from the Speaker of the House of Commons? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Have you finished? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, I have not, Mr Leader. Restrain yourself a little bit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There it is, plain as a pikestaff, that when it comes to matters of privilege, when there is a complaint of a matter of privilege, the House debates it. And it is also provided in our Standing Orders because if it is a matter of privilege it stands referred to the Committee of Privileges. What do you find when you look at the Standing Orders relating to the Committee of Privileges? That is Standing Order 95(7), \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Committee of Privileges. I do not want to read the whole of that Standing Order but it is paragraph (e) of that Standing Order which is relevant and that is this: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Leader of the House shall, upon receiving notice from the Clerk that copies of a report from the Committee have been made available to Members, give notice of a motion expressing the opinion of Parliament in regard to the report.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that is clear to the Leader of the House. What the Standing Order says is that when a matter of privilege has been referred to the Committee of Privileges, and they submit a report,that report on a matter of privilege must be debated in Parliament because the Leader of the House shall, once he receives the report, \"give notice of a motion expressing the opinion of Parliament in regard to the report.\" This is why at the last sitting I said I expected the Leader of the House to have given notice of a motion on this petition which affected the privilege of this House. But, of course, he did not. And this is why I tried to raise it on a point of order, and I was told that I was out of order in raising it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that interpretations of sections are for the courts in proceedings that come before the courts. Here, we have been asked to determine this interpretation. Here is a member of the public who writes to Parliament, to the high court of Parliament, to determine whether there has been a breach of privilege. And it is incumbent on us as Members of Parliament to decide that for ourselves whether it is a breach of privilege. The Leader would appear to take refuge or seek refuge behind the Attorney-General and his opinion. But that would be to (again I have to repeat) abdicate the functions of this House. Are we, representatives of the people, not qualified to decide on whether there has been a breach of privilege or not? This Government talks, times without number, about the quality of its Members, \"They are all graduates, they are all professional men, top calibre.\" And now we have the Leader of the House saying we cannot decide on it. We have to accept what the Attorney-General says. It is not for the Attorney-General, Members of the House, to decide on the privileges of this House. It is for the Members of this House to decide the privileges and whether there has been any breach of that privilege. So I am sorry, but the Leader's reply to my \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> motion is no reply. It is a complete evasion and avoidance of the issue raised in this motion and may I say that I find that very regrettable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I may not be a lawyer but I know where to go if I want legal opinion. I know whose opinion I should accept with confidence. It is up to this House certainly to decide whether they want to exercise their powers and decide on this matter of interpreting the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what I asked you to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Yes, and this House will decide when it decides on your motion. And as to whether I, as the Leader of the House, should have submitted a report to this House, that depends precisely upon whether the matter was considered by the Committee of Privileges or the Public Petitions Committee. The Member is entitled to his opinion. As I have said, both the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General and the Members of the Petitions Committee, did not come to a decision just in a flash. They also referred to Erskine May. They also referred to cases going back to, I do not know how many centuries. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> I am not giving way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> No. What point of order? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Leader is misleading the House. On a point of order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He says that the Committee - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, could you please resume your seat? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> resumed his seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the point I am making is that I have also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> seen a memorandum running to about 50 pages. It is quite clear that this matter is not as simple as the two Members would like to make it out to be. So it is up to this House to decide whether the particulars of the case require the House to decide immediately what the interpretation should be. And I am saying we should reject the motion and the House should decide that this matter should be left to the courts to decide. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You should not reject the motion? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> We know we are going by good advice that in this particular case it does not require the House to pre-empt an interpretation by the court. Of course, the two Members would not agree with me. I do not expect them to agree with this. But I expect them to abide by the decision of this House as to whether the House should make a pronouncement immediately or leave it to the court to decide. And in this particular case I say we reject the motion, and leave it to the court to come out with its interpretation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I again (it is already 8.20) - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> You can put it to the vote. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, no, we are not going to put it to the vote until I have finished because I am the mover of this motion. May we know from the Leader of the House, without any shilly-shallying, without being equivocal in all his answers, whether, first of all, this petition concerns a matter of privilege and, secondly, whether he agrees that the practice in England as set out in Erskine May is for all matters of privilege to be debated by the House? And if he agrees with that, would he tell this House when was this petition debated by this House? He says we can, of course, decide. But this is exactly what - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> This is exactly for the House to decide. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> This is exactly what I am saying in this Motion that this House should decide on the complaint. It has not been decided by this House. It should be debated in open Parliament on this quest- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ion and then, for the information of the Leader of the House, we will show that there is clearly a breach of privilege. There is abundant authority for it. But I do not want to go into that because this is not the point. I am taking it up purely on a procedural point. The petition has not been dealt with, as required by Standing Orders and by the practice in the United Kingdom Parliament. That is my point, it has not been dealt with. And the poor petitioner has not even been told. But now, of course, he will be told that Parliament has not even dealt with his petition. It was a waste of time writing to Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> I think I ought to make two points clear, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. First of all, whether this matter should be considered by the Public Petitions Committee or the Privileges Committee. I have been advised - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By the Attorney-General. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> - that the particular clause establishing the Public Petitions Committee of this Parliament is not exactly the same as that in the United Kingdom. Secondly, the question of whether parliamentary privilege in this particular case has been in some way infringed is precisely the point that is before the court. And I say, \"Let the court decide.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I heard the Leader of the House say that he has been advised that something is not the same as the practice in England.

I did so because of the bewilderment and consternation that swept through Singapore and not only just from the hundreds or thousands of investors but from the public at the complete silence or explanation from the Government on the events that shook Singapore in the first week of December last year. There have been letters to the press, frantic calls to the papers from members of the public asking for information. But not a word from the Government. And so I felt it my bounden duty to raise this matter before this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, at that time, I was not aware that the Minister would make a Ministerial Statement. My Party had called for a commission of inquiry into the events and when we saw that there was no reply forthcoming from the Government on our call, we repeated that call a week later. We also suggested that Parliament should be convened so that the Minister may make a statement for the information of the Members and the public. That was also not forthcoming and so I claimed the right to speak on the Adjournment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were told that the Minister was going to make a Ministerial Statement, I thought perhaps it would not be necessary now for me to claim the right to speak on this matter on the Adjournment Motion because the Minister might explain everything. But may I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, having heard the Minister through, he has not revealed anything. He has not given away anything. The statement has been tight-lipped, as have been the statements of the Government before this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the ramifications of the events that led to the suspension of the trading of the Stock Exchange do not concern just the simple failure of a public listed company. It goes far beyond that. About the time that the Stock Exchange was closed, I happened to meet \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a man who should know about the operations of the Stock Exchange and the market and he summed it up all in one word. He said, \"It is all plain greed.\" Greed on whose part? Greed on the part of some stockbrokers. And, of course, from what we now know, it is quite clear that the debacle was the work of a group of unscrupulous manipulators, aided and abetted by a small number of equally unscrupulous and greedy stockbrokers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here we have a group of people who, it would appear, deliberately went about to bring the market to the verge of collapse, giving full rein to their greed. And what they did precipitated unprecedented monetary loss, hardship and mental anguish to thousands of our small shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude and seriousness of the problem, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, must be seen in the fact that nearly 20% of the total market capitalization was wiped out. The Minister tries to minimize the damage that has been done to Singapore and to its chances of becoming a financial centre. I thought that was the declared aim of this Government, that Singapore should become a financial centre. But here we have what has been described as a crippling blow delivered to these efforts. The Minister seeks to minimize these, as I said, but if the Minister thinks that a 20% loss in the capitalization is not something to lose sleep over, then I do not know what is the loss to Singapore over which he would lose some sleep. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Stock Exchange was closed. Did the MAS decide on the closure of the Stock Exchange? In the programme \"24 hours\" broadcast over the BBC, a commentator, on being told that Singapore had close its Stock Exchange, commented that it would appear that whoever was in charge had lost his cool, or was panic-stricken. He commented that even during the Great Depression the Wall Street Exchange did not close. He said that this must result in investors all over the world losing confidence in the ability of the Singapore Government and the authorities to manage Singapore's financial affairs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Far Eastern Economic Review, in its issue for the 19th December, 1985, said \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that the suspension had put Singapore damagingly on the map. People who had not known of the Stock Exchange of Singapore knew now about it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal called it a body blow to the efforts of the Singapore Government to establish itself as a world financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Times said there would be unhappiness abroad at the way the authorities had tolerated the stockbroking practices which lay at the heart of the crises and failed to monitor the lending activities of the banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these financial journals were expressing their amazement that the authorities in Singapore had allowed this to happen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a startling revelation in the Minister's Statement, and that is, that the Stock Exchange Committee was self-regulating and therefore the MAS did not wish to interfere too much but allowed them to carry on. He said that the MAS was aware of forward contracts as early as February or March, 1985, referred it to the Stock Exchange Committee and asked them to look into it. I asked him whether there was a member from the Monetary Authority of Singapore sitting on the Stock Exchange Committee and his answer was that there was not anybody. But there is, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the present Securities Industry Act a provision which says that the Minister may establish an advisory body to advise him on matters relating to the Securities Industry. And on this body persons from the business community, the Government and the Monetary Authority should sit. What is important is that this advisory body has the power to inquire into any matter or thing related to the Securities Industry. So was there an advisory body or consultative body existing? If there was, did it exercise the powers given to it by subsection (2) of section (3), \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to enquire into any matter or thing related to the securities industry and for this purpose may summon any person to give evidence on oath or affirmation or produce any document or material necessary for the purpose of the enquiry.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the MAS doing? I think the people of Singapore have to be told. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have not got very much time. But one of the things, the cornerstone of a democratic government, is the accountability, the accountability of the government or the Administration to the people. The government must accept responsibility. The government must answer to the people. How has this Government discharged its duty of being accountable to the people for what took place in the first week of December? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government sent a civil servant to answer the questions. He held a press conference on the 4th December. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that press conference was to no avail in answering any of the questions that the public wished to know. I could read the report on that press conference as published in the Straits Times of 4th December as it makes very interesting reading. Mr Pillay has asked whether he would name the bad guys, the bad stockbroking firms, and he says, \"I leave it to the stock exchange to reveal their names.\" Silence from the gentlemen on his left. Then he was asked, \"Wouldn't you think it was a matter of public interest?\", the journalist tried again. Mr Pillay: \"You've got a point. We'll take it into account.\" So the journalists press on. They were trying to discharge their duty to the people. They asked, \"So why should one company's failure lead to such a colossal collapse of the whole system, bringing about the unprecedented suspension of all trading?\" The expected question was asked. \"Yes,\" Mr Pillay says, \"that's a question on everybody's mind.\" And he turned to the brokers for an answer. It shows a complete incompetence of the MAS. May I tell the Minister - I am sorry I have to say this - I know he did not take up the Minister's post until sometime in the middle of last year. May I tell him that he should not have sent a civil servant to chair the conference. He should have attended the conference. That is all what Ministerial responsibility is about. I am sorry to have to preach to this Government, but it would appear that the Government is not aware of Ministerial responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants are not there to take the responsibility and to account to the people. They are there to carry out the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> policies decided by the Ministers, by the politicians. So I say to the Minister that he should have attended this press conference. I am sorry to have to say this but public accountability, Ministerial responsibility, requires that the Minister should resign if he does not discharge his functions and accepts his responsibility for what has happened. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, you have one minute left. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to know what is the great obstacle to the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry? As was said by a letter to the Straits Times on the 7th December, 1985: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nothing must be swept under the carpet or foreign investors will simply go elsewhere.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is crying out for full information. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, here we have a situation where some millions of dollars have evaporated and the Government refuses to hold an inquiry. The Government refuses to account to the people. I ask that the Minister should recommend immediately to the Cabinet in discharge of its responsibility that a Commission of Inquiry be appointed so that we know why the MAS has failed completely. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, your time is up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have always been considerably impressed by the oratory of the Member for Anson, except in this instance I find that his speech on this subject 7207consists of 1% substance, about 95% meandering, and 4% of hot air. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues undoubtedly were important but they should not be taken out of context in terms of the size, the impact and seriousness of Singapore as a financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal briefly with his vast sweeping statements in saying that millions of dollars have been wiped out from the Stock Exchange capitalization. I think this is an extremely naive and simplistic \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> way of looking at prices on the Stock Exchange. I think he is referring to the one-day loss when prices dropped upon opening. I think he should realize that most of these have been recovered. So where it has evaporated, it has congealed again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prices in the stock markets move every day and it is in the nature of prices of stocks that they fluctuate. As an example, it is reported today that the Dow Jones (US Stock Exchange) fell by its largest single-day drop since 1929. In the process, due to a statement made by an Investment Counsellor, $40 billion was wiped off the value of shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Is that a real loss? By that standard, the fluctuations which have taken place over the years in the Stock Exchange of Singapore will have wiped out billions of dollars and recovered equally billions of dollars within a short time. So it is extremely naive to look at price changes over one day as wiping out the underlying assets, which is what we should be looking at. For those who may have sold on the day in question, indeed if they had sold and lost some money, this was unfortunate. But many who sold could equally have made some money except they probably did not make as much as they would have hoped to if they had bought considerably below the market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the realistic way to look at prices on the Stock Exchange is how the international investor values it, and one of the most important criteria is the price earnings ratio placed on shares by investors, both domestic and international. Even at current day prices, with the Straits Times Industrial Index standing at about 640 today, the valuation placed by international investors and the investors in general still place an average price earning ratio of 21 for Singapore stocks compared to an average of 17 in Hong Kong, 25 in Japan and 13 in the United States. So confidence in the value of our companies' assets has not evaporated by any means. Fluctuations do take place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have already talked about this in my ministerial address. Perhaps I should explain to the Member for Anson that a self-regulatory system, as practised here and until the change in the Securities \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Industry Act and as practised in the United Kingdom, places full responsibility on the Committee of the Stock Exchange to manage its own affairs. The MAS has no legal powers to enter into or inquire and demand information, and that is the defect we are trying to rectify by the new Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not giving way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> He is not giving way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am answering for your benefit now. There is an advisory body provided under the Securities Industry Council in which MAS is represented. That body's sole function, in fact, is to advise the Minister on new listings of companies. It also advises the Minister on administration of the Code on Takeovers and Mergers on stock exchange matters. If the Member for Anson wants details, we can give him facts which clearly establish that MAS has no powers which we would like to have and which are embodied in the new Securities Industry Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a self-regulation system, the Stock Exchange Committee makes its own decisions and consults the MAS on these decisions on matters of importance because it is a regulatory body for the financial system. As far as the suspension of the Stock Exchange was concerned, the decision was taken entirely independently by the Committee of the Stock Exchange after consulting with MAS and the banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You gave your consent? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes, I gave the consent simply because it was clearly impractical to insist that the Stock Exchange remain open when they clearly were not able to do so. I think that does not require a lot of logic. If we had insisted that the Stock Exchange remain open in the circumstances, does the Member for Anson believe that the prices would not have dropped? I believe that the prices in fact would have dropped twice as large. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Did he pre-empt a dropping? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Of course, not. [Interruption] But that was due to market reaction, logical or otherwise, and in a few days' time the drop was recovered and, in fact, in the process of the last few days, a good proportion of this so-called loss which the Member for Anson has mentioned has been largely recovered. I do not wish to go into the intricacies of what stock market movements mean but I think most people who are knowledgeable will understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the statement made by the Member for Anson about foreign loss of confidence, he is quoting from the BBC, the Far Eastern Economic Review, Financial Times, commentaries which suggest that the closure of the stock market in Singapore is an unprecedented tragedy of unprecedented scale. As I said earlier, investment by foreigners in our market is relatively small. Therefore, by no means, does their withdrawal of confidence mean all that much, as I have said earlier. Secondly, as to the question about the unprecedented nature of the closure, I would like to say that if it is decided that in the interest of the public in general that the stock market should be closed for two or three days in order to ensure that a proper regulated market guaranteeing the trades of all investors could be achieved after that, the decision to close, I think, was a wise one. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But it was not conveyed in the press conference. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> In fact, it was declared at the press conference that all trades were guaranteed. Rather than issuing grandiose statements about boosting market prices and encouraging people not to sell which is manifestly useless because the market is not going to believe you anyway, it was considered vital that the mechanism was put in place to ensure that no panic took place. [Interruption]. Would you please not interrupt? It was clearly a priority to ensure the mechanism was put in place to ensure that there was no panic and that was MAS' priority and it was also announced in the press conference on that day. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It wasn't. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You have one minute left, Dr Hu. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On the question of precedents in closing of markets, I would like to mention that the London Tin Market has been closed now for several months.
