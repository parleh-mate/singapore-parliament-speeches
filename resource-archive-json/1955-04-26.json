Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   authors  of  this  constitution,   with   some\r\n\r\nexceptions, were not representatives of the  people.\r\n\r\nIts  Chairman  was  a man with a very  distinguished\r\n\r\ncareer in the diplomatic service, amongst whose many\r\n\r\nachievements in life was a trip across Saudi  Arabia\r\n\r\nat  the  invitation of King Ibn Saud.

We  in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party believe that freedom  is  the\r\n\r\ninalienable  right  of any people  anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  and  it is not for any retired diplomat  who\r\n\r\nhas  travelled across Saudi Arabia or  any  colonial\r\n\r\nofficial to say that we are not fit to run;  we  are\r\n\r\nnot fit to walk; we are not even fit to stand on our\r\n\r\nown  feet. The people of Singapore - is it on a  point\r\n\r\nof  order, Sir? - I had hoped that there were  men  of\r\n\r\nstature  opposite, but I might yet  be  mistaken  in\r\n\r\nthat pious hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, Sir, that this country is fit now for\r\n\r\nfull  self-government, and, but  for  that  useless,\r\n\r\nspineless  lot  that was supposed to  represent  the\r\n\r\npeople   of   Singapore   in   that   Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission,  we would not today find ourselves  with\r\n\r\nthe   Governor's  triumvirate,  the  men  whom   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   referred   to   as   professional\r\n\r\nadministrators - and  no doubt they  are  capable  and\r\n\r\nefficient.  Finance,  law,  the  police,  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice - these are the three keys on which the whole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  operates.  The People's  Action  Party  went\r\n\r\nbefore the electorate and said that we rejected this\r\n\r\nconstitution in toto. We say this constitution is  a\r\n\r\nsham.  We  say  this constitution is colonialism  in\r\n\r\ndisguise.  Only a few days ago an eminent  supporter\r\n\r\nof  the Government Benches, who was in Bandoeng,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt exhilarated by the high rarified mountain  air\r\n\r\nin   those  parts,  was  moved  to  say  that   this\r\n\r\nconstitution   was   nothing   but   a   cloak   for\r\n\r\ncolonialism. Sir, I can only hope that his thoughts,\r\n\r\nthe  inspiration  that he received in  those  parts,\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  altogether  lost  and  that  all  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of booking air passages would have been\r\n\r\nworth-while  when  he returns  and  carries  on  the\r\n\r\ninspiration to his colleagues on the other  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House.  But  we  need not  go  to  Bandoeng  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  what the people want  is  freedom,\r\n\r\nabove   everything   else.  A   very   distinguished\r\n\r\npolitician  and diplomat once asked us  whether,  if\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party lost the  elections,  it\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that  the people  did  not  believe  in\r\n\r\nfreedom, the people did not want freedom. We did not\r\n\r\nsay  that, that if that were so, the people did  not\r\n\r\nwant  freedom. But it is quite clear that  when  the\r\n\r\npeople  on  2nd  April  decisively  rejected   those\r\n\r\nparties  which  were  tinkering  with  the  colonial\r\n\r\nsystem,  those parties which were afraid of  change,\r\n\r\nthose  parties  which advocated orderly  gradualism,\r\n\r\nthey  were  swept out because the people would  have\r\n\r\nnone of them. And if they wanted to congratulate the\r\n\r\nframers  of  this constitution, as the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  for the Colonies wishes to congratulate them,\r\n\r\nI  think  the  Chief Minister opposite and  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of his friends and colleagues would not be in\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, no one in this House knows for how\r\n\r\nlong  this constitution will last. No one knows  for\r\n\r\nhow long this Assembly will last. But for as long as\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly lasts, let it never be forgotten that\r\n\r\nthere are only 25 men here who can stand up and  say\r\n\r\n\"I  speak for the people. I speak for the people  of\r\n\r\nthe  constituency I represent\"; that  four  men  are\r\n\r\nhere  by  leave  and licence of His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  of Singapore; that they represent  no  one\r\n\r\nbut  themselves  and  their friends  whom  they  are\r\n\r\nsupposed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntypify;    and    that   the   three    professional\r\n\r\nadministrators  are in three pivotal positions.  And\r\n\r\nwe  can  only hope that there are men of stature  in\r\n\r\nthe  Front Benches opposite who will prove that this\r\n\r\nconstitution is not worth working and unworkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would therefore move that the\r\n\r\nmotion  to  thank  the Secretary of  State  for  the\r\n\r\nColonies be amended by the addition of the following\r\n\r\nwords at the end of the message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"save  and  except for that passage in  his  message\r\n\r\nwhere he congratulated all those who had taken  part\r\n\r\nin  the  working  out of the new  Constitution,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  under  the  chairmanship  of  Sir  George\r\n\r\nRendel\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not a motion of no\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the Government. We fully endorse  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy of civility and courtesy to  all\r\n\r\nthose  who are civil and courteous to us, and it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  we should return the  felicitations\r\n\r\nthat  have  been sent to us. But right across  party\r\n\r\npolitics, we must, on this first business meeting of\r\n\r\nthis  House, make a clear and categorical  assertion\r\n\r\nthat we do not accept this constitution as befitting\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore; that we do not say this  is\r\n\r\na  constitution which should be given to free men in\r\n\r\na  free world; that this is Asia and we are part  of\r\n\r\nthat  Asia  which  is  asserting  itself.  Both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Opposition, or some parts of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition - I expect some parts of the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nbe  even  more vehement than the Government  Benches\r\n\r\nopposite  in  their  defence of  the  Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission - but  apart  from them,  there  should  be\r\n\r\nagreement as the Chief Minister said six months ago,\r\n\r\nthis constitution is out-moded; we do not thank  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  framed it; and that is the amendment  I\r\n\r\nseek to move, and I hope the Chief Minister and  his\r\n\r\nfriends and colleagues are still of the opinion they\r\n\r\nwere  when they went before the electorate and  said\r\n\r\n\"This constitution is no good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to second the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nadded, be there added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

There will be conflicts, Sir, there is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  about  it, but the policy, the  doctrine,  of\r\n\r\ncollective Ministerial responsibility will, I think,\r\n\r\nprevail  in all circumstances, and make it  workable\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is  goodwill. Whatever  the  conflicts\r\n\r\nwithin  the Ministerial ranks, it must be remembered\r\n\r\nthat the people have the majority representation  in\r\n\r\nthe  Council of Ministers, and the majority decision\r\n\r\nwill prevail, and I am satisfied, with only the past\r\n\r\nfortnight's  experience,  that  I  will   have   the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Ministers'  loyal  co-operation  in   this\r\n\r\nHouse, whatever the conflicts within the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Sir George Rendel has been somewhat\r\n\r\nslightingly referred to. I can say that I view  with\r\n\r\namazement  what  has been achieved in  view  of  the\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  the  times  when  certain  so-called\r\n\r\nleaders  of the people of this country advised  him.\r\n\r\nSir,  but five months ago language was used in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  which I dare not have used myself  and  would\r\n\r\nnever dream of using, language of so discourteous  a\r\n\r\ncharacter that I have no doubt you would not  permit\r\n\r\nit,  but  which I trust you will permit me  to  read\r\n\r\nsince it is from the records of our predecessors. On\r\n\r\nthe  2nd of November, 1954, the President and leader\r\n\r\nof  the  then only existing political party  of  any\r\n\r\nstanding, Mr C. C.

I  do\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  we are not considering  that  subject\r\n\r\nnow.  If  the constitution suggested by  Sir  George\r\n\r\nRendel has been faulty, I would say that it was  not\r\n\r\nthe fault of Sir George Rendel or the members of the\r\n\r\ncommittee;  it  was  the  fault  of  the  people  of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Rubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

We  had  not mobilised our  resources  and\r\n\r\norganised  political movements in the  way  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  have,  the fact being that the  people  have\r\n\r\nbeen  organised into various political camps,  which\r\n\r\nhas  enabled  the Government to split hairs  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  scene. For example, we have a  number  of\r\n\r\npolitical  parties here. They all  have  always  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people at heart. They all aim at one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthing, but in different ways. If the whole political\r\n\r\nstructure  had  been  based  on  one  ideology   and\r\n\r\nthought,  i.e. the political emancipation  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry, then I would say that we would have  got  a\r\n\r\nbetter  constitution than the one which we  have  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment.  On  the one hand, we  had  the  people\r\n\r\ndivided into various parties, and a solid Government\r\n\r\nbloc   on   the  other  hand.  The  people   divided\r\n\r\nthemselves,  and  therefore we  had  to  suffer  the\r\n\r\nconsequences. All we can do at the moment is to seek\r\n\r\na better future, reorganize our political parties in\r\n\r\nthe  best  possible way, and see that in the  coming\r\n\r\nyears we get a better constitution. It may be, as my\r\n\r\ncolleague  has suggested, that the constitution  may\r\n\r\nbreak,  but  we  will  have another  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nholding general elections and put matters right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in opposing this move, may I suggest that I\r\n\r\nhave no intention of going into details of the whole\r\n\r\nmessage.

Again we must see that credit\r\n\r\nmust  be given to those pioneers who are setting  us\r\n\r\nup towards the road to independence. We cannot, at a\r\n\r\njump, achieve what other nations have achieved after\r\n\r\na long time, but we do not at the same time say that\r\n\r\nwe  are not fit for anything. I think it is the duty\r\n\r\nof  Members  of this House to see that we  must  get\r\n\r\nindependence as fast as we can take it. I  think  it\r\n\r\nis important that we should give this constitution a\r\n\r\nfair  trial, and as it becomes evident that  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to  take  on  more responsibilities,  then  we\r\n\r\nshould  so frame our constitution again in order  to\r\n\r\nachieve the early aims of independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of colonialism, paternalism and all\r\n\r\nthat,  I  believe  that  there  are  two  forms   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism. We do not want both. Perhaps we are now\r\n\r\ntrying  to  get rid of one, but we do not  want  the\r\n\r\nother type of colonialism. That is not only going to\r\n\r\ntie   us  physically,  but  will  also  tie  us   up\r\n\r\nspiritually.   We   detest  that   other   form   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of the leader of my Party, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  he has been a good man, a very reasonable man.\r\n\r\nIf  he  had not been, he would not have been elected\r\n\r\nonce,  and again, and I believe that he was not  far\r\n\r\nbehind when the votes were counted. Such a man  has\r\n\r\ngiven  his  service to this country for a  long  and\r\n\r\ncontinuous period, and I think credit must be  given\r\n\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the,motion that stands in my name is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its thanks to His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Governor for his Address delivered on\r\n\r\nFriday, 22nd April, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this motion, Sir, it is traditional that the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government is debated, its point of\r\n\r\nview is amplified, and the Opposition has an\r\n\r\nopportunity to attack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in our history, Sir, it is perhaps\r\n\r\nappropriate to look back a little to see how and why\r\n\r\nour policy has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevolved  the way it has shaped in the Address.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  have heard that at the beginning  Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  a village situate where this Assembly House now\r\n\r\nstands,  and today it is the tenth busiest  port  in\r\n\r\nthe  world with a population of more than a million.\r\n\r\nIn  between,  Sir, we have established a gold-mining\r\n\r\ntown  economy. The law of the jungle translated into\r\n\r\nbusiness  terms was our basic philosophy of economy,\r\n\r\nand  the god of money was the god of gods. Our gold,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  our geographical position - we are  at  the\r\n\r\ncrossroads  of the world; and also in the  flood  of\r\n\r\nexpatriates  from  many lands who  flocked  to  this\r\n\r\nterritory  to  make  their  fortunes.  The   English\r\n\r\nexpatriates,  Sir, whom Sir Stamford Raffles  called\r\n\r\n\"merchant  adventurers of our nation\",  using  their\r\n\r\nmilitary and their political power, backed by  their\r\n\r\neconomic  resources  and  experience,  maintained  a\r\n\r\nrigid  and  overwhelming domination over  the  Asian\r\n\r\nexpatriates to whom was relegated the role of worker\r\n\r\nants.  These are the people who became the  merchant\r\n\r\nprinces,   the  taipans  of  the  East,   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment officials their willing satellites.  They\r\n\r\nfound it convenient, Sir, for the better control  of\r\n\r\nthe  mass  of Asian labour, without which this  port\r\n\r\nwould  not have developed, to permit some few Asians\r\n\r\nto achieve prominence in the economic field - and only\r\n\r\nin  the  economic field. A sharp line of  domination\r\n\r\nwas   drawn  between  the  white  man - lord  of   the\r\n\r\nearth - and   the   Asian,  his  humble   slave,   his\r\n\r\ninarticulate  slave. To support this  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic set-up, we had that very convenient  theory\r\n\r\nthat  in  Singapore nobody lives, that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nbut  a  port of call. It is known as the  theory  of\r\n\r\nexpatriates,  the land of expatriates. Singapore  is\r\n\r\nonly the land of the prospectors for gold. The white\r\n\r\nman did not live here permanently, was not domiciled\r\n\r\nhere,  and  it  was  convenient to  assume  and  for\r\n\r\nGovernment to proceed on the basis that nobody lived\r\n\r\nhere,  and  eyes were closed to the cemeteries  that\r\n\r\nproved  this  theory  false.  It  was  a  convenient\r\n\r\ntheory, Sir, because it meant that Government had no\r\n\r\nobligations  for social services of any nature.  Its\r\n\r\nonly  obligation was to hold the ring  and  let  the\r\n\r\nprospectors slug it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout,  making quite certain that the expatriate  from\r\n\r\nthe  West had such political assistance that he  was\r\n\r\nat  all times the victor, the dominating factor,  in\r\n\r\nevery  strategic aspect of our life. The  Government\r\n\r\nservices,  Sir,  were keyed to the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nwealthy,  and only the wealthy. It is  true  we  had\r\n\r\nmedical    services,   but    that    is    because,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  Sir,  we have  never  been  able  to\r\n\r\neducate  the bug of disease to recognise the  sacred\r\n\r\ndivision between the wealthy and the poor, and so we\r\n\r\nhad to have medical services for the poor as well as\r\n\r\nfor the rich in order to protect the rich. There was\r\n\r\nno  need  for  schools,  Sir,  since  there  was  no\r\n\r\nexpatriate  to educate. It was soon found,  however,\r\n\r\nthat  the  commercial machine required  cheap  local\r\n\r\nfodder,  and  so  we  had schools  that  turned  out\r\n\r\ntambies  and  clerks. Just a few. The  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren,  who  did not exist in  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, had to depend on mission schools, on the\r\n\r\nprivate  charity  of  communal  schools;  but  large\r\n\r\nsections of them, Sir, were left uneducated; and how\r\n\r\nconvenient!  because  the uneducated  are  far  more\r\n\r\ndocile and far more amenable to the role of economic\r\n\r\nslaves.  They  formed our bulk of untrained  labour,\r\n\r\ncheap  labour,  Sir, and every effort  was  made  to\r\n\r\ndepress the labourers as far as possible. Our  gates\r\n\r\nwere  thrown open to floods of emigrants to maintain\r\n\r\ncheap  labour  to the greater glory  of  the  profit\r\n\r\nearner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was our tender regard for the wealthy that\r\n\r\nGovernment  never  dared suggest  that  they  should\r\n\r\ncontribute  anything  to the  cost  of  running  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The cost of running the Government  was\r\n\r\nlargely defrayed by profits from the sale of  opium,\r\n\r\nencouraged amongst the poor, the coolies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days when I was young, Sir, I remember\r\n\r\nvividly  one  sunny day watching a Chinese  labourer\r\n\r\nhefting heavy bales from a lorry to a godown, and  I\r\n\r\nsaid  to him, \"How much do you earn?\", and he  said,\r\n\r\n\"50  to  60 cents a day.\" I asked, \"What do  you  do\r\n\r\nwith  it?\" He said he spent 35 to 40 cents on opium;\r\n\r\nand   when   I   protested  at  this   extraordinary\r\n\r\nextravagance, his calm reply was \"If  I  don't  have\r\n\r\nopium, what have I to live for?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this coolie, Sir, thrown on the slag-heap of\r\n\r\nour  gold-mining town economy, who has largely  been\r\n\r\nresponsible for the development of our port.  It  is\r\n\r\nthis  coolie who has paid for our Government in  the\r\n\r\npast. It is the sweat and the misery of this coolie,\r\n\r\nextracted  from  him in generous measure,  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  transmuted to the milk and the honey on  which\r\n\r\nthe  wealthy  feed to slake their queer  thirst  for\r\n\r\nmore  money.  It is on this slag-heap, Sir,  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  that  we are sacrificing the  mass  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation,  the hundreds of thousands who  live  in\r\n\r\nsties,  in dens of disease, on pavements, the  large\r\n\r\nmass  of our school children who have to depend upon\r\n\r\nprivate  charity for education. It is on this  slag-heap  that  we find our vaunted standard of  living,\r\n\r\nthe  highest in Asia. Even if that were  true,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  it  amounts  to is this. It  is  depressingly,\r\n\r\nunnecessarily, dreadfully low - $3l a week is what our\r\n\r\nmanual  worker gets - when he gets work - $3l  a  week!\r\n\r\nCan hon. Members understand $31 a week?\r\n\r\n- to  have  a family, a home and to live normally - and\r\n\r\nthis  in  the richest country in all Asia,  with  an\r\n\r\nestimated  income  every year of $2,000  million  or\r\n\r\nmore! The smouldering embers of the slag-heap,  Sir,\r\n\r\nare  throwing  out  poisonous fumes  of  hatred,  so\r\n\r\nbitter that it cannot distinguish between the system\r\n\r\nand the rulers. These fumes and this slag-heap are a\r\n\r\ndanger  to the health of the entire people  of  this\r\n\r\nterritory. They are a menace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context, Sir, that Government laid\r\n\r\nits  plans,  and it is because of this context  that\r\n\r\nprimary  emphasis was laid on the need,  the  urgent\r\n\r\nneed, to free the people of this territory from  the\r\n\r\ntwin   evils  of  racial  domination  and   economic\r\n\r\nslavery.  It is my belief that in this constitution,\r\n\r\nwhich  we have so recently heard attacked, lies  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to achieve those aims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been called a political\r\n\r\ninnocent-[Interruption.] (yes, out of the mouths  of\r\n\r\nbabes and sucklings it has been said, I would remind\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member) - and that, Sir, because I am told  I\r\n\r\nplace  too much faith in the English. Sir,  in  this\r\n\r\ncity  of my birth, which holds a unique position  of\r\n\r\nbeing the crossroads\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the world, many peoples and many cultures  meet,\r\n\r\nand  differing peoples absorb different  proportions\r\n\r\nof the various cultures. I will freely admit that by\r\n\r\nvirtue of my education, particularly by virtue of my\r\n\r\ntraining  and  professional  calling,  I  have  come\r\n\r\nstrongly under the influence of English concepts  of\r\n\r\nliving. Sir, I will freely admit that, whatever  the\r\n\r\ntransient antagonisms, I am basically pro-English. I\r\n\r\nknow it is supposed to be political suicide to admit\r\n\r\nit.  I  have  been  told that repeatedly  during  my\r\n\r\ncampaign.  I  believe in facing facts, Sir. I  seek\r\n\r\nnothing for myself, and from that fortunate point  I\r\n\r\ncan  indulge in the luxury of the truth.  During  my\r\n\r\npolitical  campaign, whatever might  have  been  the\r\n\r\nadverse  effects  of admitting it,  I  clarified  my\r\n\r\nposition and I would like to repeat it. As a Malayan\r\n\r\nI have naturally sought to lean backwards against my\r\n\r\nnatural  bias  in order to assess wherein  lies  the\r\n\r\ntrue welfare of the people of this territory, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  come back always to the same conclusion. I  am\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  the great majority of  the  English\r\n\r\npeople  are  now conscious of the evils of  colonial\r\n\r\nrule,  and  I  will  say this to some  of  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers opposite - it is not fair to judge the English\r\n\r\npeople  by  the  conduct of the old guard  colonials\r\n\r\nwhom  we  find  in  these  territories.  It  was  an\r\n\r\nEnglishman,  Prof.  Silcock  of  the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  who  said, \"Colonial rule  is  unbelievably\r\n\r\ncorrupting to the ruler and to the ruled alike.\" But\r\n\r\nthose  of  us who have had the privilege of  knowing\r\n\r\nthe  English people in England will, I think,  admit\r\n\r\nthat  the Englishman is as fine and decent  a  human\r\n\r\nbeing as any anywhere, and his consciousness of  the\r\n\r\nevils  of  colonial  rule has brought  about - need  I\r\n\r\nremind hon. Members? - the independence of India,  our\r\n\r\ngreat neighbour, and those other great neighbours of\r\n\r\nours -  Burma and Ceylon. I hope some will remind  me\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  the Labour Government which  conceded\r\n\r\nthat  independence.  I think in  fairness  I  should\r\n\r\nindicate  that only recently Sir Winston Churchill's\r\n\r\nGovernment - a  Conservative Government I believe - gave\r\n\r\nSudan its independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

We    are    the    richer    territory\r\n\r\nproportionately, and if there is to be union we  may\r\n\r\nhave  to share our wealth. The Government is not  of\r\n\r\nthe  view that money is the all-important factor  in\r\n\r\nhuman   life  and  as  soon  as  the  newly  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   Federation  is  ready,  we   shall   open\r\n\r\nnegotiations  for  a  union  to  lead  directly   to\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-government, Sir, and even more, independence,\r\n\r\nrequires  a domiciled civil service, and although  I\r\n\r\nam  advised that Malayanisation of the civil service\r\n\r\nhas  been  the  policy for many years,  the  present\r\n\r\nposition  is most unsatisfactory and this matter  is\r\n\r\nreceiving  anxious priority consideration  from  our\r\n\r\nside   of  the  House.  There  will  be  no  further\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  expatriates  except  in  imperative\r\n\r\ncircumstances where we have no alternative, and even\r\n\r\nthen, even then, generally on contract only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Always.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, that is the political aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic field Government is anxious not to\r\n\r\nalarm  capital. We do not wish to do anything  which\r\n\r\nwould prejudice the already meagre livelihood of our\r\n\r\npeople,  and  in order to achieve our twin  aims  of\r\n\r\nincreasing trade and commerce and industry,  and  to\r\n\r\nmove  steadily towards a welfare state, we plan,  as\r\n\r\nhon. Members have heard, to have an economic adviser\r\n\r\nof  world repute, an economic planning commission of\r\n\r\nmen  of  recognised standing, and a  trade  advisory\r\n\r\ncouncil   representative  of  all   commercial   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  interests in this  territory  to  advise\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Hon. Members need not  fear  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  hinder Government's aims. There is no question\r\n\r\nof  that. But it is our view, Sir, that business men\r\n\r\nwho,  by virtue of survival in competitive callings,\r\n\r\nare normally of more than average intelligence, once\r\n\r\nthey  are  satisfied  that we are  being  guided  by\r\n\r\nexperts, once they are satisfied that they  have  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  men who seek to give them fair treatment\r\n\r\nand   not   the   Frankensteins  of   their   heated\r\n\r\nimagination,  we  believe  that  these  people  will\r\n\r\nawaken  to a realisation of one important factor  to\r\n\r\ncommerce, and that is this, that the success of  our\r\n\r\nwelfare  projects  will mean  greater  security  for\r\n\r\ntheir own investments in this territory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of housing, Sir, my friend and\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Local Government,  Lands\r\n\r\nand Housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Inche  Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat), will deal  with\r\n\r\nthis,  but  I think I should deal briefly  with  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  Government with reference  to  immovable\r\n\r\nproperty.   Immovable  property  is   an   essential\r\n\r\ncommodity  of life, as necessary to human beings  as\r\n\r\nfood  and  water. To-date, Sir, there has  been  the\r\n\r\nmost extraordinary profiteering in pursuance of  our\r\n\r\njungle law economy in that essential commodity,  and\r\n\r\nthis  to the very grave prejudice of the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of this territory. There  is  the  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition Bill which our predecessors did not care\r\n\r\nto  pass. The Government is of the view that that is\r\n\r\nvery  anaemic, whatever others may have thought.  It\r\n\r\nis  wholly  inadequate, and it is our  intention  to\r\n\r\nbring  before you a comprehensive bill freezing  all\r\n\r\nvalues   of   immovable  property,   probably   with\r\n\r\nretrospective effect to the date of the Address, and\r\n\r\nwe will seek additional powers of acquisition. There\r\n\r\nwill be no more profiteering in land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to some, the question of free legal aid may\r\n\r\nseem  minor. I am of the view that it could  have  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  influence on the life of the  people  of\r\n\r\nthis  country,  and  a  truly beneficial  influence.\r\n\r\nThose  of  us, Sir, who know our system of  justice,\r\n\r\nknow  the  comfort  and the pride  we  take  in  it,\r\n\r\nrecognise that it is one of the principal pillars of\r\n\r\nthe   development   of   this   territory.   It   is\r\n\r\nunfortunately  true, Sir, that  the  heavy  cost  of\r\n\r\nlegal   assistance  in  many  instances   makes   it\r\n\r\nimpossible  for  the common man to obtain  the  full\r\n\r\nprotection  and  seek  the  full  advantage  of  our\r\n\r\nmagnificent system of justice. I know, Sir, as  does\r\n\r\nmy  hon.  Friend opposite, that a certain amount  of\r\n\r\ngood  work  is being done in the Social  Welfare  to\r\n\r\nadvise  those  in need on legal problems.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso  in forma pauperis procedure which some  fifty\r\n\r\npeople   a   year  take  advantage  of.  These   are\r\n\r\nsuperficial palliatives. It is the intention of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take  the  law  to  the  people,  to\r\n\r\ndecentralise our law courts as far as possible,  and\r\n\r\nby   making   available  fully   trained   qualified\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees  in a  legal  aid  bureau,  to\r\n\r\nassist the poor both in civil and criminal cases,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand in advice out of Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been hoped that today we would have at least\r\n\r\none  more  Bill  tabled, Sir, the  City  and  Island\r\n\r\nCouncil  Bill. The Government recognises how  urgent\r\n\r\nis  the measure and how important that we should not\r\n\r\nfurther  prolong the prolonged life of  the  present\r\n\r\nCity  Council,  which  does  not  reflect  the  true\r\n\r\nbalance  of  opinion of the people of the territory.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  principles  of  an  extremely  important\r\n\r\ncharacter connected with that Bill have been raised,\r\n\r\nand all I can say is that we shall do our utmost  to\r\n\r\npresent it at the next meeting, on the 24th of May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a short acquaintance, a very short\r\n\r\nacquaintance, with Government, does seem to indicate\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  apt  in many spheres  to  live  on  a\r\n\r\nsomewhat  extravagant scale, and we intend  to  take\r\n\r\naction  shortly to bring about a realisation by  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Departments  of  the  important  need   for\r\n\r\neconomy. Every dollar saved, Sir, is an extra dollar\r\n\r\nfor social services for which there is such a crying\r\n\r\nneed. In every sphere of Government activity Members\r\n\r\nsitting  on  this side of the House are  finding  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to reassess the existing policy and to lay\r\n\r\ndown  fresh  instructions. The task is considerable.\r\n\r\nOur  programme has been called ambitious.  I  freely\r\n\r\nadmit   we   are  ambitious,  very  ambitious.   Our\r\n\r\nambition,  Sir, is to bring hope and  sustenance  to\r\n\r\nthe  frustrated and the dispossessed majority of the\r\n\r\npeople in this Island. Our hope is to gather in  the\r\n\r\nbitter,  the angry, the despairing, within the  warm\r\n\r\nfold  of  fellowship and mutual  help  in  a  united\r\n\r\npeople. Our hope is to bring a realisation, Sir,  to\r\n\r\nthese people so far left out in the cold, that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  their Government, that  we  on  this\r\n\r\nFront Bench are not the heaven-born, sitting on  the\r\n\r\nsnow-capped  peaks of Olympus, but in all  sincerity\r\n\r\ntheir  servants, seeking their welfare.  It  is  our\r\n\r\nhope  to  bring this Government to the  people  ever\r\n\r\nmore closely, so that it can be true that it is they\r\n\r\nwho govern. If we can only impress the people with a\r\n\r\nrealisation,  with the vision that  is  ours,  of  a\r\n\r\npeaceful  evolution to a dignified way of  life  for\r\n\r\nall the domiciled races of this country,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, we may look forward with confidence to the  day\r\n\r\nwhen the various peoples and the various cultures of\r\n\r\nthis  country  have  so  inspired  each  other  that\r\n\r\nSingapore, the crossroads of the world, will be  the\r\n\r\nbrightest star in the Eastern sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our ambition, and this is our task, Sir,\r\n\r\nand  I  would like to say to Members opposite, \"This\r\n\r\nis  your  task  too.\" I expect, we  all  expect,  we\r\n\r\nwelcome from hon.

We shall endeavour to implement\r\n\r\nthe policies laid down in His Excellency's Speech in\r\n\r\na spirit of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhonesty  and  a  sincerity of purpose, for these are  two  assets which this Government has in abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been indicated in His Excellency's Address,\r\n\r\nthree  of the important measures that we propose  to\r\n\r\ncarry  fall within my portfolio as the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government, Lands and Housing. The  first  is\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  freeze  the  values  of   immovable\r\n\r\nproperty  and give the Government additional  powers\r\n\r\nfor  the  acquisition of land for  public  purposes.\r\n\r\nSuch  legislation is designed to ensure  that  land,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  very scarce and valuable commodity  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at the present moment, is made  available\r\n\r\nto  the people at reasonably non-speculative prices.\r\n\r\nThis  is necessary if the Government is to keep  its\r\n\r\npledge  of improving the standard of living  of  the\r\n\r\npoorer classes and providing them with adequate low-cost housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it is proposed to tackle the housing\r\n\r\nproblem  more vigorously and efficiently by  setting\r\n\r\nup a statutory Housing Authority, solely responsible\r\n\r\nto  Government,  to  replace the  present  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. It is hoped that such  a  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority  would  be  able in a comparatively  short\r\n\r\ntime  to  bridge  the increasing gap between  public\r\n\r\nhousing programmes and the needs of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third important measure for which my Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  be responsible is the introduction of a system\r\n\r\nof  land  title registration to replace the  present\r\n\r\ncumbersome and costly system under which  rights  to\r\n\r\nand  over  land are recorded by the registration  of\r\n\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superiority of land title registration over\r\n\r\nregistration of deeds is now universally recognised.\r\n\r\nThe new system will certainly result in considerable\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the  cost  to  the  public  of   land\r\n\r\nownership. As hon. Members are aware, it is proposed\r\n\r\nto  introduce  the  Torrens  system  of  land  title\r\n\r\nregistration,   a  system  which  was   successfully\r\n\r\nintroduced in South Australia about a hundred  years\r\n\r\nago,  and  later, in a more modified  form,  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to conclude by repeating to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore my assurance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat this Government, which has assumed office on  a\r\n\r\nmandate,  will work sincerely for the  promotion  of\r\n\r\ntheir well-being and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just\r\n\r\nheard  the  Chief Minister elaborating  on  what  he\r\n\r\nwould  like to do during this year. He has drawn  to\r\n\r\nus  a  picture of past Singapore. He has  painted  a\r\n\r\npicture  of  the  difficulties of the  labourer,  of\r\n\r\neconomic  exploitation, but I am more interested  in\r\n\r\nwhat  concrete plans the Government is going to  put\r\n\r\nup  to  achieve all this. Indeed, when I first heard\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency's  Address on Friday,  I  could  not\r\n\r\nfully interpret it. At most I could call it as being\r\n\r\nfor  the  most  part a mixture of  pious  hopes  and\r\n\r\nslogans.  The new Government, as we know  it  today,\r\n\r\nhas  inherited from the previous Government a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of benefit and, in many instances, it has only\r\n\r\nto  repeat and carry out such plans as have  already\r\n\r\nbeen approved. I quote instances:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is the policy of this Government to finance\r\n\r\nlow-rental  housing for those in  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>but  this was approved unanimously as a result of  a\r\n\r\nmotion   by  the  Progressive  Party  in  the   last\r\n\r\nLegislative Council. Public memory may be short, but\r\n\r\nI think credit must be given to whom credit is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important question is the union of\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  the Federation of Malaya.  We  need\r\n\r\nclarification  on this point. Is it going  to  be  a\r\n\r\nunion  like that of South Africa, or is it going  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  federal government on the basis of Australia?\r\n\r\nIn  any case, we must sound a warning that in no way\r\n\r\nmust  it be a sell-out for Singapore. The people  of\r\n\r\nthis great trading centre have a right to be assured\r\n\r\nthat at the minimum it must be an equal partner with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, and I hope the Government will bear\r\n\r\nthis fully in mind when it puts up any plan for  the\r\n\r\nunion.  Perhaps  you  all  know  that  not  only  is\r\n\r\nSingapore  small, but the union with the  Federation\r\n\r\nis still too small a territory to stand alone. And I\r\n\r\nbelieve that it would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery much better if it be not only a federation with\r\n\r\nthe  hinterland,  but  a  federal  union  with  such\r\n\r\nterritories as North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak.  If\r\n\r\nsuch  a  federation were to be realised,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  greater benefits would accrue to each  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  members. And I believe that it becomes not  two\r\n\r\nsections - the  port  and the hinterland - but  it  can\r\n\r\nbecome a co-operation between many territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question again of the Government\r\n\r\npolicy  on  public services, I would like  to  state\r\n\r\nthat  it has always been one of the platforms of  my\r\n\r\nParty  to Malayanise the civil service. Previous  to\r\n\r\nthis,  recruitment of expatriates has  been  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of the permanent executives, with the  Public\r\n\r\nServices  Commission acting in an advisory capacity.\r\n\r\nThe  power  now lies with the Council of  Ministers,\r\n\r\nand  if there should be unnecessary recruitment,  or\r\n\r\nfurther  recruitment, of expatriates, we  will  know\r\n\r\nwhere  that responsibility lies. It is very good  to\r\n\r\ngloss  over  what  we  want  to  do,  but  the  more\r\n\r\nimportant thing is, can we do it? How can we do  it?\r\n\r\nI  look at the policy of the Government, and I  find\r\n\r\nthat  there  must be a means whereby we can  get  to\r\n\r\nthat  end.  The question of staffing of  our  senior\r\n\r\nservices with local people ties up very closely with\r\n\r\nour   educational  system.  There  is  no   mention,\r\n\r\nhowever, of higher education in that Address.  There\r\n\r\nmight  be primary education. There might be training\r\n\r\nof  workers in industries, but no amount of  primary\r\n\r\neducation  and no amount of training of  workers  in\r\n\r\nindustry  will ever lead us to have men sufficiently\r\n\r\nqualified  to  take  over that senior  service.  The\r\n\r\nemphasis,  may  I  suggest,  should  lie  with   the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  more  secondary  schools.  We  should\r\n\r\nassist  to  a  far greater extent the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and other higher institutions of  study.  We\r\n\r\nmust  give our unstinted help to the much publicized\r\n\r\nSingapore  Polytechnic, which  was  passed  in  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Legislative Council, and if such  measures\r\n\r\nshould  be  insufficient to  meet  our  need,  would\r\n\r\nGovernment  be  prepared to augment  our  supply  of\r\n\r\nlocally trained men by granting more scholarships to\r\n\r\nour promising youths for overseas studies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the raising of the standard of\r\n\r\nliving, I believe that everyone of us in this  House\r\n\r\nhere must agree most whole-heartedly. I find in  the\r\n\r\nAddress  that  farmers and fishermen were  specially\r\n\r\nmentioned.  Farmers,  however,  need  no   fair   to\r\n\r\nstimulate  their  interest. What  is  most  urgently\r\n\r\nrequired  is more speedy development of rural  areas\r\n\r\nand  early implementation of the policy made by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  for the development  of  rural\r\n\r\nareas  with  a  grant of $20 million  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nservices to a proper standard. We have learnt in the\r\n\r\npast and for a very long time that the coastline  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not too very long, and  whatever  in-shore  fishing  by small fishermen  has  been  fully\r\n\r\nexploited.  If  we  do want to bring  in  a  greater\r\n\r\nsupply of food to lower the cost of commodities  and\r\n\r\nthereby raise the standard of living, we must search\r\n\r\nfor   other   means   such  as   organised   fishing\r\n\r\nindustries. We hope Government will encourage that,\r\n\r\nbecause  in all these cases the standard  of  living\r\n\r\ncan  only be brought down by more food to bring down\r\n\r\nprices,  or increase individual income so  that  the\r\n\r\npeople   have   more   money  to   buy   foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nEncouragement in this direction must be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We noted from the Chief Minister's Address that he\r\n\r\nhas  been  grumbling about the exploitation  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  about how the prosperity of  this  country\r\n\r\nhas  been  built  on  labour;  but  as  I  go  round\r\n\r\nSingapore  I always meet a certain group of  people,\r\n\r\nthe  most hard-hit people, the group of people  that\r\n\r\nrequires   most  assistance.  They  are  the   small\r\n\r\nhawkers.  They number thousands. High licence  fees,\r\n\r\nconstant  raids  and heavy fines  have  driven  this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  people to desperation. I have met  a  few\r\n\r\nmore unfortunate ones, and some have even said to me\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be better to be thieves rather  than\r\n\r\ntry  to  earn  an  honest living by  hawking.  Would\r\n\r\nGovernment devise ways and means to assist them earn\r\n\r\na peaceful living? Would Government try and get more\r\n\r\nopen  spaces to build shelters for them?  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat the preponderance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the number of hawkers in this country is a  good\r\n\r\nindication of the unemployment problem, and this can\r\n\r\nonly  be  avoided by an increase of industries.  And\r\n\r\nwhilst I am on this subject of unemployment, I feel,\r\n\r\ntoo,  that  unemployment in the  educated  class  of\r\n\r\npeople who are coming out of secondary schools would\r\n\r\nbe  acute.  I  forecast that  the  problem  will  be\r\n\r\nserious  in the near future. We would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat plans Government has to combat such a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Coming  round  to  the Emergency Regulations,  I  am\r\n\r\nreally  surprised  that the  new  Government  is  no\r\n\r\nbetter  than the old one. Perhaps their  views  have\r\n\r\nnow  changed,  now that they are in power.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  new  Government  is  contented  with  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of  a  few  petty  Regulations,  but  these\r\n\r\nRegulations are already dead letters. The  power  to\r\n\r\narrest without trial, the most important clause, has\r\n\r\nbeen  left  untouched. It is difficult to  reconcile\r\n\r\nthis with the Labour Front's platform which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The situation in Singapore does not warrant the\r\n\r\ncontinuation  of the Emergency Regulations  and  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Front  will  seek  the  removal   of   this\r\n\r\nunnecessary  and  undemocratic  restriction  on  the\r\n\r\nliberty of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has further reinforced this\r\n\r\nplatform over Radio Malaya by saying in no uncertain\r\n\r\nterms   that  the  Emergency  Regulations  are   not\r\n\r\njustifiable. Under the Emergency Regulations, a  man\r\n\r\ncan  be  convicted  out  of  hand  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nconfidential reports of which he and his lawyer know\r\n\r\nnothing  or  very little. We are for law and  order,\r\n\r\nbut  we believe they can be maintained without these\r\n\r\nextraordinary laws. And now I believe that those who\r\n\r\nhave  voted  Labour will know what  they  have  been\r\n\r\nvoting  for.  We  do  not, however,  say  that  this\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  Labour Government  is  wrong.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve, too, that the security of the whole  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  at large must be maintained,  but  we\r\n\r\nalways believe in an honest platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think while we are on these Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  we might also refer to such Regulations\r\n\r\nas those relating to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Publication,  Control,  Sale  and  Circulation\r\n\r\nRegulations, 1950, for the Press. These  Regulations\r\n\r\nwere  introduced in 1950 during the Korean war.  And\r\n\r\nagain  there  were  the highly  unpopular  Emergency\r\n\r\nNewspaper  Regulations  of  1951.  These  are  still\r\n\r\nallowed to remain undisturbed. I believe that it  is\r\n\r\nhigh time that such repressive Regulations should be\r\n\r\nrepealed, and I believe, too, that the laws  in  our\r\n\r\nordinary  statute  book  should  be  sufficient   to\r\n\r\ncontrol the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of social services, we must\r\n\r\ncongratulate   the  Government  for   focusing   its\r\n\r\nattention  on  the  aged,  the  disabled,  and   the\r\n\r\nunemployed.  For the youths of Singapore  at  large,\r\n\r\nhowever, the Government policy is silent.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  right  and urgency that  the  youths  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  today,  who  will  be  the  citizens   of\r\n\r\ntomorrow,  deserve  a  little  attention  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. At present youth clubs and organisations\r\n\r\nare mainly the responsibility of public spirited and\r\n\r\ngenerous  people. I would like you to  compare  what\r\n\r\nthey  did  in  England or what they are still  doing\r\n\r\nnow.  In a county called Glamorgan, where the  youth\r\n\r\npopulation is 57,500 between the ages of 11 and  20,\r\n\r\nthe total estimated expenditure for the year 1955 to\r\n\r\n1956 is \ufffd63,000. How does this compare with our  own\r\n\r\nbudget  for  assisting youth clubs? The problems  of\r\n\r\ntoday  must  be tackled. If the youths of  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  are  to  be  the good citizens  of  tomorrow,\r\n\r\nconscious   of  their  responsibilities,   then,   I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  they must be guided. Not only  must  their\r\n\r\neducation be adequately catered for in schools,  but\r\n\r\nafter  school-hours their excess  energy  and  their\r\n\r\nleisure  hours should be channelised and  guided  by\r\n\r\nexperts.  We  ask Government that it be  considered,\r\n\r\nand  that  plans  for enhanced assistance  to  youth\r\n\r\nclubs  be  considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to refer to\r\n\r\nanother point in the Address, namely income tax. The\r\n\r\npresent  income tax laws have not taken into account\r\n\r\nthe  family  unit  in Singapore, which  is  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  from that of the West. Parents  out  here\r\n\r\nare  regarded as very important parts of the family,\r\n\r\nand rightly so; they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  remain  to enjoy the support  and  continued\r\n\r\nlove  of their children even after retirement.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  here will agree with me that it is  a  good\r\n\r\nsystem.  Further, I believe we can  all  agree  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of  such an attitude, it has  made  old-age\r\n\r\npensions, as practised in Australia, unnecessary  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Furthermore, we have less people in  need\r\n\r\nof  public  assistance owing to the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment. I make this point in order that  in  our\r\n\r\nincome tax laws the regulations may be revised so as\r\n\r\nto include parents under income tax relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must come down to what has always\r\n\r\nreceived  the  popular support of all parties - multi-lingualism. My Party has never been opposed  to  it.\r\n\r\nWe  have  always  been  motivated  by  the  idea  of\r\n\r\nefficient  despatch  of  public  matters.   We   are\r\n\r\nagreeable  that any system that meets  with  popular\r\n\r\napproval  should be given a trial, and a  very  fair\r\n\r\ntrial.  We are agreeable that if it should be  tried\r\n\r\nout  in the City and Island Council, no restrictions\r\n\r\non   dialects  and  languages  should  be  made,  no\r\n\r\nsections  of any population should be debarred  from\r\n\r\nusing their language. If it is successful, I believe\r\n\r\nit will receive also the blessings of my Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before I end, I would like to assure the\r\n\r\nGovernment side that whatever proposals or  projects\r\n\r\nthat  are  good for the people and the country  will\r\n\r\nalways  receive our support. On the other  hand,  we\r\n\r\ntrust that the Government will serve all sections of\r\n\r\nthe people without bias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, I take this\r\n\r\nopportunity to express my views on certain planks on\r\n\r\nthe  Government's programme as stated in broad lines\r\n\r\nin  His  Excellency the Governor's Address  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  at  its inaugural meeting on  22nd  April,\r\n\r\n1955,  and the address by the Chief Minister  a  few\r\n\r\nmoments   ago.  The  programme  is,  of  course,   a\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  the Welfare State, which  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront has promised its electorate and now endeavours\r\n\r\nto present to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, the Government should bear in mind the\r\n\r\nfact  that  in  order to carry out the programme  it\r\n\r\nwill be necessary to consider how and from where the\r\n\r\nfunds  may be obtained. The simple answer  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  provide would, of  course,  be  the\r\n\r\nraising  of  taxation,  but  before  the  Government\r\n\r\nresorts to this measure it should first explore  all\r\n\r\npossibilities of increasing the revenue  and  income\r\n\r\nfor  the Colony. The Democratic Party has emphasized\r\n\r\nthe  importance of expanding trade and industry, and\r\n\r\nI hope that the Government will bear this in mind in\r\n\r\ncarrying out their programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government's policy on education, I am\r\n\r\npleased to note that the policy of the Government is\r\n\r\nto  aim  at equal treatment for all schools and  all\r\n\r\nteachers in those schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

By  this  I take it that  the  Government\r\n\r\nmeans  that  it intends to have a common policy  for\r\n\r\nall  schools. May I ask the Government,  is  it  for\r\n\r\nonly schools for one particular language, or schools\r\n\r\nfor all languages? And I feel and believe that there\r\n\r\nmust  be  no  discrimination  between  English   and\r\n\r\nvernacular schools. I feel also that Government  may\r\n\r\nwish  to bear in mind the underlying principle  that\r\n\r\neducation   for   all  citizens  is   properly   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's responsibility, and aids should not  be\r\n\r\nused  as  reward for behaviour nor lever  to  secure\r\n\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Additional\r\n\r\nacquisition  of lands means additional revenue.  Due\r\n\r\nregard  must be paid to the interest of  the  people\r\n\r\nwhose lands are being acquired, and safeguards  must\r\n\r\nbe  made  to  protect their interests.  Considerable\r\n\r\nextent of land has already been acquired - take,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, Changi - and this land, I believe, is  still\r\n\r\nyet undeveloped. The Government should therefore  reconsider from where this additional revenue  may  be\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Service. I, of course, heartily support the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy of Malayanisation of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  and  venture to express that it  should  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out without undue delay together  with  the\r\n\r\nattendant training schemes for local personnel.  But\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the actual meaning  of  these\r\n\r\nthree words - \"adequate abolition terms\". What does it\r\n\r\nmean  by  \"adequate  abolition terms\"?  How  do  you\r\n\r\nconsider  the  terms  to  be  adequate?  Take,   for\r\n\r\ninstance, when we engage an officer, the officer  in\r\n\r\nthis  case will say that he expects to rise  to  the\r\n\r\nrank of a Governor, and the terms to satisfy such an\r\n\r\nofficer may be colossal, and I trust that the  words\r\n\r\n\"adequate abolition terms\" will be clarified by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><div align=\"center\"><b>Suspension of Sitting</b></div><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion made and Question proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this sitting be suspended until 2.30 p.m.\"\r\n\r\n(The Chief Minister).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at 12.17 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>until 2.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 2.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The necessity for any scheme of low housing\r\n\r\nwas  so  dire and so desperately acute at that  time\r\n\r\nthat  the last Government had to do something  about\r\n\r\nit to justify its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, his reference to multi-lingualism is\r\n\r\nmost  surprising. I think his memory is very  short-lived  because  his great leader, my formidable  and\r\n\r\nTarzanesque opponent in Katong in the last election,\r\n\r\nwhen  he was publicly asked whether he or his  Party\r\n\r\nwas  in  favour of multi-lingualism, he shouted  out\r\n\r\nwith all the force at his command, \"No!

Little  does\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Serangoon  (Mr  Lim  Choon  Mong)\r\n\r\nrealize  that this is a matter for the City  Council\r\n\r\nand  not for this Assembly. I quite believe that  it\r\n\r\nis  because  of the defeat of the Progressive  Party\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Serangoon is trying  to  catch\r\n\r\npublicity in this Assembly so that by his speech  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  he  may  be able  to  hypnotise  the\r\n\r\nhawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would draw the attention of the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  that  in  the  City  Council,  when   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Hawkers Inquiry  Report  came\r\n\r\nunder  discussion, it was the Progressive Party  who\r\n\r\ncaused all the obstructions.

We are pleased that in furtherance  of  this\r\n\r\ndeclared  objective, Malayanisation  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nService occupies an important place, a first  place,\r\n\r\nin  the policy statement of the Labour Front,  which\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In pursuance of these aims (the aims of self-government) the Government intends to give its\r\n\r\nvigorous  support  to  the policy  of  staffing  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  with  locally  domiciled  officers.\r\n\r\nWhilst   seeking  this  objective,  the   Government\r\n\r\nrecognises  the  just claims of  officers  recruited\r\n\r\nfrom overseas who have taken part in building up the\r\n\r\npresent administration, and undertakes to look after\r\n\r\ntheir  interests. If any of these officers are found\r\n\r\nto be redundant as a result of the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe   Malayanisation  policy,  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nensure  that adequate abolition terms will be  fixed\r\n\r\nhaving  regard  to the interruption  of  the  career\r\n\r\nwhich  the  officer had a right to  expect  when  he\r\n\r\naccepted his appointment. In the meantime,  no  more\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers will be appointed without  prior\r\n\r\nreference   to   the  Council  of   Ministers.

We\r\n\r\nin  the People's Action Party are disappointed  that\r\n\r\nthis  policy of Malayanisation, this declaration  of\r\n\r\npolicy,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes  not  go far enough, and has not laid  down  in\r\n\r\nmore concrete terms, the methods, the ways and means\r\n\r\nby which this policy is to be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Labour Front that they were\r\n\r\nsomewhat less concerned with quelling the alarms and\r\n\r\nanxieties  of expatriate officers when  they  framed\r\n\r\ntheir  election  four-year programme?  This  present\r\n\r\ndeclaration of policy is full of solace, consolation\r\n\r\nand  reassurances, of bounties to come and  bounties\r\n\r\nto  go.  But  when they went to the electorate,  and\r\n\r\nthey were elected on this programme, they said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Labour Front stands for complete and rapid\r\n\r\nMalayanisation of the Public Services  by  domiciled\r\n\r\nofficers.  Transients, whose loyalties are elsewhere\r\n\r\nand who regard Malaya merely as a stepping-stone  in\r\n\r\ntheir personal careers, may be retained on temporary\r\n\r\ncontracts, coterminous with their utility.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is a much fiercer statement, more becoming of a\r\n\r\nvery  fierce party. But be that as it may,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front can be confident that if it  fails\r\n\r\nin  this Malayanisation policy, then it will fail as\r\n\r\nthe Progressive Party has failed, for Malayanisation\r\n\r\nis  the first test of bona fides, your first act  of\r\n\r\nfaith.  If you say, \"I am going to give you freedom,\r\n\r\nI  am  prepared to lose my job to give you freedom,\"\r\n\r\nthen let us see it in the Civil Service. Let us  see\r\n\r\nit  in  all  the  Public Services - not  just  in  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Branches - in the Legal  Branches,  in\r\n\r\nthe City Council and in the Singapore Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is necessary, first of all, to remember\r\n\r\nwhat the present position is. By the constitution of\r\n\r\nthis Colony, the Order in Council, paragraph 11, the\r\n\r\nsupreme power of appointment to any public office is\r\n\r\nvested in the Governor. It reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to the provisions of any law for the time\r\n\r\nbeing  in force in the Colony or to any instructions\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time given to the Governor under  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Sign  Manual  and  Signet  or  through  a\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State, the Governor, in Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nname  and  on  Her Majesty's behalf, may  constitute\r\n\r\nsuch judgeships and other offices for the Colony  as\r\n\r\nmay  be lawfully constituted by Her Majesty and  may\r\n\r\nmake   appointments   (including   promotions    and\r\n\r\ntransfers)   to  any  judgeship  or   other   office\r\n\r\nconstituted for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColony,  and any person so appointed shall,  unless\r\n\r\nit  is otherwise provided by law, hold office during\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Services Commission is constituted by\r\n\r\nlocal  Ordinance. It has powers only to  advise  and\r\n\r\nits  advice  can  be ignored. Over and  above  these\r\n\r\npowers  reserved by the Governor, the  Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  has  got over-riding powers, by despatch,  to\r\n\r\nappoint  any  officer  in any public  service  whose\r\n\r\ncommencing emolument is above a thousand pounds  per\r\n\r\nannum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, then, is the present situation in a\r\n\r\ndependent  territory, and it is  because  we  are  a\r\n\r\ndependent  territory that we were never at Bandoeng.\r\n\r\nSir  John  Kotelawala is in a much more  independent\r\n\r\nposition,  his  Public  Service  and  the  power  of\r\n\r\nappointment to it is laid out in the constitution of\r\n\r\nCeylon - it  is  also  in  our draft  constitution - and\r\n\r\nsection 6 of the constitution reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The appointment, transfer, dismissal and\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  control of public officers  is  hereby\r\n\r\nvested in the Public Services Commission.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Supreme    authority   -   appointment,    transfer,\r\n\r\ndismissal, disciplinary control. A similar provision\r\n\r\nexists for the judicial officers in Ceylon, and  all\r\n\r\nthe   officers  on  the  Commission  are  local  men\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the Governor-General of Ceylon,  with\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation or suggestion of the  Government\r\n\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes a very great difference, these things,\r\n\r\nfor  our Public Services Commission does not command\r\n\r\nany  respect  or confidence from any member  in  the\r\n\r\nCivil Service that I know of. It has been staffed in\r\n\r\nits Chairman since its inception, by expatriates, ex-Judges,    ex-Directors   of    Education,    people\r\n\r\nconditioned, not out of any wickedness or malice  on\r\n\r\ntheir  part,  but  by  their  years  of  office   as\r\n\r\nprofessional  administrators,  conditioned   to   be\r\n\r\nunsympathetic  to  a Malaya that  is  determined  to\r\n\r\nMalayanise  at any price, that is determined  to  be\r\n\r\nfree, that is determined to have its own men run its\r\n\r\nown affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a makes of paramount importance that if this\r\n\r\nGovernment   wishes  to  execute   its   policy   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation, there must be a review of the Public\r\n\r\nServices Commission, its powers and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitution,  and there must be a reorientation  of\r\n\r\nthe policy of that Commission. I would elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthat  in  a few moments, but first I would  like  to\r\n\r\nmention to the Government Benches opposite that  if,\r\n\r\n136 years after Stamford Raffles, you end up with 68\r\n\r\nexpatriate  executive officers as against  23  local\r\n\r\nmen,  all  these pious protestations of enlightened,\r\n\r\nbenign, charitable colonial rule just do not  stick.\r\n\r\nI  hear the Chief Secretary querying himself. I  beg\r\n\r\nhis  pardon. 63 to 28 - a little more for the colonial\r\n\r\nsystem.  If, after all these 136 years, out of  that\r\n\r\n28,  only three were found capable of becoming,  not\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretaries who embellish the corners\r\n\r\nof   this   House,   but   just   Deputy   Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries;  I  would say 3 out of  a  hundred  and\r\n\r\nthirty-six  years makes it an average  of  45  years\r\n\r\neach  to produce a Deputy Permanent Secretary;  that\r\n\r\nis  the  glowing tribute to an Administration  which\r\n\r\nsays,  \"We have come here to give you your  freedom.\r\n\r\nSlowly, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Paper before the Legislative Council last\r\n\r\nyear  the  old  Government (which my colleague,  who\r\n\r\nreally  ought to be on some other side of the  House\r\n\r\nthan mine, has praised as part of the achievement of\r\n\r\nthe  old  Government) adopted this Council Paper  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  suggested  Malayanisation  was  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  thing, and they should go on with  it  at\r\n\r\nthe rate of four recruits per annum. At the rate  of\r\n\r\nfour  recruits per annum to replace the  63  serving\r\n\r\nofficers  I should think 16 years will be  required,\r\n\r\nand  I  believe even his ex-leader said eight years.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not  know  if anybody  worked  out  the\r\n\r\narithmetic of that one. But in this Council Paper it\r\n\r\nis stated in paragraph 11:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In view of the shortage of personnel in sister\r\n\r\nterritories, where possibly the inflow of  qualified\r\n\r\ncandidates  is  not as great as ours,  we  would  be\r\n\r\nhelping their recruiting position by withdrawing our\r\n\r\nclaims  on the services of expatriate staff  of  the\r\n\r\nnon-specialist category, and review our  indents  on\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary  of  State  accordingly.  Sarawak  in\r\n\r\nparticular\"-  God bless Sarawak-\"has  intimated  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty   experienced  in  attracting  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers  to  her Services because of  the  superior\r\n\r\nsalary scales offered here. On our part, we can  but\r\n\r\nobserve  the injunctions in the paragraph  from  the\r\n\r\nCommand Paper quoted above: it is not hastening, but\r\n\r\nregarding, the process of gradual assumption of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility  by local people to  continue  to  be\r\n\r\ndependent  on  expatriate  staff  when  the   duties\r\n\r\ninvolved  can  be performed just as  well  by  local\r\n\r\npeople.  Apart from implementing what is really  our\r\n\r\nrecruitment policy, the employment of local staff of\r\n\r\nequivalent  standard  in place of  expatriate  staff\r\n\r\nrepresents a definite financial saving.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an admission by the Committee which sat\r\n\r\non  it,  including  expatriate  officers,  that  the\r\n\r\ntalents  of  these professional administrators  were\r\n\r\nmuch  more  urgently  required elsewhere,  but  they\r\n\r\nchose  to  come  to  Singapore for  some  altruistic\r\n\r\nreason connected with the salary scales. And we  are\r\n\r\nasked  today,  having attracted  and  retained  them\r\n\r\nbecause   of   this  wonderful  salary,   expatriate\r\n\r\nallowances   and   pensionable  and  non-pensionable\r\n\r\nexpatriate  allowances, to tell  them  that  we  are\r\n\r\nsorry   that   since  their  careers   are   to   be\r\n\r\ninterrupted,     they    must    receive     special\r\n\r\nconsideration. As, not my friend, but the leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  Democratic Party - one of the two,  so  one  must\r\n\r\nlead - has  said,  there has been  no  clear  detailed\r\n\r\nsubmission of what these abolition terms are; so  my\r\n\r\nremarks  here  are purely by way of suggestion.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has not said what it proposes to do.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  declared  its  intention,  declared\r\n\r\nitself  very strongly in favour of compensating  and\r\n\r\ncomforting  those  who may lose their  jobs.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is useful to remember the present  terms,\r\n\r\napart  from abolition terms, the present pensionable\r\n\r\nterms  given to a man who is allowed to retire  from\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Service prematurely, on the  ground  of\r\n\r\ntemperamental  incompatibility  or  for  reasons  of\r\n\r\nhealth;  he automatically gets a pension at  a  very\r\n\r\nearly age of life, whatever his age may be, and  for\r\n\r\nthe rest of his life, and he gets a pension if he is\r\n\r\nan    expatriate   officer   on   his    pensionable\r\n\r\nexpatriation allowance, that allowance which we  pay\r\n\r\nhim  to attract and retain him but which we continue\r\n\r\nto pay him long after we do not want him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, one must remember that it is as well in\r\n\r\nthese  matters to reach broad agreement between  the\r\n\r\nParties in the House because, as the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  will know, no government can bind  us,  no\r\n\r\ndeclaration of intention, no declaration of  policy,\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbind   the   succeeding  government,  or  even   the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  the day. Speaking for  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party, I cannot assure any expatriate officer\r\n\r\nlargesse galore and bounties galore. Their rights as\r\n\r\npublic servants will be respected, but we cannot  be\r\n\r\nparty  to  anything  which  is  by  way  of  special\r\n\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on this question of Malayanisation, I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  considerable  cynicism  not   only\r\n\r\namongst  local  serving officers, but  also  amongst\r\n\r\nlocal  people  outside the government service.  This\r\n\r\nbusiness of looking for talented young men and being\r\n\r\nunable  to  find them either in the universities  or\r\n\r\neven  in the Public Services themselves is one which\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  very tired of. Every  year  from  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya, every year from  universities\r\n\r\nin  Britain  and Australia and other  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking Dominions, returned  students  come\r\n\r\nback,  and  I think it is a brave man who would  say\r\n\r\nthat  they  are not the equal, broadly speaking,  in\r\n\r\nintelligence and grit of any other student  anywhere\r\n\r\nin  the  world.  And yet, we get this dismal  story.\r\n\r\nWhere there is personality, for some other reason  a\r\n\r\nman  is  not acceptable, probably because  he  holds\r\n\r\nviews  not akin to those which are held by  the  ex-Director  of  Education or the ex-Puisne  Judge  who\r\n\r\nhappens to head the Commission and the two gentlemen\r\n\r\nwho  sit  with  him and who certainly have  not  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the people reposed in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think immediately a proper Commission has been\r\n\r\nset up, a review must be made of all cases of people\r\n\r\nwho have been turned down for one reason or another,\r\n\r\nfor  there is a very strong suspicion that a man who\r\n\r\ndoes  not hold the views which the Government  would\r\n\r\nlike a civil servant to hold is never allowed to  be\r\n\r\na  public servant. Of course, sometimes a few people\r\n\r\ndo  become civil servants and then alter their views\r\n\r\nso radically that the Government wish they had never\r\n\r\nemployed  them. But having employed them  and  being\r\n\r\ncaught  by their rules, they then set about amending\r\n\r\nthe Pensions Ordinance to see how they can set about\r\n\r\nputting  the matter right. I would repeat once  more\r\n\r\nthat the first test before this Labour Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the  expedition, the drive, with which  they  go\r\n\r\ninto their Malayanisation policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Labour-Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Labour-Alliance cum colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment,  because let it never be forgotten  that\r\n\r\nit is not the Chief Minister but the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nwho  is  in charge of these matters and he has  them\r\n\r\nvery  well  under his control; and I  hope  he  will\r\n\r\naccept the collective responsibility because  it  is\r\n\r\nfinally  his Chief Minister who must answer  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  for  his sins of omission  and  sins  of\r\n\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is always said that we, as the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon has said, have no talents. If we have\r\n\r\ntalents,   we  have  no  experience.  If   we   have\r\n\r\nexperience,  we have no talents. If we have  talents\r\n\r\nand  experience, we have no qualification. It is one\r\n\r\nof those curious things. So in the City Council, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  out  of 228 Executive Officers,  159  are\r\n\r\nexpatriates and 69 are local; and this,  I  believe,\r\n\r\nafter  four years, or was it six years, of the  good\r\n\r\nProgressive   Party  administration  in   the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil. And I think the City Council's servants and\r\n\r\ntheir  friends have had a great deal to do with  the\r\n\r\nresults  of the last election, because local  people\r\n\r\ndo  not  take kindly, when you say, as they said  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of three very senior appointments  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council:  \"You  cannot  be  the  Deputy  Water\r\n\r\nEngineer because Mr White or Mr Black is senior in\r\n\r\nstatus.\"  That  was  said on two occasions.  On  the\r\n\r\nthird occasion the unfortunate Malayan was senior in\r\n\r\nstatus and so they said: \"Well, it is very bad luck,\r\n\r\nbut you have not got anti-malarial experience and so\r\n\r\nyou  cannot be Deputy Health Officer, and Mr  Green\r\n\r\nwill be the Deputy Health Officer because he had one\r\n\r\nyear's special anti-malarial training.\" That is  the\r\n\r\nsort  of  thing that breeds cynicism and a sense  of\r\n\r\nhopelessness  that there is no good  faith  in  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I hope the admission of six new blood,\r\n\r\ninjected  into  the old colonial system,  will  have\r\n\r\nchanged  the  whole  outlook and character  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment. In fact, we are looking forward to  some\r\n\r\ndrastic changes in its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutward  manifestations. These are the  difficulties\r\n\r\nyou  have to face, Mr Speaker, Sir, that unless the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can pursue this policy of Malayanisation\r\n\r\nnot  only in the Government Public Services, but  in\r\n\r\nall the Public Services and, last but not least,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Harbour Board, where a very important\r\n\r\nPublic   Service   is  run  almost  exclusively   by\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers, there is going to be  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of, I would not call it sabotage, but I  would\r\n\r\njust   say,  general  dislocation,  when  a   really\r\n\r\nvigorous  Malayan Nationalist Government takes  over\r\n\r\nin  the  very  near  future, when the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment, as I hope, would have succeeded by  then\r\n\r\nin  removing the gentlemen who ought not  to  be  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  I hope therefore they will  give  this\r\n\r\nmatter   their  earnest  consideration  and,   after\r\n\r\nearnest  consideration,  their  untiring  drive  and\r\n\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, two more important but somewhat less\r\n\r\nexciting  matters  like Emergency  Regulations.  The\r\n\r\nLabour  Front, particularly the Chief  Minister,  (a\r\n\r\nvery,  very able exponent of Socialism, having  sat,\r\n\r\naccording  to one learned American journal,  at  the\r\n\r\nfeet  of  Mr  Attlee and one Mr Bevan)  has  said,\r\n\r\nperhaps in a moment of exuberance, that he wanted to\r\n\r\nrepeal  the  Emergency  Regulations.  Now,  Sir,  my\r\n\r\nParty, for some reason or the other, has always been\r\n\r\nthe  target  for  rather unhappy,  disconsolate  and\r\n\r\ndisconcerted attack-that we are extremists, that  we\r\n\r\ndo not stand for law and order, that we deliberately\r\n\r\nfoster chaos, dissension and disaster. I think it is\r\n\r\nrefreshing if this House could be reminded  that  it\r\n\r\nwas   the  People's  Action  Party  which  carefully\r\n\r\nweighed  and  considered the Emergency  Regulations,\r\n\r\nand as its election programme said, not a repeal  of\r\n\r\nthe   Emergency  Regulations,  but  \"repeal  of  the\r\n\r\narbitrary  powers  of arrest and  detention  without\r\n\r\ntrial, of the restrictions on freedoms of speech, of\r\n\r\nassembly and of publication, which are all contained\r\n\r\nin the Emergency Regulations.\" It is said with care,\r\n\r\nwith  circumspection  and with  deliberation - as  the\r\n\r\nPeople's    Action    Party   always    makes    its\r\n\r\npronouncements. We do not issue statements and  then\r\n\r\nafterwards want to retract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem, amend them, and, if possible, tear them up and\r\n\r\nforget  that we have ever said them. But it was  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front,  in  a beautifully printed  manifesto\r\n\r\nwhich  says, as the Member for Serangoon  has  said,\r\n\r\nthat  they  were going to repeal, according  to  the\r\n\r\nheading,  \"THE  REPRESSIVE  LAWS\",  and  I  have  to\r\n\r\nendorse, they are repressive laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we either believe in democracy or we do not.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do, then we must say categorically,  without\r\n\r\nqualification, that no restraint from any democratic\r\n\r\nprocess, other than by the ordinary law of the land,\r\n\r\nshould be allowed. If a man chooses to carry a  hand\r\n\r\ngrenade  or a revolver, or some other lethal weapon,\r\n\r\nin times when the Governor and the High Commissioner\r\n\r\nhave  proclaimed a state of emergency, then he takes\r\n\r\nthe  supreme penalty the law has laid down for  him.\r\n\r\nBut  if  a political party wants to hold an election\r\n\r\nmeeting,  or  even a post-election meeting  after  7\r\n\r\no'clock,  they  are  told: \"We  do  not  believe  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy  after  the election. We only  believe  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy  once in four years, for one month.\"  That\r\n\r\nis  not  the kind of democracy that you can  inspire\r\n\r\nmen  with, to fight for and die for. That is not the\r\n\r\nkind  of democracy that is going to make it tick  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia, if you tell us that we can  hold  a\r\n\r\npublic  meeting  in  the heat of  the  sun  at  four\r\n\r\no'clock  or five o'clock when nobody would  come  to\r\n\r\nlisten to us, when therefore there would be no  real\r\n\r\ndanger of any democratic movement starting, but that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  hold a public meeting after  7  o'clock,\r\n\r\nwhen  by  the habits of the workers they would  have\r\n\r\nreturned  from work, the earth has got  cooler,  the\r\n\r\nwalls  have got cooler, the night is getting  mellow\r\n\r\nand  warm speeches can be made. But, no! That is not\r\n\r\nallowed. And yet, we are asked to believe that  this\r\n\r\nis  democracy.  I must say, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  very  queer and curious democracy,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of which is not in the P.A.P. pamphlets.\r\n\r\nI  sincerely hope the Labour Front will have time - I\r\n\r\nacknowledge  that they have not as yet had  time  to\r\n\r\nconsider all these aspects for the time being, but I\r\n\r\nhope  they  will  have the time - to consider  whether\r\n\r\nthey would place their faith in democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you believe in democracy, you must believe in\r\n\r\nit  unconditionally. If you believe that men  should\r\n\r\nbe  free,  then they should have the right  of  free\r\n\r\nassociation,  of  free speech, of free  publication.\r\n\r\nThen no law should permit those democratic processes\r\n\r\nto  be  set  at  nought, and no excuse,  whether  of\r\n\r\nsecurity,   inconvenience   to   the   traffic,   or\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to police officers,  should  allow  a\r\n\r\ngovernment to be deterred from doing what  it  knows\r\n\r\nto  be  right,  and what it must know to  be  right.\r\n\r\nThere  are, of course, a number of relaxations  such\r\n\r\nas the firing of crackers after dark, and I am quite\r\n\r\nsure that someone has said, I do not know whether it\r\n\r\nis  stated  in malice, Mr Speaker, Sir, but  it  is\r\n\r\nsaid  that  perhaps  they wanted  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nsupporters to be able to fire crackers, to celebrate\r\n\r\ntheir  victory after dark. But I am quite sure  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  have  to  be a  great  deal  of  heart-searching on this question of Emergency Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister in his pamphlet and in\r\n\r\nhis  broadcasts under the old apple tree, which  has\r\n\r\nstopped  bearing apples ever since, has  said  again\r\n\r\nand  again, \"Out with it! It is unjust! We  are  the\r\n\r\ninheritors  of  a  magnificent system  of  justice.\"\r\n\r\nWell, let us have it now. Let us now, now that it is\r\n\r\nin  the  hands of people who have such  fervent  and\r\n\r\nfiery  convictions, translate them into action.  Let\r\n\r\nus  see  whether this fiery demagogue is  a  man  of\r\n\r\naction.  I  would say if he would go as far  as  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party, which has said these  things\r\n\r\nperhaps with less zeal or resilience, warmth,  fire,\r\n\r\nexpression,   but   with  more  circumspection   and\r\n\r\ndeliberation, he would have done very  well  indeed,\r\n\r\nand he would be assured of the support of my Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, may I, after being somewhat uncomplimentary\r\n\r\non   the   Emergency  Regulations,  compliment   his\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour for the prompt  assertion  and\r\n\r\ncategorical  statement that trade unions  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  take  part  in  politics?  Some   other\r\n\r\ngentleman who thought trade unions should  not  take\r\n\r\npart  in  politics but should form organizations  as\r\n\r\nthey do in America has now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  put into premature retirement and I think that\r\n\r\nis just as well for himself and for the public which\r\n\r\nhe  never  served. And we also like to  express  our\r\n\r\nhappiness  that this foolish business of  preventing\r\n\r\nGovernment  trade unions from mixing up  with  other\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  just  in case they get  revolutionary\r\n\r\nideas  about  how to deal with their employers,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government - we are glad that that  is  also\r\n\r\ngone. But let me remind the Minister for Labour that\r\n\r\nthere  is  such  a thing called the  Trade  Disputes\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  I think passed some time in 1941 - perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Attorney-General will correct me if  I\r\n\r\nam  wrong - and it is a copy, more or less,  from  the\r\n\r\nEnglish   Trade   Disputes  Act   passed   in   1927\r\n\r\nimmediately after the General Strike. It was  passed\r\n\r\nby a Tory Government that was determined to see that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no other general strike in Britain  like\r\n\r\nthe  one they saw that year. It was opposed bitterly\r\n\r\nby  the whole British trade union movement, and  the\r\n\r\nfirst  act  of the British Labour Government,  which\r\n\r\nhad  a majority in the House of Commons in 1945, was\r\n\r\nto  pass  a  complete repeal of this Trade  Disputes\r\n\r\nAct. Now, Sir, I hope I will have the opportunity in\r\n\r\nthe  near future of congratulating the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  for an equally expeditious despatch of  this\r\n\r\npiece of anti-labour legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, to multi-lingualism. Lots of people\r\n\r\nchange their views lots of times, but I have yet  to\r\n\r\nsee  the  cool  impertinence, the insolence  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon. He is either deaf, or perhaps\r\n\r\nhe  is  a  man with considerable courage in  telling\r\n\r\nthings  which are not true, and we look  forward  to\r\n\r\nthe energetic advance of the cause of the people, of\r\n\r\nthe  non-English-speaking peoples in Singapore  from\r\n\r\nthe  Progressive Party. Almost everybody  lives  and\r\n\r\nlearn, even the Progressive Party; but I think it is\r\n\r\na little bit too late in the day for them to support\r\n\r\nmulti-lingualism. The former Member for Katong said,\r\n\r\n\"I oppose - with all my strength,\" and somebody else\r\n\r\ncame  up with a policy statement, I believe  it  was\r\n\r\nsomeone  very close to the former Member for Katong,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanglin, who came up with some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  categorical assertions on what is  right  and\r\n\r\nproper  for Singapore. Having been born and bred  in\r\n\r\nsome  other  part  of the world,  he  must  be  well\r\n\r\nqualified to say this. We wish the Labour Government\r\n\r\nnow  every success in implementing it; we hope  that\r\n\r\nthey will not be beguiled by the suggestions made by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon into making it a  failure.\r\n\r\nIt  has  got to be made a success. There is a  clear\r\n\r\nmandate from the people; they want it; they want  to\r\n\r\ntry  it. The principle is accepted, and let us  make\r\n\r\nit work for their sake and for our sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say on education that I was\r\n\r\nsomewhat disappointed. When the Labour Front set out\r\n\r\nthe education programme they said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Labour Front's Policy on education is free\r\n\r\ncompulsory schooling for all children, in English or\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools, for the first six  years  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter of first priority. Thereafter scholarships or\r\n\r\ngrants may be provided in deserving cases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, somehow, when it was translated into the\r\n\r\nAddress  by His Excellency, the position,  I  think,\r\n\r\nhas been somewhat diluted. I just would like to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  I have not misunderstood it.  What  they\r\n\r\nhave  said is: \"The policy of the Government  is  to\r\n\r\naim  at  equal  treatment for all  schools  and  all\r\n\r\nteachers  in those schools. The foundation stone  of\r\n\r\nthe policy will be a six-year course of free primary\r\n\r\neducation  for all children.\" It could be  construed\r\n\r\nto  mean including vernacular schools. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it  can  be construed not to  mean  including\r\n\r\nvernacular schools, and I hope the Director - one gets\r\n\r\nso  used to colonialism that one is apt to refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  \"Director of Education\" - the Hon. the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education  will elucidate this  at  some  later\r\n\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the word \"compulsory\" been dropped? One\r\n\r\nmust  assume  that the Labour Front is  a  party  of\r\n\r\nintellectuals, not all of whom, of course, have  had\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  a  three months'  cram  course  on\r\n\r\nSocialism,  but nevertheless capable of  cogent  and\r\n\r\ndeliberate thought. There must have been good reason\r\n\r\nwhy  \"compulsory\"  was  put in  the  programme,  and\r\n\r\n\"compulsory\"  is the People's Action  Party's  view,\r\n\r\nfor no child should go without education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  the  Labour Bill. We congratulate  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  in  its ambition to try and bring  the  Armed\r\n\r\nServices  within  the  Labour Bill,  but  we  cannot\r\n\r\ncongratulate them for not attempting to  bring  them\r\n\r\nwithin  all  the  other Codes,  including  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation, the Central Provident Fund as it  will\r\n\r\nbe  amended,  and all the rest of it. Why  only  the\r\n\r\nLabour Bill? Why should the Armed Services be  in  a\r\n\r\nspecial position of immunity? Only as and when  they\r\n\r\nplease,  they  would say, \"We will be bound  by  the\r\n\r\nCode,  but only by our leave and licence.\" It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which affects a very large number of  people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and I take it that it is  because  it\r\n\r\naffects  a  very large number of people in Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  the  Labour Front in their four-year programme\r\n\r\nsaid:  \"The  Labour Front will seek to  provide  for\r\n\r\nsimilar   conditions  of  service  to  the  civilian\r\n\r\nemployees  of the three Services as are  offered  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants  of the Colony.\"  I  would  not\r\n\r\nimagine that that was said not purely to get  votes,\r\n\r\nbut  surely  also  to see that very large  sections,\r\n\r\nsome 40,000 civilian employees in the Army, Navy and\r\n\r\nAir  Force, are given conditions of employment which\r\n\r\nare  akin  to  those offered by  the  Crown  in  its\r\n\r\nmanifestation as the Singapore Government.  I  would\r\n\r\nnot wish to remind Members on the other side that if\r\n\r\nyou  say that the Crown is one and indivisible, then\r\n\r\nyou  should act according to your theory  and  treat\r\n\r\nemployees of the Crown, be they government  servants\r\n\r\nor  employees  of the Armed Services,  on  the  same\r\n\r\nfooting.  It  is a matter, I think,  which  will  be\r\n\r\nreceived   with  great  approval  by  the   civilian\r\n\r\nemployees of the Armed Services. There again, I hope\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister - it does not appear to fall within\r\n\r\nany   other   Minister's  duties - would  review   the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the land acquisition and the Torrens system, we\r\n\r\nextend our hearty congratulations to both the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  his colleague primarily  responsible,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Lands and Housing. We hope that  he\r\n\r\nwill be able to translate that policy into action as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible and they can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassured   of   our  friendly  and  our  constructive\r\n\r\nsupport.  But  there is one thing about  housing  to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think  I  must draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Ulu Bedok. Perhaps that is why  he  has\r\n\r\nchosen rural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one does not make these promises to a\r\n\r\nrelatively enlightened electorate and then forget to\r\n\r\nmention them subsequently. If there is an urgent and\r\n\r\ncogent reason why it cannot be done, then the public\r\n\r\nhas a right to know why. They have said on page 4 of\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front programme:\"A  reduction  of  the  present  interest  rates  on\r\n\r\nGovernment  loans  to the S.I.T., thereby  providing\r\n\r\nfor  cheaper  rentals  for Trust  accommodation  and\r\n\r\ncarrying  this important social amenity to a  larger\r\n\r\nnumber  of the lower income group.\" Now, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nare  a  large number of people living in Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust flats and I believe a large number of them are\r\n\r\nvoters and they have been promised this - as they have\r\n\r\nbeen  promised by the People's Action Party that  if\r\n\r\never they get into this Legislature - an abolition  of\r\n\r\nthe  interest  to  the Singapore Improvement  Trust.\r\n\r\nSir, the Labour Front has said that they believe  in\r\n\r\nsubsidized  housing.  So does  the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.  If  housing is going to be subsidized,  then\r\n\r\nthe first act it can do, the least it can do, is  to\r\n\r\nremove  this piece of businesslike economics on  the\r\n\r\npart  of the Singapore Government, supported so ably\r\n\r\npreviously  by the Progressive Party and  I  believe\r\n\r\neven  sometimes by the present Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\nand Welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

Then you can go to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  and  say,  \"We  have got  a  sound  economy.\r\n\r\nSingapore is flourishing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think these Improvement Trust flat-dwellers are very pleased about the rates they are\r\n\r\npaying,  and I also do not believe that this promise\r\n\r\nmade  to  them was completely unconnected  with  the\r\n\r\nelection results. I think they are entitled, if  not\r\n\r\nto  a  reduction  as was offered,  to  a  very  good\r\n\r\nexplanation  why  the reduction  is  not  now  being\r\n\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of this Passenger Transport Board,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  People's Action Party  never  said,  even\r\n\r\nthough  they always like to believe these things  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party, that they were going  to\r\n\r\nnationalize all these beautiful trams and omnibuses.\r\n\r\nBut  the Labour Front did, and nobody said that they\r\n\r\nwere  extremists. They said on page 6,  \"The  Labour\r\n\r\nFront   will  nationalize  the  passenger  transport\r\n\r\nsystem  in  Singapore\",  and  after  that  came  the\r\n\r\nannouncement that they are going to have a board  to\r\n\r\nfix  fares  and  calculate mileages. How  did  these\r\n\r\nthings  come  to  pass? One finds it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  it. Here they say in the  Address:  \"The\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory state of public transport  calls  for\r\n\r\nearly   action,  and  to  this  end  the  Government\r\n\r\ncontemplates the setting up of a Transport Authority\r\n\r\nwhich  will  include in its functions the allocation\r\n\r\nof  routes and the fixing of fares.\" What about this\r\n\r\nnationalisation?  Does  nationalisation   mean   the\r\n\r\nallocation of routes and the fixing of fares?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Singapore Traction Company's charter\r\n\r\nis   due  to  expire  in  June  this  year,  and   a\r\n\r\nProgressive   Party-dominated   City   Council   had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpressed  a desire earlier that it had no intention\r\n\r\nof  upsetting  this system of free enterprise.  Free\r\n\r\nenterprise! We are all free; we are all  equal  men.\r\n\r\nIf  you fail, it is because your luck is not as good\r\n\r\nas  mine and you do not work as hard as I. They said\r\n\r\nthey  did  not want to upset things. The charter  is\r\n\r\nexpiring  soon  and the City Council can  take  over\r\n\r\nthis  transport system intact. The Company is making\r\n\r\nprofits ranging, over the last four years, from  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  one  and  a half million  to  two  million\r\n\r\ndollars a year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording  to their Singapore operative accounts  of\r\n\r\nprofits  published. But the City Council passed  the\r\n\r\nbuck  up  to  the Singapore Government, \"We  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we ought to take over. Why do you not form  a\r\n\r\nPublic  Transport Board?\" But the L.P.T.B. and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government then, with all these  go-slow,\r\n\r\nplay-safe  gentlemen who no longer are  here,  said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  no.  We  do  not think we  ought  to  do  such\r\n\r\nthings.\" But I am sure hon. Members opposite are not\r\n\r\nof the same calibre or the same inclination, even if\r\n\r\nthey are of the same intention as the gentlemen  who\r\n\r\noccupied seats in that old Council which was  always\r\n\r\nplaced  in the Victoria Memorial Hall, where  people\r\n\r\nhold concerts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think action should be taken. The People's\r\n\r\nAction   Party  believes  that  here  is   a   clear\r\n\r\nopportunity where, without having to pass any  Bill,\r\n\r\na  notice  could  be given to the Company  informing\r\n\r\nthem  that  by  the end of this year the  Government\r\n\r\nintends  to put up a Transport Board and  take  over\r\n\r\ntheir  assets.  There  is no cutting  short  of  any\r\n\r\nexpectation  involved. And even if  operative  costs\r\n\r\nwere  to  go  up  for some unknown  reasons,  either\r\n\r\nbecause the officers in strategic position decide to\r\n\r\nretire  rather than to make the system  function,  I\r\n\r\nthink  still there would certainly be no loss. There\r\n\r\nis no loss in any public transport board anywhere in\r\n\r\nthe  world. The railways which never make money  are\r\n\r\nalways nationalized and the State always pay for it.\r\n\r\nBut private road transport is never nationalized and\r\n\r\nall   the   profits   go  to   the   directors   and\r\n\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is up to the Labour Front to tell the\r\n\r\npeople  what  they propose to do about this,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink it is important that they should remember that\r\n\r\nthe   responsibility  of  power  should  not  cause\r\n\r\nconfusion  with  responsibility to  the  people  who\r\n\r\nelected them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last of all the other points in this Labour Front\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of policy is the question  of  national\r\n\r\nservice.  The  People's Action Party still  says  in\r\n\r\ncategorical  terms that no government  that  is  not\r\n\r\nelected by the people, no government which has not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  make wars, or declare  wars  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people, should conscript,  should\r\n\r\nhave the right to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will train and you will die for us.\" Sir, I  am\r\n\r\nno  apologist for being anti-colonial. My Party says\r\n\r\nclearly  that  we like freedom and we  do  not  like\r\n\r\ncolonialism, and we are prepared to fight it all the\r\n\r\nway - by democratic and constitutional methods of mass\r\n\r\nstruggle, in case the Attorney-General has any ideas\r\n\r\nabout  anything. Now, Sir, Mr Nehru  never  had  to\r\n\r\nsay: \"I am pro-British, but I hate colonialism.\" Mr\r\n\r\nNehru  spent  many  years of  his  life  in  British\r\n\r\nprisons   in  India.  He  never  hated  the  British\r\n\r\npersonally.  And  I can assure all  these  gentlemen\r\n\r\nhere  who  are not Malayans, that we in the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party do not hate any Englishman  personally\r\n\r\nbecause  he is an Englishman. Of course,  there  are\r\n\r\nsome Englishmen we hate for some other reasons.  But\r\n\r\nwe are not afraid to say that we are one hundred per\r\n\r\ncent  against colonialism and we are not making  any\r\n\r\nqualification about it by being pro-British. It is a\r\n\r\ndifference of approach. The day I can say, \"I  am  a\r\n\r\nfree  man.  This  is my country\", that  day  I  will\r\n\r\nwelcome you as a friendly host would do a guest. But\r\n\r\nI will not be a guest in my own country. That is our\r\n\r\nattitude.  Mr  Nehru never agreed to  allow  Indian\r\n\r\nsoldiers to fight British battles in Saigon, in Indo-China  or  in  Indonesia. He  wrote  many  a  strong\r\n\r\nlamentation.  When  imprisoned  together  with   his\r\n\r\ncolleagues, he was helpless and impotent, while  the\r\n\r\nBritish recruited Indians to fight their battles. No\r\n\r\nnationalist, no man who says, \"I am a Malayan; I  am\r\n\r\nproud  to  be a Malayan, and I am going to see  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  an independent, democratic Malaya\",  will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Let us train to be soldiers.\" What  for?  Why\r\n\r\nfor?  Whom  are we going to fight? Who is  going  to\r\n\r\ndecide  we are going to be involved in a war or  not\r\n\r\nto  be  involved in a war? Who is going  to  be  our\r\n\r\nally?  Who  is to be our foe? There is no  provision\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  the  National Service Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nsays  that  a man cannot be sent overseas  to  fight\r\n\r\nsome other battle in some other battlefield. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy submission it would be un-Malayan to say that our\r\n\r\nyouth  should  train and fight for  somebody  else's\r\n\r\nbattles.  That  is the stand of the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty before the election, and that is the stand  of\r\n\r\nthe People's Action Party now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, we come to the milk and honey, the\r\n\r\neconomy. Before the elections we had some, if I  may\r\n\r\nsay  so  with great respect, Sir, really  patriotic,\r\n\r\nvery    expressive   phrases   which   stick.   \"Our\r\n\r\neconomy\" - and  I  am told from very reliable  sources\r\n\r\nwho  the author of this little bit was - \"is to fulfil\r\n\r\nthe  urgent  need of the rapidly growing population.\r\n\r\nThe  Labour Front stands for a reorganization of its\r\n\r\neconomy,  now  cast in the role of a milching  cow.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  I do not know why \"milching\", because I always\r\n\r\nthought  it was \"milch cow\"; but perhaps it  is  for\r\n\r\nthe  rhythm and the milk in it. And quite good.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  a  far cry from this: \"We must not  alarm  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.\" If that was not designed to alarm  the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  I  do not know what that  was  designed\r\n\r\nfor.  The Labour Front said categorically: \"We stand\r\n\r\nfor  reorganization of our economy. We are not going\r\n\r\nto  have  this 136-years' trading outpost forever  a\r\n\r\ntrading  outpost. We are going to industrialize.  We\r\n\r\nare  going to do this and we are going to do  that.\r\n\r\nWe are going to subsidize this. We are going to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  these things are done.\" They  were  good\r\n\r\nthings  and they are still good things. The People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  still believes in those  things,  and\r\n\r\nthey hope the Labour Front still does. But this is a\r\n\r\nvery far cry from the anxious reassurances that have\r\n\r\nbeen issued time and time again since April the 2nd.\r\n\r\nCapital will not fly from this country, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  for one very good reason - because it is  making\r\n\r\ngood  profits.  All  the  assurances  and  all   the\r\n\r\nblandishments  of  the Labour Front  and  its  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister will not attract one cent here if that  one\r\n\r\ncent is not going to produce two cents by the end of\r\n\r\nthe year. Anyone who cares to pay his fifty cents to\r\n\r\nthe Companies Registry could check the profits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand balance sheets of Robinson's, White-away's, John\r\n\r\nLittle's,  and United Metal Works. You  do  not  get\r\n\r\nforeign  capital because you are nice to  them.  You\r\n\r\nget  foreign capital because you offer returns.  And\r\n\r\nthere  are returns. There is no need, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nto  try and appease these men who say: \"Otherwise  I\r\n\r\nam  going  home, and when I go home,  God,  you  are\r\n\r\nfinished  lah.\" Well, I would like to see them  try.\r\n\r\nThey will not go, because we offer them profits. All\r\n\r\nthis scare, all this fright to reassure them is,  in\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, quite unnecessary. A sober policy  will\r\n\r\nimpress  upon them this fact, that this  country  is\r\n\r\nnot  interested  in having factories and  industries\r\n\r\nfor the sake of factories and industries, but in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  these  factories and  industries  pay  high\r\n\r\nwages, increase the national income and increase the\r\n\r\nstandard  of living. We are not interested in  trade\r\n\r\nfor  trade's  sake.  We  are interested  in  income,\r\n\r\nnational  income, an increase in national income.  I\r\n\r\nsee   the  Financial  Secretary  doing  some  mental\r\n\r\ncalculations,  but  I  think  I  am  right.  If  you\r\n\r\nincrease the national income and you spread it  more\r\n\r\nequitably  all  around, a larger number  of  persons\r\n\r\nwill  have  more money to buy singlets, sandals  and\r\n\r\nshort pants, even if they cannot buy bush jackets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is important, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nthat  we should assure the Labour Front that a cold,\r\n\r\ndeliberate,  calculating policy,  as  enunciated  in\r\n\r\ntheir programme, will not drive any capital out  and\r\n\r\nwill  do  a  great deal to bring about a  more  just\r\n\r\ndistribution  of wealth. And then you will  have  no\r\n\r\nmore  of these smouldering slag-heap fumes poisoning\r\n\r\nthe  air,  and we shall have more of the  peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  which we, I think on all  sides  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,   even  those  who  belong  to   some   other\r\n\r\ncountries, want here. Because we are attracting  and\r\n\r\nretaining  them  they  would also  like  to  see  us\r\n\r\nprosperous and happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is this vision which drives the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party on and on. We have not come here,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in order that some laws may be  passed\r\n\r\nand some laws may be unpassed. For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus,  and I say this, that I am more of a Malayan and\r\n\r\nmore  English educated even than the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself;  for  us it is the vision  of  a  free  and\r\n\r\nindependent,  democratic Malaya - a small  country  of\r\n\r\nseven millions, but proud and free. Proud because it\r\n\r\nis  independent in an Asia which is reasserting  its\r\n\r\nself-respect.     We     believe     in     freedom,\r\n\r\nunconditionally.  We  have  no  fears,  no   terrors\r\n\r\nbecause those who have protected us for so long will\r\n\r\nno  longer  protect us, because they are not  making\r\n\r\nprofits  out of us, or because we are not  going  to\r\n\r\npay  them expatriation allowances. For us it is this\r\n\r\ndream,  this  hope  which, in our opinion,  is  just\r\n\r\nround  the  corner; of a Malaya  in  which  all  its\r\n\r\npeoples, regardless of class, race or religion, will\r\n\r\nbe  given  the same opportunities to live their  own\r\n\r\nlives,  preserve their own cultures, even their  own\r\n\r\nlanguages,  in  so  far as it is compatible  with  a\r\n\r\nMalaya  which  is  united  together  in  one  common\r\n\r\npurpose;  a  Malaya  in which all  its  peoples  are\r\n\r\ndedicated  to its own prosperity, its own happiness;\r\n\r\nand  in which there will be none of this bitterness,\r\n\r\nfrustrations,   angers,  between  race   and   race,\r\n\r\nreligion and religion, or even class and class. That\r\n\r\nis  the Malaya that we dream of, that we will  fight\r\n\r\nfor,  and,  if  necessary, go to jail for,  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  die for. And so far as the Labour  Front\r\n\r\npursues  a policy which leads this country  to  that\r\n\r\ngoal,  the People's Action Party will be with  them,\r\n\r\nas  we  would  be with any party that pursues  those\r\n\r\naims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel even more strongly, even though we cannot\r\n\r\nexpress  it with the same bitterness, that  all  the\r\n\r\ninjustices, all the wickedness of the past, and  all\r\n\r\nthese     indecent    discrepancies    of    wealth,\r\n\r\nopportunities, fortunes of the past are things  that\r\n\r\nshould never have been and would never have been  if\r\n\r\nthere    had   been   an   independent   government,\r\n\r\nresponsible to the people it was supposed to govern.\r\n\r\nIt  was  because  they  had a  lot  of  professional\r\n\r\nadministrators who were determined to do  what  they\r\n\r\nthought  in their text books and in their experience\r\n\r\nin other territories was the right thing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  do  and  who  got, for the sake of  cover,  men,\r\n\r\nsupine, servile, bred in a generation that has  lost\r\n\r\nits  self-respect,  to  support  them  as  committee\r\n\r\nmembers,  men  on whom are ultimately showered  even\r\n\r\nK.B.E.'s. That is a Malaya which we are ashamed  of.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  say - it is not in His Excellency's speech - we\r\n\r\nsay  this from the bottom of our hearts, that we are\r\n\r\nashamed of the people who have sold us for so  long,\r\n\r\nthose - some  people do not like the word - \"Quislings\".\r\n\r\nBut  they sold out the people all the same for  very\r\n\r\ngood  reason. They believe in peaceful  and  orderly\r\n\r\nforeign government. They believe that the local  man\r\n\r\nis not as good as the white man. They believe if you\r\n\r\nhave  the qualification you must have the experience\r\n\r\nand anyway you have not got the tradition. They were\r\n\r\nthe  people who for long, long years have made fools\r\n\r\nof  us.  And  when the people went to the  polls  on\r\n\r\nApril the 2nd it was they who were rejected, perhaps\r\n\r\nforever,  because Asia today will not tolerate  such\r\n\r\nmen. You may be silent before an official because it\r\n\r\nis  prudent to be silent and submissive. But in your\r\n\r\nheart  you  neither respect him nor admire  him  for\r\n\r\nwhat  he does. And they cast their votes for  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  prepared to fight colonialism. Not because\r\n\r\nthey   want  disruption,  disorder,  disaster,   but\r\n\r\nbecause they, like us, share this vision of  a  free\r\n\r\ncountry  where a Malayan who is proud and  free  can\r\n\r\nlook  any  man in the eye and say: \"I am a  Malayan,\r\n\r\nthis  is my country, this is my home. I am proud  of\r\n\r\nit, I will make it better and better as the years go\r\n\r\nby, more just and more just.\" And it is that Malaya,\r\n\r\nthat  dream, that drives the People's Action  Party,\r\n\r\nand that has sent four representatives here to help,\r\n\r\nto  encourage,  to exhort, to advise, and  sometimes\r\n\r\neven to admonish the Labour Front a little - always in\r\n\r\nthe  hope  that  it  will go for  that  goal  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent,   democratic  Malaya   and   no   other\r\n\r\nattenuated version. That is our dream, and  we  hope\r\n\r\nit  is your dream for the sake of yourselves, of the\r\n\r\nLabour Front and the Alliance, and of the people not\r\n\r\nonly of Singapore but of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I think we have all listened with\r\n\r\nvery great interest, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew).

I have  a  note\r\n\r\non them in my file, but I think I can deal with them\r\n\r\nwithout  referring  to it. The  first  one  is, of\r\n\r\ncourse,   that  it  must  produce  efficiency,   and\r\n\r\npreferably more efficiency than you had with the un-nationalised industry. Another point is,  of  course\r\n\r\nthat   it   must   reduce  or   completely   abolish\r\n\r\nmonopolistic exploitation. It must form  a  part  of\r\n\r\nthe overall planning of the economy, and it must  be\r\n\r\nripe  for  nationalisation at the time  that  it  is\r\n\r\ntaken  over.  It  is no use nationalising  something\r\n\r\nbefore  it  is  ripe.  And  a  further  point  about\r\n\r\nnationalisation which could be added to  the  fourth\r\n\r\ncriterion   is   that   in   certain   circumstances\r\n\r\nnationalisation  is necessary in order  to  get  the\r\n\r\ncapital required for some form of development  which\r\n\r\nyou  cannot expect to get from private sources. You\r\n\r\nhave to get it from public funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the nationalisation of passenger transport in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not  a  matter of  nationalising  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Company. My impression  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  would  be  happy to sell  themselves  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  if  the Government were willing  to  buy\r\n\r\nthem; and probably a number of other companies would\r\n\r\nalso, in fact have been hopefully looking for- ward\r\n\r\nto  a  Labour Front victory with a view  to  saying,\r\n\r\n\"Now  I  have got so many routes licensed. Will  you\r\n\r\nkindly take over and I can sit back and live on  the\r\n\r\nprofits  for the rest of my life?\" That  is  not  my\r\n\r\nnotion of nationalisation by any means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we should nationalise passenger\r\n\r\ntransport,  but  I am not prepared to  say  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  immediately  rush out and  hand  out  public\r\n\r\nfunds to a lot of transport operators, some ten  or\r\n\r\ntwelve  companies,  operating  on  this  very  small\r\n\r\nisland, until we have gone first through the process\r\n\r\nof   rationalisation  and  getting  things  into   a\r\n\r\nreasonably  orderly system, from  which  we  can  go\r\n\r\nforward  to the next step when the time is ripe.  It\r\n\r\nis  not,  as far as I know, possible to give  exact\r\n\r\nfigures  yet for what the cost of nationalising  the\r\n\r\nindustry at present would be. If we take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassenger  transport simply in the usual meaning  of\r\n\r\nbuses  and  trolley-buses, it is probable  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Company does not represent  more\r\n\r\nthan  about  50 per cent of the total  capital  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  required for the takeover; and there  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be very urgent and necessary projects which\r\n\r\nwill  call for considerable sums of capital,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  that it is fair to say that with the existing\r\n\r\npowers,  and  with the powers that may  have  to  be\r\n\r\nadded,  it  will  be  possible  to  deal  with   the\r\n\r\npassenger   transport  system  and  to  make   quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable   improvements   without    necessarily\r\n\r\nimmediately  having to go over into  nationalisation\r\n\r\nof  the whole industry at once.

We had left it to the honest belief\r\n\r\nand  opinion of each individual member. We were  the\r\n\r\nonly Party honest enough not to make capital out  of\r\n\r\nit  to catch votes. We found it to our cost, but  we\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to face the issue and let the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  know that we would  rather  lose  the\r\n\r\nelection  than try something which, to our mind,  is\r\n\r\nimpracticable and impossible for the time being.

Two\r\n\r\nor three years ago we took up this question with the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  another gentleman. That failed  because\r\n\r\nof,  shall we say, vested interests. I am very  glad\r\n\r\nindeed  to  see it being pushed through so  rapidly,\r\n\r\nand I think it will have a very important bearing on\r\n\r\nthe  new  Faculty  of Law. It will provide  work,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of work, for the young men who  will  be\r\n\r\nqualified locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister started by saying that\r\n\r\nthe  law of the jungle was applied to trade in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  that the \"taipans\" of  business  grew\r\n\r\nvery  fat on it. That may be true, but at this time,\r\n\r\nwhen we are changing to a Socialist government,  let\r\n\r\nus  not be ungrateful, for it is they who have built\r\n\r\nus  this  golden heritage. But for them,  our  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister may still be speaking under the apple  tree\r\n\r\ninstead of in this well-appointed House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the uncertainty of the elections, it is most\r\n\r\nreassuring  to  see that Government recognises  that\r\n\r\ncommerce is the lifeblood of the local economy. This\r\n\r\nhas  never  been  mentioned in  the  Labour  Front's\r\n\r\nelection platform, nor in its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour-year Programme. This has always been the  chief\r\n\r\naim of the Progressive Party. Tied to this, however,\r\n\r\nis  the  encouragement of local industries,  and  an\r\n\r\nendeavour  to  seek more equitable  distribution  of\r\n\r\nwealth.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan\r\n\r\nYew)  seems  to  think  that just  by  shouting  the\r\n\r\nwords - \"You   will  make  profit  in   Singapore\" - the\r\n\r\ncapitalists will come. We shall find that is a great\r\n\r\nmistake.  Without  security, stability  and  without\r\n\r\npeople  who  wish  to  invest their  money  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  knowing that they are going to get  a  safe\r\n\r\nreturn  in  future  years, you  will  not  get  your\r\n\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest aims of this Labour Front is\r\n\r\nsocial  welfare work. We all agree with this and  we\r\n\r\nshall all support it; but we must be careful not  to\r\n\r\npush  it  too far, because once you go on  with  all\r\n\r\nthese  schemes there must be all sorts of  taxation.\r\n\r\nAnd  when you have taxation, you are going  to  curb\r\n\r\nlocal  industries.  When the prices  of  your  local\r\n\r\nproducts  are  too  high, you  will  have  to  apply\r\n\r\ncontrols.  Controls  mean the  curtailment  of  your\r\n\r\nentrepot trade. It requires a magician to keep these\r\n\r\nthree   undertakings - trade,  local  industries   and\r\n\r\nequitable distribution of wealth - going together, and\r\n\r\nwe  shall  wait with great interest to see  how  our\r\n\r\nchief  magician,  our Chief Minister,  juggles  with\r\n\r\nthese problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of housing, I think we are all\r\n\r\nagreed  that it is essential and it is not necessary\r\n\r\nfor  any Party to claim any credit.
