Such loans  could  be  floated\r\n\r\neither for the purposes of the Development Fund or\r\n\r\nfor  amortisation  of another external  loan.  The\r\n\r\nmaximum amount or amounts of the loan that may  be\r\n\r\nfloated will be approved by the President  on  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Minister. This  is  provided\r\n\r\nunder clause 2 (3) of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For raising these external loans, the Minister\r\n\r\nis  empowered under clause 4 (1) of  the  Bill  to\r\n\r\ncreate and issue such securities as he thinks fit.\r\n\r\nThe Minister may also determine under clause 4 (2)\r\n\r\nthe   terms   and  conditions  as  to   repayment,\r\n\r\nredemption and other matters, including  provision\r\n\r\nfor a sinking fund to which the securities will be\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to provide Government with\r\n\r\nthe  enabling powers to borrow in external markets\r\n\r\nshould the need arise.

With  the  accelerated\r\n\r\nBritish   military  withdrawal,  our   development\r\n\r\nexpenditure will need to be increased in the years\r\n\r\nahead.  This necessitates increased borrowing  and\r\n\r\nit  is clearly in our interest to widen the market\r\n\r\nto  include  external ones.

Singapore only requires foreign loans to\r\n\r\nexpand  its  economy  more rapidly.  The  rate  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic expansion has been such  that\r\n\r\nit  has  been equalled only by a few countries  in\r\n\r\nAsia, and even in the world. But circumstances are\r\n\r\nsuch  that,  especially in  the  next  few  years,\r\n\r\nSingapore  needs to expand much more rapidly,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this need I welcome this  Bill  which\r\n\r\nwill enable us to raise external loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I welcome the intention of this Bill, I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  it  is my duty to raise objections  to\r\n\r\nsome  of the provisions in the Bill. If this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  passed  into law as it stands, a blank  cheque\r\n\r\nBill,  as it were, would be handed to the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  am sure no one in this House  doubts\r\n\r\nthat with the present Finance Minister at the helm\r\n\r\nof  our economic ship, we will not run the risk of\r\n\r\nfoundering.  Everyone in this House  is  confident\r\n\r\nthat  he, armed with the wide powers conferred  by\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  will not seek the easy way  out  when\r\n\r\nconfronted by a shortage of cash. I am  also  sure\r\n\r\nthat  he will do his best to mobilise all domestic\r\n\r\nresources before attempting to borrow from abroad.\r\n\r\nBut,  we are not legislating for one man. What  we\r\n\r\nare  doing  today  is  to  consider  a  piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation  which will fit in with our  structure\r\n\r\nand system of government for some time to come. As\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  stands, the Finance Minister can  raise\r\n\r\nany  amount of money he likes from abroad and  pay\r\n\r\nany rate of interest he likes on those loans. As I\r\n\r\nhave  said before, I am confident that the present\r\n\r\nFinance Minister will neither be foolish nor  will\r\n\r\nhe   mortgage   our   future  unnecessarily.   But\r\n\r\ncircumstances may change and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccupiers  of posts may change.

I  also\r\n\r\nfeel  that  this  House must set a  limit  to  the\r\n\r\namount the Minister may borrow, and if he requires\r\n\r\nmore  funds, he should seek authority  again  from\r\n\r\nthis House. Similarly, I feel that this House must\r\n\r\nset  a  limit  on  the rate at which  our  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister can borrow. If he feels that he must  pay\r\n\r\nhigher   rates,  he  should  seek   the   specific\r\n\r\nauthority of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for us, our international credit\r\n\r\nrating  is high and we do not have to pay interest\r\n\r\nrates  as  charged  by  the Market  Street  money-lenders  for any external loans we seek to  raise.\r\n\r\nBut  we  still  need  to  determine  the  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest which this House must set as the limit on\r\n\r\nwhich  the Finance Minister can borrow.  I  should\r\n\r\nlike  him  to advise this House on the appropriate\r\n\r\nfigure.  Similarly, I should like  him  to  advise\r\n\r\nthis House on the limit he should be authorised to\r\n\r\nraise from external loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the hon. Member\r\n\r\nreally   raises  issues  which  are   largely   of\r\n\r\ntheoretical and academic interest. First  of  all,\r\n\r\nhe  says  that the Finance Minister can raise  any\r\n\r\namount  of money in the overseas money markets.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  is aware of the fact that most  of  the\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries are not able  to  raise  any\r\n\r\nloans  in  these  overseas money  markets  because\r\n\r\nnobody  will lend them any money. It is  true,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, that our credit rating is much better than\r\n\r\nthat  of  the general run of developing countries,\r\n\r\nand   one  hopes  that  this  credit  rating  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be good. I do not think there  is  any\r\n\r\nadvantage in raising any limit on loans  that  may\r\n\r\nbe  raised  in  overseas markets, for  the  simple\r\n\r\nreason  that I do not expect these loans would  be\r\n\r\nsubstantial and, in any event, any legislation  on\r\n\r\nthe limits of quantum of loans that may be floated\r\n\r\ndoes not really confer on Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany real control over the financial activities  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. When the limit is  reached,  then\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister will come to Parliament  and\r\n\r\nask for it to be raised. In fact, in regard to the\r\n\r\nlimit  on  Treasury Bills which has  been  set  by\r\n\r\nParliament  at  $500  million,  I  shall  soon  be\r\n\r\nintroducing a Bill to raise this limit  to  $1,000\r\n\r\nmillion because we are fast approaching the  limit\r\n\r\nof $500 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards interest rates, here again this is\r\n\r\ndetermined by the rates of interest prevailing  in\r\n\r\nmoney  markets and by the credit rating which  the\r\n\r\nborrower  enjoys in the market. Rates of  interest\r\n\r\nare at the moment pretty horrendous. For instance,\r\n\r\nif  we are to borrow money on the New York market,\r\n\r\nsay, a short-term loan of about five or six years,\r\n\r\nit  is  unlikely that we can borrow at an interest\r\n\r\nrate  of  less  than  eight  per  cent  per  year.\r\n\r\nInterest  rates in continental money  markets  are\r\n\r\nslightly  lower, but not all that much  lower.  In\r\n\r\nFrankfurt,  we may be able to borrow at  about  6\u00be per  cent, and in Switzerland possibly at  6\u00bc  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these loans are not for the asking, because\r\n\r\nvery  prolonged and delicate negotiations have  to\r\n\r\nbe  entered  into between the Government  and  the\r\n\r\nlender  or a consortium of lenders. What I  intend\r\n\r\nto  do  really  is  to raise a small  loan  at  an\r\n\r\nopportune time either in America or in Europe, not\r\n\r\nso much to use the money - because when you borrow\r\n\r\nat these rates of interest, it is going to be very\r\n\r\ndifficult to justify expenditure on development on\r\n\r\ninfrastructure at 7\u00bd per cent, 8 per cent or  even\r\n\r\n6\u00be  per  cent - but to introduce ourselves to  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  community of the  world.  I  have  been\r\n\r\nadvised  by  various people that  it  is  best  to\r\n\r\nborrow money when you do not need it, because when\r\n\r\nyou  really  need  the money desperately  you  are\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  get it. At this time,  when  we  are\r\n\r\nreasonably flush, it may be a good thing to  raise\r\n\r\nthe money either in New York, Frankfurt or Geneva,\r\n\r\nand  to  re-invest the money there possibly  at  a\r\n\r\nhigher rate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof interest.

Such stocks, therefore, appeal  to  a\r\n\r\nlimited  market and we have found  that  our  past\r\n\r\nissues have been mainly subscribed by institutions\r\n\r\nwho hold such stocks till maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the attractiveness of our loan\r\n\r\nissues,  the  Government proposes to issue  bearer\r\n\r\nbonds  as well. These bonds are payable to  bearer\r\n\r\nand  transferable by delivery without  endorsement\r\n\r\nor  registration.  The names of stockholders  will\r\n\r\nnot  appear on the stock certificate, neither will\r\n\r\na  register  of  stockholders  be  kept,  so  that\r\n\r\nanonymity   of  subscribers  will  be   preserved.\r\n\r\nInterest  coupons will be attached to  the  bonds,\r\n\r\nand  on  each  date  when interest  is  due,  such\r\n\r\ncoupons may be cashed at the nearest bank or  with\r\n\r\nthe Registrar of Loans. It will be clear from this\r\n\r\nbrief  description  that the  administrative  work\r\n\r\ninvolved will be reduced considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Development Loan Act,\r\n\r\nwhich  require sinking funds to be established  to\r\n\r\nmeet  redemption of a loan floated,  will  however\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  apply to bearer bonds  issued  under\r\n\r\nthis  Act.  So, once a loan is floated,  money  to\r\n\r\nmeet  its  redemption is automatically  set  aside\r\n\r\neach  year.  Such bearer bonds, when issued,  will\r\n\r\nbecome  negotiable instruments and  we  hope  this\r\n\r\nwill encourage greater public participation in the\r\n\r\nmobilisation of capital for development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JURONG TOWN CORPORATION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to establish the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation which will take over from the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment     Board     all     the     latter's\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  in regard to  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nfacilities   for  the  management  of   industrial\r\n\r\nestates, sites and flatted factories in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe   Corporation   will,  in  addition,   provide\r\n\r\namenities for the advancement of the well-being of\r\n\r\nthe  people living in such estates and sites.

I understand  that  it\r\n\r\ncovers  about 18,000 acres and the Government  has\r\n\r\ndone  a lot by putting all this acreage to various\r\n\r\nuses.  For  instance, about 1,700  acres  are  for\r\n\r\nheavy  industries and about 7,000  acres  are  for\r\n\r\nlight  industries. The Government has  made  plans\r\n\r\nfor  residential  and commercial areas,  community\r\n\r\nservices, facilities and amenities such as  public\r\n\r\ntelephones,  etc.  From this,  we  know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not intend to make Jurong only  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  town but also a place where  thousands\r\n\r\nof people can make a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the rapid development of Jurong,\r\n\r\nvarious problems have arisen and have to be looked\r\n\r\nafter, such as education, transport, etc, for  the\r\n\r\npeople  living  there. It would not be  convenient\r\n\r\nfor  the  Economic Development Board to  do  these\r\n\r\nthings by itself. That is why there is need  today\r\n\r\nfor a Jurong Town Corporation which will take over\r\n\r\nthe  functions  of the E.D.B, in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nJurong industrial site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our achievements in the Jurong industrial\r\n\r\nsite  are  well known throughout the  world.  Good\r\n\r\nprogress  has been made all round.

The  harbour\r\n\r\nis   good  and  deep  with  facilities  for  ship-repairing  and ship-building in docks.  This  Bill\r\n\r\nalso provides for various kinds of development  in\r\n\r\nJurong Town.

Therefore, in order to make\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  complex more attractive to  investors\r\n\r\nand workers, things in Jurong will have to improve\r\n\r\nand the co-operation of not only the employers but\r\n\r\nof the workers too is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to clause 5 (1) (c) of\r\n\r\nthe Bill and I hope the Minister will also appoint\r\n\r\ntrade  union representatives to be members of  the\r\n\r\nCorporation.

But it is sad to say that although it  is  a\r\n\r\nthriving  industrial estate, it is quite a  desert\r\n\r\nfor  social  life.  I  say  this  with  experience\r\n\r\nbecause  I  live not far off -in fact,  a  stone's\r\n\r\nthrow - from the Jurong complex. Every morning for\r\n\r\nabout  l\u00ab or 2 hours, you can see streams of cars,\r\n\r\nmotor-cycles  and scooters going in one  direction\r\n\r\nand  in the evening for about 2 hours, they go the\r\n\r\nother way. Throughout the morning and even in  the\r\n\r\nnight,  Jurong is quite a dead town. Life is  dull\r\n\r\nand   gloomy,   and  except  for  the   occasional\r\n\r\nChristmas  or  New  Year parties  thrown  by  some\r\n\r\nFather Christmas of an employer, Jurong is quite a\r\n\r\ndead  town. From my experience, most of the people\r\n\r\nafter work go to the city to enjoy themselves  and\r\n\r\nit  is very difficult sometimes to find friends at\r\n\r\nhome  in Jurong, because most of them live in  the\r\n\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said just now that Jurong should be a\r\n\r\npleasant  place in which to work, and I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation  to be set up will  endeavour  to\r\n\r\nimprove  things in the Jurong complex and  provide\r\n\r\nall   the  modem  amenities  to  the  workers  and\r\n\r\nresidents. Things in Jurong are not so good,  even\r\n\r\nthe  daily food. This is to be wondered  at,  that\r\n\r\nalthough Jurong is a landing point for the fishing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfleet, the fish one gets in Jurong is not so fresh\r\n\r\nas  one  gets in, say, the Kandang Kerbau  Market.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a complaint of the workers, that  Jurong\r\n\r\nhas  not  been taken care of in the past. I  speak\r\n\r\nnot  only from experience but also as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  complaints made by workers working in Jurong,\r\n\r\nthat  Jurong is not a very pleasant place in which\r\n\r\nto work, because not only are the wages there low,\r\n\r\nbut there are also no social amenities at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Bill intends to improve things\r\n\r\nin Jurong, I give it my whole-hearted support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I thank the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  for his very kind words on the  efforts\r\n\r\nof the Economic Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Kallang, he has made a\r\n\r\nnumber  of constructive suggestions and criticisms\r\n\r\nand  I  would like to comment on some of them.  He\r\n\r\nhas  asked  for  an  assurance  that  trade  union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives should be appointed to  the  Board\r\n\r\nof  the Jurong Town Corporation. Actually it is my\r\n\r\nintention to appoint equal numbers of trade  union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and employer representatives.  In\r\n\r\nfact,   we  have  written  to  the  N.T.U.C. for\r\n\r\nnominations,  but so far we have not received  any\r\n\r\nreply.  So  if  the  hon. Member  can  exert  some\r\n\r\npressure  on  his  colleagues in the  N.T.U.C.,  I\r\n\r\nwould be most grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the observation that there is an immense\r\n\r\namount  of commuting between Jurong and the  city.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that  the reason for this was  that  the\r\n\r\namenities  in Jurong were not as good  as  in  the\r\n\r\ncity. Actually the vast amount of commuting is not\r\n\r\nbecause  amenities are inadequate.  Amenities  are\r\n\r\ninadequate  because  there  is  this   amount   of\r\n\r\ncommuting.  In  other  words,  so  long  as  small\r\n\r\nnumbers  of workers live in Jurong, you  will  not\r\n\r\nget  the amenities coming up. For instance,  there\r\n\r\nmust   be  a  certain  minimum  population  before\r\n\r\nanybody  thinks it worth while to set up,  say,  a\r\n\r\ncinema.

We  did  a  social\r\n\r\nsurvey  of this problem some years ago.  We  found\r\n\r\nthat  the  vast  majority of workers  employed  in\r\n\r\nJurong  are people getting their first jobs.  They\r\n\r\nare  mostly youngsters living with their  parents.\r\n\r\nThey  find it is more economical to live off their\r\n\r\nparents than to move on to Jurong and set up their\r\n\r\nown  homes.  But no doubt as these  young  workers\r\n\r\nadvance  in age and mature, they will get  married\r\n\r\nand  then they will want to find their own  homes.\r\n\r\nWhen  this  happens, we shall find more  and  more\r\n\r\nworkers living in the flats that we have built  in\r\n\r\nJurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards complaints of fish and vegetables not\r\n\r\nbeing  fresh,  I do not know to what extent  these\r\n\r\ncomplaints  are justified.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Constitution (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  now  before  the House  seeks  to  introduce\r\n\r\ncertain changes in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these is the provision of a new\r\n\r\nArticle 1A empowering this House to elect a  Vice-President of the Republic of Singapore.  The  need\r\n\r\nfor  the  creation of a Vice-Presidency  has  been\r\n\r\nfelt  for  some  time now - in  fact,  ever  since\r\n\r\nSingapore    became   an   independent   Republic.\r\n\r\nConsequential   upon   Singapore    becoming    an\r\n\r\nindependent   Republic,  the  duties   that   have\r\n\r\ndevolved upon the President as Head of State  have\r\n\r\nincreased,  as  hon. Members know full  well.  The\r\n\r\noccasions  which  have  necessitated  the   actual\r\n\r\nparticipation of the President himself  in  purely\r\n\r\nceremonial    functions   have   also   increased.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  each time the President  leaves  the\r\n\r\nRepublic,  an  Acting Head  of  State  has  to  he\r\n\r\nappointed  in  order to carry on his  duties.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  for  some  time  in   the   past\r\n\r\nconsidered   this  matter  and  has  reached   the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that it would be advantageous  that  a\r\n\r\nVice-President  be appointed who  could  not  only\r\n\r\nassist the President but also act as Head of State\r\n\r\nduring his absence. As with the Head of State,  so\r\n\r\nalso  in regard to the Vice-President, the  proper\r\n\r\nmethod  of  appointment should be by  election  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber, so that Parliament may exercise  its\r\n\r\nchoice in regard to whoever may be so appointed to\r\n\r\nperform the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunctions of the President of the Republic.  Hence\r\n\r\nthis  new  Article which will enable the House  to\r\n\r\nelect such a person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Vice-President, as hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will see in the Bill, must first  possess\r\n\r\ncertain qualifications in order to be eligible for\r\n\r\nelection.  In this regard, his qualifications  are\r\n\r\nto  be similar to those conditions set out in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  regarding the office  of  President.\r\n\r\nThe   term   of  office  for  the  Vice-President,\r\n\r\nhowever,  would  only be for a  maximum  of  three\r\n\r\nyears.  He may, of course, as in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident,  resign  his  office  and  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfurther  provision in the Bill for the removal  of\r\n\r\nthe  Vice-President from office by Parliament. The\r\n\r\nVice-President  is  also  enabled  by   this   new\r\n\r\namendment in the Constitution to exercise all such\r\n\r\nduties and functions as may be delegated to him by\r\n\r\nthe  President, who, of course, would be  required\r\n\r\nto  act  in  accordance with  the  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the day. The Vice-President  would\r\n\r\nfurther  assist the President in the  exercise  of\r\n\r\nsuch  duties  and functions as any  constitutional\r\n\r\nHead  of  State  in  a modern democracy  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired to perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important provision which I would like to\r\n\r\nemphasise is that this Bill would also enable  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  to empower the Vice-President to exercise\r\n\r\nall   the  functions  of  the  President,  as   an\r\n\r\nalternative  to  appointing a person  to  exercise\r\n\r\nsuch  functions of the President and thus  act  as\r\n\r\nHead of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that hon. Members will agree with me when\r\n\r\nI say that the need for the creation of the office\r\n\r\nof  Vice-President is obvious enough, if  only  to\r\n\r\nrelieve  the  President of some  of  his  manifold\r\n\r\nduties.  The Vice-President, under the  provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution,  need  not  necessarily  be\r\n\r\nappointed   full-time,  although   there   is   no\r\n\r\nprohibition  for  a  full-time appointment  to  be\r\n\r\nmade.  The  Government,  however,  envisages   the\r\n\r\nsituation   where   whoever  is  appointed   Vice-President  should  also be  allowed  to  carry  on\r\n\r\nwhatever functions or work he may have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen performing before his appointment as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment to the Constitution, purely a\r\n\r\nfinancial  one, seeks to amend Article 86  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution which, as it now stands, requires the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   introduce   a   Supply   or    a\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Supply  Bill in  Parliament  before\r\n\r\nappropriating  funds from the  Consolidated  Fund,\r\n\r\nsave  in regard to such sums as are by law already\r\n\r\ncharged  to  the  Consolidated Fund.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nunder   the   present  constitutional   provisions\r\n\r\nrelating  to  financial  expenditure,  as  it  now\r\n\r\nstands, the Minister for Finance would be required\r\n\r\nto authorise, subject to the prior approval of the\r\n\r\nCabinet, expenditure from the Consolidated Fund or\r\n\r\nother   Government  funds  as  he   may   consider\r\n\r\nessential  for  the  continuance  of  the   public\r\n\r\nservices.  There is also a further  limitation  on\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure so authorised for any service  to\r\n\r\nthe effect that the expenditure so authorised must\r\n\r\nnot  exceed  one-quarter of the amount  voted  for\r\n\r\nthat particular service in the Supply law for  the\r\n\r\npreceding year. Hon. Members will agree that  such\r\n\r\nrestrictions  may at times prove  too  restrictive\r\n\r\nand   indeed  work  to  the  disadvantage  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the day in certain  circumstances,\r\n\r\nas, for example, where an unusual emergency arises\r\n\r\nwhich  necessitates spending of  an  exceptionally\r\n\r\nlarge amount of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order therefore to remove these fetters, the\r\n\r\nGovernment now seeks the approval of the House  to\r\n\r\nthis  proposed amendment to Article  86.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to point out that the proposed amendment  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  exceptional provision as it  follows  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  practice in many countries, the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom and India amongst them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is purely to enable the Government a\r\n\r\nfreer   hand   in   authorising   expenditure    - expenditure  that can be regarded as required  for\r\n\r\nunusual circumstances and to meet exigencies  that\r\n\r\nwe  may  be  faced with during the  crucial  years\r\n\r\nahead  of  us  and which may be in excess  of  the\r\n\r\nannual  Supply  law  - that it  has  been  thought\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  introduce  this  amendment.   These\r\n\r\nenlarged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npowers  would only be used on the occasions  which\r\n\r\nrequire  the  appropriation of  amounts  over  and\r\n\r\nabove  normal  expenditure that are  sometimes  of\r\n\r\nsuch magnitude or of such indefinite character  as\r\n\r\nwould be extremely complex and therefore difficult\r\n\r\nto  explain without technical knowledge and  which\r\n\r\nmay  at  any rate prove undesirable in the  public\r\n\r\ninterest  to disclose in detail. Nevertheless,  as\r\n\r\nit is and has always been the law that expenditure\r\n\r\nshould  be  approved by Parliament, the  amendment\r\n\r\nwould  still require the Government of the day  to\r\n\r\nauthorise  such expenditure. While clause  (6)  of\r\n\r\nArticle  86  of  the  Constitution  removes   such\r\n\r\nfetters   as  may  appear  superfluous   in   such\r\n\r\nexigencies  as I have referred to, the  canons  of\r\n\r\nprudence  and  careful  husbandry  will   not   be\r\n\r\nabandoned as the normal procedures will still have\r\n\r\nto be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, clause 4 of this Bill seeks to amend\r\n\r\nthe definition of the term \"office of profit\",  as\r\n\r\ndefined  in  Article 91 (1) of  the  Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis   article  has  again  been   found   to   be\r\n\r\nrestrictive  to such an extent as to prohibit  one\r\n\r\nwho  is  employed in the public service full-time,\r\n\r\nfrom  holding  appointment at any of the  Missions\r\n\r\nSingapore maintains in countries abroad. It is  to\r\n\r\nenable  persons  who would now by reason  of  this\r\n\r\ntechnical  definition \"office  of  profit\"  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed   to  public  offices  abroad   at   the\r\n\r\ncountry's  various  Missions,  that  it  has  been\r\n\r\ndecided  to  bring  about  this  change  with  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this amendment  to  Article  91.\r\n\r\nPersons who would otherwise be debarred from  such\r\n\r\nappointments abroad would thus be enabled to serve\r\n\r\nthe public and the nation both within the Republic\r\n\r\nand  elsewhere.  Article 91 of  the  Constitution,\r\n\r\nwhen  drafted, did not have in mind the status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as an independent nation, but rather  as\r\n\r\na   component  State  within  the  Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. One can really say, therefore, that  the\r\n\r\npresent amendment to Article 91 is necessary as  a\r\n\r\nnatural consequence of Singapore having become  an\r\n\r\nindependent Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   I  rise  in  support  of  the  Constitution\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill and I would like to  say  a  few\r\n\r\nwords  on  the  new Article IA.  Singapore  is  an\r\n\r\nindependent country and, as such, has  acquired  a\r\n\r\nlot   of   pomp  and  ceremony.  And  with   this,\r\n\r\nnaturally,  a  lot of protocol. In  the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears or more, it has become apparent to even  the\r\n\r\nleast alert of our citizens that the duties of our\r\n\r\nPresident  have  been  more  than  one   man   can\r\n\r\nshoulder,  no matter how fit he may  be.  A  Vice-President  will  therefore be a useful  person  to\r\n\r\nhave  to  share or undertake some or  all  of  the\r\n\r\npresidential  duties. I am glad to hear  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister   that  the  proposed  office  of   Vice-President  will  not necessarily  be  a  full-time\r\n\r\nappointment. This provision will therefore allow a\r\n\r\nwider  choice  of  a suitable person.  However,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  how  the  Cabinet  can  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that the appointment should  be  for  a\r\n\r\nmaximum period of three years. I think three years\r\n\r\nis  rather  too short a time. It is so short  that\r\n\r\nbefore the new Vice-President can get to know  his\r\n\r\njob  and its finer points, he will relinquish  his\r\n\r\njob  and a new person could be appointed.. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  a  five-year term will be a more  reasonable\r\n\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I fully support the Constitution (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  Its  main purpose is to make provision  for\r\n\r\nParliament to elect a Vice-President in  order  to\r\n\r\nassist  the President in such of his functions  as\r\n\r\nthe  President may care to hand over to him.  Also\r\n\r\nwhen the President is abroad or is absent for  any\r\n\r\nother reason, he may act as President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Head of State of a newly emergent\r\n\r\ncountry,  the  President has a lot of  duties  and\r\n\r\nfunctions to carry out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur  present President, Inche Yusof bin Ishak, has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  Head of State since 1960.  After  1965,\r\n\r\nwhen Singapore became independent, he has been the\r\n\r\nPresident of our Republic. We know that he  seldom\r\n\r\nwent abroad, but recently he went to Australia for\r\n\r\na  holiday. So in the absence of a Vice-President,\r\n\r\nwe  requested the Speaker of the House to  be  the\r\n\r\nActing President. With the passage of the Bill, we\r\n\r\nwill  be in a better position and we will find  it\r\n\r\nmore convenient to have a Vice-President to act as\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few points to raise. Firstly,\r\n\r\nwhen  will a Vice-President be elected? The second\r\n\r\npoint  is similar to what the Member for Joo  Chat\r\n\r\nhas raised. Why should we limit his term of office\r\n\r\nto  three years? As the President's term of office\r\n\r\nis   for  four  years,  I  feel  that  the   Vice-President's term of office should also be for four\r\n\r\nyears.  Otherwise we will have to  elect  again  a\r\n\r\nVice-President  while the President  is  still  in\r\n\r\noffice.  So  I would like the Minister to  explain\r\n\r\nwhy there should be the stipulation of three years\r\n\r\nof office for the Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank the Member for Joo Chiat and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang for their support. They have  asked\r\n\r\none  question,  \"Why  three years  for  the  Vice-President  and four years for the President?\"  Why\r\n\r\nnot?  It  does not follow that because you appoint\r\n\r\nthe  President for four years you must  appoint  a\r\n\r\nVice-President for four years. After all, the Vice-President is second to the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants to know when the\r\n\r\nVice-President will be appointed. All  I  can  say\r\n\r\nhere is, \"Very soon.\" But assuming we appoint  the\r\n\r\nVice-President tomorrow, surely we cannot  appoint\r\n\r\nhim for four years. I think that should answer the\r\n\r\ntwo  Members'  question as to how long  the  Vice-President  should hold office.
