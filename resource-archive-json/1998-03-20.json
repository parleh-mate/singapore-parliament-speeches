We  have  had\r\n\r\ncomplaints about ranking.  The system is too strung up,  and  it\r\n\r\ncauses too much stress on our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, at the Committee of Supply debate, I remember\r\n\r\nMrs  Lim  Hwee Hua raised this point, and asked the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  to  reconsider  its  emphasis  on  grades.   And  she\r\n\r\nreferred to the MSG factor which, in the eyes of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation, refers to mean subject grade, but MSG, Mrs Lim  said,\r\n\r\nis  not good for our health and we should remove it.  I am  glad\r\n\r\nto  say  that  MSG  was indeed removed.  But  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  this call for the Ministry of Education to  take  away\r\n\r\nthis over emphasis on grades in the evaluation of a school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have talked to principals who have, perhaps\r\n\r\nwishfully, perhaps regretfully, said that even though they  have\r\n\r\ngiven  very high value added to the students, if only they could\r\n\r\nget  better students to start off with, then they could get even\r\n\r\nhigher  ranking.  I think it is important for us  to  know  that\r\n\r\nranking  is good if done properly.  It is good because it  keeps\r\n\r\nschools  on  their  toes.   It  helps  them  to  evaluate  their\r\n\r\nprogrammes so that at the end of the day, they know what is weak\r\n\r\nand  what  is  strong, and so they can improve  themselves.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  is  good  for parents to know  what  are  the  good\r\n\r\nschools.  They can choose schools in an informed manner, so that\r\n\r\nthe  talents, skills and inclinations of their children  can  be\r\n\r\nmatched better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Ministry of Education to think of\r\n\r\nfine   tuning   the  ranking  system.   For  example,  we  could\r\n\r\nemphasise  on  value added.  I know that after the Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply debate last year, the Ministry of Education has begun  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  other factors like value added in a more focused  way.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  say  that, currently, there  is  still  too  much\r\n\r\nweightage  given to academic grades per se.  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  for example, to look at giving value added  the  same\r\n\r\nweightage as academic grades.   Because at the end of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe day if I send my child to school, I want to know what she is\r\n\r\ncapable  of, and the school will make her an even better person.\r\n\r\nSo value added, 30% perhaps, and academic grades, 30%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also look at other factors like the school has a\r\n\r\ngood  community service programme.  The ECA programme  is  good.\r\n\r\nIt  builds  compassion in the students.  It  builds  leadership.\r\n\r\nThese  are  all the other outcomes of education and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat is 10%.  As Mr Chiam said yesterday, the playing fields are\r\n\r\nimportant.  The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields\r\n\r\nof  Eton.   So playing fields, sports, physical programmes,  are\r\n\r\nimportant  too.   We  could give some  weightage  to  that  too,\r\n\r\nperhaps another 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for schools to have a record of\r\n\r\ncharacter building, teaching values in their progammes  and  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  must  be evident.  And if it is evident, I  think  they\r\n\r\nshould  deserve 5% for that.  Facilities of the school  will  be\r\n\r\nimportant and that, however, should not be over emphasised.   We\r\n\r\ncan  give it another 5%.  I think there can be a catch-all  kind\r\n\r\nof  category to which we give a 10% weightage, and this category\r\n\r\ncould  involve  peer ranking of the school by the  teachers  and\r\n\r\nstudents from other schools.  We look at how the school develops\r\n\r\nits teachers, the quality of its teachers, the school's \"spirit\"\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  how hard they work to make sure that the  students\r\n\r\nget an all-round education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Ministry to think along these lines.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on planning and\r\n\r\ndesign of schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbourhood schools provide much convenience to pupils\r\n\r\nand  parents.  They help parents to save on transport costs, and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  ferrying  of  children  to  and  from  schools,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  parents who have more than one child  attending\r\n\r\nschool.   Thus, I would like to urge the Ministry to place  more\r\n\r\nemphasis  to  ensure that there are adequate  school  places  in\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make the following suggestions for the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Register all Primary One pupils two or three years\r\n\r\nbefore  they  start school.  This will enable  the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\ncollect  exact  demand data for the planning of  schools.   With\r\n\r\nthis  information,  the  Ministry can  proceed  to  develop  new\r\n\r\nschools  immediately or refurbish existing schools to  cater  to\r\n\r\nthe  demand.   According to the PWD contract, it is possible  to\r\n\r\nbuild a school within 18 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Revise the 1 km policy for neighbourhood schools.\r\n\r\nChildren staying 1 km must be given higher priority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide extra capacities when designing primary\r\n\r\nschools.   At present, many principals are conducting tutorials,\r\n\r\nremedial  and  ECA classes during school hours,  thus  utilising\r\n\r\nmany classrooms.  This has made it difficult for schools to have\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility  to increase its enrolment  to  cater  for  the\r\n\r\nincreased demand.  We should build schools with more classrooms,\r\n\r\nso as to cope with the fluctuating demand yearly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Kentucky Department of Education has introduced\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated Planning Process, a joint effort  between  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Education,  local school  council  and  district\r\n\r\nstakeholders.  In this process, school councils are  responsible\r\n\r\nin   providing  an  environment  in  their  schools  to  enhance\r\n\r\nstudents'  achievement.  I would urge the Education Ministry  to\r\n\r\ninvolve school staff, School Advisory Committee members, parents\r\n\r\nand community leaders in the planning of schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the design of schools, PWD should adopt a\r\n\r\ndifferent  approach  in  producing a  conducive  environment  in\r\n\r\nschools  to  facilitate  innovative and creative  learning.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  schools should also be designed to accommodate  adult\r\n\r\nevening classes, public lectures, civil and community functions,\r\n\r\nand  cultural activities to serve the community.  In  this  way,\r\n\r\nschools can be better utilised for the benefit of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save resources, we should build primary and secondary\r\n\r\nschools at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame site.  This would facilitate the sharing of facilities such\r\n\r\nas  school fields, sports facilities, canteen and civil  defence\r\n\r\nshelter.   A  joint  primary and secondary school  can  then  be\r\n\r\nmanaged  by  one principal for better coordination  and  control\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I am going to talk\r\n\r\nabout discipline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, we are seeing a spate of youth violence and\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquencies in public places.  There is also a rising\r\n\r\ntrend  of  teenage girls getting into trouble with  the  law.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the situation is as serious in our schools.  I am\r\n\r\nsure  the  Education  Ministry is  equally  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour of students, both inside and outside school.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  nip  the problem of young offenders in the bud.  This  would\r\n\r\nrequire  the  support  and  cooperation  of  parents,  teachers,\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders,  neighbours  and  friends  to  reverse  this\r\n\r\nunhealthy trend before it gets worse and out of control.  We are\r\n\r\nalready  facing  problems  with  illegal  immigrants,   and   we\r\n\r\ncertainly  do not wish to aggravate the situation with  our  own\r\n\r\ncitizens, especially from our youths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Italian educator and a pioneer in early childhood\r\n\r\neducation, Maria Montessori, believed that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first idea that the child must acquire, in order to be\r\n\r\nactively disciplined is that of the difference between good  and\r\n\r\nevil, and the task of the educator lies in seeing that the child\r\n\r\ndoes not confound good with immobility, and evil with activity.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, early childhood education is very important. I am not\r\n\r\nsure that we should be satisfied with the present state of early\r\n\r\nchildhood  education in Singapore.  I wish to urge the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto  take  concrete  steps  to  improve  the  standard  of  early\r\n\r\nchildhood education.  We need better trained and better  quality\r\n\r\ncare-givers in our nursery schools, kindergartens and child care\r\n\r\ncentres.  The Government can be more generous by setting aside a\r\n\r\nportion  of  the  foreign maid levy to support  early  childhood\r\n\r\neducation for our toddlers and young children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should spare no efforts in whatever ways possible to\r\n\r\nbring  up  healthy  children  of  good  character.   This  would\r\n\r\nminimise the incidence of our young getting into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  problems in schools and breaking the  law.   Every\r\n\r\nchild  who goes astray and gets into trouble with the law  is  a\r\n\r\nloss to the family and society.  This, in Singapore, we can  ill\r\n\r\nafford.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a characteristic of a good school is one that enforces\r\n\r\nstrict  discipline  on  its pupils.   Parents  share  this  view\r\n\r\nbecause they believe that a high standard of discipline is  good\r\n\r\nfor  their  children.   It  is true that  \"for  the  moment  all\r\n\r\ndiscipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later  it  yields\r\n\r\nthe  peaceful  fruit  of righteousness to those  who  have  been\r\n\r\ntrained by it.\"  But discipline can only come when students have\r\n\r\nrespect  for  their  teachers and  fear  the  authority  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers.   Here,  I  would  urge all  parents  to  support  the\r\n\r\nteachers in their work, especially when the child   deserves  to\r\n\r\nbe disciplined.  All our teachers are well-trained professionals\r\n\r\nwho are able to deal with their pupils appropriately.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to commend the Ministry for increasing the number of\r\n\r\ncoordinators  for the pastoral care and guidance programme  from\r\n\r\n476  in FY97 to 1,014 in FY98.  This shows that the Ministry  is\r\n\r\naware of the problems faced by our students and the need to help\r\n\r\nthem overcome their difficulties in school work and relationship\r\n\r\nwith others.  The pastoral care and counselling services offered\r\n\r\nin  our  schools  will go a long way to help  students  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  self-esteem and motivate them to strive to achieve  their\r\n\r\nfullest potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pastoral care and guidance programme can also tie in\r\n\r\nwith  the after school care programme to facilitate the  success\r\n\r\nof  the single session schools.  The schools can tap the alumni,\r\n\r\nparents and even get grandparents as \"student-minding\" resources\r\n\r\nand  facilitators in the after school care programme.   This  is\r\n\r\nalso  an area where the Community Development Councils can  play\r\n\r\nan active role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Straits Times recently reported a survey finding\r\n\r\nthat  less  than  a quarter of our youths would  turn  to  their\r\n\r\nparents for advice.  They would rather confide in their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfriends  and  get advice from their buddies.  Our  schools  must\r\n\r\nreinforce the importance of parents as partners in the education\r\n\r\nof  their children.  The schools now arrange for the parents  to\r\n\r\nmeet  with  the teachers regularly to obtain feedback  on  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  performance and behaviour in school.  It would  help\r\n\r\nif  seminars are organised for parents to meet among  themselves\r\n\r\nto  share  experience and to learn from one  another  the  time-tested  parenting methods.  I think Mr Iswaran  spoke  about  it\r\n\r\nyesterday.    The  school  can  facilitate  better  parent-child\r\n\r\nrelationship  and  encouraging them to spend  as  much  time  as\r\n\r\npossible  together.  It is when the family develops  the  strong\r\n\r\nbonds  that  there is less likelihood for children to misconduct\r\n\r\nthemselves  inside and outside school.  We can easily  take  the\r\n\r\nattitude  that  family relationship is outside  the  purview  of\r\n\r\nteachers  and the ministry but, unfortunately, we cannot  easily\r\n\r\nsegregate one part from the other.  Parents are indeed  partners\r\n\r\nin  the education of their children.  I hope more can be done in\r\n\r\nschool to foster closer family ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over\r\n\r\nthe  past  few  years, I have been talking about  discipline  in\r\n\r\nschools and on juvenile delinquency.  Today, I am going to speak\r\n\r\nagain on the same topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reported that the problems of poor discipline and\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquency  in  schools are  getting  more  and  more\r\n\r\nserious  nowadays.  There were a number of newspaper reports  on\r\n\r\nyoungsters  committing  crimes  ranging  from  petty  theft   to\r\n\r\nfighting, robbery, and even drug addiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the conversations I had with my residents, I\r\n\r\ndiscovered that in the neighbourhood schools, these problems are\r\n\r\nmore serious, for example, smoking, fighting and even collecting\r\n\r\nprotection money, etc.  They use both inducement and threats  to\r\n\r\nforce their fellow students into joining their secret society. I\r\n\r\nhave  even  heard that some 14-15 year old students were  coaxed\r\n\r\ninto working as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbar-waitresses  to  earn money so that they  would  buy  branded\r\n\r\ndresses, cosmetics and even drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In school, these students show no respect at all to their\r\n\r\nteachers.  They have even scratched and damaged the car of their\r\n\r\nteachers.   I  sincerely  hope  that  these  incidents  are  the\r\n\r\nexceptions  rather than the norm. Because if this  gets  out  of\r\n\r\nhand  and juvenile delinquency in schools becomes a very serious\r\n\r\nproblem,  we  have  to  ask ourselves what  kind  of  a  society\r\n\r\nSingapore has become and what our schools are becoming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\nkept records of such incidents and whether such records could be\r\n\r\npublicised so that we know how serious these problems are in the\r\n\r\nschools.   I  would like to know what solutions the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation has to resolve these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Loh Meng See also mentioned that parents form\r\n\r\na  very  important link in our whole education system.  I  fully\r\n\r\nagree  with that.  But times are different now because  nowadays\r\n\r\nmost  parents  are working.  For those who are well-to-do,  they\r\n\r\nhave  maids  at home to help look after the children.   But  the\r\n\r\nbasic foundation of the family would be affected resulting in  a\r\n\r\nlack  of  discipline  in the families.   No  doubt  the  parents\r\n\r\nthemselves  have to bear certain responsibilities  in  educating\r\n\r\ntheir  children, but the schools should also be involved in  the\r\n\r\ndiscipline of the students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is very regrettable. Some 20-30 years\r\n\r\nago,  when  we  were schooling, we were very respectful  of  our\r\n\r\nteachers  and  we remember them all our lives.  I  can  remember\r\n\r\nthat  in  the past when the naughty students saw their  teachers\r\n\r\nthey would try to hide themselves.  But now, even when they have\r\n\r\ndone  something wrong or have misbehaved, they do not  care  two\r\n\r\nhoots  about it, and they do not see the need to hide from their\r\n\r\nteachers.  So I feel that the Ministry of Education should  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter - how to raise the status of the teachers, give\r\n\r\nthem  more authority so that they can play a very important part\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisciplining the students.  If the students show no respect  for\r\n\r\ntheir teachers, then even with all the good plans going all  the\r\n\r\nway  to  the  next century, which the Minister had  informed  us\r\n\r\nyesterday, will be meaningless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is: \"Has the discipline in our schools\r\n\r\nreally  gone to the point of disaster?\"  If so, then  we  should\r\n\r\nform a multi-departmental committee to look into this matter and\r\n\r\nto resolve this problem of juvenile delinquency.  I am sure that\r\n\r\nover the past few days the Minister for Education had heard  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  many of our Members here.  I hope that he would  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity today to enlighten us on the problems of  poor\r\n\r\ndiscipline in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nreinforce  what  Mr  Loh Meng See has highlighted.   As  he  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  recent statistics continue to point  to  an  adverse\r\n\r\ntrend  in  the  making  - that of the rise in  participation  of\r\n\r\nfemales   in  juvenile  related  crimes.   Teenage   girls   now\r\n\r\nreportedly  account  for more than 10% of youths  jailed,  about\r\n\r\ndouble  the  5% rate in 1989.  There is also anecdotal  evidence\r\n\r\nthat  a  number  seems to be running away from their  homes  and\r\n\r\nfrequently  end up involving themselves in gang-fights  or  drug\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a disturbing trend that requires immediate\r\n\r\nattention.   Whilst  remedial  action  is  obviously  important,\r\n\r\npreventive  measures would be far better.  At a forum  organised\r\n\r\nby  the  PAP  Women's  Wing,  participants  made  the  following\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  which I would like to forward for  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that schools complement parental efforts by\r\n\r\nproviding  the necessary discipline, especially with  regard  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  wilfully misbehaved.  Secondly,  that  schools\r\n\r\nprovide  more pastoral care, especially for girls  who  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to cope with either the school or home environment  or\r\n\r\nrelationships.   Counselling by teachers  or  professionals  can\r\n\r\nhelp  prevent  problems from emerging if troubled  students  can\r\n\r\nhave someone outside the home to talk to as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the school can indeed be an extremely effective medium\r\n\r\nfor identifying potential delinquency and, more importantly, for\r\n\r\nreducing the incidence of such delinquency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am\r\n\r\nglad  to  know  that the Public Service Commission is  providing\r\n\r\nequal  opportunities  for holders of overseas  Chinese  language\r\n\r\nscholarship  to  upgrade themselves.   At  the  same  time,  any\r\n\r\nscholarship holder who wishes to pursue further studies  leading\r\n\r\nto  a Masters degree would be allowed to defer service of his or\r\n\r\nher  bond.   This  is indeed encouraging, particularly  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese scholars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently mother tongue education has once again become a\r\n\r\nhot  talking  point among those who are concerned  with  Chinese\r\n\r\nMandarin.   There are many insiders speaking with authority,  as\r\n\r\nwell as many laymen, posing as experts.  The main emphasis is on\r\n\r\nhow   to   augment  the  curriculum  of  today's  mother  tongue\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Singaporeans who know Chinese are of the view\r\n\r\nthat, at the moment, the use of Chinese Mandarin is getting more\r\n\r\nand  more  popular in Singapore.  Almost all Chinese  can  speak\r\n\r\nMandarin, especially the younger generation of Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nnot  only  speak  Mandarin but read and write Chinese  as  well.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of our Government's past efforts in promoting\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  education and the Speak  Mandarin  Campaign  has\r\n\r\nattained its social objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the economic reform and open door policy of\r\n\r\nChina,  learning  mother tongue Chinese will not  only  help  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the traditional Chinese culture and enhance our  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  but will also be of great economic benefit.  As  such,\r\n\r\neven those who are not proficient in Chinese are beginning to be\r\n\r\nconcerned with their children's standard of Chinese.  This is  a\r\n\r\ngood sign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Education recruited a batch of\r\n\r\nstudents  who  obtained only \"B3\" grade in Chinese  at  the  \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevel  examination for training to become primary school Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers.   These parents who are not too proficient in  Chinese\r\n\r\nare  worried that the progress and standard of their  children's\r\n\r\nlearning  of the mother tongue may be affected if these students\r\n\r\nwith  \"B3\"  grade  in  Chinese were to become  their  children's\r\n\r\nChinese language teachers after their training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my children scored \"As\" in their \"O\" level for both\r\n\r\nChinese and English, but look at the notes they wrote to  me  in\r\n\r\nChinese.   They are just unreadable rubbish.  This  is  a  fact.\r\n\r\nThis  shows the difference between the standards of Chinese  and\r\n\r\nEnglish  languages in the \"O\" level examinations.   In  view  of\r\n\r\nthat, may I suggest to the Ministry of Education that this batch\r\n\r\nof  \"B3\"  grade Chinese trainee teachers be sent to the relevant\r\n\r\ncolleges  in  China  and Taiwan for training  to  improve  their\r\n\r\nability to teach the Chinese language.  I believe this will help\r\n\r\nto  alleviate the worries of some of these parents.  I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education will consider this suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Toh See Kiat suggested that the Singapore\r\n\r\nManagement University should relax the requirement of Chinese in\r\n\r\ntheir  admission  criteria.  On the contrary, I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Management   University   will   consider   allowing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are proficient in Chinese to do their  business\r\n\r\nadministration   courses in Chinese so as to contribute  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic development in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy in promoting the teaching of mother  tongue.\r\n\r\nOur  bilingual policy has done well and the fact  that  we  have\r\n\r\nevolved  a  language  policy peacefully speaks  volumes  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy because in many parts of the world, Sir, the\r\n\r\nlanguage issue is fraught with danger and often results in civil\r\n\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while English will remain the language of Government\r\n\r\nand  business,  the  learning of mother tongue  will  allow  our\r\n\r\nchildren to preserve our cultural heritage and our roots.  It is\r\n\r\nvery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant.  No matter how proficient we are in English, Sir,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  understand  our cultural background,  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nMalay,  Indian or Chinese, some knowledge of the language  is  a\r\n\r\nprerequisite.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the values that these children will learn will enable\r\n\r\nthem  to meet the onslaught of Western influence.  And if I  may\r\n\r\ndigress, my colleagues, Mr Loh, Mrs Lim, Mr Choo and others have\r\n\r\nspoken  earlier  of the diminishing regard and respect  for  the\r\n\r\nteachers.   I wonder if it has to do with the Western  influence\r\n\r\non  our television.  When we were young, we respected a teacher,\r\n\r\nwhether he was in the school or outside the school, he was still\r\n\r\na  Cikgu.  Probably the teachers are too over-friendly.  In this\r\n\r\nmodern  age,  many of them are on \"Hi-hi\" basis.  In  our  time,\r\n\r\nwhether he was in the school or outside the school, we respected\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been involved in the move to get some Indian\r\n\r\nlanguages  recognised.  When I first wrote to the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation,  then  Dr  Tony Tan, in 1996,  for  Hindi  and  other\r\n\r\nlanguages  to  be  taught, I never thought that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  so  easily  agree  to this, but  this  was  a  long  gone\r\n\r\nstruggle.   But  thanks  to the generosity  of  the  Government,\r\n\r\ntoday, besides Tamil, which is one of the official languages  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi are being taught by\r\n\r\nthe community themselves.  The Minister would be pleased to know\r\n\r\nthat  one  of the reasons many expatriate parents are  attracted\r\n\r\nhere is that these languages can be learned.  And I do not think\r\n\r\nany  other  part  of  the  world outside Singapore  offers  such\r\n\r\nfacilities.   I speak for the community that this has  been  the\r\n\r\nmost generous help the Government has given for these sub-ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups to preserve their cultural roots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area of concern is the standard of Tamil in\r\n\r\nschools.  In the past, whenever we in SINDA visited a school,  a\r\n\r\nSTEP  centre  or  met with parents, one of the areas  which  was\r\n\r\noften  raised was the lack of Tamil teaching in certain schools,\r\n\r\nbut I do not think this is an issue now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  many schools, in fairness to the Ministry, are offering\r\n\r\nit.  But one area which is of concern to the Indian community is\r\n\r\nthe  very  high  standard of Tamil.  I am not suggesting  for  a\r\n\r\nmoment that we should lower the grade but I think the choice  of\r\n\r\nwords  and  vocabulary should be done in such  a  way  that  the\r\n\r\nstudents will find it enjoyable and attractive.  I am told of  a\r\n\r\nPrimary One kid, whose mother did Tamil in school, but she found\r\n\r\nit difficult teaching her son.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to examine this problem. And I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the  Tamil  teachers, in  particular,  to  help  in\r\n\r\ncreating  an  atmosphere  where  the  students  will   find   it\r\n\r\nenjoyable.   I am very pleased to read today's Life  section  of\r\n\r\nthe  Straits  Times that Tamil Murasu has started a section  for\r\n\r\nthe   students.   I  think  the  Tamil  Section  of  the   Radio\r\n\r\nCorporation of Singapore is also helping.  It is very important,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  learning the simple words of Tamil.  And I am reminded\r\n\r\nof the Senior Minister of State, Encik Sidek Saniff's remarks in\r\n\r\nthis House many years ago about Lord Denning who wrote in simple\r\n\r\nEnglish.   Our  Tamil teachers and Tamil scholars  may  want  to\r\n\r\nemulate this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would end by urging the Ministry also to examine\r\n\r\nanother policy.  Our bright students - I am not referring to the\r\n\r\ngifted,  but  other students - 10% of the core who are  good  in\r\n\r\nlanguage  should do an optional language, ie, a third  language,\r\n\r\nwhich could be any of the languages.  I would urge them to  take\r\n\r\nMalay as an additional language, if possible, because we in this\r\n\r\npart of the world need to have some knowledge of Malay.  And  if\r\n\r\nyou  know Malay, you can learn Bahasa Indonesia easily.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  one  Asian language which is popular  is  Japanese.   I\r\n\r\nthink Japanese is important to us and we should also, if we want\r\n\r\nto  have our windows open to the world, learn other languages  - Thai,  Nepalese,  and what have you.  And I  am  not  suggesting\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  a concerted and forced effort,  but  children\r\n\r\nshould be encouraged, especially those who have got a flair  for\r\n\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the mother tongue\r\n\r\npolicy was implemented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  a  very specific social objective, and that is,  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat our  children retain the language of our forefathers and we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  transmit  our  traditional  culture  to  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration.   However, for those children  from  families  whose\r\n\r\nworking  language is not the mother tongue, they  have  to  work\r\n\r\nextra hard just to make the grade.  I am envious of Mr Peh  Chin\r\n\r\nHua  in  the sense that his son is effectively bilingual at  the\r\n\r\n\"A\" grade level.  I have also three school-going children and  I\r\n\r\nmust  report  that they have to struggle very hard to  make  the\r\n\r\ngrade.   But, nonetheless, I think the mother tongue  policy  is\r\n\r\nappropriate, it is necessary in our social context and I support\r\n\r\nthe policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I would like to address the mother tongue policy\r\n\r\nand  its  consequential policy in the context of our  effort  to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign talents.  Not all foreign talents that we  want\r\n\r\nto  attract are single, or married, without children.  Would the\r\n\r\nsecond  language requirement which sprang from the mother tongue\r\n\r\npolicy  become a hindrance if it is enforced strictly  on  these\r\n\r\nchildren  of  foreign  talents?  Here I am  referring  to  those\r\n\r\nforeign  professionals whose mother tongue is basically English.\r\n\r\nAnd  that could be of any ethnic origin and they could come from\r\n\r\nany part of the world, including UK and United States.  In fact,\r\n\r\nit  is not uncommon today to find Caucasians who have become PRs\r\n\r\nor even citizens of Singapore.  So when the mother tongue policy\r\n\r\nis  applied to them and their children, their children  studying\r\n\r\nin  our school system will be required to study another language\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not their mother tongue.  In this respect, some  take\r\n\r\nGerman  or French and others take Malay.  They probably  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  family environment to support learning and using  the\r\n\r\nlanguages.   To  this group of children, all those  languages  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned are actually all foreign languages.   So  it  is\r\n\r\njust  as  difficult  for them, if not more difficult,  to  learn\r\n\r\nthese  foreign  languages versus our  own  children  or  my  own\r\n\r\nchildren learning the mother tongue.  This is especially  so  if\r\n\r\nthe  child  is already at the secondary level when  the  parents\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Sir, and to inject some human\r\n\r\ninterest  in  this  debate, I would like to  give  a  real  life\r\n\r\nexample.  A British couple, Mr and Mrs Davies, came to my  meet-the-people   session  about  three  weeks  ago   regarding   the\r\n\r\ntremendous difficulties their son, who is enrolled in our school\r\n\r\nsystem, is encountering in learning French.  The husband who was\r\n\r\nengaged as a English Language consultant came to Singapore  with\r\n\r\nthe  family  several  years ago.  At that time,  their  son  was\r\n\r\nalready  a teenager.  The wife, Sheila Ruth Davies, was born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore when her father was serving in the British Army during\r\n\r\nthe  Second World War.  Interestingly enough, this qualified her\r\n\r\nto claim Singapore citizenship which she subsequently did.  As a\r\n\r\nresult, the husband and the son are now both Singapore PRs.  And\r\n\r\nthey  later  have  two  daughters  born  in  Singapore  and  are\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens.   This is a case of  foreign  professionals\r\n\r\ncoming to work in Singapore, fell in love with the country,  and\r\n\r\ndecided  to stay.  They put their son through our school  system\r\n\r\nwhich  by the way they praised highly, compared to their schools\r\n\r\nin  UK.   The son did very well in most subjects, except French,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the second language required and which he only started\r\n\r\nlearning  for  the first time when he joined our school  system.\r\n\r\nBy  then he was already in the secondary school years.   So  the\r\n\r\nson failed repeatedly, despite his best effort.  So much so that\r\n\r\nhe  was  asked  to  leave the Jurong Institute before  he  could\r\n\r\ncomplete his Pre-U education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my appeal, I am happy to report that the MOE is very\r\n\r\nflexible.   It  is  now  allowing  him  to  complete  the  Pre-U\r\n\r\neducation  but  MOE is still insisting that  he  must  take  his\r\n\r\nFrench at the coming \"0\" level examination and must pass with at\r\n\r\nleast  a  D7 in order to fulfil the second language requirement.\r\n\r\nI believe, Sir, it would not be easy for this young man.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having learned their lessons, the Davies are selecting\r\n\r\nMalay as the second language for their two younger daughters.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand they are doing very well in that language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to review whether the mother\r\n\r\ntongue  language  for children of foreign talents  that  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying to attract is necessary.  To me, it seems unnecessary  to\r\n\r\nbe  too  strict  in imposing the second language requirement  on\r\n\r\nsuch  families.  Such families are not the target of our  mother\r\n\r\ntongue policy and I believe we should be more flexible in  those\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua:</b> Sir, please let me declare my interest as\r\n\r\na publisher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, the Ministry of Education has decided\r\n\r\nthat  with  effect from this year the textbook  market  will  be\r\n\r\nfurther open to private publishers.  I welcome the move.   As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact,  over the past 10 to 20  years,  I  have  been\r\n\r\nwondering  why the Ministry of Education decided to set  up  the\r\n\r\nCDIS.   What  was  the  objective of  CDIS  and   what  was  the\r\n\r\nbackground leading to its establishment?  I have always  thought\r\n\r\nthat  the  setting  up of CDIS  was against the  philosophy  and\r\n\r\npolicy of the PAP.  It was some kind of a welfare scheme.   With\r\n\r\nCDIS   dominating   the   market  for   school   textbooks   and\r\n\r\nsupplementary  reading materials under the very  lowest  prices,\r\n\r\nthe  private  publishers cannot gain access  to  this  lucrative\r\n\r\nmarket.   Many  of  them  found  it  difficult  to  survive   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Many foreign publishers lost a lot of money,  closed\r\n\r\nshop, packed up and returned to UK or the USA.  Meanwhile, there\r\n\r\nwere  a  lot  of  complaints against the  quality  of  textbooks\r\n\r\npublished by  CDIS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Ministry of Education is beginning to farm out the\r\n\r\npublication  work to private sector publishers.   I  think  this\r\n\r\nwill  give more publishers to display their talent and expertise\r\n\r\nand  it  will enhance the inspirational values of the books  and\r\n\r\nmake  them  more interesting.  This shows that the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation wants to introduce the competition mechanism to remedy\r\n\r\nthe  shortcomings  of CDIS so as to give our  schools  a  larger\r\n\r\nvariety  of choices of high quality textbooks, and this will  in\r\n\r\nturn benefit the students. .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to note that the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\nassured us that there will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  a  very good authentication procedure to monitor the quality\r\n\r\nand price of textbooks.  What I am worried about is that if they\r\n\r\nwant   to  produce  good  textbooks,  do  they  understand  that\r\n\r\ncompiling them is a very time-consuming process?  From  my  past\r\n\r\nexperience,  the senior officials in the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nhave very often overlooked the actual amount of time needed from\r\n\r\nwriting to delivery of a set of textbooks.    In the past,  CDIS\r\n\r\nhad  3  to  4  years  to complete the production  of  a  set  of\r\n\r\ntextbooks.   On  the  other  hand, the private  publishers  were\r\n\r\ngiven only 6 to 9 months to do the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, it takes between 12 and 16 months to write and\r\n\r\nedit a set of textbooks, and another 4 to 6 months to print  and\r\n\r\nproduce  them.  The Ministry  of Education would  take  2  to  3\r\n\r\nmonths  to examine and approve them.  Then, the publishers  will\r\n\r\nhave to promote and introduce the textbooks to the schools.  The\r\n\r\nschools will select the set they prefer.  This will take another\r\n\r\n2 to 3 months.  Finally, the publishers will print the textbooks\r\n\r\nand  supply  them  to  the schools, hopefully  before  the  term\r\n\r\nstarts.   This again will take another 2 months.   All  in  all,\r\n\r\nsome  22  to  30  months are needed.   Therefore,  whenever  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education announces the new curricula,  publishers\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  ample time to go through the  syllabuses  and\r\n\r\ncurricula and  prepare the new sets of  textbooks accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Education can pay attention to the\r\n\r\ntime  factor  and give the publishers more time to  prepare,  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we  can  meet  the  quality  requirements  of  our\r\n\r\ntextbooks.    Otherwise,   the  open   door   policy   for   the\r\n\r\nparticipation  of  private publishers will also  be  a  case  of\r\n\r\n\"still  born\", that is, something similar to the CDIS   kind  of\r\n\r\nsituation,  where  creativity   is  lacking  in  the   textbooks\r\n\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying all these things from my own experience because\r\n\r\nI  have  spent about 20 to 30 years in this business and I  know\r\n\r\nthat  to ensure the availability of good and creative textbooks,\r\n\r\nwe  must  realise  that  we are not like  the  other  developing\r\n\r\ncountries.  In China, children by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillions  are fighting for places in the schools.   So  long  as\r\n\r\nthey can find places in the school and there is a textbook, they\r\n\r\nare  more  than happy.  One set of textbooks is good enough  for\r\n\r\neveryone.   Everyone will be happy.  We are a developed country.\r\n\r\nWe  are looking at creativity and thinking schools.  So we  must\r\n\r\nhave  creative  materials.   We must  have  a  variety  of  good\r\n\r\ntextbooks  available  for our schools to  select.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education can consider my proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, like Mr Peh Chin Hua, I applaud the\r\n\r\nrecent  move  by  the Ministry to liberalise the  publishing  of\r\n\r\nschool  textbooks.  This should allow yet more  innovation  into\r\n\r\nthe education process and enrich learning in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, two key issues for which I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider.  The first is whether textbooks would\r\n\r\nbecome  more  costly  as a result of the move,  and  the  second\r\n\r\npertains to quality control of supplementary materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern over possible upward pressure on the cost\r\n\r\nof  textbooks stems from two observations.  Firstly, the  burden\r\n\r\nof developing and publishing textbooks hitherto is shouldered by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry, providing therefore an indirect subsidy.  Private\r\n\r\nsector  publishers will naturally find it difficult not to  pass\r\n\r\non  the associated developmental cost.  Secondly, there is every\r\n\r\npossibility  that niche groups of textbooks may  emerge  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.  These, however, given the size of our market, will  not\r\n\r\nbe able to enjoy the economies of scale necessary to check price\r\n\r\npressures.   How would the Minister ensure that textbooks  would\r\n\r\nnot become too costly for the school-going population?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the second issue, we are aware of a\r\n\r\ncontinuous proliferation of supplementary materials  in  use  by\r\n\r\nschools.   With  the advent of yet more multi-media  educational\r\n\r\naids  for  schools,  will  the Minister  endeavour  to  exercise\r\n\r\nsimilar quality control to ensure consistency?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, with a rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging world, knowledge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  become  the  buzzword  for education  and  business  alike.\r\n\r\nKnowledge  is the asset that provides the competitive  advantage\r\n\r\nfor  any individual or corporation.  It is with this realisation\r\n\r\nthat we see the urgency in cramming knowledge into students  and\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt that Singaporean students have a\r\n\r\nwide knowledge base.  Just look at the number of GCE `O' and `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  subjects that they have to study and be examined in.   To\r\n\r\nprepare students for the long gruelling process of achieving  an\r\n\r\neducation  based  on  a large number of subjects,  the  cramming\r\n\r\nbegins at an early age.  I am relieved to hear the Minister  say\r\n\r\nthat  there  has been a revamp of the curriculum  and  that  the\r\n\r\nworkload  of students is being reduced.  Up till now, Primary  1\r\n\r\npupils are taught a wide range of subjects.  This is being  done\r\n\r\nwhile  they  learn to read, write and develop their arithmetical\r\n\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst being grounded on a foundation for learning, Primary\r\n\r\n1  pupils have to cope with learning a wide variety of subjects.\r\n\r\nUnder  such circumstances, there are a number who will only  get\r\n\r\nby   with  some  skills  in  reading  and  writing  and  without\r\n\r\ndeveloping   their   arithmetical  sense.   Such   pupils   will\r\n\r\neventually  find  themselves unable to cope  with  the  learning\r\n\r\nprocess and eventually drop out of the school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know of a number of pupils who left the school\r\n\r\nsystem after Primary 5 who cannot read.  There is a need  to  go\r\n\r\nback  to fundamentals.  Primary 1 must be the place where pupils\r\n\r\nare  given the foundation for learning.  It is too easy  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  many children already go to kindergarten where they  learn\r\n\r\nto read.  Whilst children in kindergarten do learn their ABC and\r\n\r\nsome can read reasonably well, they do not have the maturity  to\r\n\r\nmaster  such  skills.  Their vocabulary will remain limited  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  unable  to  express themselves.   Those  kindergarten\r\n\r\nchildren  who  progress in reading and writing,  generally  have\r\n\r\nstrong home support and supplementary tutoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without proper development of the three `R's - reading,\r\n\r\nwriting  and  arithmetical sense - a pupil will face  an  uphill\r\n\r\ntask  in  learning other subjects.  It comes  a  time  when  the\r\n\r\nsubjects  are learned without understanding, merely by rote  and\r\n\r\nwith  the one aim of passing the examination with little  or  no\r\n\r\nunderstanding.  There is a saying which is also a truism,  \"When\r\n\r\nwe  are young, we learn to read.  When we are older, we read  to\r\n\r\nlearn.\"  The greatest skill to master in school must be that  of\r\n\r\nreading, writing and arithmetics.  With the three `R's, one  can\r\n\r\nengage in self-study in any subject.  When mastered at an  early\r\n\r\nage,  the  rest  of  the school curriculum would  be  merely  an\r\n\r\nextension  of  knowledge.  Add to this the  thinking  skill  and\r\n\r\ncreativity, learning becomes an experience to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Primary 1 pupils are made to master the\r\n\r\nthree  `R's.  The curriculum should be focused towards achieving\r\n\r\nthis objective.  With a proper foundation for learning, not only\r\n\r\nwill  the pupils do well in school, but they will be capable  of\r\n\r\nkeeping pace with the rapid changes around them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Sir, for giving me\r\n\r\nthis opportunity.  Sir, may I now be permitted to deal with  the\r\n\r\nHistory  textbooks in Singapore.  It is important for youth  and\r\n\r\nour  young  to  learn  about the process  of  how  we  became  a\r\n\r\nRepublic, how we have succeeded and what were the pitfalls.   We\r\n\r\ncould  draw  richly on our oral history and in  this  regard,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  schools  should take advantage of numerous  projects\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Oral History Department.  Perhaps, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  also consider the teaching of History in a more friendly\r\n\r\nand  living  way.   I am pleased to say that sometimes,  when  I\r\n\r\nvisited  either  Chinatown or even Little  India,  I  see  young\r\n\r\nstudents  visiting the temple or mosque, and see  how  sireh  is\r\n\r\nbeing made or sold.  This is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also use television as a tool to teach History.\r\n\r\nMany  students  may not know of the various transport  modes  we\r\n\r\nhad, the mosquito buses and various other things which are dying\r\n\r\noff.   It  is very important for us to preserve these historical\r\n\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many countries, it is compulsory for students to\r\n\r\nlearn  the culture of the country, the government, and a  little\r\n\r\nbit  of history of the country.  Even in the university,  it  is\r\n\r\ncompulsory.   I  am not suggesting that History should  be  made\r\n\r\ncompulsory  but  I  hope that we should give some  weightage  to\r\n\r\nmodern  History.   I  am not talking of History  which  is  just\r\n\r\nconfined from 1959, the post-PAP era.  I am thinking of 1940  to\r\n\r\n1955  which  was  a  crucial period, how we  lived  through  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Occupation, how we lived after the Japanese  war,  the\r\n\r\nstruggle and the chaos we were in.  It is very important for  us\r\n\r\nto learn and know about this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to single out one personality who I think\r\n\r\ndeserves  greater study by our historians and I am referring  to\r\n\r\nMr David Marshall who was not only the first Chief Minister but,\r\n\r\nin   his  political  lifetime,  he  carried  the  struggle   for\r\n\r\nindependence, and multi-lingualism was his idea.  He transformed\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  and gave it a new life.  He introduced legal  aid  and\r\n\r\nvarious  things.   I  think Mr David Marshall  deserves  greater\r\n\r\nstudy than that we have hitherto given to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was very pleased to learn this morning that my\r\n\r\ncharming  friend, Mdm Claire Chiang, had written a book together\r\n\r\nwith  another  writer,  Mr Chan Kwok Bun, called  Stepping  Out.\r\n\r\nThis deals with the business entrepreneurs in Singapore and I am\r\n\r\nvery  glad that TCS is making a series out of this.  I hope this\r\n\r\nwill  be the beginning, and TCS will take the trouble to go  and\r\n\r\nmake  a  study of other pioneers from various other communities,\r\n\r\nas  I  said,  David  Marshall, and let the  students  know  that\r\n\r\nwithout history, without the past heritage, we will be nowhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to probably consider forming\r\n\r\na  committee  to  study how history could be taught  in  a  more\r\n\r\nliving  and meaningful way and I am emphasising that it  is  not\r\n\r\nthe colonial history alone, it is history from 1940 to 1955, one\r\n\r\nphase,  and  from 1955 to now.  And the students will  have  the\r\n\r\ncuriosity perhaps to go back and study on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities.

In fact, some may even fear to let their children\r\n\r\nplay near the water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to encourage all Singaporeans, in particular\r\n\r\nschool  children, to learn swimming, life saving  and  first-aid\r\n\r\nskills.   Let  me  highlight the importance for Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nlearn  swimming.  According to the Straits Times' report on  6th\r\n\r\nDecember 1997, 83 people drowned in Singapore last year,  52  at\r\n\r\nsea,  10  in swimming pools, 8 in rivers and the rest in  canals\r\n\r\nand  other places.  Out of the 83 drowned, some of them may  not\r\n\r\nhave  died if they can swim or understand water safety or people\r\n\r\naround them know life saving skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a qualified life guard myself, it saddens me each\r\n\r\ntime  I  read  in  the  papers  of  drowning  cases,  especially\r\n\r\ninvolving school children.  Over the last 20 years, I have saved\r\n\r\nfour persons.  Two of them would not have been alive today if  I\r\n\r\ncould  not  swim or did not know any life saving  skills.   This\r\n\r\nclearly  shows  the  usefulness of learning  swimming  and  life\r\n\r\nsaving skills.  Learning swimming and life saving is not only to\r\n\r\nkeep  one  healthy.   But  it  is a  skill  which  will  make  a\r\n\r\ndifference  to  one's  life or other  people's  life.   As  life\r\n\r\nsavers,  we live by this motto: \"Whosoever you see in  distress,\r\n\r\nrecognise in him a fellow man.\"  We are always on the alert  and\r\n\r\nready to save anyone who encounters difficulty in water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to note that most schools have\r\n\r\nincorporated swimming programmes for their Primary 4 and Primary\r\n\r\n6  pupils.   However, pupils of other levels are not given  much\r\n\r\nopportunity in schools to take up swimming lessons.  In fact,  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  by  one school shows that 50% of Primary Three  students\r\n\r\nhave never been to a swimming pool.  There is an urgent need  to\r\n\r\nimplement a structured programme to ensure that all our students\r\n\r\nachieve a certain level of proficiency in swimming, life  saving\r\n\r\nand first-aid skills.  The Ministry should place more emphasis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  these  ECAs  and  work  closely with  the  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil  and swimming and life saving associations   to  further\r\n\r\nencourage  such activities.  Swimming, life saving and first-aid\r\n\r\ncourses  should be made compulsory for all students, except  for\r\n\r\nmedical or religious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I am going to speak on information\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is spending a total sum of $1,091 million\r\n\r\nfor  the IT Masterplan in Education.  For FY98, an estimated sum\r\n\r\nof  $349 million has been provided as development expenditure on\r\n\r\nthe  provision of information technology resources  for  primary\r\n\r\nschools,  secondary schools and junior colleges.  As  the  large\r\n\r\nproportion  of the expenditure on IT is development  in  nature,\r\n\r\nwhat  would the likely recurring expenditure be?  We  know  from\r\n\r\nthe experience of the financial services industry that IT incurs\r\n\r\nvery  high overhead cost if the operations were to be maintained\r\n\r\nat  the full level of efficiency.   May I ask the Minister  what\r\n\r\nwould  the parents then be asked to pay for the high cost of  IT\r\n\r\napplications in school?  Will it pose a burden to  them  if  the\r\n\r\nschool fees are to be increased, because of IT cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Educational Technology Division has been tasked to\r\n\r\nimplement  MOE's Information Technology Masterplan  and  provide\r\n\r\ndirection on the use of education technology in schools.  May we\r\n\r\nknow  from  the  Minister how IT will change  the  teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning  in the classrooms.  Will the classrooms of the  future\r\n\r\nbe  re-configured?   Maybe the Minister can shed some  light  on\r\n\r\nthis, though the Minister has touched briefly on it yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indicated that the Ministry will be developing less\r\n\r\neducational  technology materials from 501 in  FY97  to  127  in\r\n\r\nFY98.   I  would like to ask the Minister why is it so. Does  it\r\n\r\nmean that there would be less development work done in-house and\r\n\r\nmore are being out-sourced to multimedia publishing houses?   Or\r\n\r\nhas the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready   developed  the  bulk  of  the  educational  technology\r\n\r\nmaterials  and, therefore, there is less need for  developmental\r\n\r\nwork in the year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, also, the number of training hours provided has\r\n\r\nincreased  from  3,722  hours in FY97 to 4,782  hours  in  FY98.\r\n\r\nThis,  translated  into an 8-hour working day,  means  that  the\r\n\r\ntraining hours provided has increased from 471  man-days to  597\r\n\r\nman-days.   When this is compared to the number of  teachers  in\r\n\r\nthe education service, the number of training hours appears very\r\n\r\nlittle.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale in which we have invested in the use of IT in\r\n\r\neducation and the direction in which we are taking is pioneering\r\n\r\nin  nature.  In fact, I am glad to read about the agreement that\r\n\r\nthe  Education  Ministry has with Microsoft  in  developing  the\r\n\r\neducational software.  This is because few governments have done\r\n\r\nthis before.  The journey we have chosen is an exciting and even\r\n\r\na  precarious one.  Many organisations have, in the  past,  made\r\n\r\nmistakes in the investment on computers and IT which had  turned\r\n\r\nout  badly.  We have to tread on this carefully, and be prepared\r\n\r\nfor  some  mistakes along the way.  However, I am optimistic  in\r\n\r\nwhere  we are heading.  Our children will benefit the most  when\r\n\r\nour investment in IT bears fruit in later years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I applaud the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education for embarking on programmes in school  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  thinking skills and promote creativity.   I  understand\r\n\r\nthat, for example, in the past 10 years or so, more schools have\r\n\r\nimplemented  Edward De Bono's thinking strategies.  The  reports\r\n\r\nwhich  I have seen in the newspapers seem to suggest that school\r\n\r\nchildren find such programmes more enjoyable and enriching.  And\r\n\r\nteachers   too  find  these  programmes  useful  in  encouraging\r\n\r\nstudents   to  pursue  self-learning.   The  need  to  encourage\r\n\r\nindependent thinking and a spirit of innovation have been  spelt\r\n\r\nout  in  the  list of Desired Outcomes also known as the  `8888'\r\n\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education system, as it stands now and in the\r\n\r\nfuture, will have a large\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the type of society and the position that  Singapore\r\n\r\nachieves  at  the  international level.  Many  Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, including myself, have argued that for Singapore to  make\r\n\r\nthe  next  grade, we need innovations and creative ouputs  which\r\n\r\ncan  match the best in the world.  Creativity will determine how\r\n\r\nour  companies compete in the age of ideas.  Hence, we  need  to\r\n\r\nmould  creative  minds  and innovative spirits  from  among  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, what exactly is creativity? American psychologist,\r\n\r\nHoward  Gardner,  defined the exemplary creator  as  \"a  strong-minded  individual who often retains child-like  characteristics\r\n\r\nsuch  as  self-centredness.\"  Ms Wu Yee-Ping, CEO of  Music  Pen\r\n\r\nInc., a New York based company, believes that \"creativity begins\r\n\r\nwith a child-like curious mind which is not afraid to take risks\r\n\r\nand  experiment.\"   Ms Wu received the Award for  Excellence  in\r\n\r\nScience and Technology from New York.   And she runs her company\r\n\r\nby  encouraging her designers to be creative and bold.  If these\r\n\r\nare the characteristics of a creative mind, then how do we teach\r\n\r\nit?   Studies have shown that gifted children often  lose  their\r\n\r\nspark  after  going to a mainstream school.  Can we,  therefore,\r\n\r\nteach creativity in our schools today?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of creativity, as seen in the above\r\n\r\ndescriptions,  is experimentation, discovery, and  a  child-like\r\n\r\ncuriosity to check things out.  Imagine a child learning to feed\r\n\r\nhimself  with a spoon.  He will fail several times.  But through\r\n\r\nthe  experience, he will learn something about how to  grip  the\r\n\r\nspoon,  about the consistency of the food which is all over  his\r\n\r\nbody,  about  his hand-eye coordination, and about dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe  frustration  of  not being able  to  have  his  food.   But\r\n\r\nperhaps,  most  importantly,  he will  experience  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nthrill of being able to do something for himself.  All this  may\r\n\r\nnot come about if he is spoon-fed all of the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the nature of creativity to experiment. But\r\n\r\nexperiments  can lead to success or failure.  Are  our  students\r\n\r\nprepared  to  deal with failure?  Is our system  sympathetic  to\r\n\r\nfailures so that, like the child\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearning  to feed himself, the student can pick himself  up  and\r\n\r\nachieve  his  objective?  Many tertiary students I met  recently\r\n\r\nspoke  about  the  need  for stable jobs.   I  sense  that  this\r\n\r\npreference could be due to a fear of failure.  Why is  this  so?\r\n\r\nHoward Gardner again observed that the US system is a system  of\r\n\r\n\"infinite second chances\".  Perhaps the perception is  that  our\r\n\r\nsystem does not provide enough second chances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that we have to create opportunities in\r\n\r\nschools for our children to explore and innovate.  We can  teach\r\n\r\nsome  basic  skills.   But we have to  leave  the  rest  to  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to  discover, but we must also counsel them  and  tell\r\n\r\nthem  that  failure  is not a bad thing.  Failure  is  part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  the  process of discovery and  innovation.   Through\r\n\r\nfailure, we will learn what works and what does not work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inventor of the plastic soda bottle was one person\r\n\r\nby  the  name  of  Nathaniel  C. Wyeth.   The  invention,  as  I\r\n\r\ndiscovered, did not come very easy.  His initial search  yielded\r\n\r\na very terrible-looking bottle. But he persisted, and used, \"all\r\n\r\nhis  failures and knowledge of things that wouldn't  work  as  a\r\n\r\nspringboard to new approaches.\"  He also said, \"if I hadn't used\r\n\r\nthose  mistakes as stepping stones, I would never have  invented\r\n\r\nanything?\"   By the way, Sir, the success of the plastic  bottle\r\n\r\nhas  created an environmental problem for modern researchers  to\r\n\r\ndeal with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, all inventors share some common traits. They\r\n\r\nthrive  no matter what the odds are and they are always dreaming\r\n\r\nof  perfecting an imperfect world.  Perhaps we may want to allow\r\n\r\nour school children to dream.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the Members' speeches\r\n\r\nyesterday,  to  a  certain extent, echo the sentiment  that  our\r\n\r\nchildren  in  school  suffer from very high  levels  of  stress.\r\n\r\nStress  may  be seen in two senses: first of all,  as  a  mental\r\n\r\nstate,  wherein a person who is under stress feels  a  sense  of\r\n\r\ntension and unease; secondly, as an agent or source which serves\r\n\r\nas  a  stimulus against which the body is forced to react  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain way to the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first example of the kind of stress that I have talked\r\n\r\nabout  would be one which results in a feeling of distress,  eg,\r\n\r\nhaving  failed in examination.  In the second instance,  stress,\r\n\r\nas  an agent or as a source, would, for example, be examination,\r\n\r\nparental expectation of a child's performance in school or  peer\r\n\r\npressure.   These forms of stress can, in turn, lead  to  stress\r\n\r\nbeing a sense of mental state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we implicitly recognise that a child's misery really\r\n\r\nbegins  from  the  time he takes cognizance of  his  surrounding\r\n\r\nenvironment.  As anxious parents concerned with giving a child a\r\n\r\nhead start in life, we bombard the child with all forms of books\r\n\r\nand learning aids and toys the minute the child is able to utter\r\n\r\nhis  first sound.  When a child is barely able to walk,  anxious\r\n\r\nparents will rush him off to all manner of classes, from  junior\r\n\r\ngymnastics to speech and drama, and, yes, even creative  writing\r\n\r\nwhen  a child has even hardly mastered basic words.  In schools,\r\n\r\nwe  recognise that the child faces much pressure.  This pressure\r\n\r\nis  especially  intense  from schools  seeking  to  maintain  or\r\n\r\nachieve a reputation as a school of standing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, additionally, as we have heard earlier, our policy on\r\n\r\nsecond  language  has  also contributed much  to  the  stressful\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  the  child has to labour  under.   It  is  my\r\n\r\nunderstanding that most children are not able to cope  with  the\r\n\r\nlearning of two languages effectively.  On the average, a  child\r\n\r\neither  masters one language well or acquire an average  ability\r\n\r\nin  two  languages.   Only  a  minority  of  children  have  the\r\n\r\nexceptional ability to master both languages well.  The  outcome\r\n\r\nthen  is  that  for most students, they spend a disproportionate\r\n\r\namount  of  time learning the second language.  It  becomes,  as\r\n\r\nthey  say, the albatross which the children have to wear  around\r\n\r\ntheir  necks  for many years, in primary and secondary  schools.\r\n\r\nAnd,  indeed,  for  many, the sad outcome has  been  that  these\r\n\r\nstudents  who struggle with the second language would have  done\r\n\r\nwell  in  the PSLE examinations if the second language  had  not\r\n\r\npulled down their grade average.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a 1985 study on stress and school children, Dr\r\n\r\nAlvin  Thomas confirmed that three sources of stress  come  from\r\n\r\nhomework, parents and peers.  In that study, Dr Thomas said that\r\n\r\n50%  of  students sampled indicated they were under stress  from\r\n\r\nhomework overload.  24% of the students sampled said they suffer\r\n\r\nfrom  depressant effect of homework.  Understandably, the  child\r\n\r\ntries  to  measure  up  to expectations, either  a  self-induced\r\n\r\nexpectation or expectation set by others.  For those who rise to\r\n\r\nthe occasion, well, they get a pat on the back and they move on.\r\n\r\nThose  who do not, suffer from a sense of failure.  This affects\r\n\r\nthe  sense of self-esteem, and perhaps explains why we see  more\r\n\r\noutlandishly dressed delinquent children smoking and hanging out\r\n\r\nat  public  places.   Sometimes I  wonder  whether  a  child  is\r\n\r\nstressed for its own sake or for the sake of the parent's  pride\r\n\r\nand the school's position in the ranking system.  The priorities\r\n\r\nmust be clear, and perspective must be balanced.  All too often,\r\n\r\nwe  lose  sight of our objectives and we miss the wood  for  the\r\n\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe in educational excellence. However,\r\n\r\neducational  excellence does not always  have to  be  synonymous\r\n\r\nwith  the high stress levels of the children.  Indeed, I am  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether we can link stress and educational performance  in\r\n\r\nschools.  By stressing our children to excel in school, which in\r\n\r\nthis case is measured by the performance output of the child, we\r\n\r\nare  indeed paying a very high price in the process.  We rob our\r\n\r\nchildren of their childhood, of the  joys of living life to  the\r\n\r\nfull  and of the life of sweet memories of childhood, as we  all\r\n\r\nknow  it.  In the end we produce children who are so preoccupied\r\n\r\nwith  performance and results that we end up with  children  who\r\n\r\nare very self-centered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note from yesterday's announcement that the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry has decided to cut down the curriculum  load\r\n\r\nof  students by 10-20%.  This decision is indeed consistent with\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  getting our children to focus  more  on  thinking\r\n\r\nskills and less on knowledge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition.  The lighter load will presumably free up a child's\r\n\r\ntime for other forms of constructive pursuits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I welcome the idea of a reduced curriculum, I am\r\n\r\nnot  sure  whether this has the effect of substantially reducing\r\n\r\nthe  stress  level  of children.  Reducing the curriculum  could\r\n\r\nalso  mean,  for the anxious parents, that the child  will  have\r\n\r\nmore   time,  relatively  speaking,  to  spend  on  the  reduced\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   In other words, the child could well  be  spending\r\n\r\nthe  same number of hours on fewer topics, with the result  that\r\n\r\nthe stress level may not necessarily be reduced correspondingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides reducing the curriculum load of a child in\r\n\r\nschool,  I  would like to ask the Minister whether the Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  is at the same time looking at other ways of  reducing\r\n\r\nstress in our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I heard Mr Sim\r\n\r\nBoon Ann's speech about students suffering from stress from  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of  the  second  language.   When  my  children  learn\r\n\r\nEnglish,  they  also  find it stressful.  So  shall  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education  to lower the standard  of  English  in\r\n\r\nschool?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Minister for Education spoke in this House\r\n\r\nyesterday,  he  painted a very idealistic educational  objective\r\n\r\nfor  us.   He  also  said that in achieving such  an  objective,\r\n\r\nteachers  play  a  decisive role.  The Minister also  introduced\r\n\r\ncertain  measures  to lighten the teachers'  workload,  such  as\r\n\r\nrestructuring the curricula, cutting down the course content and\r\n\r\nsyllabi.  But all these can be implemented only in a few  years'\r\n\r\ntime.  In the meantime, upon the implementation of new education\r\n\r\npolicies,  teachers immediately face extra workload  and  mental\r\n\r\nstress.  For example, in the application of IT in teaching,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education stipulates that by the year 2000,  30%  of\r\n\r\nthe teaching content must apply IT.  Many teachers have gone for\r\n\r\ntraining in software application - Internet, Powerpoint, Chinese\r\n\r\nStar,  etc.  But knowing how to use the software and using  them\r\n\r\nfor the design of teaching materials require two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent levels of proficiency in IT.  At the moment, there are\r\n\r\nnot many CD-ROMs available, especially for Chinese language, and\r\n\r\nnot  much suitable materials on the Internet.  Yet, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education keeps exerting pressure on the teachers to apply IT\r\n\r\nin their teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In creative teaching, the teacher's dilemma is how to carry\r\n\r\nout  creative teaching in class and at the same time ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  academic  results of his students will not be  compromised.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Education said that academic  performance  is\r\n\r\npart  of  a holistic education and that the pursuit of  holistic\r\n\r\neducation    will    not    compromise    academic    standards.\r\n\r\nTheoretically,  this  may  be so, but when  the  measurement  of\r\n\r\nsuccess  or  failure  of  education is  based  on  results,  the\r\n\r\nteachers  would still have to be more realistic  to  go  by  the\r\n\r\nstandards by which they are measured.  I am not against creative\r\n\r\nteaching  and  the emphasis on the thinking skills of  students,\r\n\r\nbut  when  we  are emphasizing so much on marks and  scores,  on\r\n\r\nresults and performance, where do we get the support point?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, will the Ministry of Education consider the\r\n\r\nways of setting questions so as to ensure that creative thinking\r\n\r\nwill  also have a place to play in examination?  At the  moment,\r\n\r\nthe  way of teaching is centred around questions set at previous\r\n\r\nexaminations  and  the  school curricula.   If  the  examination\r\n\r\nquestions  are  the  same, but the teachers  focus  on  creative\r\n\r\nthinking, and the results are therefore affected, will  this  be\r\n\r\nacceptable   to  parents,  the  schools  and  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation?   If the Ministry of Education decides to change  the\r\n\r\ncontents and styles of the questions set for the national  level\r\n\r\nexamination, what form will it take and when will it start?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers feel puzzled about creative teaching. What is\r\n\r\nmeant  by  creative teaching?  What percentage of  the  teaching\r\n\r\ntime should be devoted to creativity and critical thinking?  How\r\n\r\nmuch  of  the teaching must be tailored to impart knowledge  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the subjects that the students are studying?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the Ministry's intention is that the teachers\r\n\r\nwill still have to ensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  students pass all their examinations  and  pass  them\r\n\r\nwell,  with good results, and at the same time MOE also requires\r\n\r\nstudents to have thinking skills, creativity and to achieve  the\r\n\r\ndesired  educational results set by the Ministry  of  Education,\r\n\r\nthen  a different system of evaluation to include the objectives\r\n\r\nshould  be formulated to assess the performance results  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  We all know that our education system is based on the\r\n\r\nmarks of students to measure results.  The success or failure of\r\n\r\nstudents  is also measured by academic results.  So whatever  it\r\n\r\nis,  it   is  examination  results! So parents  follow  it,  MOE\r\n\r\nfollows it, everybody follows it, and the whole society goes  by\r\n\r\nthe  same standard for incentives and awards.  The whole society\r\n\r\nhas  this  kind  of attitude.  Therefore, if you  have  creative\r\n\r\nteaching  to  achieve the higher objective of education  but  it\r\n\r\nwill  not be measured as part of their performance, then I doubt\r\n\r\nvery  much  whether we can achieve much from creative  teaching,\r\n\r\nand  how  much  can  be  achieved in the teaching  goals  beyond\r\n\r\nexamination subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if, on the one hand, teachers are required to proceed\r\n\r\nwith  creative  teaching  and  devote  time  to  non-examination\r\n\r\nsubjects  to  expand  the  students' general  knowledge  and  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen their thinking skills to achieve the higher objective\r\n\r\nof  education,  but  on  the other hand, continue  to  rank  our\r\n\r\nschools based on the students' academic results obtained through\r\n\r\nfaithful  reproduction of knowledge they have  learnt  from  the\r\n\r\ntextbooks  and lecture  notes,  then what does the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation think that the school principals and teachers will do?\r\n\r\nWill  they  focus  on examination results by which  schools  are\r\n\r\nmeasured  or  creative  thinking to achieve  higher  educational\r\n\r\nobjectives?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, once\r\n\r\nagain  I  thank Members for their suggestions and  views.   They\r\n\r\ncome  from a number of very different perspectives.  I  think  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that some of the Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscuss  with each other and try and resolve some of the  issues\r\n\r\nthat they have brought up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, allow me to address the issue of universities\r\n\r\nwhich is a subject I left over from yesterday.  Mr Loh Meng See,\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin Tet Yung, Dr Toh See Kiat, Mr Ee, Mr Zainul  and  Dr\r\n\r\nTeo Ho Pin spoke about this.  DPM, Dr Tony Tan, has outlined the\r\n\r\nkey  changes  to university education at a speech  at  NTU  last\r\n\r\nmonth.  To recap, NUS and NTU are working to double their  post-graduate  intake  by  the  year  2000.   Both  are  working   on\r\n\r\nbroadening   undergraduate   education.    Tertiary    education\r\n\r\nopportunities  will  be expanded with the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Management University whilst Arts education  will  be\r\n\r\nboosted by impending changes to LaSalle/SIA College of the  Arts\r\n\r\nand  the  Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.  These changes  will  be\r\n\r\nannounced sometime next month by Dr Tan Chin Nam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be enough places for Singaporeans? Has there\r\n\r\nbeen  an impact from the currency crisis?  No, we have not  seen\r\n\r\nany  discernible  impact from the currency crisis.   I  wish  to\r\n\r\nassure  Mr  Loh that there will be enough university places  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who,  in  Mr Loh's words,  make  the  grade.   The\r\n\r\nincrease  in  intake of foreign students will be  undertaken  as\r\n\r\npart of the university's overall expansion plans and will not be\r\n\r\nat the expense of Singaporeans.  There is flexibility to enlarge\r\n\r\nthe intake in most courses if there is demand.  In fact, for the\r\n\r\ncoming  academic  year, 1998/1999, there will  be  increases  in\r\n\r\nintakes  in  almost all the faculties, ranging from 1%  to  11%,\r\n\r\nexcept  for Dentistry, Law and Business, where the intakes  will\r\n\r\nremain about the same.  Members will understand the reasons  for\r\n\r\nDentistry  and Law.  For Business, we are making adjustments  as\r\n\r\nwell.   The  total intake will increase by about 4\ufffd%.   For  the\r\n\r\nacademic year 1999-2000, a further 4\ufffd% increase in undergraduate\r\n\r\nintake has been projected.  We will refine this number as we  go\r\n\r\nalong.  So there is no shortage of places for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has broadening affected professional disciplines? Prof.\r\n\r\nChin asked about this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyesterday.  For professional degrees, there is a need to  strike\r\n\r\na  balance between broadening and attaining sufficient depth  of\r\n\r\nknowledge to satisfy professional bodies.  This can be  achieved\r\n\r\nthrough  changes  in the curriculum as well as by  other  means.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in the Law Faculty, as Prof. Chin knows, there are\r\n\r\nplans  to take in a more diverse student body instead of relying\r\n\r\non  those who have completed their \"A\" levels.  This is good for\r\n\r\nproviding more diverse academic preparation for lawyers who  may\r\n\r\nneed to go into specialist areas like patents and trade law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the SMU and OUDP which were raised by Mr\r\n\r\nLoh  and Dr Toh.  The establishment of the Management University\r\n\r\nin  2000 will result in an increase in the number of places  for\r\n\r\nstudents  wishing  to pursue an undergraduate  business  course.\r\n\r\nWhile  NUS will reduce its undergraduate Business Administration\r\n\r\nintake  slightly from the current 600 to 500 in the  year  2000,\r\n\r\nand NTU will stop offering its undergraduate Business programme,\r\n\r\nthere  will be more places available in SMU to make up for these\r\n\r\nchanges.   So in fact the Business intake will increase overall.\r\n\r\nThe   facilities  given  up  by  NTU's  undergraduate   Business\r\n\r\nprogrammes  will be used for an expansion of NTU's post-graduate\r\n\r\nBusiness  programmes and increase in the number  of  engineering\r\n\r\nstudents  taking  Business  minors  and  to  house  the  overall\r\n\r\nexpansion in post-graduate students in all disciplines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a private university, SMU will have some flexibility in\r\n\r\nsetting  fees  and  entry requirements.  However,  as  SMU  will\r\n\r\nreceive  Government funding, we do not expect  its  fees  to  be\r\n\r\nsignificantly higher than NUS or NTU.  We do not expect them  to\r\n\r\nbe  lower either.  As announced by the SIM Governing Council  in\r\n\r\nJanuary,  SMU will require both \"A\" level results and SATs  from\r\n\r\nthose  applying  in 2000 and beyond.  SMU will be  making  other\r\n\r\ninnovations in curriculum, campus design and other areas  and  I\r\n\r\nthink this will be good for the university sector in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother tongue requirement for SMU. Bilingualism is a\r\n\r\ncornerstone of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore's  education system.  SMU has stated  that  applicants\r\n\r\nwill need to satisfy the minimum grade in the mother tongue,  as\r\n\r\nin  the case for admission into NUS and NTU.  There is no change\r\n\r\nto  this  policy and we do not intend to make any changes.   The\r\n\r\nminimum requirement to apply for NUS and NTU is a grade of D7 in\r\n\r\nmother  tongue,  either as a second language taken  at  the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel  examination or as a first language taken at the \"O\" level\r\n\r\nexamination.  Currently, candidates who do not satisfy the above\r\n\r\nrequirements  for mother tongue may still submit an  application\r\n\r\nfor  NTU  or  NUS.   If selected, they will  be  admitted  on  a\r\n\r\nprovisional basis.  During the course of their study, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  required to meet the requisite minimum language requirements\r\n\r\nbefore  they are allowed to graduate.  I am sure SMU will  apply\r\n\r\nthe same flexibility for deserving candidates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU and OUDP serve different purposes. The establishment\r\n\r\nof  SMU  expands  tertiary education opportunities  for  school-leavers   as  well  as  for  some  working  adults.   OUDP   was\r\n\r\nestablished to provide opportunities mainly for working  adults.\r\n\r\nHow  successful has OUDP been?  The OUDP took in its first batch\r\n\r\nof  students  in  1994  and will see  its  first  batch  of  332\r\n\r\ngraduates  this  year,  even though the average  time  taken  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  degree  programme is six  years.   I  have  great\r\n\r\nadmiration for those who have taken the programme.  It  requires\r\n\r\na  lot  of commitment and effort.  Its current enrolment in  the\r\n\r\nfive   fields   of   English,  Mathematics,  Computer   Science,\r\n\r\nTechnology  and Psychology, stands at 5,100.  OUDP started  with\r\n\r\nthree   degree  programmes,  English  Language  and  Literature,\r\n\r\nMathematics  and Computer Science and has since expanded  to  15\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  It will continue to review its course offerings  to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of working adults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUDP's minimum admission requirement was raised by Mr\r\n\r\nGerard Ee and Mr Zainul.  They are already quite flexible.   The\r\n\r\nacademic requirement is 2 GCE \"A\" level passes or its equivalent\r\n\r\nor  an  acceptable  local  diploma.   Other  qualifications  are\r\n\r\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis.  These requirements are less\r\n\r\nstringent than those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  applications to NUS or NTU, for example, the two \"A\"  level\r\n\r\npasses that are required do not have to be at one sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, applicants need to have a minimum work\r\n\r\nexperience,  including NS, of two years and to be  at  least  21\r\n\r\nyears  old.   The requirement takes into account the applicant's\r\n\r\nwork experience, life skills and maturity.  I think we must  all\r\n\r\nunderstand that some minimum academic requirement is  needed  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  those who take up the programme have a  reasonable\r\n\r\nchance   of  success.   This  will  also  give  employers   more\r\n\r\nconfidence about the quality of OUDP and its graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accreditation of private educational institutions is a\r\n\r\npoint  raised  by  Mr Loh and Dr Teo Ho Pin.   The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  does  not  regulate the offer  of  distance  learning\r\n\r\nprogrammes originating from overseas tertiary institutions.   It\r\n\r\nwill become even more difficult to do so in the future when  you\r\n\r\nhave   electronic   communication  and   so   on.    The   local\r\n\r\norganisations  representing the overseas  tertiary  institutions\r\n\r\nhave   to  seek  the  Ministry's  authorisation  to  offer   the\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  The Ministry examines proposals, focusing attention\r\n\r\non  areas  including  the  standing  of  the  overseas  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitution and the programme to be offered.  The prerogative of\r\n\r\nselecting a course of study, however, rests completely with  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  Prospective students would thus need to have  a  full\r\n\r\nunderstanding of what is being offered, including  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  programme  and match it with his or her capacity,  aptitude\r\n\r\nand  resources  available  to pursue  such  studies.   The  best\r\n\r\nprotection would be to conduct a careful and thorough evaluation\r\n\r\nprior to enrolling in a programme.  Students owe themselves this\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the OUDP setting the benchmark standards for\r\n\r\ndistance   learning  courses  set  up  by  private   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions, I think it is already playing quite a useful  role\r\n\r\nby providing another avenue for upgrading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the University's admission system. Mr Chew\r\n\r\nHeng Ching, Mr Sinnakaruppan, Prof. Chin Tet Yung, all have made\r\n\r\nimpassioned  appeals  for  what they consider  to  be  important\r\n\r\nqualities to be taken into account and hope that this  will  not\r\n\r\ndistort the motivations of students when they take on all  these\r\n\r\nimportant qualities in their school life.  I just want  to  make\r\n\r\none  comment  here.   What  we do in the University's  admission\r\n\r\nsystem, as correctly pointed out by many Members, does not  only\r\n\r\nhave  an impact on what type of students enter the universities.\r\n\r\nWhat we do in the University's admission system has a big impact\r\n\r\non  the whole school system because students who aspire to go to\r\n\r\nUniversity will focus their attention and efforts on this.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee that is looking at this is cognizant of this point and\r\n\r\nwill  take  all  these  into account.  I will  forward  all  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  that  Members have raised  to  Prof.  Shih  who  is\r\n\r\nchairing  this  Committee.   We do  not  want  to  prejudge  the\r\n\r\nconclusions of this Committee.  So I will leave it at that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the discussion on University's admission and\r\n\r\nranking,  I  see two interesting trends in the whole discussion.\r\n\r\nOn  the  one hand, there is a desire to say, \"Okay, if  you  say\r\n\r\nthis  is  important, then you should count it.  If  you  do  not\r\n\r\ncount  it, that means you are not giving importance to it.\"   On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, there is another argument raised by many Members\r\n\r\nhere  to say that, \"Well, if you count it, then you distort  the\r\n\r\nstudents'  motivations in doing this.  So  you  shouldn't  count\r\n\r\nit.\"   So on the one hand, you should count all the things  that\r\n\r\nare  important;  on  the other hand, you  should  not  count  it\r\n\r\nbecause,  if it is important, the person really should be  doing\r\n\r\nit  for  the love of it, and not because he gets points for  it.\r\n\r\nSo this is an interesting dilemma.  I think basically we have to\r\n\r\nbe  realistic.  If it is important, we should try and count  it.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the approach which I think we have to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same dilemma exists in ranking. This is a subject\r\n\r\nwhich has been brought up by a number of people here.  They say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, you rank schools, it creates all kinds of distortions  in\r\n\r\nthe  system.\"  Dr Toh, I think, referred to the question  raised\r\n\r\nat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast  year's debate.  I can also refer him to the answer I  gave\r\n\r\nin  last year's debate.  Ranking is something which we will  not\r\n\r\ndo away with in Singapore.  I am open to ideas on how to improve\r\n\r\nthe  system but it is something which is valuable.  It  provides\r\n\r\nvery  valuable  benchmarking for schools, for  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  as a whole and for schools themselves to  know  where\r\n\r\nthey  stand.  If the intake of students in School A  is  roughly\r\n\r\nthe  same  as the intake of students in School B, and  School  A\r\n\r\ndoes  better than School B, remarkably better than School  B,  I\r\n\r\nthink the principals themselves would want to know why, what  is\r\n\r\nit  in  School A which is interesting and useful which School  B\r\n\r\ncan  take  on for the benefit of School B's students.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is quite a reasonable objective of ranking and comparison.\r\n\r\nAnd  all  over the world, in the UK, in the US, in many  states,\r\n\r\nranking is now accepted as something useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that two days ago, I read an interesting article\r\n\r\nin  the UK.  They now rank schools quite avidly in UK, a lot  of\r\n\r\ntests  and a lot of ranking.  And, in fact, I was very happy  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  they have just started value-added ranking  which  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which we have done in our schools for  several  years\r\n\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what Dr Toh See Kiat has proposed with regard to\r\n\r\nranking  will  make  things even worse.   He  suggested  putting\r\n\r\nweights  on  various kinds of things.  In fact, we  do  not  put\r\n\r\nweights  today.   What Dr Toh See Kiat is  doing  is  trying  to\r\n\r\nconvert a vector into a scalar - a multi-factored description of\r\n\r\na  school, by assigning weights into a single number.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  do not do that.  I have a book here which addresses what  Dr\r\n\r\nToh  was talking about.  If you are selecting a school for  your\r\n\r\nchild,  I  have a book here which is produced in four languages,\r\n\r\nand  it  describes all kinds of things: ECA highlights, physical\r\n\r\nfitness  level, aggregate range of pupils posted to that school,\r\n\r\nand  a  short write-up on the emphasis, achievements and  awards\r\n\r\nwhich  the schools write themselves to tell you what the  school\r\n\r\nis  like,  what  the  school believes in.  The   publication  is\r\n\r\navailable.  This provides a broader representation of  what  the\r\n\r\nschool does when parents are selecting secondary schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor their children.  It is also not true that the Ministry gives\r\n\r\ngreater  weightage to the pure academic performance of a  school\r\n\r\nthan   its  value-added.   But  the  public  may  give   greater\r\n\r\nweightage.  The Ministry provides little cash prizes for  value-added  schools.  We do not provide cash prizes for schools which\r\n\r\ndo  well purely by their subject grades.  So I think what Dr Toh\r\n\r\nis  proposing, which is to assign little weights  to  all  these\r\n\r\nthings, is, in fact, going to be quite counter-productive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franchising and the quality of schools - Dr Michael Lim\r\n\r\nspoke about taking \"good\" schools and \"replicating\" them.   This\r\n\r\nis one method of replicating good schools.  But replicating good\r\n\r\nschools is not just a matter of transferring the brand name.  Dr\r\n\r\nLim, I think, has some brand names in mind.  To produce a school\r\n\r\nof the same quality will require the right school leadership and\r\n\r\nmix  of  teachers.   More  importantly, this  assumes  that  the\r\n\r\nstudent body is the same.  A different student body is likely to\r\n\r\nrequire  different  teaching strategies and a  different  school\r\n\r\nethos.   A  direct clone of a school, like Raffles  Institution,\r\n\r\nfor  example, which tailors its programmes and methods  for  the\r\n\r\nvery best of our students is unlikely to be suitable for all the\r\n\r\nstudents in Singapore.  So we must be quite aware of this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to Dr Lim that while he has\r\n\r\ncited  certain  schools, we should not be overly enamoured  with\r\n\r\nbrand  names.  These are schools which do extremely  well.   But\r\n\r\nthere are also other schools which do extremely well which  have\r\n\r\nnames that are not instantly recognisable to the public or to Dr\r\n\r\nLim.   And  by this, I do not just mean schools who have  scored\r\n\r\nthe  best  results.   But, more importantly, the  schools  which\r\n\r\nproduce  the most value-added.  These are schools which  parents\r\n\r\nshould be looking for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do agree with Dr Lim that good school practices and\r\n\r\nmanagement know-how should be replicated so that we can  improve\r\n\r\nour  schools.  And this is, in fact, one of the main reasons why\r\n\r\nwe  have  done  cluster  schools.  These are  headed  by  senior\r\n\r\nprincipals  with  a  proven  track record.   Leadership  in  the\r\n\r\nschools is important.  Principals are important\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople.   If you have a good principal, how do you increase  his\r\n\r\ninfluence,  how do you make better use of him.  He can  run  one\r\n\r\nvery  good school, but if he has run it for half a dozen  years,\r\n\r\nhe  has  a  very  good school there.  How do  you  increase  his\r\n\r\ninfluence?   One way is to have him as a head of  a  cluster  in\r\n\r\nwhich the same principal, the same dynamism, his experience, can\r\n\r\nbe  extended to several other schools.  So this is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why we have cluster schools.  Clusters will also  enable\r\n\r\nschools  to exchange best practices and so forth.  And  we  also\r\n\r\nhave  a regular rotation of principals so that there is a steady\r\n\r\nflow of fresh ideas and energy in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin suggested ISO 9000 for our schools. We do\r\n\r\nhave quality control measures in place in our schools.  They are\r\n\r\nvisited  by inspectors.  First of all, within the school,  there\r\n\r\nis  a quality control structure.  The teachers are supervised by\r\n\r\nheads  of departments and subject and level heads, and its vice-principal  and  principal.  The inspectors of  schools  and  the\r\n\r\nsenior  inspectors of schools, the curriculum  specialists  will\r\n\r\nvisit  the  school, and so forth.  There are school evaluations.\r\n\r\nThere   is   ranking.    And  we  also  compare   ourselves   in\r\n\r\ninternational  mathematics and science studies and  so  on  with\r\n\r\neducational systems in other countries.  So there are  a  number\r\n\r\nof  quality control structures in place already.  I am  open  to\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  seeing how we can improve this and  we  will  see\r\n\r\nwhether Dr Teo's suggestion has merit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat wondered whether or not the schools and the\r\n\r\nHQ are in sync, whether the policies that are promulgated in the\r\n\r\nheadquarters actually get executed in the schools.  And I  think\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang also echoes some of these sentiments:</b> whether\r\n\r\nor  not  the things that we do and say in headquarters  actually\r\n\r\nare done in schools, and whether what happens in the schools  is\r\n\r\nactually  known in the headquarters.  I have been visiting  many\r\n\r\nschools  myself and talking to many teachers.  But I would  just\r\n\r\nlike to let the Members of the House know that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsenior officers in my headquarters - it is not something that  I\r\n\r\nasked  them  to  do but something which they decided  themselves\r\n\r\nthat  they want to do - the Permanent Secretaries, the Director-General  of Education, the Deputy Secretaries, and 11  Directors\r\n\r\n(16  of them in all) visit schools once every two weeks and talk\r\n\r\nto  the  teachers to find out what is happening, to  explain  to\r\n\r\nthem the policies, to get feedback from them directly.  They  do\r\n\r\nnot  go altogether, they go individually.  And in this way  each\r\n\r\nof the schools, every one of our schools, will be visited by one\r\n\r\nof them every year.  This is one of the ways in which we try and\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that the headquarters and the schools have  a  close\r\n\r\nlink together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the subject of miscellaneous fees. Several\r\n\r\nMembers - Mr Loh Meng See, Mr Hawazi and Dr Teo Ho Pin and other\r\n\r\nMPs  - have commented that the cost of education has gone up  by\r\n\r\nsomething like 30%, that operating budgets are tight and we must\r\n\r\nnot  compromise on the quality of education and they ask how the\r\n\r\nMinistry will handle the situation.  Perhaps I can ask the Clerk\r\n\r\nto distribute a Table (Cols. 1883-1884) that I have.  [Copies of\r\n\r\nTable distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980320/19980320-HA-0681883.htm\">Table - School Fees and Miscellaneous Fees (Cols. 1883-1884)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General education is almost fully subsidised by Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the average annual cost per pupil increased  61%  from\r\n\r\n$2,600 in 1992 to $4,200 in 1997, citizen pupils pay a token sum\r\n\r\nof  school fees at the rate of $5 per month for secondary school\r\n\r\nand  $6  per  month for junior colleges.  At primary  level,  no\r\n\r\nschool fees are charged and we have no intention to raise school\r\n\r\nfees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, parents now pay miscellaneous fees. These\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  fees  are  a contribution  towards  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaterials used by pupils in the schools.  In recent years, there\r\n\r\nhad   been  many  innovative  ideas,  curriculum  changes,   the\r\n\r\navailability  of  more materials and programmes.   In  order  to\r\n\r\nexpose pupils to the myriad of innovative materials available in\r\n\r\nthe  market,  schools have been making ad-hoc  cash  collections\r\n\r\nfrom  pupils.   Those of you who have children in  schools  will\r\n\r\nknow  this.  And these ad-hoc cash collections add to the amount\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents  need to spend for the education of their children.   To\r\n\r\nmanage the increase in cost, we need to do two things:  first of\r\n\r\nall,  we  must  make sure that any increase in cost,  any  extra\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  really  worthwhile,  cost  effective  and  cost\r\n\r\nefficient.   But secondly, we also have to provide  a  framework\r\n\r\nfor  schools  to  continue to spend on those  things  which  are\r\n\r\nnecessary, particularly enrichment materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present miscellaneous fee is a token sum which\r\n\r\ncomprises two components: a standard component and a second-tier\r\n\r\ncomponent.  The standard component is fixed by my Ministry at $5\r\n\r\na  month  for primary level, $7 a month for secondary and  $9  a\r\n\r\nmonth  for junior college level.  That is the standard component\r\n\r\nof  miscellaneous fees.  The second-tier component is  currently\r\n\r\ncapped  at  30% of the standard component.  The School  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  or School Management Committee (SAC/SMC)  decides  on\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  the second-tier fees and parents can  use  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  Edusave  Accounts to pay for  the  second-tier  fee.\r\n\r\nMost  schools already find it necessary to collect close to  the\r\n\r\nfull  amount  for  the second-tier fees.  As a  result,  if  the\r\n\r\nschools  wish  to  do  more,  they  often  have  to  make   cash\r\n\r\ncollections  on an ad-hoc basis from students.   This  makes  it\r\n\r\nmore  difficult  for parents to budget for such expenditure  and\r\n\r\nthese  payments are often made in cash rather than from  Edusave\r\n\r\ndue to the inconvenience of making Edusave withdrawals on an ad-hoc  basis,  if  parents  do want to use  Edusave.   These  cash\r\n\r\ncollections  also  place  an  extra  administrative  burden   on\r\n\r\nteachers  and schools because they have to collect the cash  and\r\n\r\nmake  sure  it is all accounted for properly.  My Ministry  will\r\n\r\nput  in  place  a  framework to give schools the flexibility  to\r\n\r\nreduce the ad-hoc cash collections from their pupils by allowing\r\n\r\nthem to raise the second-tier component of miscellaneous fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 1999, the Ministry of Education will allow\r\n\r\nthe  SAC/SMC to charge second-tier miscellaneous fees up to  the\r\n\r\nsame  amount as the standard miscellaneous fees instead  of  the\r\n\r\n30% of standard miscellaneous fees.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAC/SMC will continue to decide on when and how much second-tier\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  fees  should be increased  for  their  respective\r\n\r\nschools depending on the needs of that school and the programmes\r\n\r\nthat the school is undertaking.  Parents can continue to use the\r\n\r\nEdusave  Accounts to pay for the full amount of the  second-tier\r\n\r\nfees,  so  there should be no need for additional  cash  outlays\r\n\r\nfrom parents if they choose to use Edusave.  Parents who wish to\r\n\r\nuse  the Edusave Accounts to pay the second-tier fees will  also\r\n\r\nbe  required  to pay school fees and the standard  miscellaneous\r\n\r\nfees  by  GIRO.   This again will streamline the fee  collection\r\n\r\nsystem  of  schools  and  reduce the  administrative  burden  on\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lifting of the 30% cap, the maximum increase in\r\n\r\nmonthly miscellaneous fees will be $3.50 for primary, $4.90  for\r\n\r\nsecondary  and $6.30 for junior college, all of which  I  stress\r\n\r\ncan be met by using the Edusave Accounts.  For the vast majority\r\n\r\nof  parents, there will be no increase in cash outlay  therefore\r\n\r\nif  they choose to use Edusave for the second-tier miscellaneous\r\n\r\nfees.  The total maximum miscellaneous fees chargeable, ie, both\r\n\r\nthe  standard  and the second-tier component, will  be  $10  for\r\n\r\nprimary,  $14 for secondary and $18 for junior college  and  the\r\n\r\nschools will decide when they need to make adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single session schools. This is a subject raised by Dr Lee\r\n\r\nTsao  Yuan.   There are indeed many benefits from having  single\r\n\r\nsession schools.  The question really is one of resources.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education is already fully stretched  implementing\r\n\r\nthe  single  session programme to all secondary schools  by  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000.  This is quite a massive building programme  because\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  build many new schools as well as build  extension\r\n\r\nblocks in many of the existing secondary schools.  Members  will\r\n\r\nprobably  have  noticed this in the secondary schools  in  their\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the secondary school enrolment is projected to increase\r\n\r\nbeyond the year 2000, more new secondary schools will have to be\r\n\r\nbuilt  to  sustain the single session programme.   So  extending\r\n\r\nsingle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsession  to  primary schools would place further strain  on  our\r\n\r\nresources and it is not something which we are able to do  right\r\n\r\nnow.   And  for primary schools, we need to also study carefully\r\n\r\nthe  pros  and  cons of going single session.   The  pupils  are\r\n\r\nyounger.   It  is not clear that all parents would  welcome  the\r\n\r\nidea of them staying in school till about 3.30 pm each day.   We\r\n\r\nmust  also  remember  that  single  session  schools  should  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped for their educational value and not because  it  is  a\r\n\r\nconvenient means of child care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the subject of mother tongue. I was very tempted\r\n\r\nto  ask  Mr Rai and Mr Peh Chin Hua to have a discussion on  the\r\n\r\nstandard that we should achieve in our mother tongue in schools.\r\n\r\nMr  Peh  Chin Hua expressed concern about the `O' level  holders\r\n\r\nwhom  we  have recruited as teachers for Chinese Language.   The\r\n\r\nintroduction of the diploma in mother tongue language  education\r\n\r\nfor  `O'  level  holders  in 1997 was one  of  several  measures\r\n\r\nimplemented  to augment the supply of Chinese Language  teachers\r\n\r\nfor  primary  schools.  Mr Peh has expressed  concern  that  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  `O' level holders might lower the  standard  of\r\n\r\nChinese Language teaching in our primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry would like to assure Mr Peh that it will not\r\n\r\nlead  to  a  lowering  of standards given the  strict  selection\r\n\r\ncriteria.  Candidates must have good grades in their Chinese  at\r\n\r\n`O' levels and must meet the minimum criteria for pre-university\r\n\r\ncourses.   Short-listed  candidates  must  then  go  through  an\r\n\r\ninterview by Chinese Language specialists from both the Ministry\r\n\r\nand  the National Institute of Education.  During the interview,\r\n\r\ncandidates are assessed for their language fluency, knowledge of\r\n\r\nclassical  literature and their aptitude and keenness  to  teach\r\n\r\nyoung   children.    I  think  this  is  also  very   important.\r\n\r\nSuccessful  applicants  would be  enrolled  in  the  diploma  in\r\n\r\nChinese  Language education programme conducted by the  National\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Education and this is a four-year long  programme.\r\n\r\nThe  trainees would be exposed to classical literature, language\r\n\r\nand cultural training that will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbring  the Chinese Language standard and appreciation of Chinese\r\n\r\nculture  to  a  level comparable to the GCE `A'  level,  if  not\r\n\r\nhigher.  They will also be equipped with pedagogy skills so that\r\n\r\nthey are able to impart their knowledge and inherent passion for\r\n\r\nthe language to their pupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is therefore confident that the Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage teachers from the diploma in Chinese Language education\r\n\r\nprogramme  will  not  lead to any lowering of  Chinese  Language\r\n\r\nstandards  in  our  primary schools.   Like  all  other  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage teachers, they can attend in-service courses on Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage  and  Chinese Language teaching conducted regularly  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry.   They  can also apply to enrol  in  an  on-going\r\n\r\nannual teacher attachment programme in the People's Republic  of\r\n\r\nChina.   The programme is four weeks long during which  teachers\r\n\r\nwill undergo a series of classes conducted at the Beijing Normal\r\n\r\nUniversity  as  well as attachment in schools in Beijing.   This\r\n\r\nprogramme  helps  teachers find new ideas with  respect  to  the\r\n\r\nteaching of the Chinese Language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on Chinese Language, I will take up the point that Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Swee  Say  mentioned yesterday.  In fact,  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nhaving  such  passages in the Chinese Language textbooks  is  to\r\n\r\nconvey  the  moral education messages.  Perhaps, we  can  do  it\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tamil Language, Mr Rai feels that the standard of Tamil\r\n\r\nLanguage is too high.  Mr Peh feels that the standard of Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage is too low.  Somewhere in between, they should meet and\r\n\r\nhave a discussion.  The current Tamil Language syllabuses in our\r\n\r\nschools   have   been  developed  to  meet  the  objectives   of\r\n\r\ntransmitting  cultural  and  traditional  values  and  providing\r\n\r\npupils  with  proficiency in their mother tongue.  We  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  pupils who do not come from Tamil speaking homes may  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  learning  the  language.   We  will  see  what\r\n\r\nadjustments can be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also agree that our bright pupils should be given the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to learn Malay and, in fact, the Ministry  conducts\r\n\r\nlessons in Malay as a third language at its language centre  for\r\n\r\nthose pupils who wish to study the language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked about foreign talent and mother tongue as\r\n\r\nsecond  language.  In fact, the example that Dr Wang brought  up\r\n\r\nactually illustrates the flexibility with which the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  approaches  the  issue of mother  tongue  and  second\r\n\r\nlanguage for those foreigners who choose to settle in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhat  Dr Wang described was that, in fact, the Ministry has made\r\n\r\nmany adaptations, exercised a lot of flexibility and allowed the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  this  particular parent to do quite  a  number  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  things - different languages, Malay  or  French,  and\r\n\r\nseveral opportunities to take and retake the examination.  So we\r\n\r\ndo  provide a considerable amount of flexibility already  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  learning of mother tongue as second language  is  in\r\n\r\nfact good for the students in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional training of teachers is a subject that was\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by  Mr Loh yesterday.  He suggested  a  Principals'\r\n\r\nCollege.  Mr Loh also asked about English Language teachers.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not see a need for a Principals' College right now.  What we\r\n\r\nwould  want  to  do  is to make sure that  the  NIE  becomes  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  place, an institution which is renowned for  research\r\n\r\nin  education and for teaching teachers how to teach.   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething which we would like to see NIE become.  It is  already\r\n\r\nquite  a  well-established  institution  and  it  also  conducts\r\n\r\ncourses  in  educational administration, and so  on.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  principals'  course and  a  course  for  Heads  of\r\n\r\nDepartment.  They go by names which I always find very difficult\r\n\r\nto  remember.  But basically, it is a principals' course  and  a\r\n\r\nHeads of Department's course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh also asked about English Language teachers and\r\n\r\nvacancies, and so forth.  We had a good recruitment in the  last\r\n\r\ntwo  years  and the vacancies for English Language teachers  are\r\n\r\nnot  very  significant now.  We expect to be able  to  fill  the\r\n\r\nexisting  vacancies  by  May 1998 this  year  when  the  freshly\r\n\r\ntrained teachers from NIE come out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee lamented about the large number of subjects\r\n\r\nthat  Primary 1 students take.  I am not sure where he got  this\r\n\r\nidea from.  In fact, our primary school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsyllabus is very, very focused.  In Primary 1, we concentrate on\r\n\r\njust three subjects: English, mother tongue and Mathematics.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  just teach three subjects because the children also  do\r\n\r\nPE,  art, moral education, civics, and so forth.  But the  basic\r\n\r\nemphasis is on these three subjects.  So I am not sure where  Mr\r\n\r\nEe  has  got  his information from.  In fact, we  do  not  teach\r\n\r\nScience until Primary 3.  That is one of the reasons why at  the\r\n\r\nThird International Mathematics and Science Study, when our kids\r\n\r\nwere tested in Science at Primary 4, they came out somewhere  in\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of the table.  So we are extremely focused  in  our\r\n\r\nprimary school curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also expressed concern, which is a valid one, about\r\n\r\nlanguage  training  and ability at a young  age.   In  fact,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry has a learning support programme for students who  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties  coping with the first couple of years  in  school.\r\n\r\nAnd this language support programme, which is in a number of our\r\n\r\nschools, is very well received by parents whose children need  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more support to adapt to primary school.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to Mr Shriniwas Rai who spoke about history. I\r\n\r\nagree that history can be enlivened.  Information technology and\r\n\r\nTV  provide a lot of opportunities, and we will see how  we  can\r\n\r\nmake use of Mr Rai's suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See asked a number of penetrating questions\r\n\r\nabout  information technology.  We have this IT Masterplan.   He\r\n\r\nasked:  what is going to happen after this Masterplan?  How  are\r\n\r\nwe  going to replace the computers and so on?  The Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  is here.  It is quite clear.  When we provide for  this\r\n\r\nMasterplan,  we understand and know that this is not  a  one-off\r\n\r\nexercise  where we spend $2 billion over five or six years,  and\r\n\r\nput  computers in the schools.  There are many other things that\r\n\r\nwe  need  to do.   After that, we have to replace the  computers\r\n\r\nonce  every  three  or four years and so on.   The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance is cognizant of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked how information technology would change the\r\n\r\nway  our  classrooms  would look, how we use  IT  for  teaching.\r\n\r\nThere  are   three basic things.  Firstly, we can use  computers\r\n\r\nfor  very  basic functions, which is drilling.  This  is  fairly\r\n\r\nwell established.  It is like doing homework, practising and  so\r\n\r\nforth.   But  that is very basic.  Second, it can  be  used  for\r\n\r\nteaching and learning in the classroom to enliven classes,  like\r\n\r\nwhat Mr Rai has suggested, for history.  And beyond that, we can\r\n\r\ndo  free form sorts of exercises requiring creativity.  Students\r\n\r\ncan  have interchanges with students in other countries  and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh also asked about training hours and material\r\n\r\nproduction.   The reason the numbers have come down  is  because\r\n\r\nmost  of  them are multimedia.  Instead of producing many,  many\r\n\r\nitems  in  different media, they are all produced in multimedia.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  training  hours will go up as  the  IT  Masterplan  is\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, I agree with all that he has\r\n\r\nsaid.  I really have nothing to add.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Sin Boon Ann, many of the points that he has\r\n\r\nraised  about stress, I have already addressed yesterday  in  my\r\n\r\nresponse.   I would just like to reiterate that parents  have  a\r\n\r\nlot to do with expectations, which is one of the major causes of\r\n\r\nstress on their kids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked a number of questions about\r\n\r\ncurriculum, restructuring of assessment and so forth.   He asked\r\n\r\nabout  questions.   I  think  I  have  addressed  most  of  them\r\n\r\nyesterday in my response.  I can read it to him again or  I  can\r\n\r\nrefer  him to Hansard.  But, yesterday, I addressed most of  the\r\n\r\npoints   that  he  has  raised.   If  Mr  Low  has  any   useful\r\n\r\nsuggestions, other than the questions, I will be happy  to  hear\r\n\r\nhim, and see how we can implement them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that is all that I would like to respond to.\r\n\r\nI  would now like to invite Dr Wong, Mr Peter Chen and Mr Maidin\r\n\r\nto take up the other points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Wong):</b> Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Choo Wee Khiang talked about the\r\n\r\nstate  of discipline in our schools.  I wish to assure  both  of\r\n\r\nthem  that  the  state  of discipline in our  schools  is  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.   Serious cases which have been reported in  the  press\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time are very infrequent occurrences.  The  great\r\n\r\nmajority  of our students are very hardworking.  They  are  well\r\n\r\nbehaved, and they are responsible students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995, MOE has implemented a behaviour tracking and\r\n\r\nanalysis  system in schools.  This system allows us  to  collect\r\n\r\ndata systematically on all the discipline cases in school.  They\r\n\r\nrange  from  the rather light infringements like not handing  in\r\n\r\nassignments,  coming  late to school, to the  serious  offences.\r\n\r\nFor  primary students, misconduct, such as not doing assignments\r\n\r\nand  disruptive behaviour in class, is the top offence category,\r\n\r\nfollowed  by  attendance,  such  as  late  coming  and  truancy.\r\n\r\nTogether,  they  constitute about 84% of  the  total  number  of\r\n\r\noffences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no significant change in the distribution of\r\n\r\noffence  categories  over the last three years.   Increases  for\r\n\r\nserious offences were marginal, with the increase in gangsterism\r\n\r\nbeing more noticeable, from 11 cases in 1996 to 34 last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For secondary pupils, top offences are also attendance\r\n\r\nrelated and various forms of misconduct, such as improper attire\r\n\r\nand grooming, open defiance, rudeness and not doing assignments.\r\n\r\nAlthough very serious offences remain relatively infrequent, two\r\n\r\ntypes  of  cases  ought  to receive our  attention.   These  are\r\n\r\nsubstance abuse and gangsterism.  They have been on the rise  in\r\n\r\nthe  last three years.  Substance abuse, from 33 cases in  1995,\r\n\r\nshot up to 272 in 1997.  Gangsterism, from 101 cases in 1995  to\r\n\r\n159  in 1997.  This trend has also been receiving attention from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Home Affairs.  MOE and MHA are  working  very\r\n\r\nclosely together to try to contain this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the incidence of offences rises with age, and\r\n\r\noffences are more likely to be found among the less academically\r\n\r\ninclined students than among those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho are more academically inclined.  We should bear in mind that\r\n\r\nsince  we implemented the 10-year general education system,  the\r\n\r\nless  academically inclined students are now going  through  the\r\n\r\nschool  system, who previously might have dropped out of  school\r\n\r\nalready.   However, there is some positive sign and  reason  for\r\n\r\noptimism.   This is because, although the offence rate generally\r\n\r\nrises with age, the rates for secondary one and two pupils  have\r\n\r\ndeclined  over the last three years.  We will monitor  this  and\r\n\r\nsee  if  the same positive trend would be extended to the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary levels in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I would not have much time to talk about\r\n\r\nthe  kinds  of  measures we take in the schools to tackle  these\r\n\r\nproblems.   Generally speaking, they include  civics  and  moral\r\n\r\neducation,   uniformed  groups  and  the  community  involvement\r\n\r\nprogramme  we  have  now introduced.  We  have  also  introduced\r\n\r\nspecific  measures  such as the Volunteer  Special  Constabulary\r\n\r\nscheme  in the schools which is popularly known as the  \"teacher\r\n\r\ncops\".  We also have trained teachers to be counsellors, and  we\r\n\r\nhave  appointed  discipline masters and mistresses  in  all  the\r\n\r\nschools.   We place a great deal of importance on pastoral  care\r\n\r\nand  counselling, as Mr Loh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua also suggested,\r\n\r\nespecially to offer counselling and advice to at-risk pupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has rightly pointed out, there is a\r\n\r\nrising  trend of juvenile delinquency among girls, and this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  noticed also by Prof. Ho Peng Kee when he dealt  with  the\r\n\r\nmatter during the debate on the Ministry of Home Affairs.   Even\r\n\r\nthough the number of female juvenile offenders arrested has been\r\n\r\nfalling over the last three years,  at the present level, it  is\r\n\r\nstill more than double what it was like in 1991, and so this  is\r\n\r\na  worrying  trend. Similarly, we have spotted  an  increase  in\r\n\r\ndiscipline cases among girl students in our schools.   Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  about  80%  of the total number of  discipline  cases\r\n\r\namong  girls in secondary schools are offences comprising  late-coming, truancy, skipping of classes and leaving school without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermission.   The  more  serious  offences  committed  by  girls\r\n\r\ninclude  smoking, open defiance, assault and fighting, substance\r\n\r\nabuse  as  well as gangsterism.  These serious cases constituted\r\n\r\nabout  3% of the total number of offences among girls last year.\r\n\r\nWe  are  well aware that if we do not arrest the problem  early,\r\n\r\nthen  this may develop into juvenile delinquency.  We  are  also\r\n\r\naware  that  disciplinary problems and juvenile delinquency  are\r\n\r\nmulti-faceted, and we must work together with various  community\r\n\r\ngroups, MHA, the Central Narcotics Bureau and other agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April 1996, we have been working with Prof. Ho Peng\r\n\r\nKee's Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile Delinquency to tackle\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  But as I said, this rising trend of disciplinary\r\n\r\nproblem among girls is cause for some concern.  It may very well\r\n\r\nbe that the nature of offences among girls differs somewhat from\r\n\r\nthat  among  boys,  and  we  may not yet  fully  understand  the\r\n\r\npeculiar characteristics of female delinquents or offenders,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the reasons why they commit these offences.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry has decided to form a committee to look  into  this\r\n\r\nproblem  of  discipline  among  female  students.   I  shall  be\r\n\r\nchairing  this  committee.  We will take a closer  look  at  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me respond to the points raised by both Mr David Lim\r\n\r\nand Mr Loh Meng See on early childhood education.  I do not know\r\n\r\nif  I  could  give  an answer to Mr David Lim that  would  fully\r\n\r\nsatisfy him, for it is obvious that he is an ardent believer and\r\n\r\nadvocate   of   early  childhood  education.   Early   childhood\r\n\r\neducation actually spans a variety of programmes, including play\r\n\r\ngroups,  nursery  classes,  kindergartens  and  various  special\r\n\r\nprogrammes  such as dance, music and drama that aim  to  develop\r\n\r\ndifferent  aspects  of  a  child's  growth.   Some  people   are\r\n\r\nadvocating  foetal education as well.  So the question  is:  how\r\n\r\nearly  is early childhood education?  MOE's policy is to provide\r\n\r\nformal  education from primary 1 onwards, when the child reaches\r\n\r\nsix  or six plus years of age.  Pre-school education is left  to\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector  to  play  a  role.   This  allows  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  and  innovation, and provides for different  models\r\n\r\nwith  different  programmes according to  different  schools  of\r\n\r\nthought.  Parents can freely choose from among these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording to their inclinations, beliefs and affordability.  But\r\n\r\nthis  does not mean that MOE does not keep a watchful  eye  over\r\n\r\nthe  set-up  and  programmes of private  centres.   We  do  have\r\n\r\nguidelines on the educational programmes and curriculum.  And to\r\n\r\nraise the quality of kindergarten education further, we are,  at\r\n\r\npresent, reviewing this set of guidelines to make them more user\r\n\r\nfriendly  and to prepare children properly for formal  schooling\r\n\r\nat primary one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, NIE is the main provider of kindergarten\r\n\r\nteacher  training.  Together with NIE, the Ministry has recently\r\n\r\nformed  a pre-school teacher accreditation committee to accredit\r\n\r\nthe  kindergarten teacher training programmes  provided  by  the\r\n\r\nprivate training centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state that I believe in early childhood education.\r\n\r\nI think it is useful. In this day and age, no responsible parent\r\n\r\nwould  take  this lightly, whether this is done at  home  or  at\r\n\r\neducation  centres.   But I must point  out  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nconsensus  yet  on  the extent of benefit  of  structured  early\r\n\r\nchildhood  education, or on how long would the head-start  last.\r\n\r\nThe  well-known TV programme in the United States, some  Members\r\n\r\nmay  well  have  watched it too, Sesame Street was  pinned  with\r\n\r\ngreat hope in the beginning years.  Later, it was found that the\r\n\r\nhead-start  it  gave to the children would not  last  well  into\r\n\r\nelementary  school.   This  is because  home  support  given  to\r\n\r\nchildren's  learning is equally important,  and  if  it  is  not\r\n\r\nthere,  then  the children cannot sustain the initial  gains  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither are there clear-cut conclusions in the literature\r\n\r\non  early  childhood  education.   Yes,  there  have  been  some\r\n\r\nsignificant   breakthroughs  in  the  recent   decade   on   the\r\n\r\nfunctioning  of  the  brain.   We  understand  the  learning  of\r\n\r\nlanguages  better  now.  But what makes for emotions,  attitudes\r\n\r\nand  motivation,  which  are  equally  important  for  learning?\r\n\r\nExperts in brain research often say that the biggest thing  they\r\n\r\nknow about the brain is how little they still know.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When research findings are translated into the running of\r\n\r\nearly childhood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation programmes, the picture is even more mixed.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  there  can  be  very different interpretations  of  how\r\n\r\nresearch results should be put into practice.  Hence, you see  a\r\n\r\ngreat   variety  of  early  childhood  centres  with   different\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that are in the market, especially in the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  and this situation makes it extremely  difficult  to\r\n\r\ncompare the results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim suggested that a research and teaching centre for\r\n\r\nearly  childhood education could be set up and that  the  centre\r\n\r\ncould  work  with a number of prototype schools in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   We  can  encourage NIE to look into  this  suggestion,\r\n\r\ntogether   with   other   early   childhood   teacher   training\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  They could partner some private pre-schools to do\r\n\r\nthe  research,  to see what practices would be  better  for  our\r\n\r\nlocal population.  But I must say that the research will have to\r\n\r\nbe a longitudinal one.  It will take many years to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

However,  it  did  not  solve  the  more  fundamental\r\n\r\nproblems   of   the   personnel  system  -  over-centralisation,\r\n\r\nrigidity, slowness in adapting to market conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in 1994, the Government made more fundamental\r\n\r\nchanges  to the Civil Service personnel management system.   The\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  promotion and recruitment, which came  under  the\r\n\r\npurview  of  the  Public Service Commission,  Education  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  and the Police and Civil Defence Services Commission\r\n\r\nwere  devolved  to Personnel Boards, except for  recruitment  of\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers, formal appeals against decisions of the\r\n\r\nPersonnel  Boards,  and  promotion at the  very  senior  levels,\r\n\r\nnamely,  at Superscale `D' and above.  These included  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries,   Senior  Deputy  Secretaries,   and   high-ranking\r\n\r\nofficers in the Education and Ministry of Home Affairs uniformed\r\n\r\nservices.   The devolution of powers meant that the  Commissions\r\n\r\ncould  focus  on the top talent under their respective  purview,\r\n\r\nwhile the Personnel Boards took care of the personnel management\r\n\r\nof the rest of the Civil Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devolution was fully effected on 1st January 1995. It has\r\n\r\nmade  Ministries more flexible and responsive, and hence  better\r\n\r\nemployers.   It has also significantly reduced the workloads  of\r\n\r\nthe  Education  Service  Commission and  the  Police  and  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence  Services Commission.  The Education Service  Commission\r\n\r\nand  the  Police and Civil Defence Services Commission now  meet\r\n\r\nonly  once or twice a year, primarily to consider officers under\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  purview for promotion  to  Superscale  D  and\r\n\r\nabove.   The number of such officers is small.  In view of  this\r\n\r\nnew  situation, it has again become both feasible and  desirable\r\n\r\nfor  a  single Commission, namely the Public Service Commission,\r\n\r\nto  appoint,  assess  and promote the top  officers  across  the\r\n\r\npublic sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of the Education Service Commission and the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Civil  Defence Services Commission  have  performed\r\n\r\ntheir duties conscientiously and admirably.  They supervised the\r\n\r\nadvancement  of personnel in the Education Service and  the  MHA\r\n\r\nUniformed  Services at a time when the personnel  system  placed\r\n\r\nheavy  demands on the Commissions.  They have been  diligent  in\r\n\r\npromoting  deserving  officers and  pro-active  in  recruitment.\r\n\r\nTheir efforts have been appreciated by the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nteachers and the Ministry of Home Affairs uniformed staff.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  places  on  record its gratitude  to  the  Education\r\n\r\nService  Commission  and the Police and Civil  Defence  Services\r\n\r\nCommission for their significant contributions to the  personnel\r\n\r\nmanagement of the Civil Service since 1990.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides for the amalgamation of the three\r\n\r\nCommissions  through  the dissolution of the  Education  Service\r\n\r\nCommission and the Police and Civil Defence Services Commission,\r\n\r\nand the transfer of their functions to the PSC.   The amendments\r\n\r\nto  effect this are contained in clauses 1 to 6 of this Bill  as\r\n\r\nwell as clauses 8 and 9.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following subsidiary legislation, namely, the Education\r\n\r\nService   Commission  (Delegation  of  Disciplinary   Functions)\r\n\r\nDirections  1997,  and  the Police and  Civil  Defence  Services\r\n\r\nCommission  (Delegation  of Disciplinary  Functions)  Directions\r\n\r\n1997,  will  lapse once the two Commissions are  dissolved.   In\r\n\r\naddition,   there  will  be  consequential  change   to   remove\r\n\r\nreferences  to  the two Commissions in the following  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings)\r\n\r\nRegulations;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Public Service (Personnel Boards and Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard) Regulations; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Public Service (Special and Senior Personnel\r\n\r\nBoards) Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Savings and Employee Retirement Plan (SAVER)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the second category of amendments at\r\n\r\nclause 7 which amends Article 114 of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is to enable the Ministry of Defence and the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed  Forces to implement its Savings  and  Employee\r\n\r\nRetirement Plan, known as the SAVER Plan.  The SAVER  Plan  will\r\n\r\nbe  established  under  the Singapore Armed  Forces  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill,  1998.   The  SAVER  Plan will  replace  the  Pension  and\r\n\r\nContract  schemes  that  are currently  open  to  SAF  uniformed\r\n\r\nofficers.  The retirement benefits of SAF officers who join  the\r\n\r\nSAVER Plan will no longer be charged on the Pension Fund or  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund, but on a new fund known as the SAVER Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of setting up the SAVER Fund to pay for the\r\n\r\nretirement   benefits  of  SAF  officers,  there   will   be   a\r\n\r\nconsequential  amendment to the Pension  Fund  Act,  Cap.  224A.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment  is  contained in  the  Singapore  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill, 1998.  The Second Minister for Defence,  RAdm\r\n\r\nTeo Chee Hean, will be explaining further on the SAVER Plan when\r\n\r\nhe  moves  the  Second  Reading of the  Singapore  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill, 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appointment of the Chief Valuer</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn to the third category of amendments\r\n\r\nat  clause  2 which amends Article 22(1) of the Constitution  to\r\n\r\ninclude   the   Chief   Valuer  in  the  list   of   safeguarded\r\n\r\nappointments,  namely  those  for  which  the  office-holder  is\r\n\r\nappointed with the concurrence of the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State lands form a substantial part of Singapore's past\r\n\r\nreserves  which are to be protected under the Constitution.   An\r\n\r\nimportant  aspect  of  protecting  land  as  past  reserves   is\r\n\r\ndetermining its fair market value.  Where land is sold  by  open\r\n\r\ntender,  this  is  less of an issue.  But where  state  land  is\r\n\r\nalienated  directly, for example, to statutory boards  like  JTC\r\n\r\nand  HDB, rather than by open tender, it is the Chief Valuer who\r\n\r\ndecides what is the fair market value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  these  State lands.  If the Chief Valuer does not render  an\r\n\r\nhonest, unbiased opinion, reserves may be surreptitiously  drawn\r\n\r\ndown by this route.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President had expressed his concern last year to the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  over  this issue.  The Government  studied  the\r\n\r\nmatter  and agreed with the President's observation.  It decided\r\n\r\nto  amend  the  Constitution to make the Chief Valuer's  post  a\r\n\r\nsafeguarded appointment.  This amendment is provided  for  under\r\n\r\nclause 2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consequential amendment to the State Lands Act, to make\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Valuer a statutory office, is contained in a separate\r\n\r\nBill which will be taken up later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  is  gratifying to note that the Chief Valuer will be another\r\n\r\nposition that will be safeguarded in the Constitution.  My  only\r\n\r\nconcern  is that the proposed State Lands (Amendment) Bill  does\r\n\r\nnot  have details about his removal from the office in  case  we\r\n\r\nfind  that the person who is appointed is not suitable  for  the\r\n\r\njob.   Because all we have is his remuneration and  other  terms\r\n\r\nwould  not  be altered to his disadvantage.

If there is any reason  to  post  the\r\n\r\nChief  Valuer to some other appointment, we can do so,  but  the\r\n\r\nPresident will have to concur.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Division will be taken to ascertain that the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Bill is supported by the votes of not less  than\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds of the total number of elected Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nwhich   is  56  Members,  pursuant  to  Article  5(2)   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.

It  is  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  upon  which  Singapore  continues  to  prosper   and\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capable SAF we have today is the result of years of\r\n\r\ninvestment in people, doctrines and equipment.  We must continue\r\n\r\nto  invest  in the development of the SAF if we are to  continue\r\n\r\npeace, prosperity and economic progress in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we must continue to attract good people to\r\n\r\njoin  the  SAF.   It  is with this objective in  mind  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Defence commissioned a study by Towers  Perrin,  an\r\n\r\ninternational  consultancy firm, to review the  entire  manpower\r\n\r\nmanagement system of the SAF uniformed officers.  Together  with\r\n\r\nMINDEF,  Towers  Perrin  has looked into the  career  structure,\r\n\r\nremuneration   package,   career  management   and   performance\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  the officers.  Arising from the  review,  MINDEF\r\n\r\nwill  implement a total revamp of the SAF career,  offering  our\r\n\r\nofficers  a first career that is both challenging and rewarding.\r\n\r\nAmongst others, MINDEF will be establishing the new Savings  and\r\n\r\nEmployee  Retirement  Plan (SAVER Plan).  The  SAVER  Plan  will\r\n\r\nreplace the Pension and Contract schemes that are currently open\r\n\r\nto  SAF uniformed officers.  Let me explain the rationale of the\r\n\r\nSAVER Plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the need to maintain a dynamic armed forces, the\r\n\r\nSAF  adopts a policy to keep the SAF young.  A full career  with\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  spans  about 22 years.  This is long  enough  for  the\r\n\r\nofficers  to make a meaningful contribution to the  SAF  and  to\r\n\r\nrealise their full potential.  At the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime, it ensures a healthy turnover of leadership at every level\r\n\r\nof  the SAF and ensures that the SAF has a sufficient number  of\r\n\r\nofficers  with the right training and experience to support  the\r\n\r\nfull  range  of  operational  requirements.   We  do  recognise,\r\n\r\nhowever, that it can be very daunting for an officer to start  a\r\n\r\nnew  career in his mid-40s, particularly when there are  housing\r\n\r\ncommitments and the education of children to contend with.  This\r\n\r\ndeters  potential  recruits from joining  the  SAF.   Those  who\r\n\r\ninitially joined the SAF for the challenge and exciting  careers\r\n\r\nit  has to offer are also tempted to leave earlier in their late\r\n\r\n20s  and early 30s when they are better able to adjust to a  new\r\n\r\ncareer outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can never remove all the concerns associated with the\r\n\r\ntransition to a second career.  But we can make it less daunting\r\n\r\nfor  the SAF officers by minimising these concerns.  The current\r\n\r\nSAF  Pension  Scheme, which was adapted from the  civil  service\r\n\r\nPension Scheme was designed to reward people who stay in service\r\n\r\nuntil  they  reach  the age of 55 years or  above.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  the SAF because of the shorter SAF  career.   The\r\n\r\nSAVER  Plan  will give uniformed officers financial security  so\r\n\r\nthat they can concentrate on the professional development of the\r\n\r\nSAF without having to worry about their second careers.  Through\r\n\r\nthis  Plan, we hope to attract good quality people to  join  the\r\n\r\nSAF and to remain in the SAF for a full career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the SAVER Plan, MINDEF will contribute an amount,\r\n\r\nbased  on a percentage of the officer's monthly salary, into  an\r\n\r\naccount kept for the officer.  The funds in the account will  be\r\n\r\npooled  with other accounts to form an investment fund known  as\r\n\r\nthe  SAVER  Fund.    The  SAVER Fund will  be  managed  by  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers  appointed  for the purpose.   Based  on  returns  from\r\n\r\ninvestments,  dividends  will be credited  into  the  individual\r\n\r\naccounts of each officer.  A SAVER Board of Trustees, chaired by\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretary, and comprising senior MINDEF  and  SAF\r\n\r\npersonnel  and  successful people with relevant experience  from\r\n\r\nthe public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  private  sectors, will oversee the fund managers  with  the\r\n\r\nhelp of investment advisors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAVER Plan will meet the varying needs of SAF officers\r\n\r\nat  different stages of their careers.  The accumulated  amounts\r\n\r\nin  the  SAVER  accounts will be made available to the  officers\r\n\r\nprogressively.  The longer an officer stays in service, the more\r\n\r\nhe  stands to benefit from his SAVER account.  By the end of the\r\n\r\nofficer's  career,  his SAVER account will provide  him  with  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  lump  sum  to enable him to  transit  to  a  second\r\n\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAVER Plan will be implemented with effect from 1st\r\n\r\nApril  1998 for all new uniformed officers.  Existing  uniformed\r\n\r\nofficers will be offered an option to convert to the SAVER  Plan\r\n\r\nand have their accumulated benefits under their existing schemes\r\n\r\ntransferred to the new Plan.  The benefits they have chalked  up\r\n\r\nwill be transferred from Pension Fund to the SAVER Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will provide the legislative framework to\r\n\r\nimplement the SAVER Plan.  The Bill will also make consequential\r\n\r\namendments to the Pension Fund Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I rise in support of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is the bedrock and indeed the vanguard of our\r\n\r\nnational defence policy and strategy.  Without a strong SAF, all\r\n\r\nour defence planning will come to nothing.  The core or critical\r\n\r\nelement  in  the  SAF  is manpower, in particular,  the  officer\r\n\r\ncorps.   We must, therefore, ensure that at all times,  the  SAF\r\n\r\npersonnel  are  well motivated, ready and able  to  deliver  the\r\n\r\nknock-out punch when the chips are down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF must, therefore, have good terms and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice  to attract and retain the best to shoulder the  awesome\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of being in the forefront of  our  defence,  and\r\n\r\nbeing  entrusted with the training and command of  our  national\r\n\r\nservicemen.  Over time,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  perceptions and expectations change.    And  the\r\n\r\nSAF  must,  from time to time, review and adjust the  employment\r\n\r\nschemes  to  bring  them  in  line with  the  prevailing  market\r\n\r\npractices.   It is, therefore, timely as we move into  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury  that MINDEF is revamping the SAF employment system  and\r\n\r\nintroducing the Savings and Employee Retirement (SAVER) plan.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  it will be a real saver and will be very much welcomed\r\n\r\nby  the officer corps.  The new scheme, I am sure, will keep the\r\n\r\nSAF  young  and will, at the same time, meet the aspirations  of\r\n\r\nthe  younger  officers for a more defined and focused  route  of\r\n\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to seek\r\n\r\nsome  clarifications and amplification from the Minister.   Will\r\n\r\nthe  officers  continue  to enjoy medical  benefits  upon  their\r\n\r\nretirement  under  the SAVER scheme?  Will the savings  accounts\r\n\r\nand  retirement accounts of the SAVER scheme be subject  to  tax\r\n\r\nupon  withdrawal  of  the sums?  Will MINDEF  allow  progressive\r\n\r\nwithdrawals  from the various savings accounts  for  payment  of\r\n\r\nhousing instalments, as in the CPF accounts?  Will MINDEF extend\r\n\r\nthe SAVER scheme to the regular NCOs in future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pension scheme is funded directly by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.    The SAVER Fund is a separate fund established  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  with its own set of accounts.  The  SAVER  Fund\r\n\r\nwill be managed, as announced, by a Board of Trustees, appointed\r\n\r\nby   the  Armed  Forces  Council.   My  question  is:  will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment ensure that these funds are well managed in terms  of\r\n\r\ninvestments and returns, and the officers will enjoy good  rates\r\n\r\nof  returns from the SAVER Fund, no less but, hopefully,  better\r\n\r\nthan the CPF rates?  Sir, if, unfortunately, the officer dies in\r\n\r\nservice,  will his family be given the benefits under the  SAVER\r\n\r\nscheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I too support the\r\n\r\nBill.   I have a very simple question for the Minister.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to find out whether there is a minimum service the officer\r\n\r\nmust  fulfill before he can enjoy the benefits under  the  SAVER\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I thank the GPC Chairman, Dr Ong,\r\n\r\nfor the support that he has given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has asked several questions. He asked whether the\r\n\r\nofficers  will  continue to enjoy medical  benefits  upon  their\r\n\r\nretirement.  The existing medical benefits will not be  changed.\r\n\r\nExisting  officers  will  continue to  enjoy  the  same  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits  while they are in service and when they  retire.   New\r\n\r\nofficers will also enjoy the same medical benefits that are open\r\n\r\nto them now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the savings and retirement\r\n\r\naccounts will be subject to tax.  The sum in the savings account\r\n\r\nis a form of gratuity.  Like the present contract gratuity given\r\n\r\nto  officers when they complete their contract with the SAF,  it\r\n\r\ncan  be withdrawn in full after 10 years of service.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nlike contract gratuities, it will be taxable when withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirement account is similar to the present commuted\r\n\r\nlump  sum pension that is given out to retiring officers  today.\r\n\r\nIt  will, therefore, be treated like the pension today and  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  taxed if officers withdraw this when they  retire,  ie,\r\n\r\nwhen  they leave the SAF after age 40 with at least 10 years  of\r\n\r\ncontinuous  service.   If withdrawn prematurely,  the  money  is\r\n\r\ntreated like a contract gratuity and will be taxed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked about withdrawals from the SAVER accounts\r\n\r\nfor  payment of housing instalments.  Under the scheme, officers\r\n\r\nmay  withdraw  their money in the savings account  progressively\r\n\r\nafter  the  sixth year.  They can use the money as  down-payment\r\n\r\nfor  properties they wish to purchase.  When the SAVER  Plan  is\r\n\r\nfully operational, MINDEF will further consider whether to allow\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  from  the retirement account to  help  officers  buy\r\n\r\ntheir  homes.   MINDEF thinks that it is a good idea  to  unlock\r\n\r\nsome  of  the money in the SAVER accounts to help our servicemen\r\n\r\nbuy  their  homes.  It will provide security for  officers  when\r\n\r\nthey retire and will encourage more people to join and remain in\r\n\r\nthe SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked whether the SAVER scheme will be extended\r\n\r\nto regular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWarrant  Officers and specialists in future.  We  will  consider\r\n\r\nthis  when  we have gained sufficient experience after operating\r\n\r\nthe scheme for officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked how the Government will ensure that the funds\r\n\r\nare  well  managed in terms of investments and that the officers\r\n\r\nwill enjoy good rates of return for the SAVER Fund.  The purpose\r\n\r\nof  investing  the funds independently is to try   to  obtain  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  rate of return for the funds and thereby making  the\r\n\r\nscheme  even  more  attractive to  officers.   While  we  cannot\r\n\r\nguarantee  a  minimum rate of return, we will invest  prudently.\r\n\r\nTo  this  end,  we  will  work with the professional  investment\r\n\r\nadvisor  who  will  help  MINDEF  to  work  out  the  investment\r\n\r\nstrategy,  advise  on the selection of fund  managers  and  help\r\n\r\nmonitor  the performance of fund managers.  We have also invited\r\n\r\nseveral  top-level executives from the banking  sector  and  the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore to sit on the  SAVER  Board  of\r\n\r\nTrustees.    This  is  to  inject  professional  expertise   and\r\n\r\nexperience in guiding investment and management of the money  in\r\n\r\nthe SAVER Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked about the minimum period of engagement. The\r\n\r\nstructure of the SAVER system is such that the longer you  stay,\r\n\r\nthe more is accumulated in the various accounts and the more you\r\n\r\ncan  withdraw.  And the shorter you stay, the less you get.   So\r\n\r\nif  you  stay  for  a  very  short time,  you  get  very  little\r\n\r\nadditional benefit from that.  You basically get benefits  which\r\n\r\nare equivalent to something like the full CPF  system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Dr Ong asked whether the family of the\r\n\r\nofficer will be given the benefits under the SAVER scheme if the\r\n\r\nofficer  dies in service.  The answer is yes, the entire  amount\r\n\r\nin his SAVER account will go to his estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [RAdm Teo Chee Hean].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TELECOMMUNICATION AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member in charge of the Bill has informed\r\n\r\nme that he would like to defer the Second Reading of the Bill to\r\n\r\na sitting after 31st March, 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, the Budget\r\n\r\nand the Committee of Supply debates have finally come to an end.\r\n\r\nIn  all  my  years in Parliament since 1984, this  must  be  the\r\n\r\nlongest  Committee of Supply debate that we  have  had  so  far.\r\n\r\nSixty-one  Members  have moved 465 cuts  in  this  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply.
