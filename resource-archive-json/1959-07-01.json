The  immediate\r\n\r\nfuture is clear and certain. During the next  five\r\n\r\nyears  a Government elected by a decisive majority\r\n\r\nof   the   people  will,  through   peaceful   and\r\n\r\nconstitutional means, take the social revolution a\r\n\r\nstep  further. It is a Government pledged to bring\r\n\r\nabout a more just society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economics and Finance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate task facing the Government is to\r\n\r\nplace  the finances of the country on a sound  and\r\n\r\nhealthy  basis.  The  threatened  deficit  of  $14\r\n\r\nmillion for 1959 can be and will be wiped out  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  not shrunk  from  unpleasant\r\n\r\nmeasures to achieve financial stability. But  such\r\n\r\nsacrifices as have been imposed by way of pay cuts\r\n\r\nhave  fallen on those most able to bear them.  All\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  special  expenditure  is   being\r\n\r\nscrutinised  and  non-essential  items   will   be\r\n\r\nscrapped. When every available economy measure has\r\n\r\nbeen  examined, and if it is necessary further  to\r\n\r\nclose the gap between revenue and expenditure, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will then see how revenue increases may\r\n\r\nbest  be  brought about. But it is important  that\r\n\r\nall  possible measures of economy be first applied\r\n\r\nbefore  the  public is called  upon  to  bear  the\r\n\r\nburden of any tax increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general economic situation, the\r\n\r\nprime  task is to build up a climate of confidence\r\n\r\nunder  which trade expansion and industrial growth\r\n\r\ncan  take  place. Already there are  many  notable\r\n\r\nsigns  of such a build up. The Government  has  in\r\n\r\nthe  few  brief weeks of office received  numerous\r\n\r\nenquiries from foreign and local firms who want to\r\n\r\nset up new factories in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large the immediate prospects for economic\r\n\r\nexpansion are good. The political stability  which\r\n\r\nis  a  pre-requisite for expansion and  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen lacking for so long, has been achieved by the\r\n\r\nelection  with  an  overwhelming  majority  of   a\r\n\r\nGovernment  whose declared policies are  clear-cut\r\n\r\nand  unambiguous.  Further,  the  Party  in  power\r\n\r\nenjoys  the  reputation of  honouring  its  public\r\n\r\npronouncements  and  the  future  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is therefore predictable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been their declared policy, clearly\r\n\r\nenunciated during the election campaign,  to  give\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise, both of  local  and  overseas\r\n\r\norigin, all the encouragement and assistance  they\r\n\r\nneed  so that they can set up new factories  which\r\n\r\nwill  create more jobs for our growing population.\r\n\r\nThe  Government will not impose restrictions  upon\r\n\r\nforeign  investors on the transfer of profits  and\r\n\r\ncapital apart from normal exchange controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important, the Government will place at the\r\n\r\ndisposal of private industry, capital in the  form\r\n\r\nof short term or long term loans for the expansion\r\n\r\nor  establishment of enterprises. This will be one\r\n\r\nof   the  principal  objectives  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, which the Government  will  set\r\n\r\nup as a statutory body. But industrial development\r\n\r\nmust take account of the economic policies of  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are substantial advantages to be gained\r\n\r\nboth  by  the Federation and Singapore  by  having\r\n\r\ntheir economic policies integrated. The Government\r\n\r\nwill approach the Federation Government for closer\r\n\r\nco-ordination in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial  development  programmes  of  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely in any major industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme that Singapore would be able\r\n\r\nto  retain  its  100% free port  status.  Wherever\r\n\r\ntariffs are to be erected, this must be done  only\r\n\r\nwhen  the  advantage of increased  employment  and\r\n\r\nadditional  national income clearly  outweigh  any\r\n\r\npossible loss in international trade. It will also\r\n\r\nhave  to  take  into  account the  market  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation and the need for industrial development\r\n\r\nto keep pace with the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's guiding principle is industrial\r\n\r\npeace with justice. Justice implies ensuring their\r\n\r\nfair  and  just demands for a reasonable share  of\r\n\r\nthe  fruits of their labour. At the same  time  we\r\n\r\nmust  remember that a chronic state of  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  means the wrecking of our economy, and  if\r\n\r\nour economy is damaged then workers, employers and\r\n\r\nthe country as a whole will suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way of ensuring industrial peace is to\r\n\r\nencourage  workers  and  employers  to   use   the\r\n\r\nmachinery  of  collective  bargaining  instead  of\r\n\r\ntaking direct industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implies strengthening workers' organisations\r\n\r\nso  as to enhance their bargaining position vis-a-vis  the employers. This means the emergence of  a\r\n\r\nunified labour movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing its declared policy of a unified\r\n\r\nTrade  Union  movement,  the  Labour  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconsulting  all  the main streams  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement  to get the widest possible agreement  on\r\n\r\nthe  structure of the new organisation to  be  set\r\n\r\nup.  The  Government will also cancel registration\r\n\r\nof   splinter   and   yellow  unions   after   due\r\n\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also proceeding with its\r\n\r\ndeclared  plans  to  establish  a  permanent   and\r\n\r\nindependent  Court of Labour, whose  findings  and\r\n\r\nawards  would be binding and enforceable  on  both\r\n\r\nemployers and employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unified Trade Union movement under the\r\n\r\nleadership   of   a  Trade  Union  Congress   with\r\n\r\nexecutive  powers,  and a  Court  of  Labour  with\r\n\r\npowers to enforce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  awards,  constitute  the  key  to  industrial\r\n\r\npeace.  But in the first instance the channel  for\r\n\r\nthe  solution  of  industrial disputes  is  direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations  between  employer  and  Union,  then\r\n\r\nconciliation  through the Ministry of  Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw, and only finally the Court of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuance of its declared policy the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is proceeding with plans  to  build  a\r\n\r\nlarge  centrally situated Trade Union House.  This\r\n\r\nwill take some time to complete. In the meantime a\r\n\r\nlarge building in the City area is being renovated\r\n\r\nfor temporary use until the new one is erected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans for the relief of unemployment on a short\r\n\r\nterm   basis   are  being  formulated,   and   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of these plans will be pressed with\r\n\r\nthe utmost vigour. The Government will concentrate\r\n\r\nimmediately  on  projects  employing  the  maximum\r\n\r\nnumber   of  unskilled  or  semi-skilled  workers.\r\n\r\nDetails   are   being  worked  out   between   the\r\n\r\nMinistries   of  Labour  and  Law   and   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that certain statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions for the protection of workers have been\r\n\r\nevaded.  Strong  action will be taken  to  enforce\r\n\r\nthese provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will enact legislation which,\r\n\r\nwhilst  recognising existing polygamous marriages,\r\n\r\nwill  make  it an offence for persons to  contract\r\n\r\nother  than  monogamous marriages in future.  Such\r\n\r\nlegislation will not extend to Muslim marriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community and Recreation services provided by\r\n\r\nthe Government are being reorganised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Medical and Health</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of health the Government will\r\n\r\nimplement  a  long-term plan in which the  present\r\n\r\nemphasis on curative medicine will be modified and\r\n\r\nthe  emphasis  put  on the preventive  aspects  of\r\n\r\ndisease.  To secure this, the help of  the  people\r\n\r\nwill  be  enlisted through carefully-planned  mass\r\n\r\nhealth  education campaigns which will stress  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  proper nutrition, informed  social\r\n\r\nhygiene, intelligent birth control and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenlightened maternity and infant welfare  schemes.\r\n\r\nThe   campaigns   will   indicate   the   positive\r\n\r\ncontribution the people themselves can make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately, the Government proposes to introduce\r\n\r\na  series  of  short-term measures  of  reform  to\r\n\r\neliminate  obvious inadequacies  existing  in  the\r\n\r\nhealth    services.   Service    in    out-patient\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  clinics will  be  improved.  The\r\n\r\ncongestion  in Government hospitals'  out-patients\r\n\r\ndepartments will be relieved by extension and a re-organisation  of  the services by integrating  the\r\n\r\nexisting   clinic   services   provided   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   Medical  Department  and   the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give the highest priority to\r\n\r\ntreating  tuberculosis, the major  health  problem\r\n\r\nfacing the community. After consultation with  the\r\n\r\nexperts,   a   scheme   for   compulsory    B.C.G.\r\n\r\nvaccination programme for school children will  be\r\n\r\nlaunched early next year. In conjunction with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour and Law, it is proposed to draw\r\n\r\nup a list of workers in occupations where there is\r\n\r\na  risk of contracting the disease, and to provide\r\n\r\nfor  these workers periodic X-ray examination  and\r\n\r\nother necessary preventive measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be improved facilities for staff\r\n\r\ntraining and a special emphasis will be laid  upon\r\n\r\nkindness,  courtesy and consideration to  patients\r\n\r\nand  the  public. These qualities and professional\r\n\r\nefficiency  will be taken into consideration  when\r\n\r\nmaking  promotions. In future non-English educated\r\n\r\nnurses  and  midwives will also be  allowed  entry\r\n\r\ninto the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>National Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first task of the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment   is   to  re-organise   the   various\r\n\r\nsubordinate organs under the Ministry to eliminate\r\n\r\nduplication  of functions and wasteful expenditure\r\n\r\nand  to step up operational efficiency. Plans  for\r\n\r\nthe absorption of the City Council departments  in\r\n\r\nthe Government are being proceeded with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the gravest and most pressing problems\r\n\r\nfacing  the  Government  of  Singapore  today   is\r\n\r\nhousing. Since 1947,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  it  first acted as the Government's  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority,  the  Singapore Improvement  Trust  has\r\n\r\nconstructed a total of only 23,000 housing  units.\r\n\r\nThe  average  rate of construction is about  2,000\r\n\r\nunits  per year, and most of these are let out  at\r\n\r\nrates  quite  beyond the means of  people  in  the\r\n\r\nlower  income brackets. The Government is  pledged\r\n\r\nto  make  an  all-out effort to ease  the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem.  The Government will increase the  annual\r\n\r\noutput   of   houses   built  by   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will ensure that the welfare and\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the rural dwellers  are  adequately\r\n\r\nlooked  after.  To  this end  a  survey  is  being\r\n\r\nprepared  to  provide standpipes  for,  and  bring\r\n\r\nelectricity to, the rural areas. Rural people will\r\n\r\nalso  be  encouraged to build  kampong  roads  and\r\n\r\nassist  in carrying out kampong drainage  schemes.\r\n\r\nThe  building materials in all instances  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will make every effort to bring\r\n\r\nabout  increased production in agriculture, animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry and fishing. A number of schemes,  based\r\n\r\non  detailed  on-the-spot surveys  and  scientific\r\n\r\nstudies, have been prepared and are now undergoing\r\n\r\nscrutiny, prior to implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Education</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy on Education is based on\r\n\r\nthree main principles. Firstly, acceptance of  the 1955   All-Party \r\n\r\nCommittee  Report   on   Chinese\r\n\r\nEducation  of the Singapore Legislative  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis  provides for equal treatment  for  the  four\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education in English, Chinese,  Malay\r\n\r\nand  Tamil. Secondly, acceptance of Malay  as  the\r\n\r\nnational  language. The Government will  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  learning of Malay by non-Malays, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime revitalising Malay education itself. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nthe  present  curriculum will be revised  so  that\r\n\r\nemphasis  will  be on practical subjects  such  as\r\n\r\nmathematics and science, to meet the needs  of  an\r\n\r\nindustrialized  society  and  on  the   study   of\r\n\r\nlanguages of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey revealed that maximum use has not\r\n\r\nbeen   made   of  present  school  buildings   and\r\n\r\navailable staff, both administrative and teaching.\r\n\r\nIn  the  113  Government English  Primary  schools\r\n\r\nthere  are more than 450 classrooms available  but\r\n\r\nnot  used. Furthermore, 26 Primary schools (14  in\r\n\r\nRural  areas  and 12 in the City) are running  one\r\n\r\nsession  only  instead of the usual two.  By  1960\r\n\r\nwhen  a  two-session period is introduced, another\r\n\r\n400 classrooms will be available for pupils. There\r\n\r\nis   no   question   at  all  that   with   proper\r\n\r\norganisation  of  all  available  facilities,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can do more to meet the  great  demand\r\n\r\nfor  education  and  we  shall  do  so  from  1960\r\n\r\nonwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic promotion in primary classes will\r\n\r\ncease. With proper annual examinations as a  check\r\n\r\nboth  of the teachers' proficiency and the pupils'\r\n\r\neffort  the fear of failing in the common entrance\r\n\r\nexamination   for   secondary  schools   will   be\r\n\r\ndiminished.  In  order to provide for  more  study\r\n\r\ntime  in  schools  for  the  study  of  languages,\r\n\r\nmathematics   and  science,  all  elementary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools will be required to start a six-day  week  from the third term of this year,  i.e.\r\n\r\n31st  August  for Malay schools and 7th  September\r\n\r\nfor English, Chinese and Tamil schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work is going apace in the revision of text-books\r\n\r\nbased on common content and Malayan loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1960 all secondary schools, both\r\n\r\nGovernment and aided, will be required  to  be  on\r\n\r\ntwo-session  if the number of pupils  warrant  it.\r\n\r\nWith  secondary  schools on a  two-session  basis,\r\n\r\nconsideration  will be given to  convert  some  of\r\n\r\nthese   schools  into  vocational  and   technical\r\n\r\nschools    at    secondary   level.   Transitional\r\n\r\narrangements  for  equipment  and  staff  will  be\r\n\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Adult Education</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to launch a mass\r\n\r\nliteracy and education campaign. The large  number\r\n\r\nof  overage  pupils  who  cannot  find  places  in\r\n\r\nschools  and the even larger number of adults  who\r\n\r\ndid  not receive any education at all, makes  this\r\n\r\nan   urgent   and  vital  work  of  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  intention of the Government to reorganise and\r\n\r\nexpand  the  work  now carried  out  by  voluntary\r\n\r\nbodies like the Singapore Adult Education Council.\r\n\r\nIt  is intended to put this into effect from  next\r\n\r\nyear,  so  that  all pupils will be provided  with\r\n\r\nproper  syllabuses  and  receive  training   under\r\n\r\nqualified instructors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Nanyang University</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Prescott Commission on the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  will be published  soon.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment will then discuss the future of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and its graduates with the responsible\r\n\r\nChinese  Educational bodies. The  Government  will\r\n\r\nencourage  the  closest co-operation  between  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University and the University of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nas it is in the interest of Singapore that the two\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  higher learning  work  in  close\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cultural</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political and economic revolution which we\r\n\r\nhave initiated must be sustained and reinforced by\r\n\r\na cultural revolution as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up a new ministry - the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture. Upon it will fall  the  dual\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  informing  and  educating  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little was done under colonial rule to establish\r\n\r\na  sense  of  national identity among the  various\r\n\r\nraces in Malaya.

It  will help foster the  growth  of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture  which while  drawing  sustenance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  communal  cultures now  flourishing  in\r\n\r\nMalaya   will   nevertheless   develop   its   own\r\n\r\ndistinctive characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this end in view the programmes in Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be more positive and  creative.  A\r\n\r\ngreat deal more will be done than has been done in\r\n\r\nthe  past  to break down the barriers between  the\r\n\r\nfour language programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only will there be more pooling of programmes\r\n\r\nbetween  the different language sections of  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  each  section  will  also  become\r\n\r\nambassadors  of  a national rather  than  communal\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the fullest use will be made of civic\r\n\r\nand  cultural associations to further the work  of\r\n\r\ncreating a Malayan outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every aspect of its work the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  will  seek the fullest  co-operation  and\r\n\r\nparticipation  of  the  people.   In   the   final\r\n\r\nanalysis,  it  is  the people and  not  Ministries\r\n\r\nwhich develop culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library and Museum will be called\r\n\r\nupon   to   make   their  contributions   to   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a Malayan consciousness.  In  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  library development, a great deal  more\r\n\r\nwill  be done to meet the needs of the non-English\r\n\r\nreading public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Home Affairs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of Singapore lies ultimately in re-uniting with the Federation of Malaya as a state\r\n\r\nin  an independent country. It is the Government's\r\n\r\nintention during its term of office to create  and\r\n\r\nbring about conditions favourable to an early  re-unification  with the Federation.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill take firm action to prevent any irresponsible\r\n\r\nactivities  by  individuals  or  organisations  to\r\n\r\nnegate  this paramount interest of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaya. The Government will  always\r\n\r\nconsider  the views of the Federation  Government.\r\n\r\nIn   the  same  way,  the  Government  hopes   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government will understand  the  hopes\r\n\r\nand  aspirations of the people of  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthe  ways in which this Government seeks to fulfil\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic political situation in Malaya has not\r\n\r\nchanged  today.  The shooting  war  waged  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government and the  Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  enters  the eleventh year. This  Government\r\n\r\nhas  stated  its  position clearly on  subversion.\r\n\r\n\"Subversion\" is any political activity designed to\r\n\r\nfurther  the  aims and interests not  of  our  own\r\n\r\npeople but of foreign powers.

It  will  no longer be an  instrument  to\r\n\r\nfurther the aims of a Colonial regime. In a  self-governing country the role of the police  will  be\r\n\r\nto protect the life and property of the people, to\r\n\r\nmaintain  peace  and  order  and  to  protect  the\r\n\r\npeople's  elected Government from being undermined\r\n\r\nand  subverted from within and without.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nprimary  duty  of  this  Government  to  establish\r\n\r\nmutual  confidence and respect between the  people\r\n\r\nand the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the introduction of the Criminal Law\r\n\r\n(Temporary   Provisions)  (Amendment)   Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1958,  and  the subsequent detention of more  than\r\n\r\n200  gangsters last October, it would appear  that\r\n\r\nSecret  Society activities have yet to be crushed.\r\n\r\nIn   addition   to  preventive  detention,   other\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  be  necessary  to  combat   crimes\r\n\r\ncommitted by the secret societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the entry of immigrants, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  constantly  bear  in  mind   the\r\n\r\npolitical  and economic interests of the  country.\r\n\r\nIt    welcomes    technicians,   scientists    and\r\n\r\nindustrialists  to Singapore, but will  discourage\r\n\r\nthose  who come here to compete for jobs with  our\r\n\r\ncitizens   and  thus  aggravate  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's immigration policy must be in\r\n\r\nalignment  with the Federation's, for  freedom  of\r\n\r\nmovement across the causeway is of mutual interest\r\n\r\nto the people in both territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new constitution, external defence is\r\n\r\nthe  sole  responsibility of  the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment.

It is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nimportant that it should strengthen relations with\r\n\r\nits South-East Asian neighbours, in particular the\r\n\r\nRepublic   of  Indonesia,  which,  next   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, is its closest neighbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the first steps of this Government on\r\n\r\nthe  road towards an egalitarian society.  If  the\r\n\r\npast was renowned for the pomp and resplendence of\r\n\r\nthe  privileged  few  who constituted  the  ruling\r\n\r\nclass,  let the future be notable for the gracious\r\n\r\nmanner  in which these privileges are returned  to\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that some of the outward forms and\r\n\r\ntrappings  of  the past have remained  should  not\r\n\r\nblind  us to the very great changes in the content\r\n\r\nand  purpose  of  the new Government.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government to keep that  part  of\r\n\r\nthe past which helps the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a personal note:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the last of the British Governors of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is not as Governor and Commander-in-Chief that I deliver this address on behalf of the\r\n\r\nfirst   elected  Government  of  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the need to hand over the reins of the\r\n\r\nadministration swiftly and smoothly, Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the United Kingdom had  laid  down\r\n\r\nthat I should be the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\nIt  is my intention to accomplish this within  the\r\n\r\nfive  months  that are left of my office.  Then  I\r\n\r\nshall  hand over my duties and the honour of  this\r\n\r\nhigh office to a Malayan-born who will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   more   suited   to   fulfil   the   role   of\r\n\r\nconstitutional  Head of State in a  society  where\r\n\r\nsymbols for national identification and solidarity\r\n\r\ncan play so valuable a part in nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nSpeech, Mr Speaker, preceded by the Serjeant at\r\n\r\nArms, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClerk, the Clerk-Assistant and the Second Clerk-Assistant, escorted His Excellency out of the\r\n\r\nChamber, and the Assembly adjourned without\r\n\r\nquestion put, pursuant to the Standing Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">11.27 a.m.</div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
