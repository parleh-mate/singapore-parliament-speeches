During  this\r\n\r\nperiod,  the  cost  of  mail  processing  and  delivery   has\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  rise  due  to  increases  in  wage  costs  and\r\n\r\nadministration   costs.   However,   with   automation    and\r\n\r\ncomputerisation,   SingPost  is  able  to   increase   labour\r\n\r\nproductivity and offset some of these cost increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent revision, it has kept the rates for\r\n\r\ndomestic standard mail, which accounts for more than  90%  of\r\n\r\ndomestic  total volume, largely unchanged.  The postage  rate\r\n\r\nwas  raised only for standard mails in the 40-50 grams weight\r\n\r\nstep, which comprises less than 0.5% of all standard mails.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked for comparison for postage rates in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Malaysia and Brunei.  Sir, for the basic 20  grams\r\n\r\nstandard  size mail, our rate is 0.22 cents.  This is  higher\r\n\r\nthan 0.14 cents in Brunei and 0.22 cents in Malaysia, due  to\r\n\r\nhigher  wage structure in Singapore.  If we were  to  compare\r\n\r\nour rates with economies of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsimilar  wage  structure, SingPost's rate of  0.22  cents  is\r\n\r\nlower  than 0.29 cents in Hong Kong and 0.28 cents in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nSo on balance, IDA's price control framework does ensure that\r\n\r\nour postal rates are competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked about international mail rates. The\r\n\r\ntwo  major cost components are operating costs and payment to\r\n\r\ndestination  countries.  I wish to point out  that  operating\r\n\r\ncosts  account for only 38% of the total cost.  The remaining\r\n\r\n62%  are  payments to destination countries.   The  rates  of\r\n\r\npayment are determined by an International Accounting  System\r\n\r\nestablished  by the Universal Postal Union, and the  payments\r\n\r\nare  beyond  the  control of SingPost.  The  recent  hike  in\r\n\r\ninternational  postal rates is to allow SingPost  to  recover\r\n\r\npart  of  the increase in the rates of payment to destination\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, is the\r\n\r\nMinister aware that the abolition of second-class postage for\r\n\r\nprinted  materials by SingPost has resulted in a  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  postal  cost for  business  magazines  and\r\n\r\nnewsletters alike, which can no longer be posted at a cheaper\r\n\r\nsecond-class mail?  The increase of such postal  rates  could\r\n\r\nbe  as  high as 67% for local mail and over 100% for overseas\r\n\r\nmail.   This is definitely not a pro-business approach and  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Minister could explain this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, in terms of international mail, more than 60% of the\r\n\r\ncosts  are  really  beyond the control of SingPost.   So  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  international  mail  rates  is  really  a  cost\r\n\r\nincrease  that  we have no choice but to  bear.   As  far  as\r\n\r\ndomestic  mail  is concerned, the priority  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nautomation.   For  example, if companies or  individuals,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  companies,  are able to  take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes offered by SingPost, such as the  domestic\r\n\r\nmail  bulk  scheme,  ie,  they  lodge  their  letters  in   a\r\n\r\nmachineable bar-coded and pre-sorted manner, they can enjoy a\r\n\r\nsubstantial discount from SingPost.  So\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmy  suggestion is for companies, big and small, to take  full\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the  efficiency that can be  achieved  through\r\n\r\nautomation.   In  this way, we can have a  win-win  situation\r\n\r\nbetween SingPost and the users.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Is the\r\n\r\nMinister  aware  that, despite the high rates that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncharges, in this age today, it sometimes takes four  or  five\r\n\r\ndays for letters to reach the addressee in Singapore itself?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, for the ordinary letters mailed\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, IDA does not just control the rates.  It  also\r\n\r\nimposes  performance indicators on SingPost.  For example,  a\r\n\r\ncertain  percentage of the mail would have  to  be  delivered\r\n\r\nwithin the same day and a certain percentage will have to  be\r\n\r\ndelivered  by  the  next day.  In the example  cited  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  regarding the delay of four to five days, if I  could\r\n\r\nhave  the information, I would be happy to look into it.   To\r\n\r\nthe  best  of our knowledge, almost 100% of mails are  either\r\n\r\ndelivered  on  the same day or by the next day.   But,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid, I would be happy to have the information so that we can\r\n\r\nlook  into  this particular incident and see how we  can  get\r\n\r\nSingPost to improve on its performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying that I should\r\n\r\nsend  to him every letter that I have received three or  four\r\n\r\ndays  after its posting?  If he wants me to do that,  I  will\r\n\r\nflood him with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> No, Sir.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, there are two parts\r\n\r\nto  this  question.  On the first part, at the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nsession  on  9th  October  2000, Mr Tang  Guan  Seng,  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary (Trade and Industry),  has  outlined\r\n\r\nthe  measures  taken  by  the Public Utilities  Board  (PUB),\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  Ministry of the  Environment  (ENV),  to\r\n\r\nprevent a recurrence of the water contamination problem.   If\r\n\r\nthe  Member  has more questions, he might wish  to  direct  a\r\n\r\nquestion  to  MTI.  Or else, he might want  to  look  up  the\r\n\r\nHansard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On part (b), on the roles and responsibilities of the\r\n\r\nmanagement corporations (MCs), these are clearly spelt out in\r\n\r\nthe Land Titles (Strata) Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things, the management corporation has the\r\n\r\nduty  to  properly  manage,  maintain  and  keep  the  common\r\n\r\nproperty  in  a  state of good and serviceable  repair,  keep\r\n\r\nproper records and books of account and insure the property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Act, the MC may appoint a managing agent\r\n\r\n(MA)  and,  by  a written instrument, delegates  its  powers,\r\n\r\nduties  and functions to the MA.  Where the MC has  delegated\r\n\r\nthe  performance of a duty to the MA, the Act  provides  that\r\n\r\nthe   MA  shall  be  liable  for  any  contravention  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Act in respect of the delegated  duty.   So\r\n\r\nthe key words are \"delegated duty\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MC will have to decide for itself the duties to be\r\n\r\ndelegated to the MA, and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontractual  terms for the appointment.  If the  MA  did  not\r\n\r\nperform, the MC may remove the MA from office.  And like  any\r\n\r\nother  commercial  arrangements, the MC  may  also  seek  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  legal remedies if it can establish a  breach  of\r\n\r\ncontract or negligence on the part of the managing agent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where there are provisions in the Land Titles\r\n\r\n(Strata) Act, which proved to be inadequate, the Building and\r\n\r\nConstruction  Authority  (BCA) would initiate  and  recommend\r\n\r\namendments to the Act at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak):</b> Sir, can I ask two\r\n\r\nquestions?   Firstly, at the moment, since the MA's  contract\r\n\r\nis  usually  for  only one year, will the  Ministry  consider\r\n\r\ngiving  a  longer  contract  for the  MA  to  manage  private\r\n\r\ncondominiums?  Secondly, water tanks.  Does the Ministry have\r\n\r\nspecial  programmes to ensure that MAs check the water  tanks\r\n\r\nwithin a specific time?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The details of the terms of\r\n\r\na contract are between the MC and the MA.  So if the MC wants\r\n\r\nto award the contract for more than one year, it is up to the\r\n\r\nMC.   Whether the Ministry looks after the water tank safety,\r\n\r\nthe   answer   is  really  no,  because  the   Building   and\r\n\r\nConstruction Authority is the authority on building as far as\r\n\r\nstructural   integrity  is  concerned.   Water  contamination\r\n\r\nproblems  are  actually  under the purview  of  MTI  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  the  Environment.   But  just  to   give   the\r\n\r\nbackground, after the Bukit Timah Plaza incident, MTI and ENV\r\n\r\nhave  instructed all MCs to look at their sanitary pipes  and\r\n\r\nto  repair  these pipes if they are corrugated  and  to  also\r\n\r\ncheck  their  water tanks.  They have found  that  the  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah   Plaza   incident  was  an  isolated  problem.    But,\r\n\r\nnonetheless, the problem has been fixed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can\r\n\r\nI ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary if he would say that\r\n\r\nthe  two cases cited are actually of a very different  nature\r\n\r\nand whether the real cause of contamination in the Chuan Park\r\n\r\ncase has been established?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The Police's\r\n\r\nPublic  Entertainment Licensing Unit (PELU)  issues  licences\r\n\r\nfor public entertainment and meetings, such as plays, operas,\r\n\r\nvariety  acts, music performances and talks under the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Act.  In deciding whether or not  to  grant  a\r\n\r\nlicence,  PELU  may  consult  the relevant  authorities  and,\r\n\r\namongst other factors, PELU takes into account law and  order\r\n\r\nconsiderations, including racial and religious  sensitivities\r\n\r\nthat may be evoked.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, \"Talaq\", which explores marital violence and rape\r\n\r\nin  the Indian Muslim community, was first performed in Tamil\r\n\r\nby the Agni Kootthu theatre group in December 1998, and twice\r\n\r\nin  February 1999.  In assessing applications made in respect\r\n\r\nof   those  performances,  PELU  sought  the  National   Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil's  (NAC)  views.  NAC recommended  approval.   Hence,\r\n\r\nPELU  approved  the licences for the performances.   However,\r\n\r\nfollowing the February 1999 performances, both NAC  and  PELU\r\n\r\nreceived  adverse feedback  that the play was  offensive  and\r\n\r\nmisrepresented the Indian Muslim community and Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, when Ms Thenmoli, the president of Agni Kootthu,\r\n\r\napplied  to  PELU on 19th September 2000 for  \"Talaq\"  to  be\r\n\r\nstaged  in  Malay and English on 28th and 29th  October  2000\r\n\r\nrespectively, PELU sought the views of NAC.  NAC advised PELU\r\n\r\nto  seek the views of Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), as\r\n\r\nthe  play had attracted complaints previously.  MUIS informed\r\n\r\nPELU  that  they  had received objections  to  the  play  and\r\n\r\nrecommended  that PELU turn down the application.   When  NAC\r\n\r\nlearnt of this, NAC decided to organise a preview of the play\r\n\r\non  16th October 2000.  However, Ms Thenmoli at first refused\r\n\r\nto   hold  the  preview  on  the  grounds  that  there   were\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the South Indian Jamiathul Ulama  (SIJU)\r\n\r\non  the  preview panel.  PELU therefore could not  grant  the\r\n\r\nlicence  for  the  performances.   Ms  Thenmoli  subsequently\r\n\r\nchanged  her mind and agreed to a preview, which was held  on\r\n\r\n23rd  October  2000.  Representatives from MUIS,  SIJU,  Agni\r\n\r\nKootthu and PELU were invited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the following day, NAC and the Drama Review\r\n\r\nCommittee (DRC) recommended to PELU that the staging  of  the\r\n\r\nplay  could be allowed, but subject to the removal of certain\r\n\r\nreferences   to  Islam  and  the  announcement   before   the\r\n\r\ncommencement  of  each  performance  and  in  all   publicity\r\n\r\nmaterials that \"although the play is based on the experiences\r\n\r\nof  an individual, it is not intended to reflect on or defame\r\n\r\nthe  Indian  Muslim  community  at  large\".   In  giving  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations, NAC also stated that ultimately it was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPELU's  prerogative if it wished to place greater  weight  on\r\n\r\nMUIS' views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS had strongly objected to the play as it\r\n\r\ncontained Quranic references and religious connotations  that\r\n\r\nmight give the audience a wrong impression of Islam.  In view\r\n\r\nof  the NAC and DRC's recommendation, PELU sought MUIS' views\r\n\r\non  whether  NAC's proposed conditions were  adequate.   MUIS\r\n\r\nreplied that the conditions would not adequately address  the\r\n\r\nobjections  raised  by  them, and  reiterated  their  earlier\r\n\r\nstrong   objections   to  the  play.    After   taking   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  NAC's and MUIS' views, PELU  turned  down  the\r\n\r\napplication,  as  empowered under section 13  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments  Act.   PELU  conveyed  its  decision  to   Ms\r\n\r\nThenmoli on 25th October 2000, two days after the preview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore encourages artistic\r\n\r\nexpression  and creativity.  But artistic works must  respect\r\n\r\nreligious  sensitivities in multi-racial and  multi-religious\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Artistes  should  be  mindful  of  our   social\r\n\r\nrealities and avoid creating racial or religious tensions, as\r\n\r\nthey  too  have  a  responsible role to play  in  helping  to\r\n\r\npreserve religious and racial harmony in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I, first of all, say I see that the\r\n\r\noverworked  Minister of State is again asked  to  answer  all\r\n\r\nthese questions whilst the Minister is here.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> That is part of the decision-making process. I do not think it is up to PELU to disclose\r\n\r\nall  these grounds.  In fact, 11 specific grounds were given,\r\n\r\non  which  the view was formed that there were references  to\r\n\r\nQuranic  verses and also religious connotations  which  would\r\n\r\ngive  a  wrong  impression  of  Islam.   Here,  because   the\r\n\r\nperformances were in Malay and English - unlike  the  earlier\r\n\r\nperformances which were in Tamil where probably the  audience\r\n\r\nwould be a more limited one - there will be larger audiences.\r\n\r\nSo  this  will lead possibly to people of other races  having\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  impression of Islam, having perhaps an  erroneous\r\n\r\nand  lower impression of Islam than what it actually is,  and\r\n\r\nthis may lead to misunderstanding amongst the races.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why was MUIS not told that they were at\r\n\r\nliberty, if they thought there were wrong interpretations  of\r\n\r\nthe Koran or anything else, that they could come out publicly\r\n\r\nwith  their  statement and so let us have  the  debate  open,\r\n\r\ninstead of all being decided by the \"Commissar\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

I think that  is\r\n\r\nthe important point - taking all views into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> First, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  I believe the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfirst  performances of the play in Tamil  were  subtitled  in\r\n\r\nEnglish, so they did in fact reach a wider audience than just\r\n\r\nthe  Tamil community.  In fact, I think, quite a few English-speaking were there in the audience and understood the play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, all of us here fully understand that we live\r\n\r\nin  a  multi-racial  society and that we are  very  sensitive\r\n\r\nabout  not  offending all our various communities with  their\r\n\r\ndifferent religious beliefs.

The hospital and NHB have already put up\r\n\r\na  plaque  to  mark  the  history of the  building.   PMB  is\r\n\r\nstudying  the  historical and architectural  significance  of\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hospital  building to see if  it  qualifies  under\r\n\r\ncurrent guidelines to be gazetted as a national monument.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF NCO Clubhouse was built as a clubhouse in 1951\r\n\r\nby  the  British  for  their servicemen.   When  the  British\r\n\r\nwithdrew  in  1969,  the  building was  handed  over  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government.   It became the SAF NCO  Clubhouse  in\r\n\r\n1974.

The one looking at the architectural aspect  is\r\n\r\nchaired   by   somebody  from  URA  who  is   familiar   with\r\n\r\narchitecture  and so on.  The two different  committees  will\r\n\r\naward  points for the two sets of criteria and, if they  meet\r\n\r\nthe  cut-off  point,  the  building will  be  considered  for\r\n\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> In order to encourage and justify\r\n\r\ncertain preserved buildings for further redevelopments, would\r\n\r\nPMB  consider  granting  them certain incentives  to  further\r\n\r\nredevelop  such  shabby buildings, for  instance,  by  giving\r\n\r\ngreater  plot ratio and greater height to encourage  them  to\r\n\r\ncarry out redevelopment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry and the\r\n\r\nPMB  are  aware  that there are costs involved in  preserving\r\n\r\nthese buildings.  But I hope the building owners realise that\r\n\r\nthese  are important historical and national assets.  As  far\r\n\r\nas  possible,  we have tried to accommodate the  requirements\r\n\r\nand  the needs of the owners.  For example, recently,  during\r\n\r\nthe  opening of the MITA Building, I announced that  we  have\r\n\r\ncome  up  with  a new scheme known as Monuments  Category  II\r\n\r\nwhere  we allow the building owners to redevelop the building\r\n\r\nso   long  as  they  preserve  essential  components  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.   It  might be certain sections  like  the  facade.\r\n\r\nThis  is following the approach taken by URA where they  have\r\n\r\nconserved  certain areas in Chinatown and  Little  India,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the development potential of the building is preserved,\r\n\r\nthe  plot ratio is still allowed within the limits as set out\r\n\r\nin the Master Plan, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two buildings which have been gazetted under\r\n\r\nthis category and these are the MacDonald House where\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  had the bomb incident during Confrontation, and the other\r\n\r\none  is  Cathay Building.  In these two cases, there will  be\r\n\r\nsubstantial redevelopment.   We are only preserving the front\r\n\r\nof  the MacDonald House and, for Cathay Building, we are only\r\n\r\npreserving the podium and the entrance.  The Cathay  Building\r\n\r\nwill  be  redeveloped  into a cineplex with  seven  or  eight\r\n\r\ncinemas.   It  will  be  a  very interesting  and  attractive\r\n\r\nredevelopment.   But  having said that,  I  am  not  so  sure\r\n\r\nwhether there is a need for further incentives.  I think  the\r\n\r\nMinistry has tried to preserve the values of the buildings in\r\n\r\nso  far as to allow redevelopment within the limits of  their\r\n\r\npotential  under  the Masterplan, but to go  beyond  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething I am not sure whether Government will agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CAUSEWAY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Replacement with bridge)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question stood in the name of Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.

It  has been estimated that about  45%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation had ever consulted a TCM practitioner in the past.\r\n\r\nAbout 12% of the daily outpatient attendances opt to see  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners.  Hence,  TCM is a significant  factor  in  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare scene in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a similar trend in developed countries. In the\r\n\r\nWest,   complementary   medicine,  including   TCM,   has   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  following.   Some Western  countries  now  allow\r\n\r\ninsurance  claims or reimbursement for acupuncture treatment.\r\n\r\nAcupuncture  and therapeutic massage (or tui  na)  have  been\r\n\r\npopular  among  patients suffering from  painful  conditions.\r\n\r\nThere  is also the popular belief that TCM is milder and  has\r\n\r\nfewer  side  effects,  thus making it  a  preferred  modality\r\n\r\namongst  older persons. As the population in Singapore  ages,\r\n\r\nit  is likely that there would be an increased demand for TCM\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of TCM practitioners in Singapore is also\r\n\r\nsizeable  and it would probably increase in tandem  with  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for TCM treatment. A list published by the local  TCM\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  1997  indicated  that  there  were  1,807  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners in Singapore.  There is probably more now.  The\r\n\r\ntraining  and  experience of TCM practitioners  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nvary.   Some  were self-taught.  Some learned from  peers  or\r\n\r\nmasters, while others graduated from TCM institutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1994, the Ministry of Health appointed a\r\n\r\nCommittee  to look into the regulation of TCM.  The Committee\r\n\r\nrecommended  a phased approach, (ie a step-by-step  approach)\r\n\r\nto the regulation of TCM practitioners in order to safeguard\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npatients'  interest and safety, as well  as  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nstandard of training and professionalism of TCM practitioners\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phased approach is necessary, given the complexities\r\n\r\nof  regulating TCM practitioners.  Take the case of Hong Kong\r\n\r\nas  an  example.   Although Article  138  of  the  Basic  Law\r\n\r\nprovided  for  the  development of both Western  and  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedicine,  and  there has been a Working Committee  appointed\r\n\r\nsince 1989 to promote, develop, and regulate TCM, the Chinese\r\n\r\nMedicine  Ordinance was only enacted after 10 years  in  July\r\n\r\n1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the regulatory process in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health first encouraged the eight main local  TCM\r\n\r\norganisations  to  form  the  Singapore  Traditional  Chinese\r\n\r\nMedicine  Organisations Coordinating Committee  (STCMOCC)  in\r\n\r\n1996.   The  STCMOCC serves as the coordinating body  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  mainstream TCM community.  It also acts as a channel  of\r\n\r\ncommunication  between the mainstream TCM community  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that this arrangement has worked well. The\r\n\r\nformation  of STCMOCC has led to the upgrading of  the  local\r\n\r\nTCM  training course to a 6-year part-time diploma course  in\r\n\r\n1996.   The  STCMOCC has also worked out  a  listing  of  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners  in Singapore. That was how  we  knew  that  in\r\n\r\n1997,  there  were 1,807 TCM practitioners in Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  this  Bill  was prepared with useful inputs  from  the\r\n\r\nSTCMOCC.   The Bill indeed has the support of the  mainstream\r\n\r\nTCM community in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Major provisions in the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to present the main\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill. This Bill is an enabling legislation\r\n\r\nto  allow the Minister to declare any type of practice of TCM\r\n\r\nfor  registration if he is of the opinion that it is  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  interest for that type of practice to  be  regulated.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, the Minister will decide which form  of  TCM\r\n\r\npractice to be regulated at which point of time.  It will not\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat,  with the promulgation of this Act, every form  of  TCM\r\n\r\npractice will be regulated.  Clause 14(1) of the Bill  states\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister can regulate by order  published  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette.   This  is  in  line with the  phased  approach  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health has been adopting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health's intention is to start with\r\n\r\nregulating  the  acupuncturists, because  acupuncture  is  an\r\n\r\ninvasive   procedure  that  carries  risks  of   injury   and\r\n\r\ninfection.   It  is  estimated that  there  are  about  1,070\r\n\r\nacupuncturists  in Singapore. This will then be  followed  by\r\n\r\nthe registration of TCM general practitioners in about 3 to 4\r\n\r\nyears' time, and the TCM herbal dispensers at a later date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill takes reference from the existing medical- and\r\n\r\nhealth-related  legislation such as the Medical  Registration\r\n\r\nAct, the Dentists Act as well as the Nurses and Midwives Act.\r\n\r\nAll these Acts are essentially based on self-regulation. This\r\n\r\nBill  provides for the establishment of a Traditional Chinese\r\n\r\nMedicine  Practitioners Board appointed by  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nregister TCM practitioners, to accredit TCM training  courses\r\n\r\nand  institutions,  as well as to regulate  the  professional\r\n\r\nconduct  and  ethics of TCM practitioners.   The  Board  will\r\n\r\nconsist  of  5  to 9 members, comprising peers from  the  TCM\r\n\r\ncommunity,  members  of the medical profession,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board can appoint Committees to which specific tasks\r\n\r\nare  delegated.   For  example,  the  Board  may  appoint  an\r\n\r\nExaminations Committee to set standards and to determine  the\r\n\r\ncontent  of the qualifying examinations for registration,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  to  oversee  the organisation and  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nexaminations.  Also,  the  Board  may  appoint  Investigation\r\n\r\nCommittees to investigate complaints which may lead the Board\r\n\r\nto take disciplinary actions against practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TCM Practitioners Board will have disciplinary\r\n\r\npowers  to  deal  with any registered TCM practitioner  found\r\n\r\nguilty of professional misconduct, professional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnegligence,  or improper conduct, which renders  him  or  her\r\n\r\nunfit to practise.   The Board may -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) caution or censure the practitioner;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) impose a fine of not more than $10,000;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) impose conditions on the practitioner's\r\n\r\nregistration for a period of no more than three years;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) suspend his or her registration for no more than\r\n\r\nthree years; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) cancel his or her registration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any practitioner who is aggrieved by the decision of the\r\n\r\nBoard  may appeal to the High Court within 30 days.  A person\r\n\r\nwhose  registration has been cancelled can apply to the Board\r\n\r\nfor  restoration  three years after the date of  cancellation\r\n\r\nand  not more than once in any period of 12 months.  This  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to the provisions made under the Medical Registration\r\n\r\nAct as well as the Dentists Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deter unlawful practice of TCM, the Bill provides for\r\n\r\nthe  imposition of penalties similar to the provisions of the\r\n\r\nDentists Act. The Courts may fine the offender not more  than\r\n\r\n$25,000 or imprison him for a term not exceeding sixmonths or\r\n\r\nboth.   In  the  case of a second or subsequent offence,  the\r\n\r\npenalty  is  increased to a fine of not more than $50,000  or\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who procures or attempts to procure\r\n\r\nregistration by fraud shall be liable on conviction to a fine\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  $10,000 or to imprisonment  for  a  term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  two  years or to both.  This  is  similar  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Medical Registration Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Implementation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health's plan is to\r\n\r\nsubject acupuncturists to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregistration by 1st January 2002. Details of the registration\r\n\r\nas well as the criteria for registration have been worked out\r\n\r\nwith  the STCMOCC, the coordinating committee that represents\r\n\r\nthe mainstream TCM practitioners in Singapore.   The criteria\r\n\r\ntake   into   consideration  both  experience  as   well   as\r\n\r\nqualifications.   Those  who  do  not  have   the   necessary\r\n\r\nexperience  or  qualifications may  be  required  to  pass  a\r\n\r\nnational examination called the Common Acupuncture Qualifying\r\n\r\nExamination   (CAQE)   before  they   become   eligible   for\r\n\r\nregistration.   The Ministry of Health and the  STCMOCC  have\r\n\r\ninitiated the Acupuncture Upgrading Training Course (AUTC) in\r\n\r\norder  to  prepare  acupuncturists for the CAQE.  The  course\r\n\r\nsyllabus  and course structure were formulated and  developed\r\n\r\nby the STCMOCC as well as the Ministry of Health, with inputs\r\n\r\nfrom foreign TCM experts.  The first four classes of AUTC had\r\n\r\nstarted  since  September this year.  The response  has  been\r\n\r\nvery good.  We plan to conduct two or three CAQEs in the year\r\n\r\n2001,  so  there should be sufficient time and  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  the  acupuncturists to pass their  examinations  and  to\r\n\r\nregister by 1st January 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the TCM Practitioners Board is formed, it will take\r\n\r\nover  these tasks from the Ministry of Health.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nand the Board will maintain close contact with the STCMOCC to\r\n\r\nensure  that  constructive proposals from the mainstream  TCM\r\n\r\ncommunity are taken into consideration.  The registration  of\r\n\r\nthe  acupuncturists  will  provide  valuable  experience   to\r\n\r\nprepare  us  for  the  eventual  registration  of  other  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, statutory regulation of TCM practice\r\n\r\nis  necessary to safeguard patients' interest and safety.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  ensure that TCM practitioners are properly  trained\r\n\r\nand  qualified  before they are allowed to  practise.   There\r\n\r\nshould also be a framework to raise the professional standard\r\n\r\nof TCM practitioners in Singapore. All these are provided for\r\n\r\nin  this Bill.  The mainstream TCM community, represented  by\r\n\r\nSTCMOCC,   has  played an active part in the  preparation  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill. This Bill has their support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Bill introduced by the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\non   Traditional  Chinese  Medicine  (TCM).   With  an  aging\r\n\r\npopulation,   more  and  more  people  are  seeking   medical\r\n\r\nattention, and  most elderly people are more comfortable with\r\n\r\nTCM,  including acupuncture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the Bill cover mainly two areas - one,\r\n\r\nthe   setting   up   of   a  Traditional   Chinese   Medicine\r\n\r\nPractitioners  Board,  and  the  other,  provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nconduct of examinations in TCM.  On the establishment of  the\r\n\r\nTCM  Practitioners  Board, I wish to raise five points  which\r\n\r\nconcern public interest:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, with the registration of TCM practitioners,\r\n\r\nwill   the   medical  certificates  (MCs)   issued   by   TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners  enjoy the same status as  the  MCs  issued  by\r\n\r\nwestern-trained  doctors,  and be  recognised  by  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments and employers in the private sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will the receipts issued by TCM practitioners\r\n\r\nbe accepted by employers for reimbursement of medical fees?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if a TCM practitioner is of the opinion that\r\n\r\nhis patient is seriously ill and warrants immediate attention\r\n\r\nby  doctors  in the A&E unit of a Government or  restructured\r\n\r\nhospital,  will the referral letter by a TCM practitioner  be\r\n\r\naccepted for the purpose?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, currently, pharmacists in Singapore have to be\r\n\r\nregistered  and  licensed in order to practise.   Under  this\r\n\r\nBill,  will the Chinese drugstores be required  to apply  for\r\n\r\npermits or licences to sell herbs or Chinese patent medicine?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, will the Bill incorporate a set of code of\r\n\r\nconduct for the Chinese medicine practitioners to follow?  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, will the TCM practitioners be required to  be\r\n\r\nproperly attired when they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattending to their patients?   I have occasions to visit  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners  in  Singapore, and  I  notice  that  they  are\r\n\r\nusually  not  too particular about their attire.  Some  would\r\n\r\nwear  an  open-collar short-sleeve shirt, and some even  wear\r\n\r\nthe  traditional Chinese pyjama pants when they see patients.\r\n\r\nThe   practice  in  China  is  quite  different.   All  their\r\n\r\nphysicians wear smart-looking white physician's coat whenever\r\n\r\nthey are on duty, giving a very professional image.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at western-trained doctors like Dr Tan\r\n\r\nCheng  Bock, he always wears a tie and he looks very handsome\r\n\r\nindeed.  For the lady doctors, like Dr Lily Neo,  she  always\r\n\r\npays  great attention to her attire, and dressed beautifully.\r\n\r\nThis reflects the professionalism in them.   I hope that  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners in Singapore will also pay attention  to  their\r\n\r\nattire.   Once  this  Bill is passed, I  hope  that  our  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners   will  do  their  best  to   reinforce   their\r\n\r\nprofessional image.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nTraditional  Chinese  Medicine (TCM) community  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust   be  gratified  and  elated  by  the  introduction   of\r\n\r\nTraditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Bill in Parliament\r\n\r\ntoday  by  Mr  Chan Soo Sen, Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is currently strongly advocating research\r\n\r\nand  development   on  the  life  sciences  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\ndeveloping  this field into  another pillar of  our  economy.\r\n\r\nNow,  through  legislation, the Government has  included  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  TCM  in  the  scope  of  orthodox  medical  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare  industry  in  Singapore,  thereby  according  the\r\n\r\nChinese  physicians  and practitioners in  the  TCM  industry\r\n\r\ntheir   due   legal  status.  This  approach   is   certainly\r\n\r\nforesighted, appropriate, and wise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the development of TCM is well\r\n\r\nestablished  with  a  history of a few thousand  years.   The\r\n\r\nabundant  knowledge  of TCM is quite profound  and  extensive\r\n\r\nsince   it  has  taken  generations  to  accumulate   through\r\n\r\ncontinuous  medical  practice and  combat  against  diseases.\r\n\r\nYet,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere is still room for the abundant knowledge on traditional\r\n\r\nherbal treatment and acupuncture to be further developed.  As\r\n\r\nsuch,   in addition to recognizing and regulating TCM through\r\n\r\nlegislation, I would urge the Government to allocate adequate\r\n\r\nresources  to  train and recruit ample supply of  outstanding\r\n\r\nTCM practitioners and researchers to study and develop TCM so\r\n\r\nas to make it a part of the development of the life sciences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the escalating cost of\r\n\r\nwestern  medical  treatment  and  medicines,  TCM  has   been\r\n\r\nproviding our people with an alternative way to seek  cheaper\r\n\r\nand  more  convenient health care service.   According  to  a\r\n\r\nrelevant   statistical   report,   out   of   three   million\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, there have been more than  a million visits  to\r\n\r\nthe  various  TCM  hospitals  and  clinics  every  year.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  many people simply go directly to a  TCM  shop  to\r\n\r\npurchase  medicine over-the-counter and take it  without  any\r\n\r\nmedical advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics from 1999 showed that the Chung Hwa Free\r\n\r\nClinic  established  by  the  Singapore  Chinese  Physicians'\r\n\r\nAssociation in 1952 sees an average of 900 patients per  day.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, for more than four decades,  it  must  have\r\n\r\ntreated some eight million patients. The Singapore Thong Chai\r\n\r\nMedical  Institution has been receiving  an  average  of  700\r\n\r\npatients daily since 1867.  The Public Free Clinic was opened\r\n\r\nin 1974 and has about 400 patients every day.  Moreover, many\r\n\r\ncharities  such  as the Singapore Buddhist Free  Clinic,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Buddhist Lodge, and the Kwan-In  Welfare  Society,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  together receive more than 1,000 patients  daily.\r\n\r\nAs  to the 1900-odd Singapore TCM practitioners, many of them\r\n\r\nsee  more than 100 patients each in their respective  clinics\r\n\r\neach day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, many people, especially those in the lower\r\n\r\nincome group, are deeply concerned that the cost of TCM\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay  be increased once it is regulated.  I would suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  refrain from imposing  excessive  levies  or\r\n\r\nunnecessary red-tapes when issuing practising certificates to\r\n\r\nthe  practitioners so as to avoid additional  cost  to  them.\r\n\r\nProfessional   practitioners  should  also   exercise   self-discipline.  Unreasonable charges may add on medical expenses\r\n\r\nof  the  ordinary citizens, bringing them extra  burdens  and\r\n\r\ncompelling  them to switch to western medicine or even  self-medication  to  reduce  their  medical  expenses.    To   TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners it would be more of a loss than a gain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, wholesalers and retailers of Chinese\r\n\r\nmedicine  also worry that once the law comes into force  they\r\n\r\nmay  be  obligated  to hire registered TCM  practitioners  or\r\n\r\npharmacists  to be stationed at their shops to operate  their\r\n\r\nbusiness   lawfully. Currently, most of the  shops  have  the\r\n\r\nowners   or   the  \"old-hands\"  or  supervisors  to   provide\r\n\r\nconsultation and to help them dispense the correct  herbs  in\r\n\r\ntheir   correct  dosages  as  prescribed  by  the  physicians\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, there is no so-called \"controlled\"\r\n\r\nor  \"non-controlled\"  drugs, as far as  Chinese  medicine  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned.  However, the import and retail sales\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  herbs  are subjected to strict  control  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health. If any ingredient harmful to human health\r\n\r\nis  detected,  import  of the medicine  will  be  immediately\r\n\r\nbanned and the medicine or herb will be prohibited from being\r\n\r\nsold   in  Singapore.  In  other  words,  all  Chinese  herbs\r\n\r\npresently  sold  are uncontrolled drugs which  are  safe  for\r\n\r\nhuman consumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a common practice to see customers bringing their\r\n\r\nprescriptions to the TCM shop for the herbs to be  dispensed.\r\n\r\nSelling  the  herbs  and  dispensing them  according  to  the\r\n\r\nprescriptions  produced by the customers are also  the  basic\r\n\r\nbusiness and service available at all TCM shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, if these shops would have to hire registered or\r\n\r\ncertified practitioners to run\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  day-to-day  business, life would be extremely  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  the  TCM  shop-owners. The laws should be enforced  only\r\n\r\nafter all the conditions are met; otherwise, the business  of\r\n\r\nthe existing 1,000 or so TCM shops would be severely affected\r\n\r\nand  the  overall medical service, health care, and even  the\r\n\r\neconomy would suffer a negative chain impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a TCM shop sells only patent and common over-the-counter medicines it should not come under the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   This  is  the same as in the  western   medicine\r\n\r\npharmacy  where the presence of in-house pharmacists  is  not\r\n\r\nmandatory  if no prescribed medications are sold in the shop.\r\n\r\nI believe that in order to enhance and control the quality of\r\n\r\nretail  TCM shops we should consider the present practice  of\r\n\r\nthe  TCM shops. Only if we take a pragmatic approach can  our\r\n\r\npolicy  achieve the anticipated results.  If  in  the  future\r\n\r\nthey  are  required to have registered practitioners  in  the\r\n\r\nshop,  they  should also be given ample time to  train  their\r\n\r\nstaff. Also, for the best result, it is important to have the\r\n\r\ncooperation of the TCM community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Government's intention to\r\n\r\nestablish a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners  Board\r\n\r\nto  appraise the practitioners' qualifications and  to  issue\r\n\r\ncertificates so as to ensure that the practitioners observe a\r\n\r\nhigh-level code of conduct, and to promote TCM education  and\r\n\r\ntraining  plans.  From  the national medical  and  healthcare\r\n\r\nstandpoint, this Bill is rather critical as it has a profound\r\n\r\nimpact on our TCM's survival and development. I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat the Government  invite TCM-related groups to sit on this\r\n\r\nBoard to tap their expertise and experience.  I believe  with\r\n\r\nthe  cooperation of the Government and related industry, this\r\n\r\ninnovative  policy  will  achieve  successful  results.   The\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our TCM will also attain remarkable results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport this Bill.  As my name was mentioned, I thought I had\r\n\r\nbetter say a few words on this Bill too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is welcome. As a Western-trained doctor, I\r\n\r\nstill feel that we should register these practitioners.   The\r\n\r\nmain  thing  that  we must consider is a  good  standard  and\r\n\r\ntraining   for  all  TCM  practitioners.   Medical   students\r\n\r\ntraining  to become doctors have to go through six  years  of\r\n\r\nrigorous training, including one year of medical housemanship\r\n\r\nbefore  they  can come out and practise.  That  is  important\r\n\r\nbecause we are dealing with lives.  For students who want  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  medicine, they have to achieve very good grades  at\r\n\r\n'O'  and  'A' levels.  So we are picking the top of  the  'A'\r\n\r\nlevel  cohort to become doctors.  That should be  so  because\r\n\r\nthe  training to be a doctor is very tough and we are putting\r\n\r\nall  these people out to treat patients eventually.   Rightly\r\n\r\nso, we should maintain this very high standard in the medical\r\n\r\nschools.   I  am  hoping that with the  registration  of  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners,  all these TCM practitioners  should  also  be\r\n\r\ntrained  very  rigorously  so that  when  they  come  out  to\r\n\r\npractise they will also be of a very high standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we expect the entry for Singaporeans to become TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners, let us say at 'O' level or just very poor  'A'\r\n\r\nlevel  results,  we  might be getting poor quality  graduates\r\n\r\nfrom  the  TCM school.  It would be good to maintain  a  very\r\n\r\nhigh standard of entry for these Singaporeans who want to  be\r\n\r\nTCM practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng brought up the point whether, having\r\n\r\nregistered the TCM practitioners, we would recognise them  or\r\n\r\nnot.   It is a question of registration and recognition.   If\r\n\r\nrecognition is accorded to them, we must also be prepared  to\r\n\r\nrecognise the medical certificate.  I am not sure what  level\r\n\r\nof  recognition he is talking about.  Is it just  recognition\r\n\r\nthat  they can practise or recognition at the same  level  as\r\n\r\nmedical practitioners?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the three\r\n\r\nMembers  who have supported the Bill and offered constructive\r\n\r\nobservations and suggestions.  Since most of the  discussions\r\n\r\nwere in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMandarin,  allow me also to answer the questions in Mandarin,\r\n\r\nif Dr Tan Cheng Bock does not mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, I would like to thank Mr Tay Beng\r\n\r\nChuan, Mr Ang Mong Seng and Dr Tan Cheng Bock for their  very\r\n\r\ngood   and  constructive   suggestions.   Let  me  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to respond to the issues raised by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan said that when the Government\r\n\r\nregisters  the  TCM  practitioners,  it  should  not   impose\r\n\r\nexcessive  levies  or  red  tapes to  increase  their  costs,\r\n\r\nleading to higher fees for the patients.  I can assure Mr Tay\r\n\r\nBeng  Chuan that this is not the intention of the Government.\r\n\r\nI believe that the Chinese physicians will not and should not\r\n\r\ntake  the  registration as an excuse to increase  their  fees\r\n\r\neither.  I believe the fees would be a very small portion  of\r\n\r\ntheir  revenue..  The doctors, dentists and pharmacists  also\r\n\r\npay  a  one-time registration fee.  The doctors and  dentists\r\n\r\npay  $200  and  the pharmacists pay $100.   Every  year,  the\r\n\r\ndoctors and the dentists pay a licence fee of $200, while the\r\n\r\npharmacists  pay $100.  Assuming the licence and registration\r\n\r\nfees  for  TCM  practitioners are  similar,  these  are  very\r\n\r\nnominal sums.  They should not affect the consultation  fees.\r\n\r\nI  must  emphasise that these were figures for  illustration.\r\n\r\nThe  actual registration and licence fees would be determined\r\n\r\nby the TCM Practitioners Board after its establishment.  I am\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  Board  will  take  into  consideration   the\r\n\r\nprevailing charges for the doctors, dentists and pharmacists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure TCM practitioners realise that their fees are\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  market  forces.  As Mr  Tay  Beng  Chuan  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  if the fees are too expensive, the  patients  may\r\n\r\nopt  to  see  the western doctors instead.   I  am  sure  TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners  will not kill the goose that lays  the  golden\r\n\r\neggs  by arbitrarily raising their fees. If there is a  need,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Traditional Chinese Medicine Organisations Co-ordinating Committee (STCMOCC), the Committee representing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmainstream TCM community could, like the  Singapore   Medical\r\n\r\nAssociation  (SMA) for the doctors, provide  fees  guidelines\r\n\r\nfor  various treatments. If a patient feels that he has  been\r\n\r\nover-charged,  he  can  complain to the  Traditional  Chinese\r\n\r\nMedicine  Practitioners  Board,  Consumers'  Association   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (CASE),  or  to the courts.   These  are  channels\r\n\r\nthrough which they could seek redress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has also raised the issue concerning\r\n\r\ntraining  of  herbal dispensers working in TCM retail  shops.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has no immediate plans to make it  compulsory\r\n\r\nfor TCM retail shops to engage a certain number of registered\r\n\r\nTCM  practitioners or herbal dispensers. Even  if  we  do  so\r\n\r\neventually, it would be done in stages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is true that the training standards of\r\n\r\nherbal   dispensers   working  in  TCM  retail   shops   vary\r\n\r\nconsiderably.  It is necessary to upgrade their  training  so\r\n\r\nthat the TCM shops can serve their customers better. Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health  had discussed this with the Singapore Traditional\r\n\r\nChinese   Medicine  Organisations  Committee   (STOC)   which\r\n\r\nrepresented  the TCM traders and retail shops.  We  are  very\r\n\r\nhappy  that  STOC  recognises this, and  is  planning  for  a\r\n\r\ntraining  course  for herbal dispensers. Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nwill  work  with STOC to work out the course, and  will  help\r\n\r\nSTOC  to  invite foreign TCM experts to appraise and evaluate\r\n\r\nthe  training courses. If all parties work together,  we  can\r\n\r\nstart offering the herbal dispensers' training course in  one\r\n\r\nor  two  years' time. This will  make important contributions\r\n\r\ntowards lifting the service standards of TCM retail shops  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng touched on the professional image and\r\n\r\ncode  of  conduct for TCM practitioners.  Dr Tan  Cheng  Bock\r\n\r\nalso  raised  similar concerns.  Under  this  Bill,  the  TCM\r\n\r\nPractitioners  Board  will  consist  of  well-respected   TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners as well as some western doctors.  They will  be\r\n\r\nin good positions to work out the code of conduct for the TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners.  I hope the TCM Practitioners\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoard  come  out  with  some formal guidelines  so  that  the\r\n\r\nregistered  TCM practitioners can refer to.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether they would go into details such as male practitioners\r\n\r\nto  put on a tie and dressed up as handsomely as Dr Tan Cheng\r\n\r\nBock,  while  the lady practitioners  dress up as beautifully\r\n\r\nas Dr Lily Neo, as observed by Mr Ang Mong Seng.  It is up to\r\n\r\nthe  Board  to  decide. However, the Board can supervise  and\r\n\r\ntake  disciplinary actions against practitioners who  conduct\r\n\r\nthemselves unprofessionally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Dr Tan Cheng Bock both touched on\r\n\r\nthe  recognition of  Medical Certificates (MCs) and  receipts\r\n\r\nissued  by  TCM  practitioners for the  purpose  of  employee\r\n\r\nmedical benefits.  I feel that it is premature to talk  about\r\n\r\nthis  matter  at  this point of time.   Whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nemployers  will recognise the Medical Certificates issued  by\r\n\r\nTCM  practitioners and  reimburse the cost of TCM  treatment,\r\n\r\nwill depend on whether the employers are satisfied   that the\r\n\r\nChinese  physicians  are of high professional  standing,  and\r\n\r\nwhether the employers are comfortable with the authority  and\r\n\r\nauthenticity of these documents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the professional standard of our TCM practitioners\r\n\r\nhas  arrived,  more and more employers will  recognise  their\r\n\r\nMedical  Certificates.  The Government  cannot  legislate  to\r\n\r\ncompel  them  to  recognise these Medical  Certificates.  The\r\n\r\ndecision  should be taken by the employers.  I feel that  the\r\n\r\nmost  important task for the TCM community now is to  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  professional  standard and  image,  not  only  to  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of the patients but also to the satisfaction  of\r\n\r\nthe  employers.  When this is achieved, the issue of  MC  and\r\n\r\nreceipt recognition will resolve itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether the Government and\r\n\r\nrestructured   hospitals  would  accept  referrals   by   TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners for emergency treatment.  I must say that  this\r\n\r\nproblem  does  not exist at all.  If a patient  is  seriously\r\n\r\nill,  whether  or not he has a referral letter by  a  western\r\n\r\ndoctor or a Chinese physician, he would be attended to by the\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Tay Beng Chuan have also asked\r\n\r\nabout   licensing   requirements  to  sell   Chinese   herbs.\r\n\r\nRegulating  sales of Chinese medical products does  not  come\r\n\r\nunder  this Bill.  This comes under the Medicines Act.  Under\r\n\r\nthe Medicines Act, TCM retail shops do not need a licence  to\r\n\r\nsell    approved  TCM  products.   When  Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nconsiders whether a certain TCM product is approved for  sale\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  we are concerned primarily  with  harmful  or\r\n\r\ntoxic  ingredients,  mixing of Chinese  and  Western  medical\r\n\r\ningredients, and excessive claims on the effect.  There  will\r\n\r\nbe  no  change  as  this Bill has no impact on  the  existing\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked about the admission\r\n\r\ncriteria for candidates to be enrolled at training institutes\r\n\r\nfor  TCM  practitioners. This has been set to be the same  as\r\n\r\nentry  requirement to Polytechnics. The institutions training\r\n\r\nthese  TCM  practitioners are generally  satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nquality of  candidates seeking admission to their institutes.\r\n\r\nThe  quality has been going up. Some trainees have university\r\n\r\ndegrees.   I  have  come  across  two  doctors  amongst   the\r\n\r\ntrainees.  They  felt  learning  about  Traditional   Chinese\r\n\r\nMedicine could help in their practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this Bill giving TCM more\r\n\r\nstatus,  I  feel that the quality of trainees going  for  TCM\r\n\r\ncourses   will  get  even  better.  But  we  cannot   achieve\r\n\r\neverything all at once.  The TCM training course duration has\r\n\r\nalready been raised from five-year part-time to six-year part-time.   One of the TCM organisations is introducing a  three-\r\n\r\nyear   full-time   course  jointly  with  the   Nanjing   TCM\r\n\r\nUniversity.   These  are all signs of  progress.   With  this\r\n\r\nBill,  I  feel that the progress will be even faster and  TCM\r\n\r\nwill have a better future in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to clarify a point?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he would leave it to the employers to\r\n\r\ndecide   whether  or  not  they  recognise  the  TCM  medical\r\n\r\ncertificate.  Can I ask whether the Government recognises the\r\n\r\nTCM medical certificate?  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsecond  point  is  that there must be a minimum  standard  of\r\n\r\nentry.   At the moment, having heard what he said,  it  seems\r\n\r\nthat  you take in anyone who has some qualifications.  But  I\r\n\r\nfeel that there must be a certain minimum standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not  recognise  an  MC  issued  by  a   TCM\r\n\r\npractitioner.  I  do  not  know when  the  Government  as  an\r\n\r\nemployer will eventually recognise it.  It all depends on how\r\n\r\nthe  TCM  practitioners   raise their  professional  standard\r\n\r\nsufficiently,  to  a  level where we feel  confident  we  can\r\n\r\nconsider  that  particular question.   The  earlier  the  TCM\r\n\r\ncommunity raise their standard, the earlier this question can\r\n\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of minimum entry requirements for\r\n\r\nattending  TCM courses, we now have TCM courses conducted  by\r\n\r\ntwo  of  our biggest TCM organisations.  One is in Chung  Hwa\r\n\r\nFree  Clinic and the other one is in the Public Free  Clinic.\r\n\r\nAfter they have attended a six-year course, the trainees  are\r\n\r\nawarded  diplomas.  Hence it is in order  to  peg  the  entry\r\n\r\nrequirement to be similar to that of the polytechnics,  which\r\n\r\nalso offer diploma courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  has  been  acupuncturing  away  his\r\n\r\npoints.

Because\r\n\r\nthere are likely to be abuses and other related problems, how\r\n\r\nare  these  going  to be dealt with in the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npublic?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Vasoo, you are not seeking\r\n\r\nclarification.

But at the moment, TCM practice  is\r\n\r\nnot  regulated.  So there is really no channel for this  kind\r\n\r\nof  reporting.  But if people are injured because of unlawful\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment, under the current provisions  the  person\r\n\r\nwho  gave  that  treatment can be charged under  the  Medical\r\n\r\nPractitioners Act.  This is the only recourse that they  have\r\n\r\nnow.    When  this  Bill  has  been  passed,  when  the   TCM\r\n\r\nPractitioners'  Board has been set up, there   will  be  more\r\n\r\nrecourse for reporting and investigating abuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Just a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  Going back to the earlier point made  by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, my question  is:  how  is  the  TCM\r\n\r\ninstitute able to draw capable people if the Government  does\r\n\r\nnot take the first step of recognising the qualifications  by\r\n\r\nthe institute?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  there is a big market out there for TCM  treatment.\r\n\r\nThere  are  people  who  just  somehow  prefer  to  see   TCM\r\n\r\npractitioners for certain conditions.  This is  not  confined\r\n\r\nonly  to the older people.  For example, I know young  people\r\n\r\nwho  injured  themselves while playing golf telling  me  that\r\n\r\nthey  go  for  acupuncture.  Also, because of the  increasing\r\n\r\npopularity  of TCM treatment even in western countries,  some\r\n\r\nof  our  people  are beginning to feel that  TCM  is  a  good\r\n\r\nalternative form of medicine. Just imagine there is  no  need\r\n\r\nto  take medicine, just go for tui na and acupuncture.  There\r\n\r\nare  people who prefer that.  So there is really a market for\r\n\r\nTCM  treatment, notwithstanding the fact that  their  Medical\r\n\r\nCertificates are not recognised by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first\r\n\r\nof  all,  I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary's\r\n\r\npositive replies  to the points raised by us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Government's unwillingness to\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  MCs and receipts issued by TCM practitioners,\r\n\r\nwhat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nif  these  receipts  are accepted by  the  employers  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  for  reimbursement  of  medical  fees?

On the other hand, if these  MCs\r\n\r\nand receipts are not recognised,  the practice and future  of\r\n\r\nthe  TCM practitioners will be affected,  and it will  affect\r\n\r\nthe  patients too.  People may not want to join the  rank  of\r\n\r\nthe TCM practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will seriously reconsider the\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, whether\r\n\r\nthe employers recognise TCM  MCs or whether patients want  to\r\n\r\nsee  the  TCM  practitioners would depend very  much  on  the\r\n\r\npractitioners  themselves. If they continuously  raise  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of  practice,  the issue  of  recognition  will  be\r\n\r\nresolved as a matter of time.  I understand the aspiration of\r\n\r\nthe  TCM  practitioners that the Government and the employers\r\n\r\nwill  recognise  their receipts and Medical  Certificates.

Harmonizing\r\n\r\nfamily  and  work is the key to happier families, to  promote\r\n\r\nstable homes and thereby a stronger nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to balance between work and family has become\r\n\r\nan  issue  that concerns everybody and involves equally  both\r\n\r\nthe  fathers and the mothers of our families.  It is no  more\r\n\r\njust  the  concern of fathers alone who used to be  the  main\r\n\r\nproviders  of  families.   Singaporean  women  do  contribute\r\n\r\nsubstantially to our economy considering that  the  share  of\r\n\r\nfemales in the labour force was 42% last year.  Now more than\r\n\r\never,  Sir, women are required to be in partnership with  men\r\n\r\nto bring our economy to new heights.  This partnership should\r\n\r\nembrace  a  wider  field  of various  areas  like  parenting,\r\n\r\nhousehold chores, economic contributions, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining a balance between work and family is also a\r\n\r\ncrucial  factor  in  our  efforts  to  increase  the   \"total\r\n\r\nfertility  rate\"  (TFR) which currently  stands,  Sir,  at  a\r\n\r\ndismal 1.5 for Singapore.  At present, many people lament  on\r\n\r\nthe  lack of time for bigger family due to the need for  both\r\n\r\nparents to work.  Therefore, harmonizing work and family will\r\n\r\ncertainly help address our declining birth rates.  There are,\r\n\r\nof   course,   other  contributory  factors,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nexpectations  of parents and their ability to  better  juggle\r\n\r\nand manage their time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that in Italy and Spain, where\r\n\r\ntraditional gender expectations are similar to Singapore, the\r\n\r\nfertility\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrates  were  1.2  and 1.4 respectively.   In  these  southern\r\n\r\ncountries  of  Europe,  most  childcare  is  still   arranged\r\n\r\nprivately  (grandmothers take care of children while  parents\r\n\r\nare  at work and fathers do not look after children at  all).\r\n\r\nThere is this common expectation that parenting and household\r\n\r\nchores  are  the responsibility of the women.  Sir,  this  is\r\n\r\nalso  the  kind of stereotyped mindset that has been impinged\r\n\r\non  us for decades and is a major stumbling block, apart from\r\n\r\nother  factors, for our present predicament.  It is necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the socio-cultural attitude in Singapore to change  with\r\n\r\nregard to gender acceptance.  Men have to reconsider the role\r\n\r\nthey  must  assume in the Singaporean households.   Are  they\r\n\r\ncontributing to lighten the load of motherhood?  Are  fathers\r\n\r\nstill  clinging on to the cultures that foster the  image  of\r\n\r\nbeing  not  manly to do \"women's work\"?  Are they having  the\r\n\r\n\"hands-off   attitude\"  with  regard  to  child-rearing   and\r\n\r\nhousehold  chores?  Sir, these old mindsets must go  so  that\r\n\r\nour womenfolk would become more willing to have more children\r\n\r\nknowing that they can have the support of their husbands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Set up comprehensive formulation and implementation of policies including positive actions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the northern European countries, government\r\n\r\nhandouts  and support have helped ease the burden of  raising\r\n\r\nchildren.  Denmark has a \"total fertility rate\" of 1.7, which\r\n\r\nis  relatively higher compared to, say, Italy with a  TFR  of\r\n\r\n1.2.   Sir,  the level of childcare facilities  and  parental\r\n\r\nbenefits  seems  to  make  a  significant  difference.   Most\r\n\r\ncountries  on the southern rim of Europe, such as  Italy  and\r\n\r\nSpain,  have  some of the lowest TFR on the  continent.   The\r\n\r\ngovernments there provide much less child-related  allowances\r\n\r\nthan  the  Nordic countries.  These northern  countries  have\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  highest fertility rates  in  Europe  and  this\r\n\r\ndespite the fact that the proportion of women in their labour\r\n\r\nforce  is  also  among the highest.  Childcare  services  are\r\n\r\nwidely  available and are subsidised up to 85% in some cases.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the labour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarkets  in  the northern European countries are a  lot  more\r\n\r\nflexible  than  in the rest of the region.   Part-time  jobs,\r\n\r\nflexible  working  hours and tele-working are  not  uncommon.\r\n\r\nFinancial support, in the form of birth and child allowances,\r\n\r\nis  provided and, in certain cases, up to the time the  child\r\n\r\nreaches  adulthood.   It would appear  that  the  higher  TFR\r\n\r\nresulted from a more conducive environment for adults to have\r\n\r\nchildren  without  giving up or losing  their  jobs.   Labour\r\n\r\nforce  incentives are more important than monetary incentives\r\n\r\nin their case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the announcement by Prime Minister Goh\r\n\r\non  baby bonuses, maternity leave for third child and setting\r\n\r\nup of a Ministerial Committee to study declining fertility is\r\n\r\na good and welcome start.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the incentives in monetary terms may make a\r\n\r\nbigger  difference to those in the lower income families  and\r\n\r\nnot  the  better-off families who will look beyond the  money\r\n\r\nincentives   and  look  at  childcare  options,   \"stressful\"\r\n\r\neducation,  career  attainment  and  burden-free  lifestyles.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, administrative and workplace measures  are  the\r\n\r\nmain  concerns of many higher-income earners.  Incentives  on\r\n\r\ngetting  employers  to provide practices  that  help  workers\r\n\r\nharmonise  work  and family will be useful.  Incentives  that\r\n\r\nencourage  companies to follow pro-family policies for  their\r\n\r\nworkers,  especially for those with young families should  be\r\n\r\noffered.  Perhaps, for a start, we may look at the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. There must be a change in the mindset of those\r\n\r\nemployers who prefer employees with no family commitments  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  hiring  and  job  promotion,  and  so  on.    Some\r\n\r\nincentives  and  campaigns are certainly needed,  indeed,  in\r\n\r\nthis area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Incentives for big companies to set up their own\r\n\r\nchildcare centres will ease many parents with the convenience\r\n\r\nof  having  their children at or near their workplace.   This\r\n\r\nwill  benefit  the  working parents as they can  conveniently\r\n\r\ndeposit  and  pick up their children as well  as  visit  them\r\n\r\nduring tea breaks or at lunch time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Our Government should consider providing free\r\n\r\nmedical treatment for our pre-school children.  The Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  spends  only about 1.1%  of  GDP  on  healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis,  Sir, is one of the lowest in a developed country where\r\n\r\nthe  usual average is about 5% to 7%.  The healthcare  burden\r\n\r\non  the  people is high in Singapore.  The public  healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  1.1%  of  GDP  and  the  private  healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is 2% of GDP or twice the amount  spent  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   This  contrasts  significantly  with  that   in\r\n\r\nEngland  where  the  private share  is  only  one  sixth,  in\r\n\r\nAustralia where the private share is only half, and  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and Malaysia where the ratio is roughly one to one.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  it  is,  hence, reasonable to urge  our  Government  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the   spending  on  public  healthcare   for   all\r\n\r\nSingaporean  children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Housing is an important consideration to most\r\n\r\npeople.   The  incentive given to help a young couple  own  a\r\n\r\nflat  is welcome indeed.  More help should be given to  those\r\n\r\ncouples  who prefer to rent flats instead, for a  variety  of\r\n\r\nreasons.   In  my meet-the-people sessions, I  have,  many  a\r\n\r\ntime, found it necessary to sympathise with some constituents\r\n\r\nwho  needed  rental flats badly due to overcrowding.   Often,\r\n\r\nthey  were  sharing two-room or three-room flats  with  other\r\n\r\nmembers  of their families.  Worse still, some had their  own\r\n\r\nbabies coming on the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Promote family-friendly work environment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the United States has never tried shaping the birth\r\n\r\nrate or pushing any population policy, yet its fertility rate\r\n\r\nof  2.1  is  the  highest  for the industrialised  countries.\r\n\r\nWhilst  immigration  is an important contributory  factor,  a\r\n\r\nmajor  difference is made by the US workforce  that  is  more\r\n\r\nfamily-friendly  now and is a source of support  for  working\r\n\r\nparents with children.  The US has accommodated the need  for\r\n\r\ntwo-earner  families better than many European  countries  in\r\n\r\nvarious ways.  Companies offer wide-ranging creative services\r\n\r\nfrom  childcare  to shoe repair, from paternity  leave  to  a\r\n\r\ncafeteria that prepares take-home meals.  The \"Working\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMother\"  magazine releases an annual ranking of the  top  100\r\n\r\ncompanies  for working mums, and companies like to  highlight\r\n\r\nthat inclusion in this special list.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a company's bottom-line need not be affected just\r\n\r\nbecause  money is spent on family-friendly practices.   After\r\n\r\nall, its money-making ability depends, to a large extent,  on\r\n\r\nthe  well-being  of  its staff.  The  personal  life  of  its\r\n\r\nemployees can have a major impact on a company's performance.\r\n\r\nEmployers  who give their employees flexibility in  balancing\r\n\r\ntheir  work and personal lives will actually see an  increase\r\n\r\nin  profits.   I  read in the Straits Times  that  the  First\r\n\r\nTennessee  Bank  in  the United States which  had  taken  the\r\n\r\nfamily-friendly  route,  saw  a  7%  increase   in   customer\r\n\r\nretention and a US$106 million increase in profits, two years\r\n\r\nafter doing so.  Employees who have work-family conflicts are\r\n\r\nthree  times more likely to think about quitting their  jobs.\r\n\r\nIn  contrast,  employees who have supportive  workplace  have\r\n\r\ngreater job satisfaction and are more willing to put in extra\r\n\r\neffort  to  help  the company succeed.  Sir, the  Government,\r\n\r\nbeing   the   largest  employer  in  Singapore,   should   be\r\n\r\nchampioning a family-friendly civil service and must take the\r\n\r\nlead in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Facilitate women to participate in the workforce through flexible work arrangements like part-time work, flexi-time work, tele-work, and so on</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility in work arrangements must become more\r\n\r\naccepted  by  companies.  The concept must be  such  that  an\r\n\r\nemployee may work non-normal hours so long as productivity is\r\n\r\nnot  compromised despite the unusual arrangements.  I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  some  of our Government Ministries have just started  a\r\n\r\npilot  scheme  of having extended public service  hours  that\r\n\r\nwill  result  in staff having Saturdays off on  a  rotational\r\n\r\nbasis.   I  hope this scheme will be extended to  all  public\r\n\r\nservices in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir, rotation between the staff to\r\n\r\nwork  certain time slots is possible and can enhance  quality\r\n\r\nof life.  With such flexi-time work, parents may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen  opt for certain \"off-duty\" time slots to coincide  with\r\n\r\ntheir children's extra curricular activities, and so on.  The\r\n\r\nopportunity for such interaction and contact with children is\r\n\r\nimportant; the prospect of more leisure time is an adjunct of\r\n\r\na developed economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tele-working is well suited to women with young\r\n\r\nchildren.  More such jobs should be made available  to  them.\r\n\r\nEmployers must trust that work can also be done without staff\r\n\r\nat their seats within certain set hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time workers should be reimbursed on their CPF and\r\n\r\nmedical benefits as for full-time workers.  Also, many  part-time  workers do not get the same career advancement  as  for\r\n\r\nfull-time  workers.  Contract workers, likewise, should  have\r\n\r\ntheir lot enhanced.  They should be provided adequate \"safety\r\n\r\nnet\" benefits.  Perhaps, the Government would look into these\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore is a fast ageing society with a\r\n\r\ndecreasing  working  to  non-working  ratio,  the  need   for\r\n\r\nflexibility  in work arrangement is destined  to  stay.   The\r\n\r\ntrend, in the not too distant future, will be for more people\r\n\r\nto  require time off to look after their aged parents.  Thus,\r\n\r\npro-family  policies at work should encompass the  employee's\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards their aged parents as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improve our childcare facilities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is still short of childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.   MCDS  is  planning  to  increase  the  number   of\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres by 25% to 58,000 within three  years  from\r\n\r\nthe present 46,000 places.  We should use this opportunity to\r\n\r\nbetter  plan  the  childcare centres.  And, besides  numbers,\r\n\r\nbetter  childcare  centres should be provided  for  certified\r\n\r\nprofessionals and dedicated staff will give peace of mind  to\r\n\r\nparents  who  now want professional care for their  children.\r\n\r\nEnhancement of childcare facilities, such as more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprecinct-based   childcare  centres,  developing   \"borrow-a-granny\"  and  \"share-a-maid\" schemes, and so  on,  should  be\r\n\r\nfurther facilitated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have the childcare centres evenly distributed\r\n\r\nthroughout the island.  In the newer HDB estates, where there\r\n\r\nare  more  young children, there is a need for  such  centres\r\n\r\nmore urgently and in larger numbers.  Cooperation between the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  VWOs and private organisations is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nestablish and allocate childcare centres.  The aim should  be\r\n\r\nto  have  the  centres conveniently located  in  relation  to\r\n\r\neither the home or the workplace.  This, in effect, calls for\r\n\r\nemployers  to  consider providing childcare  centres  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   In  this respect, Sir, I would like  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  our  Government help private organisations in terms  of\r\n\r\ngrants towards this cause.  Realising that land cost will  be\r\n\r\na major burden for most operators, it may be worth looking at\r\n\r\nways  to  alleviate  this  to  ensure  these  centres  remain\r\n\r\naffordable.  Childcare centres should be provided for private\r\n\r\ndwellers  as well.  There are many young families buying  and\r\n\r\nmoving  into  new  condominiums in areas  with  no  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres nearby.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of childcare centres that cater to children\r\n\r\nbelow  18  months of age should be increased, as there  is  a\r\n\r\ndire  shortage of them.  At the moment, there are only  three\r\n\r\nsuch  centres  catering to a mere 44 babies,  against  40,000\r\n\r\nannual births.  I understand that it is difficult to run such\r\n\r\ncentres and that this could be due to difficulties in  hiring\r\n\r\nsuitable     care-givers,    including    nurses,     greater\r\n\r\nresponsibility with children that are young, intensive labour\r\n\r\nforce in terms of carer-to-children ratio, and susceptibility\r\n\r\nof  young  children to sickness.  MCDS should look  to  solve\r\n\r\nsome   of   these   difficulties   and   facilitate   private\r\n\r\norganisations  to  run such centres more  willingly.   For  a\r\n\r\nstart, the enlistment of retired elderly to care for children\r\n\r\nmay work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should allow the agencies to provide part-time maids to fill certain situations. There are families\r\n\r\nwho\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot afford to have full-time maids, but will benefit  from\r\n\r\nseveral  hours  of  help  per  week  from  part-time  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  maids.   Also  ad-hoc child-minders,  as  and  when\r\n\r\ncircumstances  arise, will be useful, for  example,  to  mind\r\n\r\nchildren who are ill and cannot attend childcare centres  and\r\n\r\nwhose  parents cannot take emergency leave and so  on.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  recent  shutdown of childcare centres due to  the  hand,\r\n\r\nfoot  and  mouth disease is a good example where this  scheme\r\n\r\nwould have served very well.  This would be especially so for\r\n\r\nthose  parents  who did not have relatives  and  friends  who\r\n\r\ncould   mind   their  children  for  about  10   days.    The\r\n\r\ninconvenience  and economic loss would have been  substantial\r\n\r\nas  it  involves  about  140,000 children  in  557  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  and 440 kindergartens, if a majority of the  parents\r\n\r\ncannot go to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhance Family Ties and Obligations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to inspire the young with a deeper sense\r\n\r\nof  individual  responsibility  towards  the  family.   Basic\r\n\r\nsocial  etiquette and interpersonal skills should  be  taught\r\n\r\nand  promoted.   This  will lead to our  young  being  better\r\n\r\nequipped  with  skills  in  handling  boy-girl  relationship,\r\n\r\nmarriage  and  parental  responsibility,  and  so  on.   Such\r\n\r\n\"values\"  transmission  can  be  done  through  teachers   in\r\n\r\nschools,   through   some   sort  of  parent-school-community\r\n\r\npartnership,  through  religious and  community  groups,  and\r\n\r\nthrough the media.  The Ministry of Education and Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development and Sports should look at these  issues\r\n\r\nand be facilitative in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, the father had been the sole breadwinner\r\n\r\nand  the distant disciplinarian while mother was the nurturer\r\n\r\nand  homemaker.   In  the present dual-income  family,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a shift towards this perception of the  roles  of\r\n\r\nfathers and mothers.  Parenting and homemaker tasks should be\r\n\r\nshared  between  spouses.  The joy of  bringing  up  children\r\n\r\nshould  be  shared  and experienced by both  parents.   Women\r\n\r\nwhose husbands do not help out with childrearing and domestic\r\n\r\nchores   are  more  stressed  out.   Research  into   marital\r\n\r\nsatisfaction among Singaporean women\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshowed  a  direct correlation between stress levels in  women\r\n\r\nand the amount of help they get at home.  Sir, many Singapore\r\n\r\nmen  want  to  be  better  fathers  and  husbands,  but  face\r\n\r\nconstraints  due to pressure at work and the  lack  of  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is timely to look towards a family-orientated\r\n\r\nsociety, with priority given to family needs.  I am glad that\r\n\r\nour  Government  has  recognised the  partnership  of  child-bearing  and  homemaking by granting paternity  leave.   More\r\n\r\neffort  should  be  spent  in  this  area,  such  as  further\r\n\r\nincentives and campaign to change the stereotyped mindset  of\r\n\r\nmany  men  regarding parenting and household  responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should take the lead in changing the  mindset\r\n\r\nof  fathers  and  encouraging them to be  equal  partners  in\r\n\r\nraising families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening family ties, better bonding with extended\r\n\r\nfamilies  and  neighbourliness are areas  worth  cultivating.\r\n\r\nCommunity-based organisations should organise more activities\r\n\r\nin  grassroots programmes to promote these virtues.  Our CCC,\r\n\r\nCCMC,  CDC and Town Councils can be active partners too.   As\r\n\r\nthe  trend is for Singapore families to get smaller, extended\r\n\r\nfamilies will not be the norm soon.  And since they  are  all\r\n\r\nworking,  many  will  become too busy  for  interaction  with\r\n\r\nfamilies and friends.  Such a trend, Sir, is bad and must  be\r\n\r\naddressed.  It is disturbing to know that quite a  number  of\r\n\r\ncouples  did not have anybody to fall back on to  mind  their\r\n\r\nchildren when childcare centres and kindergartens were closed\r\n\r\nduring the recent hand, foot and mouth disease epidemic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Address the Stress of Education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study by Dr Stella Quah of the National University\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  on  the Singapore Family, revealed  that  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  worry for about 45% of them came from the  problems\r\n\r\nassociated  with  their  children's  education.   Singaporean\r\n\r\nparents  have also frequently mentioned children's  education\r\n\r\nas the contributory factor in opting for smaller families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I doubt many will fault our education system in\r\n\r\nterms of first-rate facilities,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  terms of fantastic academic results, and even in terms of\r\n\r\nfree  and  fair  opportunities for  all  our  children.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment and educators spare no effort in trying to let our\r\n\r\nyoung have the best.  We should all be glad.  But we moan and\r\n\r\nwe  are disgruntled and dissatisfied.  And we tell the  world\r\n\r\nand  allow the world to tell us how stressed we are from  the\r\n\r\neducation of our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contend, Sir, that some of the problems may have to do\r\n\r\nwith  our mindset on \"success\" and \"competition for success\".\r\n\r\nThe  \"comparing\" nature is something that has been encouraged\r\n\r\nin  all  of us because we have been trained to strive  to  be\r\n\r\nbetter  than others, and there is no clear level when  enough\r\n\r\nis  enough.  We are a success-orientated nation.  It is  only\r\n\r\nnatural  for parents to want success and the best  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  Having the drive for success and for betterment is\r\n\r\nnot a bad thing at all.  But when such urge becomes excessive\r\n\r\nand  begins to look like a survival prerequisite, then it  is\r\n\r\nnot  good.  Parents should be supportive and encourage  their\r\n\r\nchildren  in their education, and they should not push  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  beyond  limits of the children's  capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis  will cause unnecessary \"stress\" to themselves and their\r\n\r\nchildren.   Mr Speaker, Sir, not all our children can  go  to\r\n\r\nuniversity but the support should be to maximise each child's\r\n\r\npotential,  whatever it may be.  Success may not  necessarily\r\n\r\ncome  from  highest education alone.  Note that our homegrown\r\n\r\nand  remarkably  successful businessman,  Mr  Sim  Wong  Hoo,\r\n\r\ngraduated from the polytechnic and not the university.  We do\r\n\r\nhave  to  try to convince Singaporeans that success does  not\r\n\r\ncome  from highest education alone.  The Government must also\r\n\r\nshow the example by not selecting and promoting people in the\r\n\r\ncivil service with highest academic qualifications alone  but\r\n\r\nalso with other and different criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, 2,358 new cases of children aged below 18 were\r\n\r\nregistered at Government psychiatric clinics.  In almost  95%\r\n\r\nof  the  cases,  the children were not mad;  they  were  just\r\n\r\nstressed out.  Half of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese  cases  were  children from primary schools,  35%  from\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  and  15% were pre-schoolers.   Stress  at\r\n\r\nschool  was  mentioned  as one of the  reasons  for  becoming\r\n\r\ndepressed.   My  view is for teachers not to overload  pupils\r\n\r\nunnecessarily with homework and tests.  Syllabus needs to  be\r\n\r\nrevamped  to  make it less demanding so that the teacher  can\r\n\r\ncomplete  it  and the students can understand what  has  been\r\n\r\ntaught.  For the above-average students, there is always  the\r\n\r\noption for them to be given more challenging \"add-ons\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our school system so inadequate, Sir, that many\r\n\r\nparents  turn  to private tuition for their  children?   Many\r\n\r\nfrom the lower-income group cannot afford this and often feel\r\n\r\npressured for being unable to give their children the  \"best\"\r\n\r\nthrough   private  tuition.   Personal  coaching   is   often\r\n\r\nimpossible because they hold full-time jobs.  Moreover,  much\r\n\r\nof  the  syllabus is beyond them anyway; this would  be  even\r\n\r\nmore  so for the lesser-educated parents.  It will be a  good\r\n\r\nidea  if  our  schools can provide the same sort of  tutorial\r\n\r\nclasses  after  normal  school  hours,  not  for  giving  the\r\n\r\nchildren  extra  work but for helping them  cope  with  their\r\n\r\n\"homework\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as helping parents with school-going kids\r\n\r\nbalance  work  and  family commitments, we  may  perhaps  try\r\n\r\nmatching  work hours with school hours.  Sir,  since  we  are\r\n\r\ntending  towards  single-session schools,  we  can  have  the\r\n\r\nchildren  stay  back in the school to do their \"homework\"  or\r\n\r\nhave  \"remedials\"  while their parents  are  still  at  work.\r\n\r\nAnother  way to help parents, especially working parents,  is\r\n\r\nto  organise  the  extra-curricular pursuits,  like  learning\r\n\r\ndrama,  piano, ballet and so on, collectively in the  schools\r\n\r\nafter  classes.  This will save parents having to ferry their\r\n\r\nchildren  to and from different places for these hobbies.   I\r\n\r\ncan  see such a system helping Singaporean parents save  much\r\n\r\ntime,  effort  and  money.   Let us  make  our  schools  more\r\n\r\nholistic and comprehensive in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the issue of schooling hours, I submit that\r\n\r\nthe starting times are far too\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearly at the moment.  This is especially so if a child is not\r\n\r\nin  a  neighbourhood school, because the average journey from\r\n\r\nhome can easily take 45 minutes.  It is a common sight to see\r\n\r\nmany  school children at bus interchanges all over the island\r\n\r\nat  around  6.20  in the morning.  These children  and  their\r\n\r\nparents have to get up very early indeed.  Many of them  have\r\n\r\nless than the eight hours of sleep that is needed, especially\r\n\r\nfor  children.  With the need to revise their schoolwork,  do\r\n\r\nhomework  and projects, participate in ECAs, go for  tuition,\r\n\r\nand  so  on, there is indeed a lot for the children  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  in a day.  On top of this, the parents have to rush  to\r\n\r\nwork,  bring  kids to the childcare centres or  grandparents,\r\n\r\netc, all within that same time-frame.  Pre-school children or\r\n\r\nbabies  may have to be woken up, sometimes in the wee  hours,\r\n\r\nto  fit  around  their older siblings'  schedules.   Sir,  we\r\n\r\nshould  aim  for  schooling hours to start  at  8.30  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning.   Most  schools in the Western world  start  anytime\r\n\r\nfrom 8.30 to 9.00 in the morning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been too much emphasis on academic achievement\r\n\r\nand  examination-based  orientation  in  our  school  system.\r\n\r\nThere  is  this  concern that children are only  \"exam-smart\"\r\n\r\nand,  rather than a really well-rounded education, a  lot  of\r\n\r\nemphasis  is  given towards passing examinations and  scoring\r\n\r\nA's.   This will not hold well in the new economy.   A  well-rounded child may not be exam-smart, scoring straight A's and\r\n\r\nall,  but  may be able to think creatively and have a  higher\r\n\r\nEQ.   The  Government  has  recognised  that  creativity   is\r\n\r\nimportant and the old way of rote learning is out.   But  can\r\n\r\nwe  really  grade critical and creative thinking?  And,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhow  do  we  transit  into the new way?  Are  there  existing\r\n\r\npolicies that impede this transition?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for the ranking of schools may have to be\r\n\r\nexpanded to lessen the emphasis on academic achievements  and\r\n\r\ngrade  scores.   More weightage should be  on  other  markers\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  the  present times; thus, ranking  should  take\r\n\r\nattainments  in  developing  the potentials  of  students  in\r\n\r\ninformation   technology,   sports   and   the   arts    into\r\n\r\nconsideration.  This will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nease  a  lot  of  the  pressures  on  students,  parents  and\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents have expressed their concerns on streaming\r\n\r\nof  children  at  Primary 4.  They still  perceive  that  EM1\r\n\r\nstudents will have better peers and teachers, when, in  fact,\r\n\r\nit  may not be the case since the difference lies only in the\r\n\r\nmother  tongue sessions that the students attend.   Now  that\r\n\r\nthe  requirements  for mother tongue have  been  relaxed  for\r\n\r\nuniversity  entry, parents should be reassured on the  nature\r\n\r\nof  streaming at Primary 4.  It is unfortunate that,  in  any\r\n\r\nyear,  there  is  also some sort of banding of  the  students\r\n\r\ninvolved in Primary 4.  However, banding students has been in\r\n\r\npractice  for decades and is something parents have accepted.\r\n\r\nIt  would  be  worthwhile for the Ministry of  Education  and\r\n\r\nschools to put in more effort to better inform the parents on\r\n\r\nthis issue to alleviate the stress associated with this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having flexibility in varsity-entry criteria will ease\r\n\r\nthe  stress from many students and parents.  Parents can then\r\n\r\nbe  at  ease  to  allow their children to develop  their  own\r\n\r\nunique  potential  though it may not  conform  to  the  norm.\r\n\r\nUniversities should not be too fixated on accepting  students\r\n\r\nwith   a  string  of  straight  A's.   Recently,  a  visiting\r\n\r\nmolecular geneticist, Professor Tsui Lap Chee, said  that  he\r\n\r\nhimself  did  not  qualify  for  the  university.    He   did\r\n\r\nbrilliantly in biology, but merely passed his other subjects.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the Department of Biology's head at the  Chinese\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Hong Kong was so impressed with  his  biology\r\n\r\ngrades  that he persuaded the University to make an exception\r\n\r\nin  his  case.  If the University had not bent the rules,  he\r\n\r\nwould not be where he is today - a world-renowned pioneer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhance fertility, childbearing and family bonding</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general tendency for the younger people in\r\n\r\nour workforce to put off courtship, marriage and childbearing\r\n\r\nto  very much later in their lives.  Often times, the reasons\r\n\r\nfor  this  trend has to do with the ability to  balance  work\r\n\r\ncommitments with other aspirations in life.  There are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunfortunate  consequences when the pressure to succeed  first\r\n\r\nat  work leads to late marriage and childbearing.  Hence,  in\r\n\r\nour  efforts to address the balance between work  and  family\r\n\r\ncommitments,  we  have  to look at alleviating  some  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems facing us concerning procreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the following are some aspects worth our\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Help the subfertile</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chances that a fertile couple would need more than a\r\n\r\nyear  to produce a child doubles from 8% when the man was  25\r\n\r\nyears old to 15% when he was over 35.  If our men do not make\r\n\r\nan  effort to date, to get married, to go back early to spend\r\n\r\ntime  with their wives and their children, how do we  achieve\r\n\r\nour   ideal  families?  The  prevalence  of  infertility   in\r\n\r\nSingapore is about 10% of married couples, of which  the  men\r\n\r\nconstitute  about 30% to 40% of the contributory factor.  The\r\n\r\nfemale is responsible for about 40% to 50%. The remaining 10%\r\n\r\nto 30% may be idiopathic or caused by contributing factors in\r\n\r\nboth  partners. Therefore, let us address this sad  issue  at\r\n\r\nboth  genders  from the outset. These 10% of married  couples\r\n\r\noften  have  to  endure  tremendous physical,  emotional  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  hardships.  Sir, I feel that these couples  should\r\n\r\nbe  helped  as  fertility  medical  treatment  can  be  time-consuming  and very expensive. The Medisave withdrawal  limit\r\n\r\nfor  the  most  costly  procedure, intro-vitro  fertilisation\r\n\r\n(IVF),  should be reviewed. The current withdrawal  limit  of\r\n\r\n$2,000  per  treatment cycle up to a maximum of three  cycles\r\n\r\nper   patient  for  a  procedure  costing  near  $10,000  per\r\n\r\ntreatment  cycle  is  far  too low.  Our  adoption  procedure\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  less  onerous to enable  couples  to  adopt\r\n\r\nchildren.  There  are  many cases where,  despite  exhaustive\r\n\r\ntreatment,  couples may still not be able  to  conceive.  For\r\n\r\nthem, adoption is an option and they should be assisted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Encourage earlier childbearing</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity and promotion of early childbearing age should\r\n\r\nbe done extensively\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  educate  the  public  on  the  medical  disadvantages  of\r\n\r\npregnancy in older women.  In Singapore, 16.8% of pregnancies\r\n\r\ninvolve  older  women. This figure far exceeds the  developed\r\n\r\nworld's  average of 8%.  Here, an average of 17 out of  every\r\n\r\n100  women  who give birth is above the age of 35.  Pregnancy\r\n\r\nin  older  women carries increased risks for mums and  babes.\r\n\r\nThese  include  miscarriages,  pregnancy  complications   and\r\n\r\ncomplicated  deliveries.  There is also  a  higher  risk  for\r\n\r\nchromosomal  abnormalities, the most common one being  Down's\r\n\r\nsyndrome.  For women aged 25 and below, the chances  are  one\r\n\r\nin  800, but by the age of 40, the rate increases to  one  in\r\n\r\n63.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced pro-family practices</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancing practices that will promote family unity and\r\n\r\nprocreation  is  necessary.  For  instance,  the  option  for\r\n\r\nmothers  to  have  extended unpaid  maternity  leave,  whilst\r\n\r\navailable,  is not widely accepted. This common  practice  in\r\n\r\nboth  the public and private sectors in the western countries\r\n\r\nand  in Australia allows for working mothers to extend  their\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave by up to six months.  Mothers get  to  spend\r\n\r\nmore  time with their babies during the post-delivery period,\r\n\r\na  time  which  is  crucial for mother-baby  bonding  and  is\r\n\r\ncertainly a pro-family ideal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expand avenues for courtship and marriage</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One in three Singapore adults in their early 30s is\r\n\r\nstill single. And 16.5% of them remain single well into their\r\n\r\n40s,  compared to just one in 10 in 1990.  According  to  the\r\n\r\n<br><br>2000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Census,  27% of men in their late 30s  were  unmarried,\r\n\r\nwhile  18.5% of women in this age group were single.   Unlike\r\n\r\nsingle  women, many of whom are graduates, two-fifths of  the\r\n\r\nover  77,000 single men above 35 have secondary education  or\r\n\r\nless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Development Unit (SDU) was set up in 1984 by\r\n\r\nthe People's Association to promote marriage among graduates.\r\n\r\nSince  then, 21,400 SDU members have got married. The  Social\r\n\r\nDevelopment Service (SDS) was set up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin 1985 to create opportunities for non-university graduates.\r\n\r\nSince then, 87,000 SDS members had married.  SDU and SDS have\r\n\r\ndone  well  and should be further supported to  expand  their\r\n\r\nroles to achieve higher targets.  In today's context of  busy\r\n\r\nschedules  and less time to meet and to court,  more  avenues\r\n\r\nfor people to interact are essential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One in five single British men and women is turning to\r\n\r\ndating   agencies  and  personal  advertisements   to   start\r\n\r\nrelationship, confirming a trend researchers have found  that\r\n\r\nmodern  lifestyle  and  job demands are  killing  traditional\r\n\r\ncourtship.  Facilitating  and  providing  avenues  for  young\r\n\r\npeople   to  come  together  in  the  schools,  polytechnics,\r\n\r\nuniversities and community centres and so on will  give  them\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to  intermingle  with  peers  within  their\r\n\r\ncohorts.   This opportunity may not be there once they  start\r\n\r\ntheir  working  life.  Credible websites  run  by  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  or  reputable  private  organisations  that  ensure\r\n\r\ncorrect  and certified data of individuals will be useful.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that, in the IT era, this channel will prove  to  be\r\n\r\nthe  preferred choice for many of our IT-savvy and busy young\r\n\r\npeople to acquaint and befriend each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, should spearhead more social-support factors. I am of the opinion that encouraging\r\n\r\nmarriages  with financial enticements would  not  be  a  good\r\n\r\nidea.  This  is  in  contrast with the  case  of  encouraging\r\n\r\ncouples  to  have bigger families with financial  incentives.\r\n\r\nParents  and  young people should abandon  the  mindset  that\r\n\r\nstudents should not court until they have graduated  and  are\r\n\r\nestablished  in  their careers because by  then,  it  becomes\r\n\r\nincreasingly difficult to meet and to start courting.   Young\r\n\r\npeople would be well-advised to be responsible adults who are\r\n\r\naccountable in relationship, responsible towards  each  other\r\n\r\nand  sensible  in  pursuing  studies  simultaneously  with  a\r\n\r\nrelationship without jeopardizing one for the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, no Government can dictate people to\r\n\r\nget married or to have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  children.  Our Government, however, can facilitate  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  fulfill their family wishes and one of  the  best\r\n\r\nways to do this is through helping them to harmonise work and\r\n\r\nfamily.  While the Government can make it more conducive  for\r\n\r\npeople  to get married and have bigger families, the eventual\r\n\r\nresult rests on the expectations of parents, their ability to\r\n\r\njuggle and manage time better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crux of the whole issue and the solution lies,\r\n\r\nultimately, in the hands of all Singaporeans themselves. They\r\n\r\nmust  have  the correct attitude towards what  they  want  in\r\n\r\nlife. They must believe that fulfilment in life depends on  a\r\n\r\nbalance between their work responsibilities and their  family\r\n\r\nneeds  rather than a compromise on one for the  other.   This\r\n\r\ninvolves a major change in mindset of  Singaporeans and  this\r\n\r\nHouse  needs  to urge the Government for a positive  move  to\r\n\r\nachieve such a change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for this\r\n\r\nopportunity to speak on this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our children are the future of the nation. They\r\n\r\nare  nurtured  in  the fold of the family. The  family  is  a\r\n\r\npillar  of  the stability of the nation.  There  is  thus  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of the importance of strong families to the  future\r\n\r\nof   Singapore.   Many  factors  make  for  a  happy  family.\r\n\r\nGovernment policies impinge on the family.  I am delighted to\r\n\r\nnote  that  over the years, the Government has  made  visible\r\n\r\nefforts to implement family supportive policies. More can  be\r\n\r\ndone and I am confident that more will be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers from happy families are more productive and I\r\n\r\nurge  all  employers to make the effort to make the workplace\r\n\r\nan  environment friendly to the family. As an  employer,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been responsive to the needs of  the  family,\r\n\r\nintroducing  family-friendly practices and facilities.   Many\r\n\r\ncompanies have also put in efforts and funds to do  so.  They\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngood examples to follow.  I urge the employers to do more and\r\n\r\nothers who have not done so to consider and implement family-friendly practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family members, especially parents, also have a\r\n\r\nmajor role in creating a happy family environment.  I want to\r\n\r\nadd  on  to a point that Dr Lily Neo raised in her address  - stress  caused by the education system.  I believe that  hard\r\n\r\nwork is necessary for success. Children have worked hard  for\r\n\r\ntheir  success.  There  is  no  alternative  even  for  those\r\n\r\nnaturally  endowed.   We  should  not  ask  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation to merely make our education system easier for  our\r\n\r\nstudent for his own sake.  MOE has been reviewing the  system\r\n\r\nto  make  our  system better able to meet the  needs  of  our\r\n\r\nfuture in the new economy. MOE has adapted our system  to  be\r\n\r\nperformance-based, each student to work at  his  or  her  own\r\n\r\npace   and   capability.   We  should  espouse  instead   the\r\n\r\nphilosophy of being the best we can be. Hence, I urge parents\r\n\r\nnot  to  pressurize their children beyond their capabilities.\r\n\r\nThey  should not have unrealistic expectation of them, making\r\n\r\nunrealistic  demand  on  their  capability  and  performance.\r\n\r\nParents  should  thus encourage their children  to  do  their\r\n\r\nbest. We should allow our children their time, their space so\r\n\r\nthat they can have their childhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if every party plays his, her or its part in\r\n\r\npromoting the welfare of the family, I am sure the quality of\r\n\r\nfamily life for our citizens will improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, I rise to support the motion\r\n\r\nstanding in the name of the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC\r\n\r\non family-friendly work practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Prime Minister's speech here in this Chamber\r\n\r\nin October one year ago, on his concern that Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nnot  reproducing  ourselves, increasing  attention  has  been\r\n\r\nturned to the subject, once again, of persuading Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto   increase   their   productivity  from   the   population\r\n\r\nperspective.    Intimately   intertwined   in   the   ensuing\r\n\r\ndiscussions and debate is the subject of the family,  and  of\r\n\r\nthe  stresses on our current day Singaporean families,  which\r\n\r\nsurely impacts on our young couples' decisions on whether  to\r\n\r\nstart  a  family and, in fact, on the size of the  family  to\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen considerable activity over this period with\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of  the  Working Committee  on  Marriage  and\r\n\r\nProcreation,  involving  an  impressive  panel  of  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  the announcement of a Ministerial Committee  to\r\n\r\nbe  led by the Minister without Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon  Heng,\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of  a Work-Life Unit  by  MCDS,  and  yet\r\n\r\nanother  committee on Public Education on the Family, chaired\r\n\r\nby  the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary of MCDS.  In between,\r\n\r\nthere has been a seminar to discuss the preliminary report of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee on the Family, workshops conducted by  invited\r\n\r\nconsultants  on  Work-Life Balance, and the  Family  Friendly\r\n\r\nAwards, a tripartite initiative of SNEF, MCDS and NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this energy and enthusiasm is certainly a good\r\n\r\nstart,  but the concern is that this flurry of activity  gets\r\n\r\ntranslated  into  real,  substantial  and  sustained  effort,\r\n\r\npolicy  reviews and initiatives and programmes for  both  the\r\n\r\nimmediate and the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Government attention on family-friendly and\r\n\r\npro-family work practices, policies and programmes to support\r\n\r\nand  strengthen the family is, to a large extent,  driven  by\r\n\r\nthe baby agenda.  But, in fact, these practices, policies and\r\n\r\nprogrammes are important for far more than just promoting the\r\n\r\nproduction of babies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening the family is intrinsically important in\r\n\r\nitself, especially as we have always held  the family  to  be\r\n\r\nthe basic building block of our society.  Even more so in the\r\n\r\nface of the challenges of the accelerating pace of our modern\r\n\r\nworking environment, coupled with the influences\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat   our   youngsters  are  now  open  to  with  the   easy\r\n\r\naccessibility of information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening existing families is important, even if\r\n\r\nall our efforts do not result in one more couple deciding  to\r\n\r\nhave  one  more  baby.   And,  indeed,  helping  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmaintain   a   balance   between  their   work   and   family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  is  an intrinsic and  essential  factor  in\r\n\r\nachieving  the  quality of life that  we  all  aspire  to  as\r\n\r\ncitizens contributing to a first-world economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same speech last October, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nspoke  of our twin goals of having both a first-world economy\r\n\r\nand a world-class home.  He observed that the goal of a first-world  economy was easier to achieve than that  of  a  world-\r\n\r\nclass  home,  which involves many intangibles and  cannot  be\r\n\r\nmeasured simply by hardware and physical infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that we are still holding on tightly to\r\n\r\nall  our  old assumptions and measures of success that  drive\r\n\r\ntowards  economic  goals, unwilling to explore  shifting  the\r\n\r\nbalance even just a little, afraid to let go, lest the easier\r\n\r\ntangible  goal  slips from our grasp, as  we  reach  for  the\r\n\r\nharder to achieve intangible one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we get to that happy state in Singapore where we can\r\n\r\nhave  a productive, satisfying job that pays reasonably  well\r\n\r\nenough  to maintain a decent standard of living and  yet,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  look forward to the prospect  of  a  family\r\n\r\nalbeit   that  it comes with responsibilities, with  pleasure\r\n\r\nrather than trepidation?  What does it take?  It seems to  me\r\n\r\nit  must  surely have to be a tripartite effort  -  involving\r\n\r\nGovernment, employers and individuals themselves.  All  three\r\n\r\nparties have a role to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start with individuals. What is the individual's\r\n\r\nrole?   It  is certainly essential.  Employers and Government\r\n\r\ncan  and  must support and facilitate through their policies,\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  services, approach, willingness to be  flexible.\r\n\r\nBut  the  individual must also be prepared, firstly, to  make\r\n\r\nhis or her own life choices, for as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsurely  as  death and taxes, you can be sure that it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  have it all.  You have to decide what  is  most\r\n\r\nimportant to you personally, your priorities, and be aware of\r\n\r\nthe implications of your choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At work, in some companies, some family-friendly\r\n\r\nbenefits  may  be  readily available, but many,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose  involving flexible working arrangements, for  example,\r\n\r\nwill often require the employee to also get engaged with  his\r\n\r\nor her supervisor on seeing how to make it work, for both the\r\n\r\nemployee and for the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans sometimes have a tendency to look to some\r\n\r\nhigher  authority,  namely, the Government,  to  solve  their\r\n\r\nproblems for them.  This is particularly likely in situations\r\n\r\nwhere  Government has already signalled that the area is  one\r\n\r\nin  which  it has an interest and a stake in prescribing  the\r\n\r\noutcome.   If  Singaporeans  take  this  attitude   in   this\r\n\r\ninstance,  it will be a sorry situation indeed,  as  it  will\r\n\r\nsurely  make the journey even more arduous and long  and  the\r\n\r\ndestination less certain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the employers' role? Employers need to do more\r\n\r\nthan just pay perfunctory attention and lip service to seeing\r\n\r\nhow  they  can  become family-friendly.  It is  however  much\r\n\r\neasier  said  than done.  It involves a lot  more  than  just\r\n\r\nintroducing   programmes  in  an  ad  hoc  manner.    To   be\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  truly  family-friendly  involves  a  systematic\r\n\r\napproach, from analysing what your own particular profile  of\r\n\r\nemployees  truly  need, through enabling and supporting  your\r\n\r\nmanagers and supervisors in dealing with the flexible working\r\n\r\nrequests  from their subordinates, to achieving all  of  this\r\n\r\nwhile keeping one's cost of operations within reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in truth, in our tight labour market, employers will\r\n\r\nfind,  over time, that they will be under pressure to respond\r\n\r\nto  the  needs  and  wants of a changing and  more  demanding\r\n\r\nworkforce.  So, why not be proactive about it and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nadopt  family-friendliness  as  a  competitive  advantage  in\r\n\r\nrecruitment, motivation and retention of good people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Government's role? Obviously, it is more than\r\n\r\nto  exhort  companies  to be family-friendly  and  to  exhort\r\n\r\nindividuals  -  well,  Government  sends  these  messages  to\r\n\r\nindividuals that convey tremendous expectations.  To  be  the\r\n\r\nbest  workers  in  the world, to continuously  upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills and expertise, to engage in life-long learning, not to\r\n\r\nneglect  their  children,  and  to  provide  care  for  their\r\n\r\nparents, as filial sons and daughters, right up to the end of\r\n\r\ntheir  increasing longer lifespans.  And to do so, if at  all\r\n\r\npossible, without foreign domestic help!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts, to date, to grapple with the many issues\r\n\r\nthat  need to be addressed, have been driven largely by MCDS,\r\n\r\nbut many more Ministries must be engaged.  Otherwise, we will\r\n\r\nnever  get anywhere, because there is no simple magic  bullet\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  solution, but many, many different  things   - policies, programmes, services that impact daily on  all  our\r\n\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, to help companies become more family-friendly, Government's assistance in defraying the cost of\r\n\r\njob  redesign  to  facilitate flexible  working  arrangements\r\n\r\nwould  be most helpful.  It has been suggested that companies\r\n\r\ncould  apply  for such support under the PSB's Work  Redesign\r\n\r\nAssistance  Programmes.   For  this  to  work,  however,  the\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  support  will need to  be  modified  from  the\r\n\r\nrelevant programmes as they currently are.  I do not  believe\r\n\r\nany  progress has been made in this, possibly because it  may\r\n\r\nnot  even be registered onto PSB's list of things to  do,  or\r\n\r\npossibly because PSB's priorities are set by MTI and  not  by\r\n\r\nMCDS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, which I had previously raised with MND\r\n\r\nfor consideration unsuccessfully, is to require developers of\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial complexes above a certain  size  to\r\n\r\nput  aside space for child or dependant care centres, and  to\r\n\r\nexempt  this  space from the calculation of plot  ratios,  so\r\n\r\nthat  near-site childcare centres could be available  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  companies  located  in  these  complexes.   The\r\n\r\nMinister, in his answer, had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaid that Government did not wish to compel developers to  do\r\n\r\nthis.   It would leave it to the companies themselves.  Well,\r\n\r\nwe  all  know,  when this Government believes that  something\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  done, it has never before had any  compunction\r\n\r\nabout acting on its beliefs.  In this instance, I would  say,\r\n\r\nokay,  do not compel them, but allow the exemption from  plot\r\n\r\nratio calculations for such centres.  And I dare say some may\r\n\r\nindeed take up the opportunity to plan accordingly, because I\r\n\r\ndo  believe  that this may, in fact, be a selling feature  of\r\n\r\nthe  development.  But for this to happen, the exemption must\r\n\r\ncome first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, here is another Ministry - MND - that\r\n\r\ncould  and  should  be  applying  its  thoughts  on  how   to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to this effort to promote pro-family  or  family-friendly facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that possibly the conviction is not quite\r\n\r\nthere  in  this effort.  And possibly the conviction  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  there  because  we  are still,  all  this  time,  just\r\n\r\nscratching at the surface, looking for the easy quick  fixes,\r\n\r\nambivalent about what is truly important to us, and  avoiding\r\n\r\nsome  real soul searching, including relooking at the  sacred\r\n\r\ncows  comfortably ensconced  on the altar of the  first-world\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prioritise between being the best workers in\r\n\r\nthe  world  and  putting much more attention to strengthening\r\n\r\nour  families?   Do we truly believe mothers  should  be  out\r\n\r\ncontributing to the economy or at home rearing the kids?   Do\r\n\r\nwe  have  a choice?  Do they have a choice?  We hesitate  and\r\n\r\nthat is why up to now, we are still ambivalent about actively\r\n\r\npromoting  the  setting up of creches for  babies  below  two\r\n\r\nyears of age.  If we cannot afford to have working mums  drop\r\n\r\nout  and  stay  at home, how much role sharing are  we  truly\r\n\r\ngoing to promote without worrying that it will undermine  our\r\n\r\ntenet of a patriarchal Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are inordinately driven by elitism. Can we not ease\r\n\r\nup  at  all without losing the drive to compete economically?\r\n\r\nYou are nothing if you are not in that cream at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  top,  not  a scholar, not in one of the top professions.\r\n\r\nThis  is  what  drives  parents and students,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhatever  other messages the Ministry of Education may  issue\r\n\r\nabout  there  being  no need to be immoderate  in  pressuring\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rare Singapore family that does not struggle\r\n\r\nwith  the  stresses of putting the kids through our education\r\n\r\nsystem.   Add  to that MOE's steadfast refusal  to  entertain\r\n\r\nthat  there might be any other way or perspective to  explore\r\n\r\nin  such  issues  as  ranking and  streaming,  and  how  much\r\n\r\nprogress  can  we  hope  to  make in  addressing  stress  for\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Working Committee on Marriage and Procreation\r\n\r\npublished  some  recommendations at the end of  August.   Two\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for  the civil service   -   three  days  of\r\n\r\npaternity  leave  and  flexibility in organising  work  hours\r\n\r\naround  a  42-hour  week.  One on building  more  hostels  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate   the  blooming  of  romance  in  our   university\r\n\r\ncampuses, and one on helping newly married couples with their\r\n\r\nHDB downpayments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Eddie Teo, who heads the Committee, in explaining the\r\n\r\nrationale  for  some  of  the  recommendations,  voiced   the\r\n\r\nconsideration  that  we should not, and I  quote,  \"send  the\r\n\r\nwrong  signal that Singapore has arrived, and it is okay  for\r\n\r\nworkers to switch to a less intense pace.\"  I sincerely  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Committee does not consider its work done, that  it  has\r\n\r\nmany   more   recommendations  to  make  to  the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  that when it does make these recommendations,\r\n\r\nthey  will  not simply provide small symptomatic  concessions\r\n\r\nbut  be  bold  and  sweeping and get down to challenging  our\r\n\r\nassumptions  on  where  the balance must  be  struck  between\r\n\r\npurely economic imperatives and the building of a world class\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The end result is a frenetic pace of work.  We cannot\r\n\r\nstop or reverse the changes brought about by the new economy.\r\n\r\nNor  should we.  We must be prepared to change or else change\r\n\r\nwill  overwhelm  us  and undermine our  survival.    Constant\r\n\r\nadaptation and upgrading of skills are the order of the  day.\r\n\r\nWorkers  should  be  adequately equipped  with  the  relevant\r\n\r\nskills  and  knowledge to enhance their employability.    The\r\n\r\nchanges  taking place at work also have profound implications\r\n\r\non  the  family. As a matter of fact, the trend  of  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy  plus  the  development  of  our  social  and  family\r\n\r\nstructure  have  made  it  more and more  difficult  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers  to  strike  a balance between  the  family  and  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present small-family structure has caused us to lose\r\n\r\nthe  closely-knit network and mutual assistance among members\r\n\r\nof  the family.  In a family where both the husband and  wife\r\n\r\nhave  to go out to work, they no longer enjoy the support  of\r\n\r\nother  family  members  as in the traditional  big  families.\r\n\r\nMany workers are sandwiched between maintaining their parents\r\n\r\nand   raising  their  young  children.   There  are  abundant\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more and more workers find it difficult to balance\r\n\r\nthe  demands of work and family.  The gradual rise in women's\r\n\r\nparticipation  in the work force is the key  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nfamily is under more stress now than in the past.  With  more\r\n\r\nand  more  women  participating in the labour  force  it  has\r\n\r\nbecome more difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have to look at this problem.  Although  some\r\n\r\nwomen-folk  are still at home looking after their family  and\r\n\r\nchildren,  many women have to go out to work because  of  the\r\n\r\nneed for money.  They have to return to the workforce to help\r\n\r\ncontribute to the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are many women who possess stronger\r\n\r\neconomic power. They work not merely to supplement the family\r\n\r\nincome.  In fact, the income of women nowadays contributes  a\r\n\r\ngreater  portion  to the total income of  the  family.   Many\r\n\r\nwomen are in a situation whereby they simply could not afford\r\n\r\nto  give up their jobs to look after the family because  they\r\n\r\nknow very well that once they drop out of the workforce, they\r\n\r\nwill not be able to catch up with the fast pace of changes in\r\n\r\nthe  business  world, and they will lose their  employability\r\n\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the above, we now need to have employers to\r\n\r\nlook at avenues where they can put in place all the necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities and flexi-working arrangement to help the women to\r\n\r\nbalance the needs of work and the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 21st century, the male workers also need\r\n\r\nflexible  working arrangements to help look after the  family\r\n\r\nand  their children.  The tripartite partnership should  help\r\n\r\nto look for such pro-family working arrangements so that they\r\n\r\ncould balance the needs of family and work responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics show that in Singapore the proportion of\r\n\r\nemployees  in the flexi- time work arrangement is only  0.06%\r\n\r\nin   1998  compared  to  28%  in  the  United  States.    The\r\n\r\nexperiences  of  family-friendly companies  in  the  US  have\r\n\r\nmanifested to them the benefits of productivity gains, higher\r\n\r\nstaff  retention  and  lower  absenteeism  and  reduction  in\r\n\r\nrecruitment  and training cost.  The report also states  that\r\n\r\nby  the  flexi-work  schedule many  advantages  are  derived,\r\n\r\nbecause every time an employee leaves his employment to  meet\r\n\r\nfamily needs, employers not only incur cost in replacing  the\r\n\r\nemployee but also lose the wealth of experience and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntacit understanding and teamwork that has been built up  over\r\n\r\nthe years.  This type of loss is very substantive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This family-friendly sort of arrangement is not\r\n\r\nimpossible in Singapore.  In fact, some unions and management\r\n\r\nhave worked out flexible arrangements, for example, Singapore\r\n\r\nPower,  Singapore Technologies Aerospace and the restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  have enjoyed some very successful experience.   At\r\n\r\nthe Changi General Hospital and Kandang Kerbau Hospital, they\r\n\r\nhad such a scheme for their staff two to three years ago. The\r\n\r\nresults have been very encouraging. This experience should be\r\n\r\na  good  example  for the others to emulate.   Besides  lower\r\n\r\nabsenteeism,  staff morale is higher.  Staff  dedication  and\r\n\r\ncommitment  became  more prevalent and an enhanced  level  of\r\n\r\nservice is for all to see.  There are a lot of advantages  in\r\n\r\nthis sort of practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something that is worth a try. This is a win-win\r\n\r\nsituation for both the employers and employees.  There is  no\r\n\r\nreason  why  we  should not adopt such a practice.   Flexible\r\n\r\nworking schedules that incorporate lifestyle aspect is a much\r\n\r\nbetter arrangement.  I feel that the employers should believe\r\n\r\nin  such  practices.  Be prepared to give them a try and  see\r\n\r\nhow  the  system  can  evolve.  The management  must  be  the\r\n\r\ndrivers of such changes.  The employers have much to gain  to\r\n\r\nexplore  initiatives  such as flexible work  arrangements  so\r\n\r\nthat they can attract and retain the best employees.  This is\r\n\r\nevidenced by the experience in the United States and in  some\r\n\r\nof the companies in Singapore.  The Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\nset a good example by implementing the new part-time teachers\r\n\r\nscheme.  With such an alternative, the teachers need not  opt\r\n\r\nout of the labour market totally when they need more time for\r\n\r\nfamily commitments.  So they can be said to enjoy the best of\r\n\r\nboth worlds with a very good balance between family needs and\r\n\r\nwork requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this very competitive environment, the\r\n\r\ncompany's business may go up, and sometimes they may go down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen there are more orders coming in, the companies will have\r\n\r\nto  meet their obligations, and their margins are often  very\r\n\r\nthin.   If they have no orders and if there is no work to  be\r\n\r\ncarried out, the company's cost remains very high.  Under the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  if  the employers do not find  some  ways  to\r\n\r\nimprove, and make the economics right, in the end it would be\r\n\r\nthe  workers  who will suffer most.  Many of them  will  lose\r\n\r\ntheir job because the company was relocated to save cost.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve that all the workers and employers know the advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  flexi-time  scheme, and  many  of  the  workers  are\r\n\r\nactually  taking  the initiative to ask  their  companies  to\r\n\r\nallow them to work on a flexible time system so that they can\r\n\r\nhave more time with their families.  So the management should\r\n\r\nrespond  promptly  and find feasible ways to  implement  such\r\n\r\nflexi-time schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions in Singapore support labour market\r\n\r\nflexibility with flexible work arrangements.  The  NTUC  has,\r\n\r\nover  the  years,  put in considerable efforts  in  promoting\r\n\r\nflexible  and  family-friendly  work  environment  through  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  tripartite programmes such  as  back-to-work  and\r\n\r\nsetting up of eldercare and childcare cooperatives, etc.  The\r\n\r\nNTUC  also  promotes the employment of part-time workers  and\r\n\r\narticulates  the relevant legislation to protect and  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  for  part-time and contract workers,  so  that\r\n\r\nworkers  need not give up their work just because  of  family\r\n\r\ncommitment.    However,  some  workers  may  still   perceive\r\n\r\nflexible work arrangement as their employers' way to  squeeze\r\n\r\nmore  out  of  them  so  as to make more  profit.   Some  see\r\n\r\nflexible   work   arrangement  as  temporary  or   short-term\r\n\r\nemployment.  I think that workers should not worry  too  much\r\n\r\nabout this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement would like to work with employers\r\n\r\nand  the  Government on this subject more actively.  We  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  make sure that employers treat workers fairly  when\r\n\r\nthey  reorganise  work to gain more flexibility.   We  should\r\n\r\nalso   ensure  that  unions  are  consulted  when   companies\r\n\r\nimplement new work arrangements.  It is in the trade  union's\r\n\r\ninterest to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhelp  workers  keep their jobs and have greater certainty  in\r\n\r\ntheir incomes in spite of the peaks and lulls of the business\r\n\r\ncycle.   This type of arrangement, on one hand, will  improve\r\n\r\nthe  company's productivity and, on the other hand, will help\r\n\r\nthe  workers  to  look  after their  families.   Whether  the\r\n\r\neconomy  is  booming or whether it is in recession,  we  must\r\n\r\nmake sure that the worker's job is secure and he will have  a\r\n\r\nsteady income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to have a uniform style or model and we\r\n\r\ndo  not  need all the companies to implement such  a  scheme.\r\n\r\nBecause   in   different  companies,  there   are   different\r\n\r\ncircumstances and the companies should design their own  work\r\n\r\nschedules in a way that is most suitable to them.   In  order\r\n\r\nfor the companies to implement this flexible wage or flexible\r\n\r\ntime  arrangement  scheme for the workers,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower  may  want  to review the present  legislation,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  present system of 44 hours a week.   For  some\r\n\r\nindustries,  particularly in the knowledge-based economy,  we\r\n\r\nshould  review whether we should have a better reward  system\r\n\r\nand  better  wages for the workers who are on this flexi-time\r\n\r\narrangement.  We should look at the results rather  than  the\r\n\r\nnumber of hours they work.  In this way, the workers can have\r\n\r\nmore  liberty  to  allocate their time so that  they  have  a\r\n\r\nbalance between their work requirement and family needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has overcome many challenges over the years.\r\n\r\nAmong  others,  this  challenge of enabling  our  workers  to\r\n\r\nbalance the work with their family is a daunting one.  But it\r\n\r\nis  by  no means insurmountable.  We have proved to  be  very\r\n\r\nadept  at  finding innovative ideas and solutions to  resolve\r\n\r\nour  present  problems in the past.  This time  round,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  if  we  have  to make changes, we  should  make  them.\r\n\r\nEmployers  should  take  an enlightened  view  and  with  the\r\n\r\nencouragement  from the Government and the  cooperation  from\r\n\r\nthe  unions  and  the workers, I am quite confident  that  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  able  to create an ideal work environment  and  an\r\n\r\nideal home for our workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  be  exempted  at  this  day's  sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FAMILY-FRIENDLY WORK PRACTICES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion\r\n\r\nmoved by Dr Lily Neo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an increase in the number of dual-income\r\n\r\nfamilies.  More than 50% of the workforce comprise of working\r\n\r\ncouples, and it is projected that it is likely to increase to\r\n\r\n70%  the  next  decade.   This  therefore  calls  for  urgent\r\n\r\nattention as to what support we can give to working couples.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>3.37 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is inevitable that more companies will need to\r\n\r\nmove  towards  family-friendly work  practices.   Because  if\r\n\r\nthese  companies  do  not move towards  family-friendly  work\r\n\r\npractices,  they are likely to lose younger working  couples.\r\n\r\nIt  becomes  less  attractive and  therefore  companies  will\r\n\r\ninevitably  need  to  think of ways  to  attract  and  retain\r\n\r\nyounger working couples.  I see that it is very important for\r\n\r\nus  to maintain a balance between friendly-work practices and\r\n\r\nalso the viability of companies.  We cannot separate them and\r\n\r\nlook at each of them on its own merits.  Therefore, to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  companies are viable, we need also to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey provide good support for their workers.  Because workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  faced  with  various family-related  problems  also\r\n\r\nbecome  very unproductive workers and they incur cost to  the\r\n\r\ncompany, and the company is also likely to become less viable\r\n\r\nbecause of these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are no complete solutions to this whole matter\r\n\r\nbecause we are dealing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  lifespan  issues,  and  lifespan  issues  call  for   a\r\n\r\ncompletely  life-long examination of how we  can  respond  to\r\n\r\nhuman  development.  I think that nobody disagrees that there\r\n\r\nis  a  need  for us to look at ways to strengthen the  family\r\n\r\nbecause  strengthening family and giving family the  best  of\r\n\r\nsupport  we  can,  enriches the nation.  We  deal  with  less\r\n\r\nsocial  problems,  less family breakdowns and  other  related\r\n\r\nfamily problems and in the end it is going to be less cost to\r\n\r\nthe  society  in  any case.  Therefore,  all  the  more,  the\r\n\r\nvarious  views expressed by Dr Lily Neo and Dr  Jennifer  Lee\r\n\r\nshould be given serious attention.  I hope that the committee\r\n\r\nunder  the charge of Minister Lim Boon Heng would be able  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  how we can address some of these issues related  to\r\n\r\nfamily  support and family-friendly work practices.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe  need to review some of the policies which have impact  on\r\n\r\nthe  family.   They are rather segmented and  many  of  these\r\n\r\nsocial policies related to families are not comprehensive and\r\n\r\nwell  coordinated, and there is a need to  re-visit  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  family support policies.  I am sure Mr Lim's committee\r\n\r\nis  actively looking into these and I hope that his committee\r\n\r\nis  able  to  come out with more comprehensive policies  that\r\n\r\nwill  provide  concerted support for families.   This,  I  am\r\n\r\ncertain, his committee is looking at and they would  not  put\r\n\r\nup knee-jerk reaction policies.  More often than not, many of\r\n\r\nthe  policies  that we have known are policies that  are,  to\r\n\r\nsome extent, knee-jerk, and they are not going to produce any\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  impact  in  support  of  family  life.    More\r\n\r\nimportantly,   Sir,   we  need  to  re-visit   family-support\r\n\r\npolicies.    Aside   from   promoting  more   family-friendly\r\n\r\nworkplaces, it is important to look at these policies because\r\n\r\nthese  policies  are  fundamental to ensuring  that  we  have\r\n\r\nstrong  families, and strong families mean better workplaces,\r\n\r\nand  better workplaces mean more viable companies, and we are\r\n\r\nable to make better economic progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to look at the childcare grants. The\r\n\r\nchildcare grant of $180 may not necessarily be able  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  increased cost in childcare.  Today, if you look at  the\r\n\r\naverage  cost  of  childcare, it is  about  $450  and  above.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecomes a burden to many average working families.  So  there\r\n\r\nis  a  need to revise it.  Childcare sick leave is only three\r\n\r\ndays, paternity leave is at the moment being implemented, and\r\n\r\nother childcare leave is very limited.  So we have to examine\r\n\r\nit and I hope this would be actively reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workplace childcare services also need to be looked at\r\n\r\nbecause  we  want  to encourage clusters of companies  coming\r\n\r\ntogether to promote workplace childcare services and we  need\r\n\r\nto  study  the kind of support to be given to these companies\r\n\r\nthat are interested.  Some of them may not have economies  of\r\n\r\nscale  but I think we can look at the clustering of all these\r\n\r\ncompanies  coming together to provide childcare  services  in\r\n\r\nurban areas where many young couples work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maternity leave which is now extended to the third\r\n\r\nchild may need to be looked at in terms of post-natal kind of\r\n\r\nleave  where  the mother needs to support a  new-born  and  a\r\n\r\nmonth's  leave  may not necessarily help her to  prepare  and\r\n\r\nwean the child because of the requirement to go back to work.\r\n\r\nSo this can be re-examined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid levy has to be looked at more closely because\r\n\r\nthere  have been suggestions and viewpoints from many working\r\n\r\nmothers  to  re-look at this.  And I hope that the  committee\r\n\r\nwill actively restudy these issues that have been raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect which we need to assess is the single\r\n\r\nsession schools and whether single session schools are  going\r\n\r\nto be actively promoted.  I hope that this will be stepped up\r\n\r\nso  that  it  would  be a solution to the problem  of  giving\r\n\r\nsupport to families, especially families with younger primary\r\n\r\nschool-going children.  This, I think, should not  remain  as\r\n\r\nlip-service.  I feel that the Ministry of Education, with the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the committee, could look  at  how  these\r\n\r\ncould be implemented as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that I would like to bring to the\r\n\r\nattention of the House is that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  few urgent priorities that need to  be  looked\r\n\r\ninto.  First, we need to provide more incentives to companies\r\n\r\nwho are setting up workplace childcare places, as recommended\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Jennifer Lee.  And there is this problem that MND  is\r\n\r\nnot  giving sufficient incentives for companies to  implement\r\n\r\nsuch a scheme.  The plot ratio takes into consideration these\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres.  If you look at the childcare centre,  it\r\n\r\nis  a  social  service.   It  is a  programme  like  schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals,  clinics and various other facilities.   They  are\r\n\r\nsocial services which enhance the human social capital.  Such\r\n\r\na  service  that  is undertaken by companies  should  receive\r\n\r\ngreater  attention and incentives.  So there  should  be  tax\r\n\r\nexemptions  for  companies  to take  an  active  interest  by\r\n\r\nproviding the support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to look at the setting up of childcare\r\n\r\nservice for children below the age of 18 months because  many\r\n\r\nparents  want to work but they are deterred by the fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  have to look after younger children below 18 months  or\r\n\r\nthere are problems related to childcare.  Such a service  has\r\n\r\nto be stepped up.  Private operators, voluntary organisations\r\n\r\nand  other  interested groups can be encouraged to look  into\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of  such  a service.  Better  incentives  and\r\n\r\nsupport  should  be  given to these groups.   It  is  a  very\r\n\r\nspecialised  service  as  they are very  young  children  who\r\n\r\nrequire more close attention and care.  This means that  more\r\n\r\nresources,  in  terms of manpower, would  be  required.   And\r\n\r\nnobody  would  want to go into this field provided  there  is\r\n\r\nadequate  support from the Ministry of Community  Development\r\n\r\nand Sports as well as the Government itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that we could examine is the need to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  database  which  should  be  made  available   to\r\n\r\ncompanies, that there are retired housewives and mothers  who\r\n\r\nlive  in  the  neighbourhood and who want to provide  family-based  childcare  services.   If  a  good  database  can   be\r\n\r\nmaintained and made available to companies, then it would  be\r\n\r\na  source of support.  Such databases, at the moment, are not\r\n\r\ncollated.   I  think  some  agencies,  like  family   service\r\n\r\nagencies and other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagencies  providing childcare services, can provide a  value-added service in this direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect that we need to look at is the flexi-work scheme. With the move towards IT and other information\r\n\r\ntechnology  advancement, the work world is likely to  change.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there is a necessity for companies to  relook  at\r\n\r\nhow  work  could  be  organised in such a  way  that  working\r\n\r\nmothers can do their work within their home setting and  also\r\n\r\nhave  flexible  work arrangements within  the  work  setting.\r\n\r\nThis   is  a  matter  of  scheduling  and  reorganising  work\r\n\r\nschedules.  I hope that more encouragement and development in\r\n\r\nthis  direction  can be forthcoming.  With these  changes  in\r\n\r\nwork arrangements, it would help to provide more support  for\r\n\r\nyounger  working couples because the work world is  going  to\r\n\r\nattract  many  of these people, retain them to be  productive\r\n\r\nworkers  and contribute to the economic development of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies.   One  has  got  to  respond  fairly  quickly   in\r\n\r\norganising friendly work practices within the work world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very important and urgent that we find ways\r\n\r\nto  strengthen support to the family, particularly support to\r\n\r\nworking  couples, so that the more support we can provide  to\r\n\r\nthem,  the  companies  will become  viable.   When  companies\r\n\r\nbecome  viable, then we would be able to harness more workers\r\n\r\nto  work  within the setting.  Otherwise, if we do  not  have\r\n\r\nviable  companies that can attract younger couples,  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  policies  that we talk about remain as  rhetoric.   So\r\n\r\nthese  issues, I hope, can be urgently looked  into  and  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  under Mr Lim Boon Heng will address  these  issues\r\n\r\nfairly  quickly  and come out with a more coordinated  policy\r\n\r\nthat  will  encourage families, not only to care  effectively\r\n\r\nfor   their  children,  but  also  to  contribute  to   their\r\n\r\ncompanies.  This will therefore help families continue to  be\r\n\r\nviable and effective as well as help companies to move  ahead\r\n\r\nand respond to the changing economic circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  let  me begin at Act 1, Scene 1.  Superwoman  rises  at\r\n\r\n6.00  in  the morning, ensures that her domestic  helper  has\r\n\r\nprepared  breakfast for her family, especially  her  son  who\r\n\r\nneeds  to  catch the school bus at 6.30 am.  In between,  she\r\n\r\ncatches  snippets of Channel News Asia for  the  latest  news\r\n\r\nthat she might need at work.  She lugs along her hand carried\r\n\r\nbaggage  to work in a taxi as she is scheduled to  travel  at\r\n\r\n5.00  in  the  afternoon to Hong Kong for  business.   During\r\n\r\nlunch,  she  rings  her  son's  Chinese  teacher  to  discuss\r\n\r\narrangements for remedial work on Saturdays.  Before she  has\r\n\r\nhad a chance to respond to all her e-mails, she realises that\r\n\r\nshe must rush to the airport or she will miss her flight.  On\r\n\r\nthe  way  to the airport, she rings her mother on her  mobile\r\n\r\nphone to make sure that she has kept her appointment with the\r\n\r\nphysiotherapist.  She next rings her husband to remind him of\r\n\r\nhis  dental appointment.  By the time she sinks into her seat\r\n\r\non  the  plane,  she  is already thinking about  the  various\r\n\r\nmarketing strategies for the Hong Kong-based clients.  She is\r\n\r\nkeenly  aware that competition is intensifying.  But  as  she\r\n\r\ndozes  off  momentarily, she could not be more  satisfied  at\r\n\r\nwork for the adrenaline keeps her going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this one act play describes the multiple roles that\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporean women and, to a similar extent, Singaporean\r\n\r\nmen  assume,  namely, as a parent, a spouse, a child  and  an\r\n\r\nemployee  or  economic contributor, all  at  the  same  time.\r\n\r\nThere  is a constant juggling of roles and competing  demands\r\n\r\nfor our finite time and resources.  As such, social norms are\r\n\r\nstrong  guiding principles that will dictate the  performance\r\n\r\nof each of these roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no turning back to the stereotypes of the\r\n\r\npast  where the woman has to remain at home, especially after\r\n\r\nhaving   children   and  regardless  of   her   ability   and\r\n\r\npreferences.   In  fact,  I believe Singapore  would  be  the\r\n\r\npoorer  for  it if these stereotypes were to persist  as  our\r\n\r\ncompetitive strength will lie in our human resources, men and\r\n\r\nwomen alike.  This is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  to  say  that  we  should actively discourage  women  or\r\n\r\nmothers  who wish to remain at home from doing so.   However,\r\n\r\nwe should actively help them re-enter the workforce when they\r\n\r\nwould  like to.  From this perspective, policies and measures\r\n\r\nwill  hopefully  have their desired impact although  they  do\r\n\r\nhave  the limitations.  As such, to have a sustaining effect,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should  send strong signals  to  help  shape\r\n\r\nsocial   norms.   For  example,  in  land-scarce   Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially within the Central Business District, a strong pro-family  signal can be sent via a combination of, firstly,  an\r\n\r\nexclusion of childcare resources from the computation of plot\r\n\r\nratios,  which  Dr  Lee  and Dr Vasoo have  mentioned,  or  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  preferential treatment be given.   And  secondly,  a\r\n\r\ngenerous  tax deduction for childcare-related operating  cost\r\n\r\nas  an  incentive for property owners and employers.  Another\r\n\r\nstrong  signal could be to allow young couples with new-borns\r\n\r\nto  be  granted  an earlier allocation of  a  flat.   Besides\r\n\r\nhelping  out with the down-payment, the Government  can  also\r\n\r\nenhance  the  ability  to afford a new flat  through  balloon\r\n\r\npayment schemes, where necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many suggestions have been made by hon. Members in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  not  least by Dr Lily Neo, on  how  to  promote\r\n\r\nfamily.   The sceptics would argue that the measures are  not\r\n\r\nquite  enough.   But  with  more  concerted  efforts  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the community at large, I believe  a  strong\r\n\r\nunified message can and will emerge.  I would therefore  like\r\n\r\nto  urge  the  Government to continue to  set  the  pace  and\r\n\r\nexample  by  implementing pro-family measures in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector as far as is possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I would like to register my full\r\n\r\nsupport for the motion standing in the name of Dr Lily Neo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the motion as proposed by Dr Lily Neo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spelt out in the S21 Report, we want to build strong\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  Singapore in the new millennium.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  national  goal,  we  need to put  in  place  pro-family\r\n\r\npolicies  to  support family development as  well  as  family\r\n\r\nbonding.   The allocation of national resources to build  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  physical  infrastructure for facilitating  family-friendly  activities  will  signify  the  Government's   firm\r\n\r\ncommitment to building strong families among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to providing pro-family infrastructure and\r\n\r\nfacilities,  I  would like to propose the following  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Build pro-family integrated facilities within HDB\r\n\r\ntowns.  HDB and town councils must make conscious efforts  to\r\n\r\nbuild  pro-family facilities within HDB towns.  We must  plan\r\n\r\nand   implement  improvement  projects  to  encourage  family\r\n\r\nmembers  to  come  together to have  fun.   We  should  build\r\n\r\n'social  centres'  where families and  their  neighbours  can\r\n\r\ngather conveniently for social interaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical 'social centre' would include facilities for\r\n\r\nall  age  groups, such as children playground, barbecue  pit,\r\n\r\nfitness  corner,  reflexology path, multi-purpose  court  and\r\n\r\nseating facilities.  By integrating these facilities  into  a\r\n\r\n'social centre', family members will have ample opportunities\r\n\r\nto interact, leading to the strengthening of family bonding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where possible, such integrated facilities should be\r\n\r\nlocated  within HDB precincts or near neighbourhood  centres.\r\n\r\nThe  increased  accessibility  and  convenience  will  ensure\r\n\r\nhigher  utilisation  of  such social centres,  enhancing  the\r\n\r\nopportunities for families to stay and play together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Build more parks. Living in an urbanised\r\n\r\nenvironment  like Singapore, it is crucial for  us  to  build\r\n\r\nmore  parks to provide green lungs in our living  space.   In\r\n\r\nland-scarce  Singapore,  it is even  more  critical  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to strike a balance between allocating  land  for\r\n\r\npublic parks and land for pure commercial uses, such as  golf\r\n\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parks provide excellent venues for families to get\r\n\r\ntogether.  Experiences from several countries have shown that\r\n\r\nmany  families  do  visit and spend  a  lot  of  time  having\r\n\r\nrecreation in parks.  Such open spaces also help families  to\r\n\r\nrelax and unwind on weekends, especially after a long week at\r\n\r\nschool and work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, parks do not seem to attract enough locals\r\n\r\nas  they  generally  lack attractions and  facilities.   Some\r\n\r\nparks  charge an entrance fee, which then deters people  from\r\n\r\nvisiting   them.    There  are  also  instances   where   the\r\n\r\nauthorities charge car-parking fees and keep up the  pace  of\r\n\r\nissuing  parking  summons  after some  parks  become  popular\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  turn,  in the long run, discourage  regular  park\r\n\r\nusers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should build more national, regional and\r\n\r\nneighbourhood parks in Singapore.  More pro-family facilities\r\n\r\nsuch as children's playgrounds, games corners, barbecue pits,\r\n\r\nmulti-purpose  courts  and open fields,  should  be  provided\r\n\r\nwithin  the  parks  to  attract more  Singaporeans  to  fully\r\n\r\nutilise  our  parks.   In addition, the  necessary  transport\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  should  be built  to  cater  for  a  seamless\r\n\r\njourney from home to the park.  For instance, parks should be\r\n\r\neasily accessible by public transport and there must be ample\r\n\r\nfree car-parking facilities for park users who drive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should seriously consider providing\r\n\r\nsubsidy  for operating all parks in Singapore.   So  far,  no\r\n\r\ncommercial   parks   have  been  successfully   operated   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   In short, there is a need for more public  parks\r\n\r\nto be built in Singapore to support the pro-family movement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Rejuvenate our beaches. We have to rejuvenate and\r\n\r\ninject  more  life into our shores and beaches.   Today,  our\r\n\r\nbeaches  are  not  very  well  maintained  and,  hence,   not\r\n\r\nattractive to many Singaporeans.  There is a general lack  of\r\n\r\nfacilities and activities along our beaches.  Firstly, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseabed  and  water do not cater well for swimming and  water-sports activities.  Secondly, some of the beaches have  pests\r\n\r\nsuch  as crows and strays which create much nuisance to beach\r\n\r\ngoers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beaches are good spots for pro-family activities. They\r\n\r\nserve  as  good  recreational venues for family  outings  and\r\n\r\npicnics.   The  Government  should  place  more  emphasis  in\r\n\r\nrejuvenating our beaches.  For example, there should be  more\r\n\r\nwater-sports  facilities  for  activities  such  as  boating,\r\n\r\nwindsurfing or canoeing.  We should also increase the  number\r\n\r\nof  food  outlets, such as ice-cream, drinks or snack stalls,\r\n\r\nto  be  located  along the beaches to add more  life  to  our\r\n\r\nbeaches.   Some  areas  should be  cordoned  off  to  provide\r\n\r\nswimming bays with ample toilet facilities to serve the beach\r\n\r\nusers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Build more swimming pools within the community.\r\n\r\nBased  upon the current planning ratio, some communities  are\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  swimming pools because they  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nrequired  population catchment to be entitled to  a  swimming\r\n\r\ncomplex.   This  policy needs to be reviewed if  we  want  to\r\n\r\nencourage families to play together.  Swimming pools  provide\r\n\r\ngood  opportunities for the whole family to keep fit as  well\r\n\r\nas to have fun together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter this problem, we can consider building\r\n\r\nsmaller swimming complexes, ie, maybe a 50-metre pool  and  a\r\n\r\n25-metre  training pool, instead of large swimming  complexes\r\n\r\nwhich   are   currently  built  only  for  large   population\r\n\r\ncatchments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that it is generally expensive to\r\n\r\noperate  a  swimming complex as the income generated  is  low\r\n\r\nwhile  operating costs are high.  However, if we look  at  it\r\n\r\nfrom   the  pro-family  as  well  as  the  healthy  lifestyle\r\n\r\nperspectives, the benefits to be gained should  outweigh  the\r\n\r\ncosts in the long run.  Besides, the smaller swimming complex\r\n\r\ncan  be  built near a cluster of schools and be utilised  for\r\n\r\nextra-curricular activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish that, as a good start, the Government\r\n\r\nwill consider forming a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworking committee to study the physical infrastructure  needs\r\n\r\nfor  building  and  strengthening family bonding  within  our\r\n\r\ncommunities.  This should send a clear signal to all citizens\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is actively seeking ways to improve  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  life of all Singaporeans by taking the  positive\r\n\r\nstep towards fulfilling its commitment to S21.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I had not planned to join this\r\n\r\ndebate, and I may not have done so if this morning my 3-year-old  son had not woken me and asked me to play with  him.   I\r\n\r\ndid  so until 9.30 and then got to the office only at 10.   I\r\n\r\nmay  not have joined this debate also if my wife did not tell\r\n\r\nme, when we were walking at 7.00 am, that she wished we had a\r\n\r\nreliable  part-time  domestic help  instead  of  a  full-time\r\n\r\nforeign worker we do have.  This is despite the fact that she\r\n\r\nruns  her own business and is the primary care-giver for  our\r\n\r\nson.  And I may not have joined this debate also if I had not\r\n\r\nheard   the   Minister  for  Health  yesterday   defend   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  not to give any special  assistance  to\r\n\r\nsingle mothers who decide to keep their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we are all in this House in favour of\r\n\r\nfamilies  and family-friendly practices.  What I am concerned\r\n\r\nabout  is that our support becomes merely convention - stated\r\n\r\nbut   not  practised  -  that  we  replace,  in  this  sense,\r\n\r\nmotherhood statements with family-hood statements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first think of family-friendly practices, I do of\r\n\r\ncourse  think of the women - the wives and mothers among  us.\r\n\r\nToo  many have to make a choice between a job they enjoy  and\r\n\r\ntheir  children whom they also enjoy.  And this is a beggar's\r\n\r\nchoice.   They  should have more options than  this.   Losing\r\n\r\nwomen  from  the workplace is a loss not only to the  economy\r\n\r\nbut  also  for the women themselves.  Many enjoy  aspects  of\r\n\r\nwork  and life outside the house, and this is a part of  what\r\n\r\nthey want for themselves in their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntraining,  in their view of their own self-esteem.   And,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  love  their children.  But  this  is  a  great\r\n\r\nsacrifice that need not always be made and may not always  be\r\n\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while they are important, this debate about families\r\n\r\nshould look beyond women as wives and mothers.  If we do not,\r\n\r\nthere is a danger that when we think of the family, we assume\r\n\r\nand cater only to what some think of as the ideal family, ie,\r\n\r\nhusband  and wife, children - two or more, please - with  the\r\n\r\nassumption  of  a  maid  and perhaps  a  helpful  and  active\r\n\r\ngrandmother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this perspective, Sir, it is too easy to think of\r\n\r\nfamily-friendly practices as being primarily and perhaps only\r\n\r\nfor women as wives and mothers.  While this is the ideal that\r\n\r\nsome  in our society presently uphold, we have to look beyond\r\n\r\nthis if we are truly to be family-friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of a family after all, as sociologists tell us,\r\n\r\nis  changeable over time, culture and space.  In Singapore in\r\n\r\na  past  generation, extended families were the norm.   There\r\n\r\nwere  also  families which involved more than one wife,  more\r\n\r\nthan one mother.  In other countries today, while the nuclear\r\n\r\nfamily is the norm, the exact arrangements of who takes  care\r\n\r\nof the children may differ from what we in Singapore think of\r\n\r\nas  normal.  We do not have to change our social norms.   But\r\n\r\nwe  do  need to show true flexibility if we are to  be  truly\r\n\r\nfriendly to the family.  In this context, I put forward three\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on fathers. I must confess an interest\r\n\r\nhere.   I  think we must not be patriarchal.   Even  if  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans still believe that the woman must be the one who\r\n\r\nis  the primary care-giver to the family, we must be flexible\r\n\r\nenough  to  give  men the option.  We should not  design  the\r\n\r\nworkplace so that men work too long and too hard without  any\r\n\r\nchoice,  while women join, inevitably, a sort of  slow  track\r\n\r\nor,  as  in Japan, have the primary role in the workplace  as\r\n\r\ntea  ladies.  A few men may want to become house-husbands and\r\n\r\nthe primary care-giver to the children.  More\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmen  may wish to take on a larger share of the family  duties\r\n\r\nwhile still keeping the wife in the primary driver-seat.  And\r\n\r\neven  if  the norm is otherwise, our system must be  flexible\r\n\r\nenough to allow for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, single mothers. Our Government has been\r\n\r\nreluctant  to  acknowledge singles  and,  especially,  single\r\n\r\nparents.  I understand that many do not wish this to  be  the\r\n\r\nnorm.   Accordingly,  some  incentives  should  go  only  for\r\n\r\ncouples.  However, we should not go too far in this.  If  one\r\n\r\ntakes the idea of being a single parent seriously and no  one\r\n\r\ntakes   it   lightly,  the  pressures  of  money,  time   and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  are very great, and I think all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nrecognise  this.   If, despite all these, a Singaporean  does\r\n\r\nmake  that  decision, I think we have to have a  system  that\r\n\r\nsupports and allows that decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion is on dependence on the domestic\r\n\r\nmaid or helper.  I think, Sir, there is a time and a need  to\r\n\r\nseriously  look at the provision of part-time domestic  help,\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres and other facilities that will enable  the\r\n\r\nnuclear family, ie, the mother and the father, to do more for\r\n\r\nthemselves and more for their children.  There need, in other\r\n\r\nwords,  to be alternatives to the full-time foreign  maid  as\r\n\r\nthe  primary  care-giver.  This is important for privacy  and\r\n\r\nquality  family  time;   this is important  to  have  parents\r\n\r\nrecognise  a greater role in the care of their own  children.\r\n\r\nThere  is not much point in providing more swimming pools  or\r\n\r\nmore  play  centres  if  all  we see  there  are  maids  with\r\n\r\nchildren,  and  parents  at  the workplace  or  the  shopping\r\n\r\ncentres.   We  need,  in  a sense, to  ask  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower   to  help  promote  and  professionalise  part-time\r\n\r\nhousekeeping   services  by  Singaporeans   for   Singaporean\r\n\r\nfamilies  and,  perhaps, to have a match-making  service  for\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was Tolstoy or some other Russian writer who\r\n\r\nsaid that all happy families are the same while every unhappy\r\n\r\nfamily  has unique cause and character.  In today's world,  I\r\n\r\nbeg to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisagree.   In the face of so many pressures in the workplace\r\n\r\nin  competition between companies to get ahead, I think it is\r\n\r\neach  happy family now that is unique.  Our system has to  be\r\n\r\nflexible  enough, therefore, to acknowledge and support  each\r\n\r\nand every family in its effort to be unique and to be happy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Lily  Neo  for\r\n\r\nher  comprehensive survey of issues relating to  the  family,\r\n\r\nespecially  to raising our fertility rate.  I  wish  also  to\r\n\r\nthank  all those who spoke, with great spirit in some  cases,\r\n\r\nand gave their views and suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the concerns raised are real ones, shared by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   This is the reason why the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nasked  me  and two of my Cabinet colleagues, Messrs  Lim  Hng\r\n\r\nKiang and Abdullah Tarmugi, to form the Ministerial Committee\r\n\r\non Marriage and Procreation to look into these concerns.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that the Prime Minister himself raised the subject  and\r\n\r\nspoke  of  the  joys of a family at the National  Day  Rally,\r\n\r\nshows that the Government is not just concerned with economic\r\n\r\nachievements but also with our social achievements.  Dr  Lee,\r\n\r\nI  feel, misinterpreted the Prime Minister's statement.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister acknowledges that it is far harder to measure\r\n\r\nsocial  development,  not that we are  clinging  to  the  old\r\n\r\neconomic ones.  Many of Dr Neo's proposals and those  of  the\r\n\r\nother  speakers  have actually either been  implemented,  are\r\n\r\nbeing   implemented,   or  are  currently   being   seriously\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now reply to some of the more specific points\r\n\r\nthat they have raised.  First, I will start with the physical\r\n\r\nones  that Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested.  I would like him  to\r\n\r\nexpand  on  his ideas.  But it is not necessary to  form  yet\r\n\r\nanother  ministerial committee or committee of Parliament  to\r\n\r\ndo  it.  In the spirit of S21, Dr Teo and like-minded Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament, as well as like-minded members of the public,\r\n\r\ncan  get  together,  do a study and present  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nreport.  That report could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  submitted  to the Ministerial Committee on  Marriage  and\r\n\r\nProcreation or, if he feels that he could do so directly with\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development, he is also free to  do\r\n\r\nso.  This is what we mean when we talk about participation by\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo has urged that there be a comprehensive approach\r\n\r\nto formulating and implementing policies to address the issue\r\n\r\nof falling fertility.  We totally agree with her.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government announced the package  of  measures  to\r\n\r\nencourage marriage and procreation recently, we stressed  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  create  a  total environment conducive  to  couples\r\n\r\nmarrying  and  having more children.  Here, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nreiterate to Mr Simon Tay that the Government's objective  is\r\n\r\nto  have couples marrying and having more children within the\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  marriage.  So it is  not  the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  promote single parenthood.  Besides  monetary\r\n\r\nincentives like the Baby Bonus Scheme, the measures  included\r\n\r\npromoting pro-family work practices, increasing the supply of\r\n\r\nquality  childcare centres, easier home ownership  for  young\r\n\r\ncouples,    public   education   and   creating   socialising\r\n\r\nopportunities for the young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key measure is public education. Hence, a Public\r\n\r\nEducation Committee (PEC) on the Family chaired by the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary for Community Development and Sports,\r\n\r\nMrs  Yu-Foo  Yee Shoon, has been formed.  The PEC  will  look\r\n\r\ninto  a number of the proposals that Dr Neo has raised,  such\r\n\r\nas  changing  the  mindset of employers who prefer  employees\r\n\r\nwith  no family commitments, encouraging earlier childbearing\r\n\r\nand  role-sharing, and expanding the avenues for young people\r\n\r\nto  socialise.  I do not need to elaborate on this as Dr Neo,\r\n\r\nbeing a member of the PEC, will be familiar with its work.  I\r\n\r\nalso  note that Dr Vasoo and Dr Jennifer Lee are also members\r\n\r\nof  this  Committee.   We hope that Dr Neo  and  these  other\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Committee would spare  no  effort  in  this\r\n\r\nimportant task of changing mindsets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, already many existing pro-family\r\n\r\npolicies. We have, for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexample,   been   advocating  that  the   responsibility   of\r\n\r\nparenthood  does  not lie solely with the women  and  fathers\r\n\r\nmust  share  their  responsibilities  in  bringing  up  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   The  Prime  Minister  reiterated  this  when   he\r\n\r\nannounced the paternity leave scheme in the civil service  in\r\n\r\nAugust  this  year.   It may not be very  much  of  a  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefit  in terms of cost but it is a very strong  signal  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  at large that the fathers also have  a  role  to\r\n\r\nplay.   MCDS has also been organising and supporting seminars\r\n\r\non fathering to highlight the importance of fatherhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is our pro-family public housing. There\r\n\r\nare  rental  schemes  in place for young couples  setting  up\r\n\r\nhomes  for  the first time.  Those who book a new flat  still\r\n\r\nunder  construction under the Registration  for  Flat  System\r\n\r\n(RFS) or who have been in the queue for at least three months\r\n\r\nawaiting  selection of a flat can apply to rent a  three-room\r\n\r\nflat  under the Transitional Rental Housing Scheme.  For  low\r\n\r\nincome  couples,  they could apply under  the  Public  Rental\r\n\r\nHousing Scheme to rent a one-room or two-room flat from  HDB,\r\n\r\nor  the  Rent and Purchase Scheme which allows them to  first\r\n\r\nrent  a  three-room  flat and buy over the flat  subsequently\r\n\r\nwhen their financial situation improves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association has also been encouraging\r\n\r\ncommunity-based  organisations  to  conduct  more  grassroots\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  strengthen family ties  and  neighbourliness.\r\n\r\nActivities  range  from  family  day  activities  to  festive\r\n\r\ncelebrations  involving  families.   And  I  hope  that   all\r\n\r\nadvisers  will  review  the activities  of  their  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations and make sure that they are better focused  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  more effective in strengthening family bonds.  The\r\n\r\nwork  is  not  that of just the Government and policies.  The\r\n\r\nwork  has  to  be done on the ground and I hope, through  the\r\n\r\nadvisers, that more can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has also implemented several family-friendly initiatives. Apart from the paid marriage and\r\n\r\npaternity  leave that were implemented from 1st October  this\r\n\r\nyear, it has allowed individual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nministries and departments to arrange flexi-work arrangements\r\n\r\nas  long  as  there is no loss of productivity and  lapse  in\r\n\r\nservice  standards to the public. These are  in  addition  to\r\n\r\nmany  other pro-family policies introduced much earlier,  for\r\n\r\nexample, no-pay leave for childcare, part-time employment for\r\n\r\nworking mothers and sick childcare leave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting family-friendly practices in private sector\r\n\r\ncompanies  is a key strategic focus for both the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development  and  Sports  and  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nManpower.   This is intended not just to improve family  life\r\n\r\nbut  also work life.  Efforts to encourage employers to adopt\r\n\r\nfamily-friendly  work practices were first initiated  by  the\r\n\r\nthen Ministry of Community Development and its people sector-led  Committee  on  the  Family.   One  of  the  first  major\r\n\r\ninitiatives was the launch of the Family Friendly Firm  Award\r\n\r\nin  1998.  This was introduced together with the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades Union Congress. The award aims to  recognise\r\n\r\ncompanies for their pro-family efforts and encourage them  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  and  promote innovative pro-family  practices  for\r\n\r\ntheir employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is well aware of the increasing struggles\r\n\r\nfor  families  in  coping  with a fast-paced  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  This year, both Prime Minister Goh and Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  BG Lee have emphasised the need to have  pro-family\r\n\r\nworkplaces.  This  is  particularly so  as  the  dual  income\r\n\r\nfamilies become the norm and working hours become longer in a\r\n\r\n24  x  7  economy.  But let us pause and think. The  24  x  7\r\n\r\neconomy  does  not necessarily mean that each person  has  to\r\n\r\nwork  longer hours in a week.  It is how we roster people  at\r\n\r\nwork  and  how smartly they work that is important,  not  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  hours that they spend at work. And  this  is  the\r\n\r\nfocus  which  all  employers should bear in  mind  when  they\r\n\r\ndevise  pro-family practices.  It will make a mockery of  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  productivity if getting  more  work  done  means\r\n\r\ngetting the workers to work longer hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by Dr Neo, many of the organisations in the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  of America have offered family-friendly  work\r\n\r\npractices  believing  that being family-friendly  makes  good\r\n\r\nbusiness sense. This is despite their government's negligible\r\n\r\nrole in promoting family-friendly programmes.  In fact, these\r\n\r\ncompanies  no  longer talk about work-family balance  because\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"balance\"  seems  to  suggest  a  zero  sum  game.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they  talk  about work-life effectiveness  as  they\r\n\r\nstrongly  believe  that employees with  strong  personal  and\r\n\r\nfamily  ties would be more effective and motivated  at  work.\r\n\r\nFamily  and work are not necessarily at odds with each other.\r\n\r\nThis  represents  a  paradigm shift and reflects  a  holistic\r\n\r\napproach.   European  companies  too  have  adopted   family-friendly practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our local companies to emulate these companies.\r\n\r\nWe agree that employers should, as far as possible, implement\r\n\r\nflexi-work  arrangements  to help  Singaporeans  with  family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  to participate in the  workforce.  This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  so with the availability of IT.   Our  existing\r\n\r\nemployment  laws are already flexible in allowing  flexi-work\r\n\r\narrangements. What is needed are creative solutions by  human\r\n\r\nresource  managers.   Our  laws  also  ensure  that   workers\r\n\r\nemployed  on a part-time basis can enjoy pro-rated employment\r\n\r\nbenefits  such as medical leave. Employers are also  required\r\n\r\nto  contribute  to  the Central Provident Fund  even  if  the\r\n\r\nemployee is working part-time.  Nevertheless, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower is reviewing the Employment Act to ensure that  they\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  meet the needs of business and employees.   And\r\n\r\nthose employers who want to re-design their working hours and\r\n\r\npractices   and   who  encounter  some  problems   with   our\r\n\r\nlegislation  would be encouraged to bring them  up  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower so that they can be taken into  account\r\n\r\nwhen the Employment Act is reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to point out that the paid maternity\r\n\r\nleave  in our Employment Act for up to two children  and  the\r\n\r\nadditional grants for the second and third child are in  fact\r\n\r\nmore favourable and family-friendly as compared to a number\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  other countries including Australia, New Zealand and some\r\n\r\nstates  in  the United States of America which  do  not  even\r\n\r\nrequire  employers  to  pay for such  leave  as  a  statutory\r\n\r\nbenefit.  Such  benefits in these countries  are  subject  to\r\n\r\nnegotiations between the employer and employee concerned. The\r\n\r\npoint I want to put across to Members is:  let us look at the\r\n\r\ntotal  package,  not  just  on  specific  measures  that  are\r\n\r\navailable  in  any  country. We have to  look  at  the  total\r\n\r\npackage and see how those incentives work before we say  that\r\n\r\nwe should adopt them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing family-friendly work practices requires\r\n\r\nmuch work to be done in changing our employers' mindsets  and\r\n\r\nthat  is why the Ministry of Community Development and Sports\r\n\r\nset  up  a  Work-Life Unit in September this year to  promote\r\n\r\nfamily-friendly  work  practices. The  Ministry  of  Manpower\r\n\r\nitself  has also set up the Human Resource Promotion  Section\r\n\r\nin  1999 to promote good human resource (HR) practices. These\r\n\r\nmeasures reflect our commitment to bringing about a workplace\r\n\r\nculture change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by Dr Lee, MCDS engaged two leading\r\n\r\nAmerican  work-life consultants to conduct awareness seminars\r\n\r\nand  training  workshops for HR managers as well  as  provide\r\n\r\nconsultancy to companies in Singapore.  The response to these\r\n\r\nevents  was  overwhelming.  Numerous companies  have  already\r\n\r\napproached  the  Work-Life Unit to give sharing  sessions  on\r\n\r\nwork-life  strategies  and to provide  more  information  and\r\n\r\nadvice.  So an encouraging ground swell has started to  build\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another initiative which the Ministries are working on\r\n\r\nwould be the compilation of actual pro-family practices  that\r\n\r\nwork,  for  example,  K  K  Hospital,  Changi  Hospital,   ST\r\n\r\nAerospace  and others, to show other employers  what  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  and we will need to provide greater publicity for these\r\n\r\nmeasures that work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to childcare facilities. Dr Vasoo has\r\n\r\nasked  for a review of childcare subsidies. We can assure  Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo that the subsidies will be reviewed periodically\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  ensure that they keep pace with the times.  Dr Neo  asked\r\n\r\nfor  better  distribution  of  childcare  centres.  Childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  in  private residential areas are set up by  private\r\n\r\noperators  and, as in any commercial enterprise, the  numbers\r\n\r\nare  determined by the viability of the project.  In new  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  MCDS plans ahead of demand through regular meetings\r\n\r\nwith  HDB  based  on  the number of dwelling  units  for  the\r\n\r\nestate.   For  older HDB estates, we increase the  number  of\r\n\r\ncentres in high demand areas.  MCDS works closely with HDB so\r\n\r\nthat  childcare premises are conveniently sited together with\r\n\r\nthe  housing  blocks.   MCDS will  be  delegating  the  local\r\n\r\nplanning   of  childcare  centres  to  Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  (CDCs), which will better enable them to gauge  and\r\n\r\nrespond to local demand.  Here, Members of Parliament who are\r\n\r\nmembers  of  CDCs can expect to play a greater  role  at  the\r\n\r\nlocal area.  For a start, this will take place starting  with\r\n\r\nMarine Parade and Tanjong Pagar CDCs.  MCDS will continue  to\r\n\r\nmanage  demand  and supply at the national level  and  ensure\r\n\r\nthat acceptable standards are met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides promoting the setting up of childcare centres in\r\n\r\nprivate   residential  areas,  we  also  encourage  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  in condominiums.  URA levies development charges  at\r\n\r\nthe residential rate instead of commercial rate for childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  in  condominiums.  URA has also lifted  restrictions\r\n\r\nrequiring such centres to serve residents only.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some financial support and incentives are provided to\r\n\r\nemployers  who  set  up  childcare  centres  as  an  employee\r\n\r\nbenefit.   These  include capital grants for  furnishing  and\r\n\r\nequipping  new  centres and various tax incentives.   We  can\r\n\r\nreview these incentives to see whether they are adequate  and\r\n\r\nup  them  if they are not, although we should note  that  our\r\n\r\nstudies  show  a  low demand for workplace childcare  centres\r\n\r\noverall.  This is the more important factor than plot  ratios\r\n\r\nthat Dr Lee, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Dr Vasoo had mentioned.   A\r\n\r\ncritical  mass  is  necessary for a childcare  centre  to  be\r\n\r\nviable,  and  that has been the experience of NTUC  Childcare\r\n\r\nfor which I have some knowledge.  You must have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncritical  mass of children using a centre for that centre  to\r\n\r\nbe  economically viable.  As a rule of thumb, it is now above\r\n\r\n100  children  per  centre.  So, there  have  been  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres at workplaces run by NTUC Childcare contracted by the\r\n\r\nemployers,  but the number of children had been too  few  for\r\n\r\nthe  centres  to be viable and, unfortunately,  they  had  to\r\n\r\nclose down.  I think if we wish to have more such centres set\r\n\r\nup  where the parents work, a viable centre would be one that\r\n\r\ndoes  not  specifically serve one employer only, and  has  to\r\n\r\nserve  a  number of employers, so that we can get a  critical\r\n\r\nmass  of  children using that centre to make the cost  within\r\n\r\nreason.    This  is  something which  private  operators  can\r\n\r\nexamine  and  if there are impediments to the setting  up  of\r\n\r\nsuch  centres,  please let us know and, where  possible,  the\r\n\r\nobstacles can be removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS has also studied the obstacles to the development\r\n\r\nof  childcare centres catering to children below  18  months.\r\n\r\nWe are mindful of the fact that many child experts agree that\r\n\r\nthe  first  few  years of a child's life  are  important  for\r\n\r\nparent to child bonding, and that infants are best cared  for\r\n\r\nat  home  by their mothers or relatives.  And indeed  surveys\r\n\r\nalso  show  that  that  is  the  preference  of  the  parents\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Hence, we should put more emphasis  on  support\r\n\r\nfor  home  care, such as family-friendly employment practices\r\n\r\nand  also  encourage the extended family.  However,  if  dual\r\n\r\nincome families have no other alternatives to care for  their\r\n\r\ninfants, we have to promote other care arrangements.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe measures taken recently was to revise the requirement for\r\n\r\ninfant  care  centres to have at least one paediatric-trained\r\n\r\nnurse  to one state approved nurse.  This does not compromise\r\n\r\nstandards.   In  fact, when we have trained sufficient  early\r\n\r\nchildhood   personnel  specialising  in  infant   care,   the\r\n\r\nrequirement  to have a nurse can be removed altogether.   The\r\n\r\nwhole  purpose  is,  of course, to bring  down  the  cost  of\r\n\r\noperating such centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for allowing part-time employment of foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworkers,  the  Ministry of Manpower is hesitant to  introduce\r\n\r\nsuch\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  option.   Currently, there are more than 100,000  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers in Singapore.  This number has  doubled  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  10 years.  Allowing households access to part-time\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers may greatly increase their numbers,\r\n\r\nas  households without foreign domestic workers could turn to\r\n\r\nthem.  This could increase our reliance on foreign labour and\r\n\r\ncould have adverse social consequences.  There would also  be\r\n\r\nconcerns over the question of responsibility of looking after\r\n\r\nthe welfare and accommodation of these workers.  They may  be\r\n\r\nexploited  or abused.  And allowing foreign domestic  workers\r\n\r\nto  work  part-time  will stunt the  emergence  of  a  strong\r\n\r\ndomestic  service sector.  So let us look  at  the  need  and\r\n\r\nexamine  how  other  countries achieve higher  female  labour\r\n\r\nforce  participation rates than us without relying on foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers.  I think this is an issue which we have not\r\n\r\nexamined to any depth.  Why are the Nordic countries,  as  Dr\r\n\r\nLily  Neo  says, reflecting a higher fertility rate than  us,\r\n\r\nand  yet  in those Nordic countries they do not have a  heavy\r\n\r\nreliance  on foreign domestic maids?  Maybe there are  things\r\n\r\nthat they can teach us.  And I think one of the possibilities\r\n\r\nis  the availability of services using local domestic workers\r\n\r\nrather than foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on stress in education. Dr Neo has made a number\r\n\r\nof  proposals to fine tune our education system.  She  talked\r\n\r\nabout homework overload.  I would like to assure her that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  has a differentiated  curriculum  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  each  child  to  his  or  her  potential.   However,\r\n\r\nsometimes  the expectations and aspirations of  parents  come\r\n\r\ninto  play,  and these have direct impact on their children's\r\n\r\nstress  level.   Our message to these parents  is  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  not stress the child beyond what he or she is capable\r\n\r\nof.   Instead,  we should look at the total development,  not\r\n\r\njust the academic achievements of the child.  What is already\r\n\r\nin  the school curriculum is sufficient.  It is not necessary\r\n\r\nto  overload  the  child with a lot of other extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities.   So it is the responsibility of the  parents  to\r\n\r\nensure that there is no such overload.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for providing tutorial classes after school hours, I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the schools today have various programmes and\r\n\r\nactivities to cater to those who need help with their  school\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On schools starting later and allowing facilities to be\r\n\r\nused  by  students  throughout  the  day,  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  has implemented single session programmes  in  all\r\n\r\nsecondary schools this year.  Hence, these schools  have  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  rearrange their formal curriculum  hours  to\r\n\r\naccommodate the needs of their pupils by starting  their  day\r\n\r\nlater.   Co-curricular activities, pastoral  care  and  other\r\n\r\nprogrammes can also be organised after class by the students,\r\n\r\nand  also  with the support of the parents.  Primary  schools\r\n\r\nwill  have  constraints as they run double session programmes\r\n\r\nnow.  However, this too is being reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education also agrees that children\r\n\r\nshould  not  only  be  exam-smart.  Hence,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  implemented the Thinking Skills programme  in  all\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  in 1999, to encourage students  to  think\r\n\r\ncritically  and  creatively.  It has also  introduced  Inter-disciplinary  Project  Work to all schools  and  have  a  few\r\n\r\nchallenging \"thinking questions\" in their examinations.  And,\r\n\r\nrecently, that caused a little bit of uproar with respect  to\r\n\r\nthe PSLE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also ranked on both academic and non-academic achievements. The Ministry of Education has also\r\n\r\nadopted the school excellence model for all schools this year\r\n\r\nto  broaden  the  scope  of the way  schools  are  appraised.\r\n\r\nLinked to this is an award system that recognises talents and\r\n\r\nabilities in non-academic spheres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities will also implement a new admission\r\n\r\nsystem in the year 2003, moving away from a sole reliance  on\r\n\r\n'A'  levels towards a more holistic evaluation of a  person's\r\n\r\npotential  to  benefit  from  university  education.   Hence,\r\n\r\nperformance  in  a  reasoning  test,  project  work  and  co-curricular activities will be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, let me take a step back and ask\r\n\r\nall of us to assess our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducation system.  International studies have shown  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  good  system.   I  hope that  the  Public  Education\r\n\r\nCommittee will address this and bring home this point to  all\r\n\r\nparents,   so   that  there  is  less  stress   come   school\r\n\r\nregistration time.  It is not necessary to get into  the  so-called list of top schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for stress on academic results, let me reassure\r\n\r\nMembers of the House that the public service does not promote\r\n\r\non  the  basis  of examination results.  The  public  service\r\n\r\npromotes  on  the  basis  of performance,  the  result  of  a\r\n\r\nperformance appraisal which the public service does, and  not\r\n\r\nbecause  of what kind of examination results that person  has\r\n\r\nhad  in  school  or  at  university.   And  it  would  be  an\r\n\r\nexaggeration,  to put it mildly, to describe  our  system  as\r\n\r\nelitist.  We should not confuse meritocracy with elitism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, subsidising health care for children. Dr Neo has\r\n\r\nsuggested providing free medical treatment for our pre-school\r\n\r\nchildren.   Currently, the Government is already providing  a\r\n\r\nnational childhood immunisation programme and the development\r\n\r\nscreening programme which monitors the growth and development\r\n\r\nof  infants  and pre-school children free of  charge  at  our\r\n\r\npolyclinics.   For acute care, our healthcare finance  policy\r\n\r\nstresses personal responsibility for maintaining good health.\r\n\r\nParents should look after the health of their children.   For\r\n\r\nchildren  who  fall sick and seek treatment  in  our  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised polyclinics and public hospitals, the parents have\r\n\r\nto pay only part of the cost of the medical service consumed.\r\n\r\nThe principle of co-payment is necessary to avoid the pitfall\r\n\r\nof \"free\" medical services stimulating insatiable demand, and\r\n\r\nto keep the cost of basic health care affordable.  Currently,\r\n\r\nour  children  are subsidised at 75% at the  polyclinics  and\r\n\r\nbetween  65%  and 80% in Class B2 or C wards.   Our  children\r\n\r\nwill  never  be denied access to basic medical  care  because\r\n\r\ntheir  parents are in financial difficulties as  the  parents\r\n\r\ncan apply for Medifund assistance or waiver of fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point about Government expenditure on health\r\n\r\ncare, we must bear\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  mind that higher Government expenditure on health care is\r\n\r\noften  related  to higher tax rates.  So it  is  one  or  the\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to liberalising the use of Medisave for\r\n\r\nassisted conception procedures (ACP), the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nhas   received   feedback  from  the  public  regarding   the\r\n\r\ninadequacy of the current Medisave withdrawal limits  imposed\r\n\r\non  ACP.   It  is currently reviewing the Medisave withdrawal\r\n\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, there are also few procedural impediments\r\n\r\nto   childless   couples  adopting   babies.    When   social\r\n\r\ninvestigations  are conducted, they serve  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\ninterests  and  well-being of the child to be  adopted.   The\r\n\r\nprimary problem is the lack of babies, especially local ones,\r\n\r\navailable for adoption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign adoptions require certain safeguards and checks\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  the  adoptive  parents  see  through  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  raising  the  child.   We  do  not   want\r\n\r\nsituations  where parents give up their adopted  child  later\r\n\r\nbecause  of  difficulties in the relationship.   Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nMCDS  and  other departments involved will continue  to  look\r\n\r\ninto facilitating foreign adoption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of what we have discussed are on social\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and the soft aspects of the issues,  and  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  of social capital in our society.   It  is  the\r\n\r\nsubject of social capital which is completely relevant to the\r\n\r\nsubject in hand for which we have not fully explored. We will\r\n\r\nhave  to  understand  not only the work pressures  but  other\r\n\r\nfactors  at  work that inhibit couples from having  children.\r\n\r\nHere,  I think we are going into a much larger area for which\r\n\r\nwe have as yet little good knowledge.  But we should continue\r\n\r\nto examine those factors and address them wherever we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With family-friendly workplaces and family-friendly\r\n\r\nenvironment  and our continual drive in putting forward  pro-family policies, programmes, services and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmessages,  I  am confident that we can become  an  even  more\r\n\r\nfamily-oriented  society.   I  am  sure  that  the   energies\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  by  Members of this House will  translate  into\r\n\r\nmore babies and stronger families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng  for his favourable  and  positive\r\n\r\nresponses.  I would also like to express my gratitude to  all\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues - Dr Vasoo, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Dr Tan Boon Wan,\r\n\r\nDr  Teo  Ho  Pin, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Dr Jennifer Lee  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon Tay - who have participated in this debate.  They  have\r\n\r\nraised  many  good  suggestions and unique perspectives  that\r\n\r\nmake this debate interesting and fruitful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On child care centres, Mr Lim Boon Heng said that their\r\n\r\nstudies showed a low demand for work-place child care centres\r\n\r\noverall.   This  is not borne out by the apparent  popularity\r\n\r\nand  success in the existing child care centres at workplaces\r\n\r\nrun  by the Kandang Kerbau Women and Children Hospital,  MCDS\r\n\r\nand Ministry of Manpower, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can understand that private organisations would\r\n\r\nalways consider the cost of providing child care centres.  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Boon Heng has mentioned about a critical mass for  child\r\n\r\ncare  centres  to  be  economically  viable.   However,   the\r\n\r\nchallenge  is  to  re-emphasise that money spent  on  family-friendly  practices  is a draw for the company's  performance\r\n\r\nand  attractiveness.  Steps taken by the  Government  to  re-visit   and  review  facilities  in  terms  of  grants,   tax\r\n\r\nincentives  and  set  up  such  centres  will  endorse   this\r\n\r\npractice.  Echoing Dr Jennifer Lee, Dr Vasoo and Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua,  I  would like to suggest that the Ministry of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment waive development charges for building child care\r\n\r\ncentres at workplaces and favourably treating this as in  the\r\n\r\ncategory of community service by our Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On school starting later, Mr Lim Boon Heng said that\r\n\r\nschools   have  the  flexibility  to  arrange  their   formal\r\n\r\ncurriculum hours to accommodate the needs of their pupils\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  starting  their  day  later.   It  seems,  however,  that\r\n\r\nprincipals have not taken the initiative to start  later.   I\r\n\r\ndoubt if it is really in the interest of the students that no\r\n\r\nchange  in the start-times has been made, especially for  the\r\n\r\nsingle-session  schools.  I therefore feel that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed for positive directive from the Ministry of Education on\r\n\r\nthis, especially for single-session schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of Medisave for intro-vitro fertilisation, Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Boon  Heng said that the Ministry of Health is currently\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  Medisave  withdrawal  limits.   I  hope   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health will give a significant  and  favourable\r\n\r\nresponse on this for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The opportunity for more births;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Infertile couples' desperation for a child of their own;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Such couples are usually young and can build up their\r\n\r\nMedisave savings for many more years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the difficulty for young couples to rent HDB flats,\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Boon  Heng mentioned existing schemes  available  to\r\n\r\nyoung couples.  However, unless the couples have applied  for\r\n\r\nhome ownership flats under the RFS as first-timers, they  are\r\n\r\nnot  eligible to rent HDB flats at the moment.  The other HDB\r\n\r\nrental  scheme  available with a $800  ceiling  on  household\r\n\r\nincome,  which  has been implemented for the past  10  years,\r\n\r\ninvariably excludes young working couples in today's context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our existing HDB rental policy dashes our hope of\r\n\r\nchanging the mindset of our young who are postponing marriage\r\n\r\nand  starting  family  until they  have  succeeded  in  their\r\n\r\ncareers  or  have bought their own homes.  Our policy  should\r\n\r\nnot  be hampering or contradictory in nature.  Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nyoung  couples are not prepared to buy HDB homes for whatever\r\n\r\nreasons, they should not be denied the rental of HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister gave several reasons against allowing part-time foreign maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to appeal for a reconsideration with  the\r\n\r\nfollowing viewpoints:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Allowing part-time foreign maids will create\r\n\r\nadditional demand.  This may not necessarily be so  as  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  full-time foreign maids may then opt for part-time\r\n\r\nones  to  save cost or to have more privacy and  so  on.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  as mentioned by Mr Simon Tay earlier, his wife is  one\r\n\r\nof those who prefers part-time maid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Accommodation for part-time maids will be a concern.\r\n\r\nThis  can be overcome by allowing only those agents that  can\r\n\r\nprovide  accommodation getting the licence to  recruit.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  maids that will be approved will  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nspace or accommodation available for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Issue of exploitation of maids and illegals working\r\n\r\nin  other  sectors.  Here, the agents again have to  be  made\r\n\r\naccountable  for  some  code  of  practice  to  address  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  Sir, deterrent measures can be put in place to deal\r\n\r\nwith errant agents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Over-reliance on foreign maids. The present rules\r\n\r\nconcerning employer eligibility and maid levy may be  adopted\r\n\r\nfor  part-time maids to prevent unnecessary and over-reliance\r\n\r\non foreign maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Stunting the emergence of a strong domestic service\r\n\r\nsector.   Sir,  this is not valid because Singaporeans  would\r\n\r\nnot take such jobs which are considered lowly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Boon Heng has said that many European country\r\n\r\nfamilies  do not need maids.  I would like to reiterate  that\r\n\r\nthese  countries have good government and social  support  as\r\n\r\nwell  as conducive work environment that are pro-family.   If\r\n\r\nwe  can  match  them  one  day in the near  future,  probably\r\n\r\nSingaporean families may not need maids too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would say that social conditions change\r\n\r\nand  it  is  necessary therefore that policies  get  adjusted\r\n\r\naccordingly  to  suit  the  needs  of  the  time.   Even   if\r\n\r\ndifficulties abound, the desired outcome must be sought. As I\r\n\r\nhave said\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearlier,  it  may involve a major change in the  mindsets  of\r\n\r\nboth  the  people and the  Government.  We  need  to  make  a\r\n\r\npositive move to achieve this change.  It would be worthwhile\r\n\r\nin  the long run if the adjustments can help Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nbalance the demands of work and family responsibility better.\r\n\r\nYou  may  ask  why  there is such a need  for  us  to  be  so\r\n\r\nproactive in promoting harmonising work and family now.   Are\r\n\r\nwe  a nanny state?  Sir, my answer is that Singapore has been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  because  the Government was  able  to  anticipate\r\n\r\nproblems and influence the people at overcoming the problems.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a small country with a very small  population.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot just let things drift unchecked all the time.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case of declining total fertility rates, that will  mean\r\n\r\nlesser  and  lesser Singaporeans in the future to ensure  the\r\n\r\nsurvival and prosperity and continuity of this state.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot   have  the  luxury  of  other  big  countries  with  big\r\n\r\npopulations to cushion the effect of declining birth rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of it all, if more proactive actions are\r\n\r\ntaken  to help Singaporeans beget happiness, as mentioned  by\r\n\r\nMr  Simon  Tay earlier, through harmonising work and  family,\r\n\r\nour efforts today would have received its honorarium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and\r\n\r\nthe House for the patience and indulgence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I just briefly\r\n\r\nmake two very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmall clarifications.
