In 1998, we signed an addendum to  the  1990\r\n\r\nMOU  which  allows  US Deep Draft Vessels, such  as  aircraft\r\n\r\ncarriers, to berth at Changi\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNaval  Base.

With globalisation,\r\n\r\nsome  are doing very well, while others are still struggling.\r\n\r\nWe  are  recovering  from the crisis but we  are  entering  a\r\n\r\nperiod of increasing globalisation and competition.  I  think\r\n\r\none  of  the speakers, on the first day of the debate, talked\r\n\r\nabout  what shape of recovery in terms of alphabets.  Let  me\r\n\r\ncontinue with this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fear the U-shape recovery because that will mean that\r\n\r\nwe  spend  too long at the bottom.  What we seem to have,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's case, is very much a V-shape recovery,  last  one\r\n\r\nin and first one out.  But\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincreasingly, the present scenario seems to be more of  a  W,\r\n\r\nup and down, much depending on what happens in the US market.\r\n\r\nMy own view, however, is that beyond U, V, W, we have to look\r\n\r\nat  the next alphabet, which is the X.  The X-shape seems  to\r\n\r\napply  not only for Singapore but for Asia, and this is  that\r\n\r\nsome will be going down and are likely to stay down, and this\r\n\r\nwould not just be countries but also companies and sectors of\r\n\r\nsociety.   In  contrast,  others  would  be  going  up  quite\r\n\r\nrapidly.  In Asia X or Singapore X, we will actually need  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  a  whole new way of trying to help those  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom  improve and hold the society together when  we  would\r\n\r\nhave quite different levels of results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget has been welcomed as the most generous\r\n\r\nBudget. There are suggestions that this is an election Budget\r\n\r\nand that, in that sense, it would not likely be repeated.   I\r\n\r\njoin  those  who welcome the Budget.  However,  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthere  would not be a one-off.  Some of the features of  this\r\n\r\nBudget should endure and, indeed, be strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget policy has the makings of a new and very\r\n\r\nwelcome  approach  for this new age of globalisation  and  of\r\n\r\nthis X-feature in our society.  There are special efforts  to\r\n\r\ntarget  assistance to the less well-off.   The  Minister  has\r\n\r\nproposed  lessening  the tax burden, especially  for  smaller\r\n\r\nbusinesses and the lower-income and middle income earners.  I\r\n\r\nwelcome  these but more, of course, can be done.   Some  have\r\n\r\nthought  of a social safety net. There are, however,  dangers\r\n\r\nin  elaborate  systems of welfare.  They are costly  for  the\r\n\r\nState and for the taxpayers.  Even for the recipients of  the\r\n\r\nwelfare,  there  is  a danger of creating dependency  and  of\r\n\r\ndamaging  self-worth and motivation.  The better approach  is\r\n\r\none that can both save but avoid ensnaring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I think we are at a bit of crossroads in\r\n\r\nthinking  about  the  future  of  our  society.   It  was  my\r\n\r\nprivilege  recently  to  chair  two  talks  at  the  National\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore where I teach.  One was by  DPM  Tony\r\n\r\nTan and the other by the Member for Potong Pasir, Mr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChiam  See Tong.  Mr Chiam, in his talk, emphasised the  need\r\n\r\nfor  welfarism, to think about how to take care of the  poor.\r\n\r\nDPM  Tony  Tan  emphasised the new  and  dynamic  changes  in\r\n\r\neducation  -  the only way to help give people the skills  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the challenges of the new economy.  Mr Chiam, I  think,\r\n\r\ntouched a sympathetic vein among some of the students.  But I\r\n\r\nthink DPM Tony Tan challenged them to look at the way forward\r\n\r\nand  how  to bring the whole society up, and this is  what  I\r\n\r\nmean by the challenges facing us as we go forward.  We should\r\n\r\nnot, in that sense, be thinking about a social safety net  or\r\n\r\nan elaborate welfare system.  We should instead be seeking to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  trampoline that would help save people when  they\r\n\r\nfall, but help them bounce quickly back up.  How can this  be\r\n\r\nconstructed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think we should focus on the individual. It is\r\n\r\ngood   that  the  Minister  proposes  doubling  the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning Endowment Fund, but the questions of how it will  be\r\n\r\nused  are still to be answered in full.  I think there  is  a\r\n\r\ndanger  that  this Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  will  be\r\n\r\noverly  bureaucratic and will favour those who  know  how  to\r\n\r\nfill up the forms properly and, in the first place, know what\r\n\r\nthey  want.  I think there has to be much more leeway in this\r\n\r\nFund,  so  that they can target people who truly  need  help.\r\n\r\nThere  should  be education bursaries specially targeted  for\r\n\r\nmature  students,  those  who  take  the  Government's   call\r\n\r\nseriously to go back and improve themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, the Government should also consider\r\n\r\nspecial  counselling for those who wish to upgrade themselves\r\n\r\nor  those who may be working in sectors that may, in  future,\r\n\r\nprove  vulnerable.  Because, how else will people  know  that\r\n\r\nthey  need  to take upgrading and what precisely should  they\r\n\r\ndo.   Studying,  say,  the arts may be of  interest  to  some\r\n\r\npeople,  but  they  may  not be   helpful  for  them  in  the\r\n\r\nparticular sector that will emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should also increase match-making services\r\n\r\nfor  employment.  I think, in this way, the counselling,  the\r\n\r\nmatch-making  and  the special grants for  mature  and  other\r\n\r\nspecial students will need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncooperation,   not  just  with  the  economic   agencies   of\r\n\r\nGovernment but those in charge of community.  In this  sense,\r\n\r\nI  hope we will see the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Community Development work much more closely together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of this need for counselling and the need\r\n\r\nfor  community  development, because of a taxi  ride  I  took\r\n\r\nrecently  back from the airport.  It was a late night  flight\r\n\r\nand  when  I  got  in, I was surprised to see  a  woman  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver.  After a while, we spoke and I found out that she was\r\n\r\na former assembly line supervisor.  The factory was upgrading\r\n\r\nand  she  had actually been offered retraining at  the  going\r\n\r\nrate of partial pay during the period of retraining, but  yet\r\n\r\nshe  chose to quit and to be a taxi driver.  There is nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  with being a taxi driver.  But, obviously, this  is  a\r\n\r\njob with  both independence and yet insecurity and one which,\r\n\r\nin her case, forced her to drive even later into the night to\r\n\r\nearn more money, and this despite the fact that she has young\r\n\r\nchildren.  Of course, everyone has the right to make his  own\r\n\r\ndecisions about his own life.  But I had to ask whether  this\r\n\r\nwas  actually wise, not just for her and her career  but  for\r\n\r\nthe  family  and  for the society.  And I hope  this  is  one\r\n\r\nexample  the Ministry will consider about needing to  counsel\r\n\r\nour  people  when it comes to thinking about rather  abstract\r\n\r\nthoughts  such as upgrading.  In the Singapore  of  tomorrow,\r\n\r\nthere  must be a place for everyone, but to help the process,\r\n\r\nwe  will  need  ushers  to  help  people  find  their  place.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  people will tend to bunch up at the back  and  no\r\n\r\none will sit in the front row.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in this sense, limits to centrally held funds\r\n\r\nand  Government initiatives, and I would urge the  Government\r\n\r\nto  go  beyond the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to  allow\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  take  ownership  over  their  own   lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning.  Government must neither pity nor pander to people.\r\n\r\nIt  must  empower them.  Measures that can help this  include\r\n\r\ntax  write offs or even the use of their CPF when individuals\r\n\r\ninvest in their own upgrading, training and education.   When\r\n\r\nthe Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund  cannot reach everyone, they can  reach  into\r\n\r\ntheir own resources and should be encouraged to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, beyond the individual, I join the call of many\r\n\r\nMPs  that Government can and should do more to help small and\r\n\r\nmedium enterprises.  Government agencies that deal with  SMEs\r\n\r\nshould be strengthened and, in some ways, be retooled.   Many\r\n\r\nof  the Government agencies, such as the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard,   are   very  used  to  working  with   multi-national\r\n\r\ncorporations  and big companies.  They are good  at  it,  but\r\n\r\nthis  is  what they are used to and there is a temptation  to\r\n\r\nmeasure their success by the number of big deals they do with\r\n\r\neven bigger figures.  It must be, however, more difficult and\r\n\r\nevery bit as important to help smaller companies even if  the\r\n\r\nfigures are not so impressive.  In this, specifically, I want\r\n\r\nto  mention the super business Chamber that the Government is\r\n\r\npromoting.   I  believe that when this is set up,  this  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  due  place for SMEs and local non-Government  linked\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Otherwise, this super Chamber will  risk  simply\r\n\r\nreinforcing some of the concerns that people have about  SMEs\r\n\r\nand private businesses in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my third point, Sir. The perception\r\n\r\ncontinues  that multi-nationals and GLCs unfairly  crowd  out\r\n\r\nSingapore  businesses.  These perceptions should be addressed\r\n\r\nif untrue, as the Minister for Trade and Industry has said in\r\n\r\na  recent sitting of Parliament.  If there is any element  of\r\n\r\ntruth in some sectors or in particular cases, this should  be\r\n\r\nredressed.  We have to ensure a playing field for  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises that is level and fair and that, in  some\r\n\r\nways,   understands  their  limitations  and  accepts   their\r\n\r\npotential as their entry point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also important because we are increasingly\r\n\r\nmoving   away  from  Government  regulation  to  Government's\r\n\r\ndependence  on markets.  After this sitting, we will  have  a\r\n\r\nlarge  debate about the deregulation of power and, of course,\r\n\r\nthat,  until  very recently, was thought to be  a  Government\r\n\r\nnatural monopoly.  Markets are fine things, but markets  need\r\n\r\nto be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndesigned.   Markets depend on free and fair competition  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  players.  Unless Government ensures that  markets\r\n\r\nare  open  and that the thresholds to entry are not too  high\r\n\r\nand  do  not block out SMEs, we will create not markets  that\r\n\r\nare  free  and fair but, unwittingly, we may create  cartels.\r\n\r\nThe  stickiness of fuel prices in the present climate  is  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  this that consumers feel every  day.   There  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be fair competition in this area  but  we  have\r\n\r\ntrouble if we try to actually find fair prices to reflect the\r\n\r\nlessening of fuel prices world wide.  Government, as a  major\r\n\r\nshareholder, should rein in GLCs who compete in  areas  where\r\n\r\nSMEs  and  start-ups are coming up.  These GLCs  should  stay\r\n\r\nwithin  their  key  focus areas, assuming they  have  thought\r\n\r\nabout these areas, and they should think long term and big.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One additional point, Sir, this time about larger\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The  Minister's Budget Statement has  emphasised\r\n\r\nthe  growing  diversification of the  Singapore  market.   In\r\n\r\nterms  of  its markets and products, the USA and disk  drives\r\n\r\nremain  important to Singapore, but now less so in proportion\r\n\r\nto other markets and other products.  Such diversification is\r\n\r\nvery  much  needed.  Europe, including Eastern Europe,  Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica  and  Asia,  especially  Korea  and  Japan,  will  be\r\n\r\nimportant to emphasise on the way ahead.  The way ahead  will\r\n\r\nbe  paved by Government, as we negotiate bilateral trade  and\r\n\r\nother  economic treaties, but the risks remain, and the risks\r\n\r\nwill  remain for the private sector to take.  Companies  that\r\n\r\ngo  out will have to take these risks.  Many were hit by  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  and they will be hit by future ones, as they  go  out\r\n\r\nagain to the region and the wider world.  Given this, I would\r\n\r\nask  the  Government to consider underwriting  part  of  that\r\n\r\nrisk.   Government should allow companies that go out to  set\r\n\r\noff overseas losses, if any, against Singapore-based profits.\r\n\r\nThis,  I  understand, is already allowed in some cases  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  double  taxation  agreement,  but  not  in  all\r\n\r\ncountries and, certainly, not enough of them for Singapore to\r\n\r\ngo  global and truly regional.  If certain conditions set  in\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensure the validity of these losses, the principle should  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  to more overseas ventures in new countries  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  these  can  be  linked to the  bilateral  trade  and\r\n\r\neconomic agreements that we are negotiating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are entering a world of greater risk and\r\n\r\ndiversity.  The Government's role is no longer to  drive  the\r\n\r\nengine, fuel the tanks as well as steer the ship.  It is more\r\n\r\na  matter now of stewardship and of empowering others to take\r\n\r\nthe  lead.  The Government is wise in saying we can no longer\r\n\r\nensure that we pick all the right winners.  The question  now\r\n\r\nis how we enable our people, our SMEs, our private sector and\r\n\r\nhow  we  enable  and create an environment that  can  support\r\n\r\nchange, their striving and their thriving.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget, as the\r\n\r\nlast  speaker has said, has been termed in some quarters,  as\r\n\r\nan election Budget and being very generous.  Of course, it is\r\n\r\ngenerous.  One can see that.  But the question that has to be\r\n\r\nasked  is:  is this generosity spread to all our people?   Is\r\n\r\nit  even  handedly spread or is there any neglect or uncaring\r\n\r\nattitude towards some sectors of the population?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, at the outset, reject completely the idea that it\r\n\r\nis  welfarism to take care of and to attend to the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthose   in  society  who  are  unable  to  afford  the  needs\r\n\r\nthemselves.  It is not welfarism.  It is to see that all  our\r\n\r\npeople,   regardless  of  their  wealth  or  their   poverty,\r\n\r\nregardless  of the level of their income, do not  go  without\r\n\r\nthe  basic  needs and necessities they need for  human  life.\r\n\r\nFor  that reason, Sir, I find the Budget lacking very  badly.\r\n\r\nI  have  no  quarrel with the tax cuts, with the rebates  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is being done to help the business sector.  But,  if  I\r\n\r\nmay  say  so, this Budget shows a callous disregard  for  the\r\n\r\nplight of at least 20%, or it may be even 30%, of our people,\r\n\r\nand it reflects the lack of any political will on the part of\r\n\r\nthis  Government to do anything for them.  I am,  of  course,\r\n\r\nreferring to the widening gap in our society between the rich\r\n\r\nand  the poor.  I do not think I need to tell the Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  that  if this widening gap is  not  checked  and\r\n\r\nsomething is done to rectify the widening gap,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe results for this society will be disastrous.  I hope such\r\n\r\na  thing  may  not  come to pass, but that there  will  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater  bonding, as the calls have been from the  Government\r\n\r\n-   we hear this again and again  -  a greater bonding of the\r\n\r\npeople together, a caring for all of them, not that some  are\r\n\r\nleft out and only some are cared for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Statistics released an occasional\r\n\r\npaper   in  May  of  last  year  drawing  attention  to   the\r\n\r\naccelerated widening of the gap between the rich and the poor\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  I spoke on this in this House  in  August  of\r\n\r\nlast  year  when  I  proposed a number of measures  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could take - not welfarism; I was  not  proposing\r\n\r\nhandouts  -  to remedy and to halt this widening gap  between\r\n\r\nthe rich and the poor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech\r\n\r\nreferred to this release by the Statistics Department of  the\r\n\r\nwidening  gap.  He seemed very upset by a photograph  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times showing a cleaner with a quote: \"I survive  on\r\n\r\n$133  a  month.\"  I hope the editor was suitably rebuked  and\r\n\r\ntold  not  to  write such nonsense.  But that  was  what  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Statistics reported -  that  persons  in  the\r\n\r\nbottom 10% of our society were only earning that amount.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister says that it is misleading, and he says  that\r\n\r\nno  cleaner  earns only $133 a month.  But when I spoke  last\r\n\r\nyear,  I referred to the statistics on wages and I said  that\r\n\r\nfor 1999, there were 14,700 workers earning less than $200  a\r\n\r\nmonth  and there were 33,700 earning less than $400 a  month.\r\n\r\nIs  the  Prime  Minister not aware of these statistics?   And\r\n\r\nthen  he  takes  up  what  has been  attempted  by  even  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Statistics, that the fact is that  the  bottom\r\n\r\n10%,  he  says, have a reasonable standard of living  -  they\r\n\r\nhave  their TV sets, they own their houses - so what  are  we\r\n\r\ncomplaining  about?  And he attributes the  widening  gap  to\r\n\r\nglobalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make it quite clear here that I do accept that in\r\n\r\nall  societies,  there must be a gap.  But the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  government is to see that the people at the  very  bottom\r\n\r\nlevel  are  not thereby left out completely.   Again,  may  I\r\n\r\nrepeat, that is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  welfarism,  that  is acting as a responsible  government\r\n\r\nwith  a  conscience.  The Prime Minister speaking then quoted\r\n\r\nPresident  Zedillo of Mexico.  And if I may  give  the  quote\r\n\r\nhere.   President  Zedillo  was replying  to  whether  wealth\r\n\r\nshould be spread more evenly and his reply apparently was:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"They are confused. You don't get better income\r\n\r\ndistribution  by taking from one and giving to another.   You\r\n\r\nget  better income distribution by empowering people to  have\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  to  share the benefits  of  development.   The\r\n\r\nwealth  will  be  better  distributed  as  long  as  we   are\r\n\r\nsuccessful  and  continue  to invest  heavily  in  education,\r\n\r\nhealth and programmes against extreme poverty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important part of his observation, may I say, is the\r\n\r\nlast sentence: \"The wealth will be better distributed as long\r\n\r\nas  we  are  successful  and continue to  invest  heavily  in\r\n\r\neducation,  health  and programmes against extreme  poverty.\"\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister  quoted him with approval,  but  stopped\r\n\r\nshort of that.  Is his Government adopting that advice, given\r\n\r\nby President Zedillo of Mexico?  It does not appear from this\r\n\r\nBudget  that  the  Government is indeed taking  that  bit  of\r\n\r\nadvice to heart - investing heavily in education, health  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes against extreme poverty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking about the figures given in the May\r\n\r\nrelease.  If one looks at the latest figures released by  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Statistics before the census report is out,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, you find that for the lowest 10%, the  average\r\n\r\nhousehold  income has dropped again to $61  per  month.   And\r\n\r\nthis, we are told, includes households where no member of the\r\n\r\nfamily is earning income.  But what are we to do about  these\r\n\r\npeople who are not earning any income?  The table goes on  to\r\n\r\ngive  the average income for households with income at  $459.\r\n\r\nThat is by no stretch of imagination enough to cater for  the\r\n\r\nneeds of these families.  We have to recognise - I have  said\r\n\r\nthis  time and time again - that Singapore is one of the most\r\n\r\nexpensive cities in the world now.  It ranks very high on the\r\n\r\nlist  of expensive countries or cities.  In the face of  this\r\n\r\ngrowing  cost of living, the lowest 10% are only  earning  an\r\n\r\naverage of $459 in household income per month.  I asked in my\r\n\r\nAugust\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspeech: has the Government made a study of how much a  family\r\n\r\nof four will need?  I had tried to give my figures and I said\r\n\r\nit  would  appear that at least $1,800 would be needed  by  a\r\n\r\nfamily of four.  But I am told by several people that is very\r\n\r\nlow, very conservative.  They need a lot more than that.  But\r\n\r\nif  you look at the latest figures released by the Department\r\n\r\nof  Statistics,  there are 30% of our people in  our  society\r\n\r\nhaving a household income of only $1,862 or less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is steadily slipping into a\r\n\r\ncountry of two nations, unless steps are taken to check this.\r\n\r\nThis  was  a term coined by a British Prime Minister  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of the last century.  And Singapore today  in  the\r\n\r\n21st  century  is  beginning to slip into a  country  of  two\r\n\r\nnations.   So  in the face of this grim reality presented  by\r\n\r\nthe statistics gathered by the Department of Statistics, what\r\n\r\ndo  we  have?   What  Budget  is  the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nproposing - a Budget that gives to those who already have and\r\n\r\nprecious little for the have-nots.  It would appear that  the\r\n\r\nmotto  or  object is to give to those who have  and  to  deny\r\n\r\nthose who have not anything, to deny them anything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance headlines in Part II or\r\n\r\nsomewhere in his Budget speech says, \"A place for everyone in\r\n\r\nSingapore\".  And he ends his Budget Statement with that  same\r\n\r\nphrase that, \"There is a place for everyone in Singapore . .\"\r\n\r\nWhen I saw that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I was reminded of two lines\r\n\r\nin a Christian hymn: \"The rich man in his castle and the poor\r\n\r\nman  at the gate.  The good Lord make them all.\"  So the poor\r\n\r\nman  has his place at the gate or somewhere down in the  cold\r\n\r\nwhereas  the rich man has a place in the sun.  They all  have\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  places, and that has  to  be  accepted  by\r\n\r\nsociety.  Do we?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would now propose to turn, knowing that I only have\r\n\r\nhalf  an  hour, to what the Budget does.  I see that we  have\r\n\r\nagain  managed to exceed the estimated surplus for  the  year\r\n\r\n2000.   We have managed to increase or put together a surplus\r\n\r\nof at least $1 billion more than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  was  estimated.  Great!  And for the year to come,  the\r\n\r\nestimated surplus is $4.37 billion.  May I ask, as I did ask,\r\n\r\nwhat comfort is this?  To the people in the 50% bottom of our\r\n\r\nsociety.  If you look at the provisions in the budget, and  I\r\n\r\nam looking only at the Main Estimates provisions provided for\r\n\r\noperating expenditure, what does one find?  That for  Health,\r\n\r\nwe are only spending $1.5 billion of our monies on health and\r\n\r\nthat   works  out  to  a  percentage  of  5.6  of  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   For  Education,  we  are  only  spending  $4.9\r\n\r\nbillion  working out to a proportion of 22.3%  of  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   But when one looks at the Defence expenditure,\r\n\r\none  finds  that we are spending $7.1 billion on Defence,  $2\r\n\r\nbillion   over  Education  and  $5.5  billion   over   Health\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this say about our priorities? That health\r\n\r\nranks  way  down  below  defence  of  the  country.   Is  not\r\n\r\nproviding that our people are healthy and well enough, also a\r\n\r\ndefence?   Is  it not necessary to defend our people  against\r\n\r\nattacks  of  ill  health, sickness, just as  much  as  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to defend the country against attacks from overseas\r\n\r\nor  abroad?   I  have questioned year in  and  year  out  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure on defence, and I am afraid I have not been given\r\n\r\na  satisfactory answer, and that view is not only mine, it is\r\n\r\nshared by several people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Minister for Defence goes to Europe, meets the\r\n\r\nAmerican   Defence   Secretary   and   talks   about    great\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  cooperation  between  the  US   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  defence  matters.   If  you  are  relying  on\r\n\r\nAmerican military might and we give them facilities, are they\r\n\r\ngoing to run away if there is any attack on this country?  So\r\n\r\nwhy  are  we at the same time increasing our defence spending\r\n\r\nyear by year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say a few words on health? Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nhealthcare is crippling for our people and I have asked  time\r\n\r\nand  time  again for a public health service in this country.\r\n\r\nAgain,  may  I  repeat that is not welfarism.   That  is,  as\r\n\r\nPresident Zedillo says, investing in our people.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nwelfarism.   There was a letter in the Straits Times  of  1st\r\n\r\nMarch from someone who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nasked  why  is it that the same medicine costs much  more  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  than  in Johor Baru and that they have  to  travel\r\n\r\nthere to get their medicine at almost a little over half  the\r\n\r\nprice.  Why is it that we cannot afford, from the monies that\r\n\r\nwe  have,  to see that those who are in need of medical  care\r\n\r\nget  the  proper medical care at a cost that they can  afford\r\n\r\nwithout having to go abroad to get medical care?  Is that not\r\n\r\ndemeaning ourselves if our citizens have to go abroad to  get\r\n\r\ncheaper   medical   care?   Is  that   not   abdicating   our\r\n\r\nresponsibility to them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked in this House that the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nprovides a costing, why it costs the Government to charge the\r\n\r\nfees  that  it  now charges.  That question was misunderstood\r\n\r\nand I was given an answer that all bills have a breakdown  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the costs are for.  It is time the Government presented\r\n\r\na  White Paper on Health and tell the people exactly how much\r\n\r\nit  costs  them  to  keep a patient in hospital.   I  am  not\r\n\r\ntalking  about  the first class, or the A  class  wards,  but\r\n\r\nabout the people in the C class.  Why is it necessary for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to charge $30 or more for a bed in the  C  class?\r\n\r\nWhy  is  it necessary for the Government to charge extra  for\r\n\r\nevery  other service given to the patient?  That is the  sort\r\n\r\nof  costing one should provide so that people may understand.\r\n\r\nBut nothing is done to explain the cost to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am very disappointed that health does not rank as a\r\n\r\npriority  with  this  Government.  I  am  aware,  as  I  said\r\n\r\npreviously,  that  there can be abuse.   I  have  proposed  a\r\n\r\nsocial security card system for people earning below $2,000 a\r\n\r\nmonth  so that their health is taken care of.  What is  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  that?  Why cannot the Government provide the funds  for\r\n\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may turn to Education. Yes, Education\r\n\r\nprovision has increased.  But it is still by no means enough.\r\n\r\nIt  does not match anywhere near the Defence provision.   Why\r\n\r\nis  it not possible, I have asked before and I ask again,  to\r\n\r\nsee that children from families earning below $2,000 can have\r\n\r\ntheir children educated without any cost to them, without any\r\n\r\nfees under whatever name it is called?  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  not  have  to  pay anything to  have  their  children\r\n\r\neducated.   That  way, we will be investing in  this  country\r\n\r\nbecause we have been told again and again that our people are\r\n\r\nthe only resources here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up 30\r\n\r\nminutes.  Dr Wang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans reacted very favourably to the generous tax cuts\r\n\r\nand other social transfers provided in the FY2001 budget.  In\r\n\r\nso far as providing tax relief is concerned, it is indeed the\r\n\r\nmost  generous  budget ever.  Enough has been said  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  plight  of  the  unemployed, the lower  income  and  the\r\n\r\nstruggling small businesses by Members preceding me and I  do\r\n\r\nnot intend to repeat their points.  However, Sir, I think  we\r\n\r\nwill  miss  the impetus of the Budget if we do not appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  two key objectives of the Government in presenting  this\r\n\r\nBudget.   Firstly, to position Singapore for the new  era  of\r\n\r\ngrowth   by  increasing  our  attractiveness  not   only   to\r\n\r\nbusinesses but also to individuals as a place to live and  to\r\n\r\nwork  in.   Secondly,  to  give every individual  worker  the\r\n\r\nwherewithal  to weather this difficult period of  transition,\r\n\r\nto   assist   promising  business  enterprises   in   getting\r\n\r\nestablished and to help businesses in dying trades shift  out\r\n\r\nto other industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Sir, it is important to measure the\r\n\r\nbudget  against these stated objectives and to determine  how\r\n\r\nfar this budget goes towards achieving these objectives.   As\r\n\r\nI  was  listening  to  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam,  I  was  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether    he    ever   takes   this   into    consideration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he has stepped out of the House.  So even if I\r\n\r\nwant  to address some of his points, he is not here to listen\r\n\r\nto  them.   But, nonetheless, let me touch on two  points  he\r\n\r\nbrought  up.   Mr  Jeyaretnam mentioned  about  the  widening\r\n\r\nincome gap and he said that the Prime Minister had attributed\r\n\r\nit to globalisation.  My question to him is whether he accept\r\n\r\nthis particular reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in the forefront of the IT\r\n\r\nindustry  and  I  can give a very good example  of  why  this\r\n\r\nincome gap widening is a universal phenomenon, and not just a\r\n\r\nphenomenon\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithin Singapore.  For instance, the United States government\r\n\r\nat  the behest of their IT industry had issued a new category\r\n\r\nof  visa called H1B Visas and it provided a quota of close to\r\n\r\n200,000   visas  per  year.   In  other  words,   since   its\r\n\r\nimplementation till five years hence, it will be able to suck\r\n\r\nin  close to one million IT professionals from throughout the\r\n\r\nworld.  Now, where do these people come from?  They are going\r\n\r\nto  come in from developing countries, such as India,  China,\r\n\r\nEastern European countries and even a few from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, if we had adopted policies that prevent our IT\r\n\r\nprofessionals  from  having better pay to  make  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nbetter  place for them to stay behind, then I think we  would\r\n\r\neven  face greater migration of our talented and young people\r\n\r\nto  magnets, like Silicon Valley.  Sir, a widening income gap\r\n\r\nis  a  global phenomenon, and Singapore is already in a  very\r\n\r\ngood  position  to  address  this problem,  compared  to  the\r\n\r\ncountries I have mentioned.  So the key issue is actually not\r\n\r\nto  look  at how we can prevent the widening income gap,  but\r\n\r\nhow  to  address  the  social and economic  structure  within\r\n\r\nSingapore as a result of the widening income gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mr Jeyaretnam did mention that, quoting from the\r\n\r\nPresident of Mexico, there are several factors that we should\r\n\r\naddress  in so doing:  firstly, education;  secondly, health;\r\n\r\nand,  thirdly, to address extreme poverty in a  society.   In\r\n\r\naddressing  education, he has always compared its expenditure\r\n\r\nwith that for defence, that defence expenditure is pegged  at\r\n\r\n5%,  whereas education is only 3.7%.  But however it may  be,\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam  does not realise that defence is  a  capital-intensive expenditure - weaponry, arms, equipment and so on - whereas education is a labour-intensive expenditure.   As  we\r\n\r\nstand today, our education expenditure stands at 3.7% of  the\r\n\r\nGDP,  and  the  Prime  Minister has  already  stated  in  his\r\n\r\nNational  Day Rally speech that it is his target to  increase\r\n\r\nthis expenditure to 4.5% of the GDP.  And, as Chairman of the\r\n\r\nGPC for Education, I can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsay that the Ministry is trying its very best to achieve this\r\n\r\ntarget and, I think, if we want to spend more money, the  MOE\r\n\r\nmight have indigestion on how to properly bring value to  the\r\n\r\nexpenditures.  Nonetheless, in the budget for the year  2001,\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  increase  of close  to  $500  million  in  MOE\r\n\r\nexpenditures.  So, Mr Jeyaretnam should consider  this  point\r\n\r\nbefore  he  keeps on repeating how to address the problem  of\r\n\r\nlow-income  citizens in Singapore, how do we help  the  lower\r\n\r\n30% in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the budget surpluses in our\r\n\r\nBudget.   For  many  years  now, I  have  observed  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  under  estimated  revenue  and  actually  over\r\n\r\nestimated expenditure.  I wonder whether this is a result  of\r\n\r\npoor  modelling or the result of very conservative behaviour,\r\n\r\nor  both.   Again, in the FY 2000 Budget, the revised  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus is $3.54 billion while the estimated surplus is $2.45\r\n\r\nbillion, a variation of close to $1.1 billion or 44.5%.   And\r\n\r\nthis   is   after   an   unplanned  $1.94  billion   one-time\r\n\r\ncompensation payment to the two telephone companies.   In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, Sir, this compensation should be treated in the same\r\n\r\ncategory  as  long-term capital transactions,  like  proceeds\r\n\r\nfrom  land  sales, and should have come out from a  long-term\r\n\r\nfund  rather than from our operating expenditures.  Thus,  if\r\n\r\nwe  take that into consideration, we should be looking  at  a\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus of close to $4.48 billion or a  variation  of\r\n\r\n120%.  This is, of course, already a big improvement from the\r\n\r\nFY99  budget,  when there was a variation of close  to  $9.98\r\n\r\nbillion  when the budget swung from a deficit of $5.1 billion\r\n\r\nto  a  surplus  of  $4.88 billion.  Sir,  I  understand  that\r\n\r\npredicting budget surplus or presenting budgets to Parliament\r\n\r\nis  a very tricky matter because so much of this is dependent\r\n\r\non  the GDP growth rate.  But the projections are so far  off\r\n\r\nthat it begs the question of how good we are in forecasting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, at a time when the Singapore Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nhas  been  urging public-listed companies to  disclose  their\r\n\r\nresults on a quarterly basis and these disclosures should  be\r\n\r\nas accurate as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npossible, should Parliament expect less of the Government  in\r\n\r\nthis  climate?   Maybe  we do not need quarterly  reports  on\r\n\r\nrevenue  and expenditure but, perhaps, it is not too much  to\r\n\r\nask for a more accurate budget forecast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that some of these variations in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  revenue result from the  under-spending  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure.  I also note, in the Report  of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates Committee, Parliament Paper No. 1 of 2001, that the\r\n\r\nMinistry has indeed imposed a reservation fee of close to  3%\r\n\r\nto  prevent  under-spending of development  expenditures.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to find out from the Minister whether this measure\r\n\r\nis  necessary and what is its effectiveness, and  whether  we\r\n\r\nare   promoting  undesirable  behaviour  within  the  various\r\n\r\nMinistries by forcing them to spend money when they could not\r\n\r\nspend  the money.  So, are we, in fact, forcing them to incur\r\n\r\nsome waste unnecessarily?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to have budget surpluses, and I am not\r\n\r\nagainst  budget  surpluses.  In  fact,  in  my  own  personal\r\n\r\nfinance,  my first principle is prudence, in other words,  to\r\n\r\nalways make sure that I have surpluses.  However, in managing\r\n\r\na  nation's  budget,  I  think we  should  delve  further  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  impact of budget surpluses on  the  nation's\r\n\r\neconomy.   Like  a  large vacuum cleaner, taxation  sucks  up\r\n\r\nliquidity  from the economy.  Mr Chay Wai Chuen  has  already\r\n\r\ntouched  upon  the  lack of growth in many  economic  sectors\r\n\r\nwhile  our  national GDP grew by 9.9% in the year  2000.   He\r\n\r\nalso  pointed out that the money supply did not seem to  grow\r\n\r\nvery  much  either.  I believe he had touched on a  very  key\r\n\r\npoint.   Perhaps the Minister should tell us the  correlation\r\n\r\nbetween budget surpluses and consumption by our citizens,  as\r\n\r\nevery dollar taxed is one dollar less in the pocket to spend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, if we just look at the budget surplus item\r\n\r\nin  the  Budget Book, we see the figures of $4.88 billion  in\r\n\r\n1999,  $3.54 billion in the year 2000, and $4.37  billion  in\r\n\r\nthe  year  2001.  But, Sir, these are actually the surpluses,\r\n\r\nafter provisions for Special Transfers.  And we must remember\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe money in these various endowment funds, including the CPF\r\n\r\nTop-Up  Scheme,  is  still removed from  circulation  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  as  the  principal sums remain  illiquid.   So,  to\r\n\r\nactually determine the impact on liquidity, we should look at\r\n\r\nthe  surplus  before Special Transfers.  And the numbers  now\r\n\r\nstand  at  $5.57 billion, $5.38 billion and $6.22 billion  in\r\n\r\nthe three years I have mentioned.  So, in three years, if  we\r\n\r\nadd  up  all  these  sums,  $17.17 billion  is  removed  from\r\n\r\ncirculation  in the local economy as, presumably,  these  are\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the Government Investment Corporation  (GIC),\r\n\r\nwhich in turn invests most of these surpluses overseas.  With\r\n\r\nthese surpluses hovering close to 3% of GDP year in and  year\r\n\r\nout,  it  begs the question whether we are locking  away  too\r\n\r\nmuch  money and, thereby, starving domestic demand.  Well,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  the  answer,  but  perhaps  the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nenlighten this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of looking at it is this: is the nation\r\n\r\nsaddled  with  too  heavy  a tax burden  through  direct  and\r\n\r\nindirect taxes?  I suspect the Minister must, in one  way  or\r\n\r\nanother, think likewise, as he is introducing structural  and\r\n\r\nlong-term  reductions in both income tax as well as corporate\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on corporate tax, Sir, as in previous years,\r\n\r\nthe Feedback Unit had conducted a series of dialogue sessions\r\n\r\nin  mid-January  2001  with the business  community  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public as a preview to the Budget.   I  chaired  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  language sessions on business.  The participants  of\r\n\r\nthe  sessions include various chambers of commerce, small and\r\n\r\nmedium enterprises, as well as selected corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unlike the previous year, the feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  the  business community is a bit lacklustre this  year.\r\n\r\nPresumably,  people are holding their breath for the  details\r\n\r\nof  the  Budget, after the Minister had dropped strong  hints\r\n\r\nabout   the   goodies  he  would  provide  in   the   Budget.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  many ideas were proposed in past  sessions  and\r\n\r\nthey  were yet to be implemented.  Nonetheless, we  can  draw\r\n\r\nsome general conclusions.  One\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  that the corporate tax in Singapore is already reasonable\r\n\r\nin  comparison with the regional countries.  So,  instead  of\r\n\r\nblanket  tax  reductions, the business community  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  looking  towards  specific tax  incentives  to  promote\r\n\r\nindustries targeted by the Government.  In this respect, Sir,\r\n\r\nit is interesting to note that the Minister has desisted from\r\n\r\nso doing this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reduction of corporate tax from\r\n\r\n25.5%  to  24.5%  is  a  surprise  since  we  had  been  told\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  that our long-term corporate tax target  is  25%.\r\n\r\nBearing  in  mind  that it was 26% only two  years  ago,  the\r\n\r\nreduction  is,  indeed, rather aggressive.  The  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether   the  \"tax  haven\"  provisions  in  many   developed\r\n\r\ncountries  would  be triggered by this reduction.   And  this\r\n\r\nhas,  indeed, been touched upon by Mr Iswaran earlier.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to join him by asking the Minister what  is  the\r\n\r\nimpact  on  multinational companies (MNCs) in Singapore  that\r\n\r\nwould  be affected by this tax haven provision in their  home\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the persistent requests from the business\r\n\r\ncommunity is the suggestion to tax, at a lower rate,  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies  or  start-up companies to  help  them  find  their\r\n\r\nfooting.  We were reminded repeatedly that Britain has such a\r\n\r\ntax  incentive for small companies.  I am very glad  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister has finally responded favourably  to  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion  and, not only that, he has gone one  step  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  expectation of the business community by  introducing  a\r\n\r\nprogressive  scale into the corporate tax structure,  thereby\r\n\r\nbenefiting all companies, large and small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on personal income tax, I would say that the\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  by the Minister in reducing personal  income\r\n\r\ntax  rate across all brackets are very generous.  I hope that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a one-off measure but is the start of  a  trend\r\n\r\ntowards  lower  personal income tax rates.   Hopefully,  this\r\n\r\nwill  remove whatever disincentive to the individual to exert\r\n\r\ngreater effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general comment received in the dialogue sessions\r\n\r\norganised by the Feedback Unit is that the direct tax  burden\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is actually relatively low, but there are  many\r\n\r\nindirect taxes based on consumption.  These include GST, COE,\r\n\r\nvehicle  import duties, ARF, property tax and so on.   As  an\r\n\r\nend result, for the high-income earners desirous of a certain\r\n\r\nlifestyle,  such  as  car  ownership  and  living  in  landed\r\n\r\nproperties, the total tax burden is, indeed, rather high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister has made appropriate\r\n\r\nadjustments  to the income tax structure so as not  to  deter\r\n\r\nstrive and enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in good years with healthy budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses,  the  Minister  has been consistent  in  providing\r\n\r\nprovisions  into  the  various  endowment  funds,   such   as\r\n\r\nElderCare,  Medicare,  as  well  as  the  Lifelong   Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment Fund.  This year, he has done the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like at this point to touch\r\n\r\nupon  the  survival  of  these  endowment  funds  after   the\r\n\r\ndissolution   of   Parliament.   Under   the   Constitutional\r\n\r\namendment  to  preserve  past reserves,  once  Parliament  is\r\n\r\ndissolved, the net budget surpluses of the present Government\r\n\r\nover its tenure would have gone into past reserves and, thus,\r\n\r\nlocked  away  from the reach of the next incoming government.\r\n\r\nOn   the   other  hand,  the  endowment  funds  survive   the\r\n\r\ndissolution of Parliament and remain accessible to  the  next\r\n\r\nincoming government, at least the interest generated by these\r\n\r\nendowment  funds.   I understand that the  principal  sum  is\r\n\r\nstill  under  the stewardship of the Ministry of Finance  and\r\n\r\nit, thus, forms part of the past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have is: would there be a proliferation\r\n\r\nof  such  endowment funds, as additional specific  needs  are\r\n\r\nidentified by the Government?  Furthermore, since we only use\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  these endowment funds  to  meet  operating\r\n\r\nexpenditures,  the  principal sums of these  endowment  funds\r\n\r\nwould have to be quite substantial.  Take, for instance,  the\r\n\r\nLifelong Learning Endowment Fund.  The principal sum has been\r\n\r\nincreased to $1 billion in order to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngenerate  $40 million to fund the activities of the  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting to observe is that these\r\n\r\ndisbursements from the funds are actually off-Budget, as they\r\n\r\ndo  not show up in the line items of the Ministries involved.\r\n\r\nAt  this  point  in  time, these items are  still  relatively\r\n\r\nsmall,  and do not distort the total Government expenditures.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, they are not pittance and should, in  principle,\r\n\r\nbe  subject to parliamentary scrutiny.  For instance, Members\r\n\r\nof  this House do not know the amount actually paid out  from\r\n\r\neach  endowment fund over the years even though we have close\r\n\r\nto  $32 million and $30 million in the Medical Endowment Fund\r\n\r\nand  the  ElderCare  Endowment Fund  respectively.   I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Minister provide a table somewhere  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget Book showing the actual disbursements of each of these\r\n\r\nendowment  funds.  The other question I have is  whether  the\r\n\r\namounts  yielded by the various endowment funds count towards\r\n\r\nthe  limit  of  not more than 50% of the NII  that  could  be\r\n\r\nallocated towards the operating revenue of the Government.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister could enlighten the House in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I sit down, I would like to make some\r\n\r\ncomments  on  NII,  one of my favourite subjects.   With  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional amendment clearly defining part of the NII  as\r\n\r\noperating revenue, the NII contribution, a new item, which is\r\n\r\nthe spendable part of the NII, is now moved above the line in\r\n\r\nour  budget  presentation.  In the  previous  year,  NII  was\r\n\r\nplaced below the line.  Then, new money from tax revenue  was\r\n\r\nspent before there was a need to tap more money from the  NII\r\n\r\nand  therefore,  the so-called new money was segregated  from\r\n\r\nthe  old  money.  However, in this new presentation, the  new\r\n\r\nmoney  and  old money got mixed together.  Like  a  glass  of\r\n\r\nwater,  once  mixed, it is one and the same.  In effect,  NII\r\n\r\ncontribution  now  forms part of the Government  revenue  and\r\n\r\nbecomes  indistinguishable from other sources of income.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as long as the budget surplus at the bottom line  is\r\n\r\nstill  greater than the NII contribution, we really have  not\r\n\r\ntapped  into the NII yet.  Nonetheless, this is more  than  a\r\n\r\nchange in presentation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  is a change in mindset.  So by mixing the old money  with\r\n\r\nthe  new,  the  Government seems to have  overcome  a  mental\r\n\r\nhurdle  to  tap into the investment income generated  by  our\r\n\r\npast reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having set that aside, I have several questions\r\n\r\nregarding  the  NII numbers shown in Table 1  of  the  Budget\r\n\r\nBook.   The  revised NII for the year 2000 is  $1.55  billion\r\n\r\nwhile  the  estimated NII contribution for  FY2001  is  $0.86\r\n\r\nbillion,  a decrease of 44.7%.  I am interested to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhat accounts for the decrease.  Are we foreseeing a dramatic\r\n\r\ndecrease in NII as a result of some poor performance  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Investment  Corporation  which  is  tasked   with\r\n\r\ninvesting  our reserves?  The Minister also did not  disclose\r\n\r\nwhat percentage these numbers represent.  In other words, how\r\n\r\nmuch  is $1.55 billion out of the total NII, and how much  is\r\n\r\n$0.86 billion out of the NII for the coming year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the Constitution stipulates that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should set aside at least 50% of the NII  as  part\r\n\r\nof  the past reserves.  The Finance Minister has disclosed in\r\n\r\nthis  House that NII for year 2000 was 3.5% of our GDP.  That\r\n\r\nwould  translate to $5.94 billion in that year, using figures\r\n\r\nin  the public domain.  Thus, by our own computation, the NII\r\n\r\ncontribution in FY2000 was only 26%.  Assuming that  the  NII\r\n\r\nremains  at about $6 billion, then $0.86 billion in the  next\r\n\r\nyear,  FY2001,  would only come to 14%, much  less  than  the\r\n\r\nmandatory requirements.  My question to the Minister is:   on\r\n\r\nwhat basis does the Government decide how many percent of the\r\n\r\nNII is transferred to the operating expenditure each year?  I\r\n\r\nactually  would  like to understand the  basis  they  use  to\r\n\r\ndecide on these numbers.  I think it will help this House  to\r\n\r\ngain   a  better  grasp  of  the  budget,  which  is  already\r\n\r\ncomplicated.   To  me, as it stands, the NII contribution  in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  Book seems like a book-keeping entry,  balancing\r\n\r\nthe  various figures so that the annual surplus does not look\r\n\r\nso  high  and attract undue attention.  Perhaps, the Minister\r\n\r\ncan correct my impression on this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have done well as an economy. This is not by\r\n\r\naccident but is the outcome\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   a   strong  partnership  between  the  people  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The  Government  contributes  by   implementing\r\n\r\nfarsighted and consistent policies. The people responded with\r\n\r\ncommitments to their jobs and to the nation.  I believe  with\r\n\r\nthe   new  Budget  philosophy  outlined  by  the  Government,\r\n\r\nSingapore will continue to prosper for many years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing\r\n\r\nme  to  join in the debate.  I shall be precise in  terms  of\r\n\r\nwhat I have to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, listening to what my parliamentary colleagues have\r\n\r\nto  say over two days, I must say that many of them have made\r\n\r\nsuggestions to improve the budget, and some of them have,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  asked  for additional provisions for the budget.   All\r\n\r\nthis  seems  very  interesting.  I would also  join  them  to\r\n\r\nsuggest some improvements to the budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is possible because we are making a\r\n\r\nsurplus and we are able to improve the provisions.  But then,\r\n\r\nI  was  thinking  aloud  that if we  are  not  able  to  have\r\n\r\nadditional surpluses, what should we all be talking about?  I\r\n\r\nthink that is equally important because we may not be able to\r\n\r\nask for all these provisions which we have articulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that this is the first time that I am hearing the\r\n\r\nNCMP  was  not asking for welfarism because all the time,  he\r\n\r\nhas  been  asking for welfarism, but now he has  changed  his\r\n\r\ntune.   He is not here.  I think we have to understand  basic\r\n\r\neconomics  in the sense that unless we are able  to  generate\r\n\r\nwealth,  there is nothing to distribute, there is nothing  to\r\n\r\ngive  away.   And in many governments, they are not  able  to\r\n\r\ngenerate wealth and one would be lucky if they do not ask you\r\n\r\nto  come up with more money and empty your pockets.   And  in\r\n\r\nmany  places,  this  has happened and  we  should  thank  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance for having maintained a very  positive\r\n\r\nbudget, a very sound economic policy over the last number  of\r\n\r\nyears  that I know of.  He has, in fact, presented very sound\r\n\r\nbudget policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental fact that we cannot detract from.  Unless\r\n\r\nwe  are  able to generate a surplus, then all the suggestions\r\n\r\nand what we have will come to nought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to commend the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nDr  Richard Hu, for the pro-active Budget for year  2001.   I\r\n\r\nhave heard him since I was a parliamentarian in this House in\r\n\r\n1984  and  since then, he has presented very sound  financial\r\n\r\npolicies which have helped Singapore to weather some  of  the\r\n\r\nturbulent economic storms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say this year's Budget is both pro-people\r\n\r\nand  pro-business.   Many Singaporeans and  small  businesses\r\n\r\nhave benefited in big and small ways from the tax changes and\r\n\r\nother  provisions.  I hope the Minister would have been  more\r\n\r\ngenerous towards the low-income families and the elderly  who\r\n\r\nare   and  still  will  be  most  affected  by  the  economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring   and  transition.   As  can  be   noted,   the\r\n\r\nunemployment rate last year has increased from 1.5%  to  3.5%\r\n\r\nand  retrenchments,  although lower by  about  1,700  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond quarter of the year 2000, are still looming.  As  more\r\n\r\nlabour-intensive industries are expected to  relocate,  there\r\n\r\nwould  be more job losses and because of relocation, I expect\r\n\r\nthe  semi-skilled  and  unskilled  workers  would  likely  be\r\n\r\naffected most.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not too late for the Minister to consider further\r\n\r\nreliefs and rebates for them.  I would urge him to look  into\r\n\r\na  number  of  areas  seriously.   First,  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nmonitoring  and control mechanism for increase of charges  of\r\n\r\npublic  services.  There have been increases  in  charges  of\r\n\r\npublic services, such as healthcare, education, transport and\r\n\r\nutilities.  Some  of  these  increases  are  necessary.   But\r\n\r\nbecause most of the public services have been restructured or\r\n\r\ncorporatised, there is a potential danger that profit motives\r\n\r\ncan become an overriding factor and this, I think, we have to\r\n\r\nbe  on  the  watch out.  We have to monitor and look  at  the\r\n\r\nimpact, particularly on the average working class families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences would be that these services can become\r\n\r\nless affordable and accessible to the ordinary working class\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamilies.  It is now more urgent for the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nto  examine  the  cost-effectiveness of the  public  services\r\n\r\nprovided  and to monitor the overcharging for public services\r\n\r\ndelivered by restructured Government organisations.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  find  out  if  there is a  monitoring  and  control\r\n\r\nmechanism  put in place by the Ministry of Finance  or  other\r\n\r\nrelated  Ministries.  Such a monitoring  and  control  system\r\n\r\ncan,  when  necessary,  apply  brakes  on  runaway  increases\r\n\r\nimposed  by restructured Government agencies and I feel  that\r\n\r\nit  is  time that we looked at this issue more seriously  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be a control board to examine  the  cost-effectiveness  of  these services.   Are  they  really  cost-effective or are they spending in areas which do not  produce\r\n\r\nany  direct  benefit to the consumers, or are  the  consumers\r\n\r\nthemselves  getting  their dollars  worth  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nservices  which are provided by these corporatised Government\r\n\r\nagencies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue of concern is inflation. With the\r\n\r\nrecent  price  increases in goods and services, is  inflation\r\n\r\nkept under control?  Would there be an inflationary trend  in\r\n\r\nthe  near future?  All these price inflations can affect  the\r\n\r\npurchasing  power of our working class.  I want to  find  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister if he would be able to let us know whether\r\n\r\ninflation would be expected this year and by how much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on higher transfer of Utilities Save\r\n\r\nand  rebates  for low-income families.  There  is  a  concern\r\n\r\nabout  widening income gap.  This has been addressed  through\r\n\r\neducation and skills training of young Singaporeans and older\r\n\r\nworkers.  With  better educational support and opportunities,\r\n\r\nit  is  envisaged  that, in future, the  income  gap  can  be\r\n\r\nmediated or reduced.  There is always an income gap  but  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  how wide that gap is going to be,  and  various\r\n\r\nefforts  need  to be made to intervene, re-distribute  or  to\r\n\r\nmake  transfers  so that the less better off  would  have  an\r\n\r\nequal  opportunity to be in the race and to be able  to  make\r\n\r\nit.   However,  in the meanwhile, we should  be  a  bit  more\r\n\r\ngenerous by way of transfers and rebates to help the  36%  of\r\n\r\nHDB families living in 1-, 2- and 3-room\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflats.   These  families, whose incomes  have  not  increased\r\n\r\nsignificantly because of economic restructuring and  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown  in the past, have an increased burden to cope  with\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood.   The  Utilities Save  of  $350  could  be\r\n\r\nincreased to $480 as the power bill has gone up by about  70-90% since its revision.  The SC&CC charges and rental rebates\r\n\r\ncould  be revised and increased between $10-$25 for 3- to  1-room  HDB households.  For the elderly who are more concerned\r\n\r\nfor  healthcare,  a higher top-up of their  Medisave  account\r\n\r\nwith  a wider range of usage other than hospitalisation cost,\r\n\r\nwould  be  helpful.   I think there is  a  need  to  look  at\r\n\r\nMedisave  usage and whether this usage could be applied  more\r\n\r\nflexibly.  This would be most helpful to the elderly who  are\r\n\r\nretired and who have less savings in their CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for CPF top-ups, we should find ways to reach out to\r\n\r\nthe  210,000  persons who did not top up for  one  reason  or\r\n\r\nanother,  and  help them to benefit from  the  share  of  our\r\n\r\nnation's progress.  Community groups can help to provide them\r\n\r\nwith  assistance for the top-up and perhaps CPF can work with\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisations to see how we  could  reach  out  to\r\n\r\nthese people who have not benefitted from such a scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to talk about low-income\r\n\r\npensioners, because I have been discussing this issue year in\r\n\r\nand  year  out,  and I hope that this year the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  will  be able to hear me out this time  again.   The\r\n\r\nincrease  of  the  Singapore allowance by $10  is  really  so\r\n\r\nmeagre,  and  I  would  say that it is  paltry.   Surely  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  be bigger-hearted by demonstrating  that  it\r\n\r\nstill  cares for the pensioners.  I know Government cares for\r\n\r\nthe  pensioners.   It can care a bit more,  by  demonstrating\r\n\r\nthat  it  can  make  the adjustment by  more  than  $10.   An\r\n\r\nincrease is deserving, Sir.  Perhaps a $30 increase would  be\r\n\r\na more positive gesture.  More particularly, those low-income\r\n\r\npensioners, who get less than the public assistance  rate  of\r\n\r\n$200  per month, should deserve attention, as they have given\r\n\r\nsterling  services  to our society.  They cannot  be  treated\r\n\r\nworse  off  than  our  public  assistance  recipients.    The\r\n\r\nMinister should redress this anomaly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter that I would like to bring up is\r\n\r\nthat I was listening to Mr Chng Hee Kok who talked about  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower's website, and the need for  people  to\r\n\r\ncheck  on  the status or the validity of the work  permit  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   I was quite interested in this issue and I  wanted\r\n\r\nto know whether the Ministry is keeping an update on this.  I\r\n\r\nwent  to the website and I was able to see that we can  check\r\n\r\nnot  only  on the validity of the work permits but all  other\r\n\r\ninformation which are required can be obtained.  I think good\r\n\r\nprogress  has been made, because now people who are concerned\r\n\r\nabout  illegal workers will be able to do this check  through\r\n\r\nthe Ministry's website itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last issue that I would like to raise is that aside\r\n\r\nfrom  the status of pensioners, there have been recent  views\r\n\r\nto  compare  the position of MPs with board of  directors  of\r\n\r\nprivate companies.  Such a comparison and viewpoint,  to  me,\r\n\r\nis  not  only  erroneous  but misplaced.   It  is  just  like\r\n\r\ncomparing   apples  with  oranges.   Would  my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  want to equate their public office  with  company\r\n\r\ndirectors?   Surely not.  I am sure Members do  not  want  to\r\n\r\ndemean  their MP's office by comparing themselves to a  board\r\n\r\nof  directors.   I am sure Members agree with me that they do\r\n\r\nnot  want  their MP's office to be associated with  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors,  would they?   On their behalf, I will say  surely\r\n\r\nnot.   MPs are elected lawmakers to public office by  popular\r\n\r\nmandate  and  in  the  case of board of directors,  they  are\r\n\r\nappointed by a group of shareholders to private office.   MPs\r\n\r\nare  elected  to  public office and a board of  directors  is\r\n\r\nelected to private office.  There is a mile of difference  on\r\n\r\nthis  issue.  Sir, I am sure you will agree with me  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not allow anyone to demean the status of MPs and  the\r\n\r\npublic  office should be held in high esteem.  And I am  sure\r\n\r\nall  my parliamentary colleagues would agree with me on  this\r\n\r\nviewpoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the penultimate paragraph of Dr Richard Hu's\r\n\r\nStatement describes succinctly the intent of his Budget and I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is a place for everyone in Singapore, and\r\n\r\neveryone  will benefit from good governance.   It  will  take\r\n\r\neffort  and  even a fair amount of difficulty to reach  where\r\n\r\nwe,  as  a  nation,  want to get to.  This Budget  serves  to\r\n\r\nencourage everyone to stay united and succeed together.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certainly, Dr Hu's Budget has been well received\r\n\r\nand  certainly  they  have seen that good  governance  indeed\r\n\r\nmeans  greater  surplus, and greater surplus  is  shared  and\r\n\r\ndistributed  amongst all Singaporeans.  But,  certainly,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  take  much  greater  effort  to  bring  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to reach where we want to achieve as  a  nation.\r\n\r\nI will touch on this later in my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu's Budget can really be divided into two\r\n\r\ncategories:   one,  a  group  of  tax  measures   that   will\r\n\r\nfundamentally  restructure the approach to  the  tax  regime;\r\n\r\nthe  other is a group of measures that are one-off in  nature\r\n\r\nthat  benefit a wide cross-section of Singaporeans.   On  the\r\n\r\nfirst  category, significant changes have been  made  to  the\r\n\r\npersonal  income  tax, corporate tax and the  employee  stock\r\n\r\noption  scheme.   The changes in personal income  tax  are  a\r\n\r\nrecognition by the Government to reward individual effort and\r\n\r\nsacrifice, and sacrifice during the economic crisis where CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution had been reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite a sterling 9.9% growth last year, many in the\r\n\r\nprivate sector feel that the recovery is patchy and therefore\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  restoration should be more gradual.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, workers cannot understand why the Government is slow to\r\n\r\nrestore   the  CPF.   Therefore,  the  personal  income   tax\r\n\r\nreduction,  the rebates and other goodies announced  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget  are the best ways for the Government to satisfy  both\r\n\r\nemployers   and   workers.   While  the  2%  across-the-board\r\n\r\nreduction  in income tax is most welcome, there are  concerns\r\n\r\nin many quarters as to whether this 2% reduction is a prelude\r\n\r\nto  an increase in GST of, say, 2% perhaps by the end of next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the corporate tax reduction, coupled with the tax\r\n\r\nexemption,  will help SMEs who are marginally  profitable  to\r\n\r\nthrive  and  to help them expand their businesses.   This  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  welcome  as, in the past, many  foreign  companies\r\n\r\nwere  indeed  the  beneficiaries  of  tax  holidays  and  tax\r\n\r\nexemptions, and only a select few local companies benefitted.\r\n\r\nThese  changes will help many SMEs who would find that  their\r\n\r\neffective tax rates would be significantly lower. Sir, at the\r\n\r\nsame time, it is possible that the tax exemption scheme would\r\n\r\nlead  to  more  associate companies being  set  up  to  split\r\n\r\nincomes.   Is  there  a concern for the  Government,  as  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement has been  quite silent on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's robust 1% corporate tax reduction\r\n\r\ncomes  at  a time when many of our regional competitors  have\r\n\r\nalso  been  reducing  their tax rates  in  order  to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  direct  investments.  This reduction  by  Government\r\n\r\nseems to signal a change in the Government's past thinking of\r\n\r\nnot  making Singapore a tax haven.  In this regard,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Finance Minister what is Singapore's  medium\r\n\r\nterm target at which the corporate tax will be set at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second group of measures, the one-off goodies\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  given  this year,  have  indeed  been  most\r\n\r\ngenerous.   Many Singaporeans have expressed their  happiness\r\n\r\nin  this  regard.   These are like a  little  bonus  to  many\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  as it will help in some measure to reduce  their\r\n\r\nhousehold expenditure.  But beyond that, their happiness will\r\n\r\nwane  soon,  as their worries of a long-term livelihood  will\r\n\r\ntake root.  Families whose household income is between $2,000-$3,000  or  less comprise many unskilled workers  working  in\r\n\r\nMNCs  or SMEs, many shopowners, hawkers, sole proprietors  of\r\n\r\nsmall service companies, small contractors and so on.  With a\r\n\r\nstronger dollar and higher wage cost, more and more MNCs  are\r\n\r\ngoing to move their manufacturing plants to other lower  cost\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  region.  As Dr  Vasoo  has  pointed  out,\r\n\r\nretrenchments  are becoming a regular feature for  the  lower\r\n\r\nskilled  workers,  especially  those  working  in  the  MNCs.\r\n\r\nNearly half of our workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork  in the SMEs.  Many of them work for companies with less\r\n\r\nthan  10 people.  A lot of them work for 2-men, 3-men or  4-5\r\n\r\nmen companies.  These workers are largely unskilled and often\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  the opportunity or the urge to go  for  skills\r\n\r\ntraining  or retraining.  Many such companies have  not  been\r\n\r\ndoing well in the past few years since the economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members of this House have spoken about the plight\r\n\r\nof the HDB shop retailers.  But what about the many provision\r\n\r\nshopkeepers in non-HDB shophouses?  What about the many  sole\r\n\r\nproprietors  owning small service outlets?   What  about  the\r\n\r\nhawkers,  the  market stallholders and the small contractors?\r\n\r\nThese   people's  livelihood  are  at  stake  too.   A  small\r\n\r\ncontractor told me at the meet-the-people session  this  week\r\n\r\nthat the construction industry is indeed in a bad shape.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  last week he went for a show around for  a  small\r\n\r\ncontract  tender  and  found that there  were  more  than  40\r\n\r\ncontractors who had turned up just for a contract that is not\r\n\r\nworth  more  than $40,000-$50,000, and there  were  many  big\r\n\r\nplayers  there as well.  He said that this is  indeed  a  bad\r\n\r\nsign for the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu had said that the construction industry will turn\r\n\r\naround this year, but many in the industry that members of my\r\n\r\nGPC  spoke  to are sceptical of a turn around, and  are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned   that  the  Ministry  of  National   Development's\r\n\r\nexpenditure has been reduced and this is going to  hurt  them\r\n\r\neven more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plight of our small enterprises is indeed very\r\n\r\nworrying.   On  its  part, the Government has  done  well  to\r\n\r\nallocate significant amounts of money for skills training and\r\n\r\nlifelong learning.  The Ministry of Manpower has done well to\r\n\r\nunveil a comprehensive Manpower 21 Vision.  Many workers have\r\n\r\nbeen  reached  through  these schemes.   Many  more  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially  vulnerable  workers,  need  to  be  reached   and\r\n\r\nretrained  and  reskilled  for  them  to  remain  employable.\r\n\r\nOften,  the  problem is that the most vulnerable workers  are\r\n\r\noften  the last ones to be reached and, more often,  are  the\r\n\r\nones who refuse to be trained.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have more than 500,000 Singaporean workers in\r\n\r\nour  workforce  who  do not have a secondary  education.   Of\r\n\r\nthese,  approximately 180,000-200,000 do not have  a  primary\r\n\r\neducation  and  they  are  largely aged  between  30-49,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore they will have to make a living for themselves  and\r\n\r\ntheir families for many more years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Hu has said, it will take effort and even a fair\r\n\r\namount  of difficulty to reach that we, as a nation, want  to\r\n\r\nget  to.   The Government must go beyond providing money  for\r\n\r\ntraining  and  giving one-off Budget goodies.  It  must  have\r\n\r\ngreater  compassion and greater commitment to  level  up  the\r\n\r\nlower  strata of our society.  Like the call by Mrs Lim  Hwee\r\n\r\nHua, it must do much more on public education on what we want\r\n\r\nto  achieve as a nation.  It must rally our citizens to  help\r\n\r\nthem  cope  with the impending changes of our economy.   Only\r\n\r\nthen  can  we stay united as one nation and face the external\r\n\r\nchallenges confronting us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the 2001 Budget is a very generous  one.   The\r\n\r\nheadline on the Lianhe Wanbao of 24th February mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was giving away 12 angpows:  six  pro-people\r\n\r\nangpows, three pro-business angpows and three others, in  the\r\n\r\nform of Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, Eldercare Fund  and\r\n\r\nMedifund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt this Budget is generous, but when I spoke to my\r\n\r\nconstituents, they have still some comments to  make,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to feed back these comments to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance for his consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with the Utilities Save scheme, the\r\n\r\nthree-tier family and the CPF Top-up Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utilities Save scheme is very popular among the\r\n\r\npeople,  but  there is a general feeling  that  this  is  not\r\n\r\nextensive  enough  to cover everybody.   The  Utilities  Save\r\n\r\nrebates  are  only confined to the 1- to 5-room families  and\r\n\r\nexclude those living\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  executive  flats,  private apartments,  condominiums  and\r\n\r\nlanded property.  Because of the increase in utilities rates,\r\n\r\npeople  have  to pay more for water and electricity.   So  to\r\n\r\nlighten  the burden of the people, rebates are given to  some\r\n\r\ncitizens.   To  some  extent,  this  would  indeed  help  the\r\n\r\nresidents in the HDB housing estates.  But those residing  in\r\n\r\nprivate   property  are  excluded  from  this  scheme.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  think that those living in private  property\r\n\r\nwould benefit from the tax rebates or tax cuts.  But not  all\r\n\r\nresidents   in  private  estates  are  high-income   earners.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  not  all  people living  in  the  public  housing\r\n\r\nestates  are  low-income earners.  Our  utilities  are  on  a\r\n\r\nstandard  rate.  Irrespective of private or HDB estates,  the\r\n\r\nelectricity  and water tariffs are the same.  Therefore,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  distinguish people by the type of property they  live\r\n\r\nin.    The  Government should apply the principle  of  \"equal\r\n\r\nmisery  and  equal  prosperity\", so that  all  families  will\r\n\r\nproportionately enjoy some utilities rebates.  The amount  of\r\n\r\nrebates may not be large, but at least all the residents  can\r\n\r\nget  some  benefit and be appreciative to the Government  for\r\n\r\nsharing  the  budget surplus with them.  I  believe  the  end\r\n\r\nbenefit to the Government will far surpass the cost incurred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people first heard about the rebates on\r\n\r\nutilities, they were all smiles.   But when they received the\r\n\r\nutilities bill later on, the smiles disappeared, because  all\r\n\r\nthe utilities rates were increased.  Recently, when I visited\r\n\r\nmy  constituents, I came across a young couple living in a 4-room  flat.  They told me that they used to pay     only  $50\r\n\r\nto  $60 per month for utilities but now it has been increased\r\n\r\nto about $80 or $90 -- an increase of about 40%.  I explained\r\n\r\nto  them that after July, a $30 rebate will be given  to  the\r\n\r\nfamily  for  a  period of 10 months and it will  be  able  to\r\n\r\noffset the increases.   They were so happy about it and  they\r\n\r\nthanked  the  Government for helping to reduce their  burden.\r\n\r\nBut  the  family  living opposite was not so fortunate.   The\r\n\r\nresidents told me that they used to pay between $100 and $150\r\n\r\nper  month  in utilities bill.  Now it has jumped  to  around\r\n\r\n$220,  and  the last bill was a hefty $311.  For a family  of\r\n\r\nthree to pay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore than  $300 for utilities seems to be on the high side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be something wrong with the new\r\n\r\nsoftware  used by Power Supply last year.  I would appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to make a thorough study into the matter and\r\n\r\ncompensate  the  consumers for all the  amounts  overcharged.\r\n\r\nThe  problem should be tackled at its roots and not  just  on\r\n\r\nthe  surface.   Otherwise, all these  rebates  given  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  the residents will be nothing more  than  the\r\n\r\nTokuhon  (Japanese medical plaster) applied on  the  skin  to\r\n\r\nprovide  temporary relief to the trauma within.  It will  not\r\n\r\neradicate the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will deal with the 3-tier family bonus. In this\r\n\r\nBudget,  there  are  different packages for  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  categories of people, much to the delight  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   Taxpayers should be happy with the 10% tax  rebate.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  seems to be no goodies for  those  who  have\r\n\r\nresponded  to  the  Government's  appeal  to  forming  3-tier\r\n\r\nfamilies.  With our population ageing more rapidly,  quite  a\r\n\r\nlot  of problems have arisen. These problems must be resolved\r\n\r\nearly.   Many  young  Singaporeans  have  responded  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's call to set up 3-tier family so that the old and\r\n\r\nthe  young  could  be looked after.  On the other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must give some clear incentives to reward them.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  the Government consider giving the  following\r\n\r\nincentives to encourage the formation of 3-tier families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying, \"An elder in a family is like\r\n\r\na treasure at home\".  If the young people can live with their\r\n\r\nparents, the old folks can look after their children, and the\r\n\r\nyoung  couple  can then be encouraged to have  more  children\r\n\r\nwithout  having to worry that there would be nobody  to  look\r\n\r\nafter their children.  In the meantime, the old folks can  be\r\n\r\ncared   for  and  looked  after  by  their  family   members.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the  grandparents can  inculcate  the  traditional\r\n\r\nmoral values in the young children so that they would grow up\r\n\r\nto become useful citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3-tier family will also contribute to the\r\n\r\nenhancement of family and social\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncohesion,  as  it  is  often said  that  the  family  is  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  of society. Perhaps, the Government can  consider\r\n\r\ngiving  a  once-off  $1,000 3-tier family bonus to the  young\r\n\r\ncouples.   I  hope the Government can consider this  proposal\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the CPF Top-up Scheme. The Minister for Manpower,\r\n\r\nDr  Lee Boon Yang, told us that about 190,000 people did  not\r\n\r\nmake  contribution of $100 each into their CPF  accounts  and\r\n\r\nhence did not qualify for the top-ups of $500 to $1,700  into\r\n\r\ntheir accounts.  Among the 190,000 people, about 23% are aged\r\n\r\n65  and  above, and 33% live in 1 to 3 room flats.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to urge MOM to conduct a thorough investigation into the\r\n\r\nmatter.   Like Dr Vasoo, I would also be grateful if the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard could provide me with the following information:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Of the 190,000 people, how many are singles with no\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) How many are jobless and have no income at all;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) How many are physically handicapped, such as mentally\r\n\r\nretarded, senile, dementia, non-ambulant; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) How many are living in old folks' homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that these people could also enjoy the fruits\r\n\r\nof  our  economic  success,  the Government  should  consider\r\n\r\ndepositing the top-ups of $500 to $1,700 into the accounts of\r\n\r\nthese  people  who  have,  in the past,  contributed  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  particularly those who live  in  1-room  to  3-room\r\n\r\nflats, and then later, at the time of withdrawal, deduct  the\r\n\r\nbasic $100 as a pre-qualification for the top-up at the  next\r\n\r\ntop-up scheme.  This is killing two birds with one stone.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  for Finance can help  these  people  who\r\n\r\nreally need our help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, among the 190,000 people, there may be\r\n\r\nsome who are quite financially well-off  and do not need  the\r\n\r\nCPF top-up.  Can we ask these people to indicate whether they\r\n\r\ncould donate the top-up amounts, which they would have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen entitled to, to the grassroots activities fund or some\r\n\r\ncharity funds.  If among the 190,000 people, 10% of the\r\n\r\npeople are willing to donate their CPF top-up money, then we\r\n\r\nwould have $10 million for our grassroots activities fund or\r\n\r\ncharity fund.  This will be much better than the $8.3 million\r\n\r\nas proposed by Mr Leong Horn Kee  for the grassroots\r\n\r\nactivities fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can consider my proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to speak in support of the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the Minister introduced a measured Budget\r\n\r\nusing  measured  fiscal responses to address  the  millennium\r\n\r\nchallenges.  We have just emerged from a recession  the  year\r\n\r\nbefore and there was a need to remain circumspect and yet  be\r\n\r\nbold  enough to seize the new opportunities in our knowledge-based  economy.  Hence, in last year's budget, the withdrawal\r\n\r\nof  each rebate appeared to be followed by a concomitant  new\r\n\r\ntax initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Christmas seems to have come early. With the\r\n\r\nadvent of greater uncertainty over the economic situation for\r\n\r\nthe  rest of the year, many are pleasantly surprised  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  generosity.  It is therefore not surprising  that\r\n\r\nmany  people  are lauding this year's Budget as an  \"Election\r\n\r\nYear  Budget\"  because  it  is  very  pro-business  and  pro-individual.  Political overtones aside, I think  that  it  is\r\n\r\nmore  appropriate to term this year's Budget as a  \"Pay  Back\r\n\r\nBudget\" in view of the concessions that Singaporeans have  to\r\n\r\nbear with during the recession period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A Different Scenario</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like the Minister to consider other\r\n\r\npossibilities  that  require an even bolder  fiscal  approach\r\n\r\nthis  year.   Sir,  what if the economy  becomes  less  rosy,\r\n\r\nthereby requiring a stronger fiscal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresponse?    What  other  tax  initiatives   can   help   our\r\n\r\nregionalisation drive?  What other tax measures can encourage\r\n\r\nour  promising local enterprises to think bigger, enter  into\r\n\r\nnew  markets and invest more boldly?  What other  tax  boosts\r\n\r\ncan  we  give  to our SMEs to ride over the current  economic\r\n\r\nuncertainty?   How  else  can we help  individuals  face  the\r\n\r\neconomic uncertainties ahead?  We ought to visit these issues\r\n\r\nand attempt to answer these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Small and medium-sized Enterprises</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on our SMEs. Many of them have not overcome\r\n\r\nthe  effects of last year's recession.  Before they can  come\r\n\r\nout  of  the woods, they are already greeted by the  news  of\r\n\r\npossibly  another slowdown.  I am glad that the Minister  has\r\n\r\nconsidered  their plight in this year's Budget.   I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  PSB  is  helping  to  raise the  performance  of  local\r\n\r\nenterprises,  and I look earnestly forward to  learning  more\r\n\r\nregarding Retail 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that we adopt further fiscal measures to\r\n\r\nhelp our SMEs.  If we want to grow our local SMEs into world-class  corporations,  we need to create  a  conducive  fiscal\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  nurture them.  Instead of a  flat  corporate\r\n\r\nincome tax rates for all companies and partial exemption  for\r\n\r\nincome   of  up  to  a  certain  level,  we  might   consider\r\n\r\nimplementing a lower rate of income tax for local SMEs.   The\r\n\r\nBudget's measure of introducing a tiered rate system for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  $100,000 of chargeable income is a step in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.   However, this can be improved upon.   SMEs  that\r\n\r\nare  wholly owned by Singaporeans and whose turnover or total\r\n\r\nassets do not exceed a certain amount could be subject  to  a\r\n\r\nlower  rate  of  tax, say, 16% on the first  half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  worth  of  income which is ploughed  back  into  the\r\n\r\nbusiness,  and not distributed as dividends.  Low rate  would\r\n\r\nact  as  an  incentive to allow the SMEs to  build  up  their\r\n\r\nreserves  to  better weather economic downturn.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nreduction  of tax rates would only be of benefit to companies\r\n\r\nwhich make profits.  But what if they make losses?  As a  tax\r\n\r\nrule for SMEs,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe should allow SMEs to use losses incurred during a downturn\r\n\r\nagainst  income earned in, say, of the preceding  two  years.\r\n\r\nIf  taxes  were paid in the preceding two years,  such  taxes\r\n\r\ncould be refunded to the company.  This ability to carry back\r\n\r\nlosses  would generally benefit SMEs facing cashflow  problem\r\n\r\nand  financial difficulties now.   The current tax  rules  on\r\n\r\nthe carrying forward of losses benefit companies that survive\r\n\r\na  recession.   But  the ability to carry back  losses  would\r\n\r\nassist  companies  to  ride  out rough  patches  where  their\r\n\r\nfundamental business proposition is sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to this, I would like to also raise the issue of\r\n\r\ncorporate  group  relief  for  losses.   Businesses  may   be\r\n\r\norganised  in  separate companies for various reasons.   This\r\n\r\ncorporate  separation,  while real in  the  legal  sense,  is\r\n\r\nartificial   in   the  business  sense   from   the   owner's\r\n\r\nperspective.  But our tax rules do not permit losses  in  one\r\n\r\ncompany to be offset against profits in another company, even\r\n\r\nif  one person owns both.  If the two businesses were run out\r\n\r\nof  the  same  company, the losses would implicitly  be  used\r\n\r\nagainst  the  profits resulting in less tax.  In  effect,  by\r\n\r\ndisallowing inter-corporate losses, the effective tax rate is\r\n\r\nhigher  than  24.5% for the above companies  taken  together.\r\n\r\nThis  should not be the case.  We should seriously look  into\r\n\r\nthe concept of group loss relief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where local companies are seeking to expand into other\r\n\r\njurisdictions  that permit group relief, our companies  would\r\n\r\nbe  at  a  disadvantage compared to companies that  can  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of group relief.  In fact, the effective  tax  rate\r\n\r\non  such  companies  can actually be lower  than  Singapore's\r\n\r\nstatutory rates, notwithstanding that our rate is amongst the\r\n\r\nlowest of all developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Globalisation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now consider the tax measures to boost our\r\n\r\nregionalisation drive.  Sir, we should provide incentives  to\r\n\r\nlocal  companies to go regional by helping them to  build  up\r\n\r\ntheir  reserves.   But the current tax  rules  do  not  allow\r\n\r\nfunding cost to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeducted if investments do not produce income.  This acts  as\r\n\r\na  disincentive  to  local companies  from  seeking  regional\r\n\r\nexpansion   opportunities.   They  should   be   allowed   to\r\n\r\naccumulate  expenses in periods when no income is earned  and\r\n\r\ndeduct  expenses  when  their investments  start  to  produce\r\n\r\nincome.  Such expenses can be restricted to cost incurred  in\r\n\r\nregional  expansion  activities, such as  funding  and  legal\r\n\r\ncosts.  Such an incentive would merely be an extension of the\r\n\r\nInland   Revenue's  current  liberal  treatment  of  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  which  have generated foreign  income.   Presently,\r\n\r\nexpenses incurred which generate foreign income that are  not\r\n\r\nrepatriated can be accumulated and carried forward to be used\r\n\r\nto offset such foreign income when repatriated in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also help successful local enterprises to\r\n\r\nreinvest  their  overseas profit.  Currently,  foreign  taxes\r\n\r\npaid   by  second  or  third-tier  foreign  company  is   not\r\n\r\nrecognised  in  Singapore  when  the  local  parent   company\r\n\r\nreceives dividends from its overseas subsidiaries through  an\r\n\r\noffshore intermediate holding company.  Since credit  is  not\r\n\r\ngiven for such foreign taxes suffered at the second and third-tier levels, the overseas income brought back to Singapore is\r\n\r\neffectively  taxed  twice,  by the  foreign  country  and  by\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This acts as a disincentive to local enterprises\r\n\r\nfrom  reinvesting in Singapore even if the best opportunities\r\n\r\nare  available  at  home.  Instead,  we  should  allow  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  to look through intermediate holding companies  in\r\n\r\nforeign countries and receive credit for foreign taxes paid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to issues affecting individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Speculative tax on capital gains on properties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tax on speculative gains on sale of real\r\n\r\nestates  was introduced at a time when the Government  deemed\r\n\r\nit  necessary to prevent a speculative bubble from forming in\r\n\r\nSingapore's property market.  Aside from the common  argument\r\n\r\nthat  the  current market does not require such  measures,  I\r\n\r\nwould also like to raise a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  fundamental  albeit technical issue.   Singapore's  tax\r\n\r\nsystem  does  not  tax  capital  gains,  only  income.    The\r\n\r\nimposition  of  tax on the gain, that is in all  respect  the\r\n\r\ncapital  gain, merely because the subject matter of the  gain\r\n\r\nis  real property, would appear to be contrary to Singapore's\r\n\r\nfundamental  tax policy.  For this reason, I would  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  Government to reconsider the rationale for the  property\r\n\r\nspeculation tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore's population ageing, an issue is whether\r\n\r\nretiring persons would have enough to see them through  their\r\n\r\nretirement  years, I would suggest that retirement gratuities\r\n\r\nnot  be  taxed.   The  taxation of  such  amounts  inherently\r\n\r\nimposes  a  larger  than usual tax burden as  the  amount  is\r\n\r\ntypically  received  in  one lump  sum  at  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual's career.  Therefore, the individual may be pushed\r\n\r\ninto  a  higher tax bracket than usual due to the receipt  of\r\n\r\nsuch  an amount, notwithstanding that such amount is intended\r\n\r\nto provide for his future years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that retirement gratuities\r\n\r\nwere  exempt  from  tax before 1st January  1993.   But  with\r\n\r\nconcerns that CPF savings may not be adequate for retirees in\r\n\r\ntoday's  environment, the reinstatement of such an  exemption\r\n\r\nmay  be opportune.  I would like to take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\napplaud  the  Government's introduction of  the  CSOP  scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  I believe will benefit employees and employers  alike.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also like to draw attention to the fact that  free\r\n\r\nshare awards should also be given the same treatment provided\r\n\r\nsimilar  parameters are met.  For instance,  there  does  not\r\n\r\nappear to be any reason why share awards that are granted  to\r\n\r\nmore  than 50% of a company's employees should not be covered\r\n\r\nby the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of stock options, I would however like to\r\n\r\ndraw  attention to the manner in which stock options obtained\r\n\r\nby  expatriate  employees before they came to Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nwhich are exercised while they are employed in Singapore, are\r\n\r\ntaxed.   The  exercise of such stock options  is  subject  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's tax notwithstanding that they were granted and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearned  during  their  expatriate years  of  service  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.    If Singapore is to attract top foreign  talent,\r\n\r\nwe  need to relook at this issue to ensure that there are  no\r\n\r\nundue  issues  that  may  act  as  a  disincentive  to   such\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would also like to very briefly comment\r\n\r\non  a  few  other  tax issues, some of which  I  have  raised\r\n\r\npreviously.   The first is the need to review  the  threshold\r\n\r\nparameters for estate duty, in particular the use of $600,000\r\n\r\nas  the  threshold for non-property exemption is  inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe $600,000 is inclusive of CPF which is nowadays easier  to\r\n\r\nachieve.   The  current exemption scheme  appears  to  favour\r\n\r\nthose with significant property ownership in their investment\r\n\r\nportfolio.    We  should  revise  upwards  the   non-property\r\n\r\nexemption  allowed, or even abolish estate duty on  all  non-property  assets and allow for estate duty to be levied  only\r\n\r\non real property passing in excess of the present $9 million.\r\n\r\nThis would encourage Singaporeans to adopt a wider investment\r\n\r\nstrategy  rather than to be overly tied down and  exposed  in\r\n\r\nthe property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern deals with the personal reliefs\r\n\r\ngenerally.  Such reliefs do not appear to have kept  up  with\r\n\r\nthe  time.   For instance, the personal income  threshold  of\r\n\r\n$2,000  for  the wife relief does not appear realistic  given\r\n\r\nthe  financial pattern of today's family.  I suggest we  look\r\n\r\nclosely  at  the  current programme of  personal  reliefs  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  where  improvements can  be  made.   One  area  of\r\n\r\nconcern among the growing number of Singaporeans is the  cost\r\n\r\nof  medical  treatment for the ageing parents.  To  encourage\r\n\r\nthree  generation  households and  to  ensure  that  retirees\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  enjoy a certain quality of life, medical  costs\r\n\r\nincurred  for  geriatric  treatment  and  for  other  serious\r\n\r\nillnesses  should  be given relief up to a  certain  monetary\r\n\r\ncapping.   Perhaps, the personal tax system can  be  used  to\r\n\r\nhelp alleviate some of these concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to propose a topping up of the\r\n\r\nstudent's  Edusave  account to encourage  PC  ownership.   We\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencourage  our students to be more IT-savvy.  But  not  every\r\n\r\nstudent can afford a PC.  While there are PCs in the schools,\r\n\r\nthe  IT exposure of students without PCs at home is very much\r\n\r\nrestricted.  For this purpose, we should consider topping  up\r\n\r\nthe  student's Edusave account to subsidise or  pay  for  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  a PC or IT-related accessory or software.   The\r\n\r\ntop-up  can be renewed five years later to keep up  with  the\r\n\r\nchanges in computer technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-Budget wish-list that I have just described\r\n\r\nshould not taint the bold and positive aspects of the Budget,\r\n\r\nas  announced by the Minister.  But who knows Santa Claus may\r\n\r\nstill be accepting late orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  for allowing me to join in the debate  today.\r\n\r\nWhilst  I  agree with Members of this House who  have  spoken\r\n\r\nearlier  that the Budget for this year is a generous  one,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  it  has inadequately addressed  our  concerns  in\r\n\r\npreparing for the future needs of a fast-ageing population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is indeed facing a fast-ageing population\r\n\r\nwith  the \"older dependency ratio\" decreasing from 10 now  to\r\n\r\nover  30  by 2030.  This is worrying.  But even more worrying\r\n\r\nand  dramatic will be the increasing number of the  very  old\r\n\r\n(those  aged 75 and above).  This group represents the  frail\r\n\r\nelderly  with physical, mental and social limitations.   This\r\n\r\nis  the  group that is most likely to depend on and  tax  our\r\n\r\nhealth  and social services.  There will be an almost  three-fold  increase  of this group from just over  90,000  now  to\r\n\r\nabout 250,000 by 2030, when it will comprise about 7% of  our\r\n\r\ntotal  population.   Sir, we need good  planning  and  astute\r\n\r\nallocation of immediate resources for a smooth transition  to\r\n\r\nthe years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older people are more likely to have disabilities; the\r\n\r\nchallenge  is to attain a position where we can provide  care\r\n\r\nthat  allows  them  to  live independently  for  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible  and,  preferably, in their  own  homes  with  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  In order to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nachieve  this,  I  would  like to suggest  that,  henceforth,\r\n\r\ncertain incentive grants be set aside for relevant Ministries\r\n\r\nto  plan  and act on innovative ideas that will save us  from\r\n\r\nchallenging burdens later on.  Incentives should be given for\r\n\r\nproactive  measures that can improve the care  of  the  older\r\n\r\ngeneration in future.  In view of the daunting task of caring\r\n\r\nfor  so  many older people in the not too distant future,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  start  working on this potential problem  now.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, our priority is to have in place a system  that\r\n\r\nstrengthens  our  foundation  and  taps  and  maximises   our\r\n\r\nvoluntary and private sectors.  I would like the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  consider the importance in laying the foundation\r\n\r\nand  the  infrastructure immediately.  Additionally, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  the  different  Ministries, such  as  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports (MCDS), Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\n(MOH),  Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment (MND) to appropriate proactive measures  to  make\r\n\r\nsome significant impact over this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For MCDS, I would like to suggest that since our primary\r\n\r\nobjective  in  the care of the elderly is to enable  them  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  independent  lives in the community  and  in  their\r\n\r\nhomes  for as long as possible, maintaining the social status\r\n\r\nquo  in those elderly who are well and those elderly who  are\r\n\r\nnot   totally  dependent,  should  be  one  of  its   primary\r\n\r\nobjectives.  Thus, by postponing or retarding the  functional\r\n\r\ndeterioration  in  these older persons, MCDS  can  help  them\r\n\r\nreduce  avoidable hospital admissions and minimize  premature\r\n\r\ndependence on long-term care in institutional settings.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  aim  must  be to help the older persons  do  things  for\r\n\r\nthemselves;  not do things for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to happen, there must be effective support from\r\n\r\nprimary healthcare, community healthcare, social services and\r\n\r\nmodified  housing.  There must be ample community  volunteers\r\n\r\nand  home help for families to care for the dependent elderly\r\n\r\nin  their  homes.  As a matter of urgency, MCDS  should  have\r\n\r\nhomecare-cum-domiciliary services, daycare and rehabilitation\r\n\r\nservices, occupational therapy services\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  equipment  and  adaptations  at  homes  developed   and\r\n\r\nestablished.  Easy access to these community care facilities,\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis centres of activity, centres for rehabilitation and\r\n\r\ndaycare  centres,  is  essential.  There  must  be  unstinted\r\n\r\navailability  of support and advice.  MCDS should  facilitate\r\n\r\nthis  area  by  involving community bodies such as  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations, grassroots organisations,  and  other\r\n\r\ngroups  in  the  private  sector.   Such  facilitation   will\r\n\r\ntranslate  into  lower costs and convenience  for  a  happier\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, volunteer opportunities should be made available\r\n\r\nand  seniors  should  be  made aware that  their  skills  are\r\n\r\nvalued.  We have a large and increasing pool of volunteers to\r\n\r\ntap  from among the older Singaporeans.  Training them to  be\r\n\r\ncompetent in the different areas of our needs will give  them\r\n\r\nrecognition and worth.  For example, as we are lacking in the\r\n\r\ncommunity services to support and care for the frail and semi-dependent  in  the society, we may perhaps  equip  and  train\r\n\r\nthese  volunteers to provide them.  Perhaps,  a  well-managed\r\n\r\nregister  of  volunteers  and matching  services  can  ensure\r\n\r\nsuccessful  implementation  of  this  type  of  volunteerism.\r\n\r\nVolunteers should be recognised for their work, and it  would\r\n\r\nbe  good if they can get some privileged and subsidised  care\r\n\r\nwhen, in turn, they themselves need community services.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  reimbursed  transportation  and  minor  costs  of\r\n\r\nincidentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS should also look into another important area.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  need  to  facilitate adaptations,  either  with\r\n\r\nstructural  modifications to the homes, or with provision  of\r\n\r\nappropriate equipment to ease the inadequacies of  the  frail\r\n\r\nor semi-dependent elderly.  This will enable them to continue\r\n\r\nliving in their own homes for as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we figure out how to best prepare\r\n\r\nfor our aging population, half the battle would have been won\r\n\r\nif  we  could influence Singaporeans with the correct mindset\r\n\r\nconcerning  older persons and retirement.  A  mindset  change\r\n\r\nneeds\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime and a lot of effort to nurture, and I would like MCDS to\r\n\r\nprioritise  it and enable us to achieve the desired  outcome.\r\n\r\nSir,  older  persons  should be regarded as  useful  citizens\r\n\r\nwhose wisdom, skills and talents are valuable resources  that\r\n\r\nmust  be  tapped for as long as possible to benefit  society.\r\n\r\nThe  mindset on retirement should be: \"A time to begin a  new\r\n\r\nchapter  in  life by being active and involved; starting  new\r\n\r\nactivities and setting new goals.\"  Indeed, Sir, older people\r\n\r\ncan  approach aging and retirement in new and exciting  ways,\r\n\r\nand MCDS can do much to help them realise such a goal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new survey of 803 American men and women aged 50 to 75\r\n\r\nhas  found that 40% of them are working or plan to work after\r\n\r\nthey  retire, while an equal percentage plans to do volunteer\r\n\r\nwork.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Ministry  of  Manpower  should\r\n\r\nencourage  and facilitate this type of attitudes by providing\r\n\r\navenues  for  Singaporeans  to  remain  at  work  and  to  do\r\n\r\nvolunteer work.  Matching the seniors to further training  or\r\n\r\njob placements should also be enhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older people should be given training opportunities\r\n\r\nirrespective of age.  This will enable them to receive skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  and help them stay relevant in the economy.   Sir,\r\n\r\npeople are healthier and are living longer.  A skilled labour\r\n\r\nforce  of  \"seniors\"  can, therefore, be  a  valuable  asset.\r\n\r\nCompanies  wishing  to  retain their  older  workers  through\r\n\r\nworkplace re-engineering should be encouraged and facilitated\r\n\r\nin  this  respect.  As we plan ahead, we need  to  turn  full\r\n\r\ncircle, and adopt policies and programmes, provide retraining\r\n\r\nopportunities, offer flexible work hours and encourage  those\r\n\r\nwho  want  to stay on the job to do so.  Sir, it  is  prudent\r\n\r\nthat MOM is continuing to review the retirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many older people can stay longer in the community with\r\n\r\nstructural adaptations made to their own homes.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National  Development should facilitate  this  by  having\r\n\r\nmodifications done to older flats, occupied mainly  by  older\r\n\r\nfolk,  in  similar fashion to those modified for some  rental\r\n\r\nHDB blocks.  Mr Speaker, Sir, having\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseen  those  modified rental HDB homes, we know what  can  be\r\n\r\ndone. The more elderly-friendly features inside the flats and\r\n\r\nthe  access or surrounding areas are, indeed, a boon  to  the\r\n\r\nolder persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND should also facilitate owners of HDB flats in the\r\n\r\nexisting and new HDB flats to modify their homes, if they  so\r\n\r\nwish.   Furthermore,  MND should also have  sheltered  homes,\r\n\r\nstudio apartments and retirement villages built in increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers  to  meet increasing demand through  time.   Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  good  if  MND has schemes in  place  to  encourage\r\n\r\nprivate organisations to build such homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has said that,\r\n\r\nas  our  population ages, the healthcare costs for the  older\r\n\r\ngeneration of our people will rapidly increase.  This is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  allowances  were  made  to  meet  the  projected\r\n\r\nhealthcare costs in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge now is to ensure that we can continue to\r\n\r\nspend  wisely and efficiently in the future.  The current  8%\r\n\r\nof   older   persons  account  for  20%  of  all   outpatient\r\n\r\nattendances and 18% of all hospital admissions.   Sir,  going\r\n\r\nforward  along such a trend, we will be putting a  tremendous\r\n\r\nburden upon our healthcare resources.  We must help the older\r\n\r\npeople  maintain  independent lives in the community  for  as\r\n\r\nlong  as possible, being aided predominantly by the community\r\n\r\nhealthcare  services.   As  people get  older,  the  emphasis\r\n\r\nshould shift from the extension of life to the improvement of\r\n\r\nhealth-related quality of life.  In other words, the emphasis\r\n\r\nshould be on \"adding life to years and not years to life\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like each one of us here\r\n\r\npresent to consider the scenario of having to care for one of\r\n\r\nour  very own elderly parents who should fall ill.   This  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  unlikely  scenario as many of  us  do  have  elderly\r\n\r\nparents  and  one  in four in our population  will  face  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in the not-too-distant future.  It is a matter  of\r\n\r\ntime when we would have to meet that call.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If faced with that situation now, you may be wondering\r\n\r\nwhere  to look for help.  Must you seek specialist help  and,\r\n\r\nif so,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  and  how many specialists will you need to  send  your\r\n\r\nparent  for  proper diagnosis and treatment of the  different\r\n\r\nillnesses, which older people can have?  How are you going to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  care  if  he or she is semi-dependent  and  you\r\n\r\nneeded to be at work?  Do you have the know-how to care for a\r\n\r\ntotally  dependent elderly?  If he or she insists on  staying\r\n\r\nat  home and rejects the idea of care in a nursing home,  how\r\n\r\ndo  you  then  cope with all the daily medical  requirements?\r\n\r\nSir,  what I am getting at is to illustrate our need to  have\r\n\r\nin  place a healthcare system that provides a one-stop centre\r\n\r\nwhich  you  can  call  upon  to  handle  such  a  distressing\r\n\r\nscenario.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should plan a system that promotes independence\r\n\r\nby   supporting  people  to  achieve  their  potential,   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  families  by supporting family  responsibilities.\r\n\r\nWe  must  have  the  personnel, in ample numbers,  to  assist\r\n\r\npeople with appropriate support to assess medical conditions,\r\n\r\nadvise  nursing care, provide home-help courses, and  suggest\r\n\r\nnecessary  home  adaptations  and  so  on.   This   means   a\r\n\r\nstandardised  and holistic management of the  needs  of  each\r\n\r\nfamily, and an assurance of appropriate care that spares them\r\n\r\nlots of worry, time and effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have this, we have to start training more medical\r\n\r\npersonnel   in   various   fields.    We   must   have   more\r\n\r\ngeriatricians, physiotherapists, community nurses,  home-care\r\n\r\nnurses  and  home-care  helpers.  We need  \"new  courses\"  to\r\n\r\nimpart  ideas  and experiences of experts in other  countries\r\n\r\nthat  have gone through this predicament long before us.   We\r\n\r\ncan   certainly  benefit  by  looking  at  others  in   their\r\n\r\nmanagement  of workable systems.  A centre or bureau  with  a\r\n\r\ndedicated  team may be set up for this.  It will  augur  well\r\n\r\nfor  us if the Ministry of Health looks into this immediately\r\n\r\nand the Ministry of Finance funds for this generously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the task in the ensuing years may seem\r\n\r\ninsurmountable  due to foreseeable increased demands  on  our\r\n\r\nhealthcare  system as a result of greater  needs  of  elderly\r\n\r\nfolk,  expectations of affluent citizens, and  costs  of  new\r\n\r\nmedical advances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst we cannot arrest the rising demands and costs, we  can\r\n\r\nchallenge ourselves to find and implement the ways to  lessen\r\n\r\nthe  burden.   Promoting  \"preventive  care\"  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nhealthy population for as long as possible will be the  basic\r\n\r\ntenets  of  our endeavour.  The target is to help  the  older\r\n\r\npeople  to  live as independently as possible,  deliver  good\r\n\r\nmedical care at affordable costs, ensure appropriate  use  of\r\n\r\nmedical  resources without wastage, emphasise self-help,  and\r\n\r\nstress  responsibility for one's own good  health.   Spending\r\n\r\nnow  to  meet this challenge will save us millions of dollars\r\n\r\nin  the  future.   I  am glad that the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nrecognises  this  and  has started to address  the  issue  by\r\n\r\nproviding  substantially more funds for healthcare.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  funds  will be used to establish the foundations  for  a\r\n\r\nsound \"Healthcare 21\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish to reiterate that it requires\r\n\r\nthe  concerted  effort, through close networking  and  smooth\r\n\r\nimplementation of policies by various Ministries, that  would\r\n\r\nensure us our success in this issue.  Therefore, I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  relevant  Ministries to garner all their  resources  and\r\n\r\nwork as one entity for the better of our aging nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I welcome this generous Budget as presented  by\r\n\r\nMinister Hu, and as mentioned in a local newspaper,  The  New\r\n\r\nPaper,  it  would certainly bring happiness  to  the  people.\r\n\r\nThere  is  much  to  be  said about  the  Budget  this  year.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would  mention only three issues.   Firstly,  on\r\n\r\nalcohol.   I  welcome the measures taken by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  in increasing the tax on tobacco by $30 a kilogram,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is a wonder how the tax on alcohol was not increased\r\n\r\nin  tandem.   Although I do not question the tax increase,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say about the consequences of alcohol  which\r\n\r\nbring about problems to the family and our youths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sympathise with Mr Tan Boon Hui and Miss Ng Shen\r\n\r\nChing who died in a road accident when they were preparing to\r\n\r\nset up a family.  It was reported in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nStraits Times on 27th February 2001.  Both of them died  when\r\n\r\ntheir motorcycles went out of control on the PIE on 13th  May\r\n\r\nlast  year.  Late last month, the Coroner's Court found  that\r\n\r\nthe  blood  and  urine  sample of Mr Tan contained  excessive\r\n\r\namounts of alcohol.  We also read early last month about a 7-Eleven  branch in Hastings Road in Little India which stopped\r\n\r\nselling  alcohol  because there were  a  lot  of  fights  and\r\n\r\nclashes by the customers who purchased alcohol there and from\r\n\r\nseveral  other shops.  Please refer to the New Paper  on  3rd\r\n\r\nFebruary  2001.  In fact, according to one of  the  residents\r\n\r\nthere,  they  would  drink  until they  were  drunk  and  got\r\n\r\nthemselves  into scuffles.  Another resident also  said  that\r\n\r\nthey  are not prepared to allow their children to go  out  on\r\n\r\nlate nights in the weekend, for fear of being involved in the\r\n\r\nscuffle.   We were also told that one in every four  husbands\r\n\r\nwho is involved in wife battering cases is an alcoholic. This\r\n\r\nis reported in the New Paper on 20th February 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one expert, Dr Joseph Ozawa, Director of\r\n\r\nPhysiological Services for the Criminal, Family and  Juvenile\r\n\r\nJustice  Centre, said that problems of the family are  mainly\r\n\r\ncaused  by  the  husbands who are alcoholics  and  not  those\r\n\r\nhusbands who are drug addicts.  He said that this is  because\r\n\r\nit is easier to purchase alcohol than drugs.  While I welcome\r\n\r\nthe  Subordinates Courts' Family Justice Centre to  launch  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  assist the heads of family who are  alcoholics\r\n\r\nnext  month in April, I think other measures should be  taken\r\n\r\nand  one of them is to increase the duty for alcohol as  much\r\n\r\nas  it  can  so  that it is no longer cheap to purchase.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  am  the  only one who asked it to be  increased  as\r\n\r\ncompared to the others who did not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the Government's measure to top up $500\r\n\r\nmillion  into the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund this  year\r\n\r\nto  reach  $1  billion, and more than  $30  million  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Manpower Development Assistance Scheme  so  as\r\n\r\nto equip our workers with the necessary skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lifelong learning will be a new lifestyle in today's\r\n\r\nliving, $1 billion may not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  enough.  The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  should  be\r\n\r\none-third  of the sum allocated to the Ministry of Education,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  $6.3 billion.  A new way is for the Government  to\r\n\r\nassist   those   workers  who  do  not  have   post-secondary\r\n\r\neducation,  as this group will be left behind by the  changes\r\n\r\nin  our  economy.  This group, if not helped, will break  our\r\n\r\nsocial fabric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khalid Abdullah, who is of Chinese Indian-Pakistani\r\n\r\ndescent, has written about his surprise when a child  who  is\r\n\r\nnot more than 10 years old told him and his two children that\r\n\r\nhe  could not play at a playground because \"you are an Indian\r\n\r\nand  you  smell\".  This is reported in the Straits  Times  on\r\n\r\n19th February 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month earlier, a New Paper journalist, Melvin Singh,\r\n\r\nalso  raised the same issue regarding the smell  in  the  New\r\n\r\nPaper of 15th January 2001.  He wrote about two of his wife's\r\n\r\nnephews  who are of Chinese descent and aged 3 and  5  years.\r\n\r\nHe  said, \"Both had hugged me in the same way they have  done\r\n\r\nto their other uncles.  But one day, one of them told me that\r\n\r\nmy body smells because I have dark skin.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that worries me because of race\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  If this is not contained, it will bring about\r\n\r\nadverse effect in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, the generous Budget which has\r\n\r\nallowed  the Government to share their successes with  others\r\n\r\nis  a  sign of the Government appreciating the effort of  the\r\n\r\npeople  who are together with the Government during difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget Statement which has been tabled by\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I join my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in thanking the Minister for Finance for  a  very\r\n\r\ngenerous  Budget this year.  It is a Budget aimed  at  making\r\n\r\nour  companies  more competitive and, at the same  time,  put\r\n\r\nmore  disposable income in the pockets of the people.  I only\r\n\r\nhave a few comments to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Singapore's economic performance was beyond\r\n\r\nthe expectations of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany,  growing  by  9.9%.  According to  economic  statistics\r\n\r\ndisclosed  recently, most sectors did better  than  in  1999,\r\n\r\nexcept for the construction sector.  Feedback from small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) however seem to suggest  that\r\n\r\n1999  was  still very tough for many of them, especially  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  have ventured into the region at the Government's\r\n\r\nurging  and  are  still  not  profitable.   I  do  not   have\r\n\r\nstatistics  to  support this assertion  as  the  feedback  is\r\n\r\nmainly  anecdotal.   Many  such  SMEs  feel  that  the   cost\r\n\r\nrestorations,  such  as  in  the  employers'  share  of   CPF\r\n\r\npayments,  have  come a little bit too fast.  This  situation\r\n\r\nwas  exacerbated by the significant fall in asset  values  of\r\n\r\nshares and properties, making many feel even poorer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for this year is slower growth. This\r\n\r\nportends  an  even  worse  time  for  the  SMEs.   Many  such\r\n\r\ncompanies  offer  supporting  services  or  products  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the GLCs, MNCs and other large corporations based\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Many have ventured into the region  and  some\r\n\r\neven  further afield to look for new markets.  Many have been\r\n\r\nhurt  by the untimely downturn in the region.  Some are  even\r\n\r\nin need of recapitalisation to survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the Government's reduction in corporate\r\n\r\ntax  rate by 1% to 24.5% is welcome.  Of more direct  benefit\r\n\r\nto  the SMEs is the new tax exemption scheme that will exempt\r\n\r\nthree-quarters  of  up to the first $10,000  of  a  company's\r\n\r\nchargeable  income, and one-half of up to  the  next  $90,000\r\n\r\nfrom  corporate  tax.  It will help the SMEs  reinvest  their\r\n\r\ninitial profits into the business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Finance to consider\r\n\r\nagain  the  possibility of allowing companies to group  their\r\n\r\nprofits  or losses for tax purposes.  Today, group  companies\r\n\r\nneed  not be large conglomerates that are usually profitable.\r\n\r\nMany  SMEs today start new companies for new markets or  form\r\n\r\njoint   ventures  with  local  partners  overseas   for   new\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  Property companies are required by law to have a\r\n\r\nnew entity for each project.  The new projects are usually\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  always profitable in the initial years.  In fact,  those\r\n\r\nthat  are  not doing well are usually wound up  after  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  as  the  original founders cut  their  losses.   Their\r\n\r\ncumulative tax losses cannot be utilised unless the companies\r\n\r\nare  bought  over  by some other companies.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  allow such group companies to offset profits  of  one\r\n\r\ncompany  with losses from another as long as these  companies\r\n\r\nare  subsidiaries  of the group. This will lighten  the  cash\r\n\r\nflow  problems  of  many  companies  and  encourage  them  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to invest in new markets and go into new businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that FY2001 would be a more difficult year, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Government to bring forward or  speed\r\n\r\nup  more  public sector projects to help the private  sector.\r\n\r\nFor example, given that our projected budget surplus is still\r\n\r\nvery  respectable, we could increase the number of  Main  and\r\n\r\nInterim  Upgrading projects which will also benefit  our  HDB\r\n\r\ndwellers.   I  would also like to suggest that we  set  aside\r\n\r\nmore  funds for the upgrading of private housing estates  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of private housing estate residents.  Last year,\r\n\r\nonly five private housing estates were selected for upgrading\r\n\r\nalthough many qualified under the criteria given.  This year,\r\n\r\nI hope that there will be more such estates selected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set aside funds to help SMEs through\r\n\r\nthe   Productivity  and  Standards  Board  and  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Assistance Scheme.  They are given more  in  the\r\n\r\nform of technical assistance, training and consulting to help\r\n\r\nthem  modernise management, adopt technology and become  more\r\n\r\nproductive.  These initiatives are good and will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  welcome.   SMEs, however, need more than  just  technical\r\n\r\nassistance  and training today. They need some  support  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government  too  in  the form of  equity  to  grow  more\r\n\r\naggressively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, through Temasek Holdings, the EDB\r\n\r\nInvestments,  the National Science and Technology  Board  and\r\n\r\nother Government vehicles, takes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstakes in our local companies from time to time.  However,  I\r\n\r\nnotice that many of these investments tend to be in big local\r\n\r\ncompanies  or  big  projects.   Government  venture   capital\r\n\r\ncompanies,  such as Vertex, take stakes in start-ups.   There\r\n\r\nseems  to be a gap where the SMEs are.  I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government consider investing more  in  our  SMEs.\r\n\r\nThey  need more financial support to go into the region  with\r\n\r\ntheir existing businesses and to venture into new businesses.\r\n\r\nThe stakes need not be big.  They should leave the management\r\n\r\nof  such SMEs to the founding entrepreneurs and professionals\r\n\r\nemployed.   The confidence of the market, business associates\r\n\r\nand  customers from such Government support will give them  a\r\n\r\nmuch  better  chance to succeed in the  region.   I  want  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that I am not suggesting a bail out of ailing  local\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I am suggesting that the Government look at  good\r\n\r\nSMEs  with  viable  business models and distinct  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantages  that have not yet obtained access  to  the  stock\r\n\r\nmarkets for their capital for expansion. These companies need\r\n\r\nour support to grow and eventually become world-class.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the CPF top-up scheme. I\r\n\r\ncommend  the  Government  for  its  unique  but  nevertheless\r\n\r\ngenerous  way  of  sharing our budget surplus.   Putting  the\r\n\r\nmoney  directly into the CPF however may not be the best  way\r\n\r\nof  doing  so because many Singaporeans do not see the  money\r\n\r\nand  probably  do not even know when the money was  credited.\r\n\r\nIf  they  do  not even know or feel it, would they appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  handout?  Perhaps, the Government should consider giving\r\n\r\nit in cash, cheque or vouchers for a change.  This would also\r\n\r\nhelp to boost the economy in a year of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to comment on is Edusave.\r\n\r\nIn  my  view,  it  is  one  of the  more  popular  Government\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to  support procreation  and  education  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung.    However,  I  still  fail  to  understand  why   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would not extend this to families  with  four  or\r\n\r\nmore  children.  I am sure the amount involved would  not  be\r\n\r\nlarge.  If we want families to have three\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor more children, we should be consistent in our policies and\r\n\r\nnot discriminate against the fourth or fifth child in such  a\r\n\r\nmanner.  I hope the Government will review this policy  again\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, Budget 2001 has been hailed, as many colleagues\r\n\r\nhave  said,  a  good  Budget for the people  and  businesses.\r\n\r\nUnder  the able leadership of our Government, we have managed\r\n\r\nto   achieve   a  budget  surplus.   Our  economy   performed\r\n\r\nremarkably  well in the year 2000.  This was  due  to  strong\r\n\r\nexternal  developments,  sound economic  policies  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, it was due to the sacrifice of our workers.  The\r\n\r\ncut  in CPF in 1999 has restored our competitiveness and  has\r\n\r\ngained investors' confidence.  For this, full credit must  go\r\n\r\nto  our  workers.   CPF contribution has  been  progressively\r\n\r\nrestored  since  January 2000, bringing  the  employer's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate to 16%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people think that this is an election year Budget.\r\n\r\nHowever,  facts  had  shown  that  our  economy  indeed  grew\r\n\r\nremarkably  in  the year 2000.   It was our workers  who  had\r\n\r\nborne the major brunt in the economic recession in 1997/1998.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  fair and timely that they should be recompensed\r\n\r\nfor such sacrifice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are clear signs that the economy is slowing down.\r\n\r\nIn  particular, the US economy is heading for a slowdown.  We\r\n\r\nhave  projected  growth of between 5-7%, if  the  US  economy\r\n\r\ngrows  by  2-2.5%.  Dr Richard Hu cautioned that any negative\r\n\r\ngrowth  figure in the US will mean that we will be hit  hard.\r\n\r\nDoes  the  Government have other off-Budget measures  it  had\r\n\r\nintroduced during the recession in 1997/1998?  We agree  that\r\n\r\nwe  must  be prepared for difficult times ahead.   Growth  in\r\n\r\nglobal  electronics has slowed significantly.  As the  US  is\r\n\r\nour  major electronic export market, to what extent would the\r\n\r\nslowdown affect our workers' job security?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is right for the Government to promote\r\n\r\nother high value added industries as we move forward into the\r\n\r\nNew\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEconomy,  such as the life sciences and infocomm  industries.\r\n\r\nIn  these sectors, many new and skilled jobs will be created.\r\n\r\nHowever,  how  can we channel retrenched workers  into  these\r\n\r\nsectors?   Do they possess the necessary skills  to  take  up\r\n\r\nthese  jobs?  We need to address the issue of skills mismatch\r\n\r\namong our retrenched workers.  The Government adopted several\r\n\r\ninitiatives  through  the  Manpower  Development   Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme,  SDF  and  the Lifelong Learning  Endowment  Fund  to\r\n\r\naddress  the  issue.  NTUC has the SRP and N-ETF  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nskills  of  our workers, so that they will remain  employable\r\n\r\nand,  in the event of retrenchment, they are able to take  up\r\n\r\nhigher skill jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is necessary to put in place these schemes, it\r\n\r\nis  insufficient  to  deal with the problem  of  structurally\r\n\r\ndisplaced  workers.  However, other than these  schemes,  the\r\n\r\nretrenched workers themselves must be willing to be retrained\r\n\r\nand take up jobs in the high growth sectors.  After training,\r\n\r\nthe  next challenging task is to match these workers with the\r\n\r\nnew jobs.  To achieve this end, a better job matching system,\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  constant contact with the retrenched  workers,\r\n\r\nmust  be  put in place.  Equally important is the willingness\r\n\r\nof  our workers to be retrained and take up jobs in these new\r\n\r\nindustries.    However, what is causing concern is that  many\r\n\r\nretrenched workers choose to drive taxis rather than take  up\r\n\r\ntraining and move into these new jobs and industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another challenge that we face is the\r\n\r\ntraining of our older workers.  Even when some of these older\r\n\r\nworkers  accepted  our advice and went for  retraining,  more\r\n\r\noften than not they were turned away at job interviews.  Many\r\n\r\nemployers  cited  age as the main reason for rejecting  them.\r\n\r\nWith  scarce  human resources and the longer life expectancy,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  make better use of our workers.  I  am  glad  a\r\n\r\nTripartite  Working Committee on Work Redesign has  commenced\r\n\r\nto  look  into  restructuring jobs in the hotel,  marine  and\r\n\r\ncleaning  industries.  I hope that they will  look  into  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  how  older workers can be fitted  into  new  jobs,\r\n\r\nrather than focusing too much on increasing productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While striving to maintain investors' confidence in our\r\n\r\neconomy, to that end, the National Wages Council had endorsed\r\n\r\nthe monthly variable component (MVC).  The MVC is targeted to\r\n\r\nform  about  10%  of   total  wages.   It  acts  as  a  first\r\n\r\ncushioning  effect before a CPF cut is considered.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  progress  in implementing the MVC in companies  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen encouraging.  As a result, we may not be able to achieve\r\n\r\nsuch wage restructuring in time to come.  The slowdown in the\r\n\r\nUS  economy will have some spillover effects on our  economy.\r\n\r\nCan  our workers still look forward to a full restoration  of\r\n\r\nthe  employer's  CPF  contribution  or  will  they  face  the\r\n\r\nprospect of another cut in CPF if the economy worsens?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of the cost of living has been discussed\r\n\r\nmany  times.  However, it is a subject that touches the heart\r\n\r\nand  soul  of every Singaporean, especially the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup.   The  recent  increase  in  electricity  tariffs  had\r\n\r\nsparked a huge uproar.  This was made worse by wrong billing.\r\n\r\nThe  continued  increase  in  petrol  prices  also  led  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to believe that  this is the result of  monopoly\r\n\r\nin  the  industry.  I urge the Government to monitor  closely\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in  prices in these companies with  particular\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  basic essential items, such as  electricity,\r\n\r\nwater and other basic amenities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one of the most generous budgets,\r\n\r\nespecially  for the individuals.  In fact, Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nbeen  looking forward to it.  Naturally, workers would expect\r\n\r\nthe  Budget to get better each year.  We may not be  able  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  the performance of the year 2000 in 2001, and instead\r\n\r\nthere may be a slowdown in our economy.  If that happens, can\r\n\r\nthe  Government convince the people to accept something less?\r\n\r\nWhilst material gains and benefits are important in levelling\r\n\r\nup  our  people and sharing our fruits of success, it is  not\r\n\r\nthe  only  thing.  More crucial is to cultivate  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nidentity  and  sense  of  belonging  to  our  country,  which\r\n\r\nultimately will ensure our social cohesion and unity in  time\r\n\r\nof crisis as our nation progresses.  Therefore, I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  like  to urge the Government to put in more  resources\r\n\r\nand  effort to inculcate this sense and the spirit of nation-building  among  Singaporeans, and hope  that  future  Budget\r\n\r\nstatements  will  better reflect this  growing  need  in  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  times  ahead.  Hopefully, with this  approach,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able, over time, to change the mindset of our people\r\n\r\nand  that  they are able to bond together and go through  the\r\n\r\nthick and thin of times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I congratulate the Finance Minister for his\r\n\r\nexcellent  Budget.  I also commend him for his  understanding\r\n\r\nof  our people's expectations.  On this note, I fully support\r\n\r\nthe Budget for 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for permitting me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by many Members who have spoken before me, the\r\n\r\nBudget  has  indeed  been very well  received,  as  there  is\r\n\r\nevidently something for almost everyone.  I congratulate  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  its astute handling of Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nwell-being,  which has enabled us to emerge not  only  almost\r\n\r\nunscathed  from  the Asian financial crisis  but  has  placed\r\n\r\nSingapore  several  steps ahead of  our  competitors.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  we  are now in this happy and enviable situation  of\r\n\r\nhow to manage our surplus and redistribute the created wealth\r\n\r\nfrom our prudent but successful economic management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certainly most supportive of budget surpluses,\r\n\r\nespecially  when part of the wealth created is  redistributed\r\n\r\nin the fashion and extraordinary generosity of this very pro-Singaporean Budget.  It is highly motivating and, I  believe,\r\n\r\nwill  spur people to work harder, as it represents a  win-win\r\n\r\nformula  for  both the country as well as its people.   Every\r\n\r\nparty  benefits from it.  We have to strengthen the  virtuous\r\n\r\ncycle  of effort, growth and wealth creation in order for  us\r\n\r\nto maintain this win-win formula.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join the many others\r\n\r\nwho have spoken earlier, and also in expressing my admiration\r\n\r\nfor the creative manner in how part of this year's Budget  is\r\n\r\nbeing returned back to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore's stakeholders.  There is benefit to be derived  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans from all walks of life as well as, particularly,\r\n\r\nour small SMEs and new and budding businesses.  This is why I\r\n\r\nreferred to it earlier as a pro-Singaporean Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I would like to suggest that the\r\n\r\nGovernment consider some form of a formula for the management\r\n\r\nand  redistribution of our annual budget  surpluses,  as  and\r\n\r\nwhen  we  have them.  I feel that having a known  and  shared\r\n\r\nformula would enable us to have rationalisation in the manner\r\n\r\nour  surpluses are distributed.  The Government should  first\r\n\r\nconduct  a  detailed  study of what the  appropriate  formula\r\n\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if we can say that 30% or 40% of each\r\n\r\nyear's budget surplus is returned to the people with the rest\r\n\r\ngoing  into  reserves, considering that  the  growth  of  our\r\n\r\nreserves is generally higher than our annual GDP growth  each\r\n\r\nyear,  this will represent an added incentive for our  people\r\n\r\nand  stakeholders  to  work harder,  knowing  that  a  bigger\r\n\r\nsurplus would translate into  higher potential incentives for\r\n\r\nthem.   Such  a  formula  will make  it  clear  that  with  a\r\n\r\nguaranteed commitment of part of the surpluses being returned\r\n\r\nto  the people, the Government cares and is prepared to share\r\n\r\nits  annual  wealth creation, while comfort of mind  is  also\r\n\r\nbuilt that there is continued set aside for rainy days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, the Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC, who\r\n\r\nspoke last Monday, also noted that excessive budget surpluses\r\n\r\ncan  result  in unnecessary deflationary pull on the  private\r\n\r\nsector  economy  through taxes and statutory cost  and  fees,\r\n\r\nwhereas  a  more  rationalised tax  infrastructure,  such  as\r\n\r\nreturning   part   of  surpluses  to  the  stakeholders,   as\r\n\r\nundertaken  in  this Budget, can promote a more  dynamic  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  economy with lesser debt burden.   This  was\r\n\r\nfurther reinforced by Dr Wang Kai Yuen who also spoke on this\r\n\r\nissue earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, allow me to touch on globalisation impact on the\r\n\r\nlower  income group and small SMEs.  Sir, while  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's Budget should give us good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreason  to  cheer  about,  the rapidly  deteriorating  global\r\n\r\neconomic  environment certainly does not.  Manufacturers  are\r\n\r\nstarting to scramble to trim their sails in response  to  the\r\n\r\nslowdown  in  the  United States and in case  the  US  market\r\n\r\ndrought  is prolonged.  In Singapore, our MNCs and  high-tech\r\n\r\nmanufacturers are the pumping chambers of our economic heart,\r\n\r\nwith  electronic  manufacturing making up 64%  of  our  total\r\n\r\nexports  and accounting for more than half of our  industrial\r\n\r\nproduction.     Thus,  a  slowdown  in   world   demand   for\r\n\r\nelectronics products will have a significant impact  on  jobs\r\n\r\nrelated  to the electronic industry.  This is the reality  of\r\n\r\nthe  sweeping forces of globalisation affecting Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nand  this will continue to affect our lives even more  so  in\r\n\r\nthis new millennium.  My worry, Sir, is particularly for  our\r\n\r\nolder   and   lower   income   workers.    Apart   from   the\r\n\r\nuncontrollable  global economic cycles, faster  technological\r\n\r\nchanges would also affect these workers' ability to hold jobs\r\n\r\ndue to more aggressive regional and global competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not as concerned about our young Singaporeans as I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they are more adaptable to high-tech life and  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  environment.  However,  it  is  this  ready\r\n\r\nacceptance and adaptation by the younger generation that will\r\n\r\npropel  our  transition  into a knowledge-based  economy  and\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly make the digital divide more pronounced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, Sir, I would like to call on the Government to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to intensify its efforts and to act decisively  and\r\n\r\nquickly to help our older adult population in retraining  and\r\n\r\nreskilling them.  Equipping them with knowledge of IT  should\r\n\r\nalso be a priority, as most industrial jobs today require  IT\r\n\r\nfamiliarisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge the Finance Minister to support this\r\n\r\nurgent  and  worthwhile cause to minimise  the  threat  of  a\r\n\r\ndigitally divided society.  In view of the imminent threat of\r\n\r\nanother round of unemployment, I would urge the Government to\r\n\r\nharness  and  take advantage of all existing  infrastructure,\r\n\r\nincluding creating new avenues, if necessary, to retrain  and\r\n\r\nreskill older\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers.   This includes tapping into the vast  resources  of\r\n\r\nour   unions,   working   with   grassroots   and   community\r\n\r\norganisations and employer groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides individuals, many of our small SMEs are also\r\n\r\nstruggling   to   survive  as  a  result   of   the   rapidly\r\n\r\nrestructuring  economy.  In spite of  the  sterling  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  last year, it is not uncommon to hear groans  of  our\r\n\r\nsmall businesses that they have not benefited that much  from\r\n\r\nlast year's 9.9% economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is common for owners of SMEs to pledge their\r\n\r\nproperties  against  bank borrowings.  Prices  of  properties\r\n\r\ntoday  are  subject  to wild swings and when  these  diminish\r\n\r\nsubstantially,  such as the case during the financial  crisis\r\n\r\nyears,  banks unhesitatingly demand for immediate top-ups  to\r\n\r\nmake  up  for the difference if the outstanding loan  amounts\r\n\r\nare  above the diminished collateral value.  Those who  could\r\n\r\nnot  pay had to declare bankruptcy.  Sir, there are signs  of\r\n\r\nsimilar trends emerging as a result of the economic slowdown.\r\n\r\nI  would like to therefore ask the Government to consider the\r\n\r\nexploration  and  facilitation of some form of  an  insurance\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  be in place for such cases if  none  currently\r\n\r\nexists.   This will help prevent viable SMEs from  having  to\r\n\r\nwind up just because of a temporary downturn situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Relief for Knowledge Upgrading</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to tax relief for knowledge upgrading. On the\r\n\r\nsame  token,  Sir, the Government should be pleased  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  many mid-career workers have responded well to the call\r\n\r\nfor   lifelong  learning  by  upgrading  themselves   through\r\n\r\nenrolment  in  professional and  degree  courses.   A  recent\r\n\r\nStraits  Times'  report noted that about  25,400  people  are\r\n\r\ndoing  this based on 1999 data.  The course fees are not  low\r\n\r\nand  can amount to tens of thousands of dollars.  As such,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Finance Minister to review and consider\r\n\r\ndoubling the current course fee relief from $2,500 to $5,000.\r\n\r\nThis should be done not only in appreciation of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeoples'  positive response to the call for lifelong learning\r\n\r\nbut also to encourage more to do so.  Investment in education\r\n\r\nwill  go a long way in increasing each citizen's contribution\r\n\r\nto Singapore's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Attracting Back Singaporeans and Retaining Singaporean Talent</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, is on attracting back Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  retaining  Singaporean  talent.   An  estimated  200,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are currently living abroad.  Many,  I  believe,\r\n\r\nare professionals who could make a meaningful contribution to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Therefore,  in  addition  to  our  endeavour  to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign talent to work in Singapore, we should  also\r\n\r\nintensify  efforts to create more opportunities for  talented\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  living  abroad to  return  home.   We  need  to\r\n\r\ncontinually  re-examine  our environment  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nfactors why many Singaporeans choose to live and work abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, the Government is now much more receptive to\r\n\r\nget  feedback and ideas from Singaporeans.  This may  not  be\r\n\r\nknown  to  fellow Singaporeans living abroad  who  felt  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  lacks  the  space for them to express  themselves.\r\n\r\nOne  way  is for the Government to more regularly communicate\r\n\r\nwith  overseas Singaporeans to keep them informed of  changes\r\n\r\nin  living  conditions  in Singapore to  keep  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nheartbeat pounding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are thinking of leaving Singapore, have\r\n\r\nthem  tell  us  our \"shortcomings\".  Be with us  to  build  a\r\n\r\nbetter  Singapore.  Make this our homeland, a country we  are\r\n\r\nproud to call our home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can create an abundance of opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  all  but  if  the sense of belonging of Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  begins to falter, then the future  of  the  nation\r\n\r\nwill be at stake.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Keeping Singaporeans Healthy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch briefly on keeping Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhealthy.   Is  Singapore a sickly nation?  I am  particularly\r\n\r\ndisturbed by the heading of the publication \"Today\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndated  23rd  February which implied that we are a  nation  of\r\n\r\nsick  people.  Our greatest resource is our people.  Everyone\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is important, no matter how old he or  she  is.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, a healthy individual can contribute more than an\r\n\r\nunhealthy  one.  Thus, leading a healthy life should  be  the\r\n\r\nnorm  for every Singaporean and each should be encouraged  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that the competitive environment we\r\n\r\nlive  in  contributes to stress in many people.  We therefore\r\n\r\nneed  to  and  can  do more to encourage and  motivate  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean to stay healthy and fit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Building more health clubs or exercise facilities in HDB\r\n\r\nand  industrial estates to encourage people to exercise  more\r\n\r\nso that they can stay fit.  Wherever possible, the facilities\r\n\r\nshould  be  free, but if charges are levied the fees  charged\r\n\r\nmust be reasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Building two or more grassroots clubs in strategic sites\r\n\r\naround  Singapore to encourage grassroots members  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  also indulge in healthy lifestyle.   Grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  play an integral role in community bonding  and  are\r\n\r\ntherefore valuable assets to the nation.

It is a delicious snack which is favoured\r\n\r\nby the young and old.  But then a friend of mine told me that\r\n\r\nsome  Singaporeans  would prefer to buy   ham  jin  ben,  the\r\n\r\nCantonese  pancake rather than the doughnut.  The  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat even before you start biting on it, there is already one\r\n\r\nmouthful  missing  as there is a hole in the  middle  of  the\r\n\r\ndoughnut.   That is why there are some people,  like  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang,  who would only focus on the  little  hole  but\r\n\r\nnegate  the  pleasure  that comes from the  dough  ring,  and\r\n\r\nforgetting that the structure of doughnut itself is  a  ring,\r\n\r\nand  the space in the centre is not a hole.  He said that the\r\n\r\n$230  saving for the lower-income taxpayer is not  a  saving.\r\n\r\nHe is looking not at a doughnut but a cake. No matter how big\r\n\r\nthe  cake is, he would say that it is not big enough.  Is  he\r\n\r\nsaying that the income tax saving totalling $700 million   is\r\n\r\nnot  a  saving?   What  kind of logic  is  this?   I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not immortal. We have still to\r\n\r\ntake  earthly  food and water to survive,  and  to  face  the\r\n\r\ncruel  reality.  The Government is mortal. It is not  a  god.\r\n\r\nIt  cannot turn stone into gold and cannot answer your  every\r\n\r\nprayer.   So what we need is a balanced budget that  benefits\r\n\r\neverybody.  Singapore is like a child born to a poor  family.\r\n\r\nIt  has to rely on itself and work hard to make its mark.  We\r\n\r\ndo not have oil.  We do not have natural gas.  Even water has\r\n\r\nto be imported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society may not be so perfect. But we have very\r\n\r\nsound  systems. Apart from the Government agencies,  we  have\r\n\r\nvery  extensive  grassroots  network.   Whenever  the  people\r\n\r\nencounter difficulties, there is always a way out.  The  only\r\n\r\nproblem is some people are not aware of the relevant measures\r\n\r\nand  where  to  seek  help.  With  some guidance  from  other\r\n\r\npeople, they  are enlightened, and very often, they will  see\r\n\r\nthe  light  at  the  end  of  the channel.   However,  it  is\r\n\r\nregrettable  there are some people, like the  NCMP,  who  are\r\n\r\nalways putting forward some fallacious arguments rather  than\r\n\r\nlending  a  helping hand to those who need help.  They  could\r\n\r\nonly  exaggerate the problem and inflate the hardship.  Their\r\n\r\nmentality and behaviour are like a song that is made known by\r\n\r\nthe  popular  Hong  Kong star,  Roman  Tam,  \"Loving  You  Is\r\n\r\nHurting You\".  Why should the love become a harm to you?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need are realistic policies and solutions to the\r\n\r\nproblems,   so  that  our people can survive  in  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy  and continue to enjoy better quality of life.   Even\r\n\r\nwhen there is an income gap, everyone's living conditions can\r\n\r\nbe improved continuously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to learn from the Minister that our\r\n\r\nutilities industry will be further deregulated and the  power\r\n\r\nand  gas supply market will be fully opened up.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nthrough  competition, cost-effectiveness  will  be  enhanced,\r\n\r\nthereby  relieving our people from the pressure of escalating\r\n\r\nelectricity charges. I hope that the Minister would take some\r\n\r\nsteps to restrain the rise in electricity tariffs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very glad to learn that the Government will\r\n\r\nincrease the Medical Endowment Fund to $800 million  as  this\r\n\r\nwill  imply  that more than $30 million will be allocated  to\r\n\r\nthe  Medifund  every year to help the poor in settling  their\r\n\r\nmedical  bills.   The $1 billion Lifelong Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund  would also mean that, every year, $40 million could  be\r\n\r\nspent to finance our workers in training and skill upgrading.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the Government would consider increasing  these\r\n\r\nfunds  when there are surpluses and also to raise the ceiling\r\n\r\nfor  matching  grant  to the Community  Development  Councils\r\n\r\n(CDCs).   This  will  enable  the  CDCs   to  provide  better\r\n\r\nservices to the less privileged in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have collated some feedback from the television forum\r\n\r\ncorner,  the  coffee-shops  and meetings  of  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  and  I  would like to  present  them  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for his consideration:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Why is the Government deciding on the amount of\r\n\r\nrebates  on  utilities  and service and  conservancy  charges\r\n\r\nbased  on the sizes of the HDB flats rather than the combined\r\n\r\nincomes   of   the   families?  Quite  a  large   number   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  incomes are not really commensurate  with  the\r\n\r\nsize of the flat they live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can the said rebates be extended to all households?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The personal income tax relief has stagnated at\r\n\r\n$3,000  for  many  years.  Can the Government  consider  some\r\n\r\nupward adjustment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The relief for parental care is fixed at $5,000 and\r\n\r\n$3,500, depending on whether the taxpayer is staying with the\r\n\r\nparents.   Can the Government consider granting the taxpayers\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  living with their parents but are deliberately\r\n\r\nstaying close to their parents so that they could look  after\r\n\r\nthem, the higher relief as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as we move towards a knowledge-based economy,\r\n\r\nthe   economic  structure  will  be  facing  all   sorts   of\r\n\r\nrestructuring  and changes, and the welfare  of  our  workers\r\n\r\nwill   inevitably  be  affected.   The  labour  movement   in\r\n\r\nSingapore is promoting more flexible labour welfare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  more effectively protect the interests  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers,  particularly medical benefits.  Can the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider  raising  the  2% cap on tax exemption  for  medical\r\n\r\nexpenses?  Perhaps,  the Government could  consider  granting\r\n\r\nfurther  tax  concessions  for  employers  who  support   the\r\n\r\nportable  medical  benefits system or  who  voluntarily  make\r\n\r\nadditional contributions to the employees' medical accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Suspension of Standing Orders)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consent of Mr Speaker and the general assent of\r\n\r\nMembers present, Question put and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item under discussion be\r\n\r\nexempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 45  so  as\r\n\r\nto  remove the time limit to enable the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nto  reply adequately to all the points raised by Members.   - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br>4.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, let me first thank all Members of  this  House\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken on the Budget on Monday and this afternoon.\r\n\r\nBecause of time constraints, I will focus on the major issues\r\n\r\nraised  by Members; where they have raised points of details,\r\n\r\nI will have to leave them to be discussed in the Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Budget debate, some Members commented\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  was too quick to  withdraw  the  cost-cutting  measures  introduced during the 1997/1998  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis, even as we emerged from the crisis with a respectable\r\n\r\ngrowth of 5.9% in 1999.  This year, despite a stronger growth\r\n\r\nof  9.9%  in  the  year  2000, Members have  again  expressed\r\n\r\nsimilar concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These calls for help are a reflection that economic\r\n\r\ngrowth has not been evenly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspread  out  in  Singapore.  Although SMEs in the  knowledge-based sectors and those servicing the multinational companies\r\n\r\nhave  done well, and have benefited from the strong  external\r\n\r\ndemand  in  the  past two years, other SMEs in  the  domestic\r\n\r\nsectors have not done as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government understands the cost pressures these SMEs\r\n\r\nare  facing.   Therefore, although the  one-off  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  were  meant to help tide them  over  the  temporary\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties, the Government has not withdrawn  all\r\n\r\nthe  cost-cutting measures.  For example, the employer's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate has not been fully restored to 20%.  JTC is\r\n\r\nstill  granting  a  rebate of up to  10%  of  its  customers'\r\n\r\ncontracted  rents.   The  HDB is also  extending  its  rental\r\n\r\nrebate  until  the  end  of this year at  half  the  original\r\n\r\nquantum.    The  gradual  phasing  out  of  the  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures has not resulted in any substantial rise in business\r\n\r\ncosts.   In  fact,  Unit  Labour Cost  for  the  economy  has\r\n\r\ncontinued to fall, by 0.9% last year, and Unit Business  Cost\r\n\r\nof manufacturing also declined, by 1.1%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should distinguish between temporary difficulties,\r\n\r\nfor  which short-term cost-cutting measures are helpful,  and\r\n\r\nmore   fundamental  changes,  which  have  to  be  confronted\r\n\r\ndirectly.   We  cannot meet the new challenges ahead  through\r\n\r\nrebates  and  cost  subsidies. As we  enter  the  new  global\r\n\r\neconomy  where knowledge, creativity and innovation  are  the\r\n\r\nkey  competitive advantages, the challenges brought about  by\r\n\r\nglobalisation can only be met by upgrading our capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore introduced a slate of\r\n\r\nmeasures  in  Budget  2001 to reposition  ourselves  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   The  Budget  this  year  is  aimed  at  creating  a\r\n\r\nframework  for  businesses to flourish,  and  maximising  the\r\n\r\npotential  of  all  Singaporeans.   The  package  of  revenue\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  increase our competitiveness.  A  preliminary\r\n\r\nstudy  indicates that they could enhance our economic  growth\r\n\r\nby around 0.2% this year and by a further 0.4% next year.  As\r\n\r\nthe  tax rate cuts are permanent, they provide companies  and\r\n\r\nindividuals   with  the  certainty  they  need  in   business\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we push ahead in sectors that are growing\r\n\r\nrapidly,  the Government recognises the need to  help  slower\r\n\r\nsectors   upgrade   or   restructure.  Where   the   economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals  of  the  business  have  changed,  it  may   be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  some to shift to industries  offering  better\r\n\r\nprospects.  The Government will extend help to them in making\r\n\r\nthese adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, our social cohesion must remain\r\n\r\nstrong.  The economic fruits of our success have to be shared\r\n\r\nwith  all  segments of our population.  This  year,  we  have\r\n\r\ntherefore  designed a progressive package of  Budget  \"share-outs\".   More importantly, ample help will also be  given  to\r\n\r\nthose who are not doing as well, through various means,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Manpower  Development  Assistance  Scheme,  and  the\r\n\r\nLifelong Learning Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I proceed to address major issues raised by\r\n\r\nMembers,   I   would  like  to  correct  several   misleading\r\n\r\nstatements  made  by  Mr  Low Thia  Khiang  and  by  Mr  J  B\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low claims that the personal tax rate cuts mainly\r\n\r\nbenefit  the rich because their savings in dollar  terms  are\r\n\r\nhigher  than  lower income persons.  I hope that  he  is  not\r\n\r\nnaive  enough to believe that this is a legitimate complaint.\r\n\r\nHe  must know that the tax cuts are structured so that higher\r\n\r\nincome  persons  will receive lower tax  cuts  in  percentage\r\n\r\nterms  than  lower  income persons.  It is  not  feasible  to\r\n\r\ndevise a tax cut in which lower income taxpayers receive more\r\n\r\ntax savings in money terms than higher income taxpayers.   He\r\n\r\nalso  conveniently  forgets that nearly 70%  of  economically\r\n\r\nactive persons in Singapore no longer pay any personal income\r\n\r\ntax,  and  the  taxes  paid by the remaining  30%  ultimately\r\n\r\nappear  as part of the budget surpluses used to pay  for  the\r\n\r\nCPF  top-ups, S&C charges and utilities rebates given to  the\r\n\r\nlower income persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 70% who do not pay any income tax at all, they\r\n\r\nbenefit  directly  from  the CPF  top-ups,  the  S&C  charges\r\n\r\nrebates and Utilities Save.  As these payments are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmade  in money terms, we have structured the payments to give\r\n\r\nmore to the lower income persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also says that the Government should guarantee\r\n\r\nthat the cost of living in Singapore would not go up.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible  to  give  such a guarantee.  First,  the  main\r\n\r\ncontributor  to domestic inflation is the wage  increases  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   I hope that Mr Low is not suggesting that workers'\r\n\r\nwages  should be frozen.  Secondly, Mr Low must know  that  a\r\n\r\nlarge  proportion of everything that we consume is  imported.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot control the prices of imported goods, but the  MAS\r\n\r\nhas  been  quite successful in minimising imported  inflation\r\n\r\nthrough its management of the Singapore dollar exchange rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy has, therefore, been to keep\r\n\r\ninflation   as  low  as  possible  and  through  productivity\r\n\r\nimprovements, ensure that wages increase faster than the cost\r\n\r\nof   living.   This  way,  living  standards  will  rise  for\r\n\r\neveryone.   Over  the past 10 years, the cost  of  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as  measured by the Consumer Price  Index  (CPI),\r\n\r\nincreased  by  1.7%  per annum.  On the other  hand,  average\r\n\r\nhousehold income from work increased by 4.9% per annum.   The\r\n\r\naverage  household income has therefore gone up by  3.1%  per\r\n\r\nannum  in  real terms.  Today, households are therefore  much\r\n\r\nbetter off in income terms compared to 10 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam has made numerous comments on a broad\r\n\r\nrange  of topics.  He should take up such details during  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply.  But I have to comment on his references\r\n\r\nto the education, defence and health budgets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam quoted only the Ministry of Education's\r\n\r\noperating  budget of $4.9 billion.  This forms only  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  budget  for  education.  The  total  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation budget is, in fact, $6.3 billion, which is almost a\r\n\r\nthird more than the figure Mr Jeyaretnam quoted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also compared the MOE budget with the\r\n\r\ndefence  budget.  First,  there is  no  need  for  us  to  be\r\n\r\napologetic about our spending on defence.  Without safety and\r\n\r\nsecurity, all our hopes and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndreams  will  vanish.   Mr Jeyaretnam  should  not  misdirect\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with his naivete.  The defence budget is  capped\r\n\r\nat  6%  of  our  GDP.   It is an insurance  premium.   Actual\r\n\r\nexpenditures on defence have consistently hovered  around  5%\r\n\r\nin recent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are increasing the total education budget\r\n\r\nfor  FY2001  by $480 million, more than the $390 million  for\r\n\r\ndefence, which is, in turn, only slightly more than the  $370\r\n\r\nmillion  increase  for  health.  This demonstrates  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  sees education and health as matters of  national\r\n\r\npriority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also decries that we are not spending\r\n\r\nenough  on  healthcare.  He is not seeing the total  picture.\r\n\r\nIn  FY2001,  the  Ministry of Health's  budget  is  increased\r\n\r\nsignificantly  by 30% over FY2000.  In our public  hospitals,\r\n\r\nvery  substantial subsidies are provided - 80% for  Class  C,\r\n\r\nand  65%  for  Class B2.  These subsidy rates  apply  to  all\r\n\r\ncosts,  including medicine.  Primary healthcare treatment  is\r\n\r\nalso  heavily  subsidised in our polyclinics.   In  addition,\r\n\r\npatients  can  use their Medisave to pay for the  balance  of\r\n\r\ntheir hospital bills, and to take up MediShield to help  them\r\n\r\nshould  they  contract catastrophic illnesses.  Patients  who\r\n\r\nare  not able to pay for their share of the medical bills can\r\n\r\napply  for  assistance from the Medifund.  The recipients  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance are given free medical  treatment  in  our\r\n\r\npublic  hospitals  and polyclinics. Healthcare  is  therefore\r\n\r\naccessible and affordable for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Outlook and Off-budget Measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Peh Chin Hua, Mr Chew Heng Ching,\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Ah Heng and others have expressed concern about  the\r\n\r\neconomic  outlook  this  year.   Some  have  asked   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is ready to consider off-budget measures  if  the\r\n\r\neconomy takes a turn for the worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's growth estimate of 5-7% for 2001 takes\r\n\r\ninto account the consensus of US growth forecast of 2-3%  for\r\n\r\nthe  year  as a whole.  If US growth should turn  out  to  be\r\n\r\nsubstantially lower,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  forecasts will have to be adjusted downwards, but it  is\r\n\r\nstill too early to tell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the economy really falter, Members can be assured\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will take whatever measures  needed  to\r\n\r\nstabilise the economy.  We did so in 1998 and we will  do  it\r\n\r\nagain if the need arises as we have the resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker Sin Tze and Prof. Low Seow Chay want the property\r\n\r\ntax rate to be cut by more than 2% because they said that the\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  rebate  will  be withdrawn  after  June.   The\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  rebate  was  introduced  to  help  ease   cost\r\n\r\npressures  on  companies during the 1997/1998  crisis.   With\r\n\r\nimproved  economic  growth in 1999 and 2000,  rental  markets\r\n\r\nhave  improved  considerably, so  an  extension  of  the  25%\r\n\r\nproperty tax rebate is no longer justified.  However, to help\r\n\r\nreduce  business costs in the longer term,  I  have  cut  the\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  rate by 2%.  Unlike a rebate, a permanent  tax\r\n\r\ncut provides businesses with certainty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested that the Government remove\r\n\r\nproperty   tax   altogether,  especially  for  owner-occupied\r\n\r\ncommercial properties.  I should point out that property  tax\r\n\r\nis  still  a  significant  and stable  source  of  Government\r\n\r\nrevenue.   It  can be reduced but not eliminated  altogether,\r\n\r\notherwise  other taxes will have to be raised.  Also,  it  is\r\n\r\nwrong  to make a distinction between owner-occupied and  let-out  commercial and industrial buildings.  Removing  property\r\n\r\ntax  only  for owner-occupied commercial properties  distorts\r\n\r\nbusiness decisions by making rental properties more expensive\r\n\r\nthan owner-occupied premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay and Mr Noris Ong have asked for the\r\n\r\nremoval of property market anti-speculation measures to  help\r\n\r\nthe   property   sector.   I  feel  that  there   is   little\r\n\r\njustification  for  this.  Although the  property  market  is\r\n\r\nfacing  a  period of lacklustre performance, the  residential\r\n\r\nprice  index  of  132.8 for the fourth  quarter  of  2000  is\r\n\r\ncurrently well above its trough of 100 in the fourth  quarter\r\n\r\nof 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Help for Small Businesses</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Noris Ong and Mr Lew\r\n\r\nSyn  Pau  have  stressed  the importance  of  giving  SMEs  a\r\n\r\nfighting   chance  to  survive  in  a  rapidly  restructuring\r\n\r\neconomy.  The Government has implemented a host of programmes\r\n\r\nand   financial  schemes  to  help  SMEs  grow,  expand   and\r\n\r\nregionalise  their  businesses.   EDB,  PSB,  IDA  and  other\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies offer more than 60 programmes  for  local\r\n\r\ncompanies at different stages of development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the tax exemption scheme that I am\r\n\r\nintroducing  to  the  corporate  tax  regime  this  year   is\r\n\r\nspecifically  designed to help small companies and  start-ups\r\n\r\ngrow  by  allowing them to plough more of their profits  back\r\n\r\ninto  their  businesses.  Mr Noris  Ong  asked  for  a  small\r\n\r\ncompanies  tax  rate,  saying  that  the  $100,000  exemption\r\n\r\nthreshold may not be enough.  I believe that the measures  we\r\n\r\nhave  introduced in this Budget are sufficient for now.  Two-thirds  of  small companies will have their taxes reduced  by\r\n\r\nmore than half.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Incentives for Businesses</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has called for more incentives for\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and entrepreneurs, and a Lifeline  Fund  to  help\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   There  are already existing schemes  in  place,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  Innovation  Development  Scheme  and  Overseas\r\n\r\nEnterprise Incentive Scheme, to help companies improve  their\r\n\r\nproductivity, to regionalise and to bring in new activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry will address other\r\n\r\npoints  on the SMEs in greater detail, including the specific\r\n\r\nproposal for a Lifeline Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Help for Construction Industry</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Prof. Low Seow Chay and Dr Teo Ho Pin\r\n\r\nhave  expressed concerns about the construction industry.   I\r\n\r\nshould point out however that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontraction of construction output has moderated in year 2000\r\n\r\nand  the  growth rate of the construction sector  could  turn\r\n\r\npositive this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue for construction is productivity\r\n\r\nimprovement   and   Government  is  pushing   on   with   the\r\n\r\nConstruction  21  blueprint  to help  construction  firms  to\r\n\r\nupgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Government-linked Companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Kenneth Chen and Mr Simon Tay have\r\n\r\nraised   concerns  over  perceived  unfair   competition   by\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies (GLCs) in the domestic market.  I\r\n\r\nwould  reiterate  that GLCs operate on  a  commercial  basis.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not receive any subsidies or preferential treatment\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government, and are subject to the same regulations\r\n\r\nand market forces as private entrepreneurs and SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek Holdings, the holding company of the GLCs, will\r\n\r\ncontinue to drive GLCs to focus on their core competencies in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  to expand into the region.   GLCs  will  also\r\n\r\nundertake  commercial  investments that  enhance  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic and business infrastructure.  These investments  may\r\n\r\nbe in new technologies and capabilities where the risk is too\r\n\r\nhigh  for  private  funding or where  private  enterprise  is\r\n\r\nlacking.  They can contribute to projects that complement the\r\n\r\nefforts  of other Singapore companies and economic  agencies,\r\n\r\nand partner local companies in their regionalisation efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to issues relating to tax and budget\r\n\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Accuracy of Estimates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has commented on the differences\r\n\r\nbetween  the  estimated and revised revenue  and  expenditure\r\n\r\nforecasts.  Operating  revenue  in  FY2000  was  higher  than\r\n\r\nforecast  because real GDP growth in 2000 turned  out  to  be\r\n\r\nmuch  higher  at  9.9% compared to the original  estimate  of\r\n\r\nbetween  4.5-6.5%.   This vast change in economic  growth  is\r\n\r\ntypical of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  economy  like  Singapore, which is heavily  dependent  on\r\n\r\nexports.   It  is  extremely difficult to  forecast  how  our\r\n\r\nexport   partners'  economies  will  do.   In  the  case   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenses,  actual  expenditure  was  lower  than\r\n\r\nforecast because tender prices were low and there were delays\r\n\r\nin implementing several development projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Endowment Funds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also asked for the various endowment funds to be\r\n\r\nsubject  to parliamentary scrutiny.  All the endowment  funds\r\n\r\nwere set up through Acts of Parliament and the administration\r\n\r\nof  the  endowment funds is subject to the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nActs  passed  by  Parliament.  The annual reports,  financial\r\n\r\nstatements and auditor's reports for the endowment funds  are\r\n\r\nalso  presented to Parliament annually.  In addition, Members\r\n\r\ncan raise queries about the use of the endowment funds during\r\n\r\nthe   Committee  of  Supply  proceedings,  and   can   direct\r\n\r\nparliamentary  questions on them to the respective  Ministers\r\n\r\nat other times of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Net Investment Income</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen also touched on the treatment of Net\r\n\r\nInvestment  Income  (NII)  in the FY2000  and  FY2001  budget\r\n\r\npresentation.  He said that Government is mixing up  new  and\r\n\r\nold  money  by having NII contribution as an \"above-the-line\"\r\n\r\nitem.    I   would  say  that  Dr  Wang  is  mistaken.    NII\r\n\r\ncontribution  is the portion of NII that remains  as  current\r\n\r\nreserves  under  the amended Constitution.  It  is  thus  new\r\n\r\nmoney  and  the  issue of mixing new and old money  does  not\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of NII contribution as an \"above-the-line\"\r\n\r\nitem does not represent any sudden change in the Government's\r\n\r\nfiscal  policies.   Although NII contribution  is  above-the-line,  we  will not, as in the past, make use of this  income\r\n\r\nstream  until there is a need to.  Tax revenue and  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges will continue to be the primary source of revenue for\r\n\r\nGovernment.  For FY2001, we see no need to make use of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nany  part  of the NII contribution as normal revenue  streams\r\n\r\nalone  will  be more than sufficient to pay for  all  planned\r\n\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much NII to keep available for spending, subject to\r\n\r\nusing  a maximum of 50% of the NII earned from past reserves,\r\n\r\nis  something  that  the Government will have  to  decide  on\r\n\r\nannually,  taking  into consideration budgetary  needs.   The\r\n\r\nreal  budgetary pressures of a rapidly ageing population  are\r\n\r\nnot upon us yet.  The proportion of elderly aged 65 years and\r\n\r\nabove  is projected to increase from the current 7.3% to  13%\r\n\r\nby the year 2020 and to 19% by the year 2030.  This will mean\r\n\r\nmore  expenditure looking after the elderly and the  sick  in\r\n\r\nthe  future years.  At the same time there will be a downward\r\n\r\npressure  on  revenue  as our tax base  narrows.  There  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  greater calls on our NII in  the  future.   We\r\n\r\nmust, therefore, be conservative in our spending now and plan\r\n\r\nwisely for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also pointed out that the NII contribution\r\n\r\nexpected  for  FY2001  is  lower than  that  for  FY2000  and\r\n\r\nquestioned whether this is due to the poor performance of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore Investment  Corporation  (GIC).   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  assure Dr Wang that this  is  not  so.   The\r\n\r\ninvestment  income  for  FY2000  is  higher  due  to  special\r\n\r\ndividends  received by the Government from Temasek  Holdings.\r\n\r\nDiscounting the special dividends, the investment incomes for\r\n\r\nthe 2 years are comparable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Corporate Tax Regime</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Iswaran and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua have\r\n\r\nasked  whether  the cut in our corporate tax below  25%  will\r\n\r\ntrigger  off anti-tax haven measures.  With other  countries,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Germany,  United  Kingdom,  Australia  and  Ireland\r\n\r\nreducing their corporate tax rates, we see the need to reduce\r\n\r\nour    corporate    tax   rate   to   maintain    Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   We need not be overly concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nanti-tax  haven measures of other countries as most  anti-tax\r\n\r\nhaven  rules  are triggered against passive  income  and  not\r\n\r\nactive income.  We have always\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencouraged   foreign  companies  to  set  up  operations   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  with substantial real activities in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nnot just use Singapore as a base for booking activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan has asked whether the Government will\r\n\r\nput  in place regulations to prevent companies from splitting\r\n\r\nup  into  smaller  companies  to  enjoy  the  three-tier  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  scheme.  The exemptions were given to help  mainly\r\n\r\nthe smaller and less profitable companies.  It is, of course,\r\n\r\npossible that profitable larger companies may break  up  into\r\n\r\nsmaller  entities in order to enjoy larger tax  savings.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment will monitor the situation carefully and if abuses\r\n\r\nare  found,  tax  rules will be put in  place  to  curb  such\r\n\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Company Stock Option Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran said that the Company Stock Option Scheme\r\n\r\n(CSOP)   should  enjoy  the  same  tax  exemptions   as   the\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial  Employee  Stock Option  Scheme  (EESOS).   I\r\n\r\nwould  point out that in the case of start-ups, stock options\r\n\r\nare  the  main tools for attracting and retaining  talent  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  able  to  pay competitive  salaries.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary  to  provide  the  start-ups  with  more\r\n\r\nincentives.    On   the  other  hand,  in  most   established\r\n\r\ncompanies,  stock  options do not form a major  part  of  the\r\n\r\nannual compensation for most employees.  The two schemes  are\r\n\r\ntherefore structured differently.  Mr Iswaran also wanted  to\r\n\r\nknow  how  the  50%  rule would apply to Singapore  companies\r\n\r\nwhich employ many staff in their overseas factories.  In such\r\n\r\ncases, companies with production factories overseas can still\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  CSOP scheme as long as the conditions  have  been\r\n\r\nsatisfied by their Singapore operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Goods and Services Tax</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas has asked for GST to be reduced in view\r\n\r\nof  our  surpluses.  Our GST rate of 3% is the lowest in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  There is therefore no reason to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreduce the GST rate.  Mr Sinnakaruppan has also asked if  the\r\n\r\ncuts  in income taxes would lead to a higher GST rate by  the\r\n\r\nend of next year.  The answer is a simple \"no\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua is concerned that the cuts in personal\r\n\r\nincome tax will shrink our tax base and eventually limit  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of income tax adjustments as a fiscal  tool  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  There is no reason for immediate concern as all  the\r\n\r\ntax  changes announced in this year's Budget will only narrow\r\n\r\nour  tax  net  marginally by 2 percentage  points,  from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent 32% to 30%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share her concern, however, that we should take care\r\n\r\nnot  to  narrow  our tax net by too much.  Hence,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsupportive  of  Mr  Chew  Heng Ching's  and  Mr  Noris  Ong's\r\n\r\nproposals that we should introduce more generous personal tax\r\n\r\nreliefs.  Doing so will shrink our tax net even further.   My\r\n\r\npreference is to cut tax rates directly as this will  benefit\r\n\r\nall  taxpayers,  and not benefit special groups  selectively,\r\n\r\nunless there are overriding reasons to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr S Vasoo and Dr Jennifer Lee and others have expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  over the widening income gap and the plight  of  the\r\n\r\nless  well  off.  The widening income gap is a reflection  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  and  the  transition  into  a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.    Salaries  at  the  top  end  will   be   globally\r\n\r\ndetermined, as countries compete for talent.  Skilled workers\r\n\r\nwill also be able to command good salaries. This is something\r\n\r\nwe cannot avoid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the income difference in itself is not the\r\n\r\nfundamental  problem.  The issue is whether  those  with  low\r\n\r\nincomes  can make ends meet, and whether they are given  help\r\n\r\nto  lift  themselves out of their circumstances.   Government\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  assist the lower income group through  various\r\n\r\nmeasures  like the S&C rebates, Utilities Save and  CPF  Top-ups,  where those with lower incomes receive more.   Just  as\r\n\r\ncritically, Government has invested heavily in the  provision\r\n\r\nof  formal  education, offering quality primary and secondary\r\n\r\nschooling  at  very low fees.  Schools have schemes  to  help\r\n\r\nthose  who cannot afford even these fees.  Children from  the\r\n\r\nlower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome  group  will  be able to go as far  up  the  education\r\n\r\nladder as they can go, and be assured of a good future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See, Dr Lily Neo and Mr Thomas Thomas have\r\n\r\nasked the Government to do more for the elderly and the sick.\r\n\r\nBesides  the  subsidies and assistance  offered  through  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health and the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nand  Sports,  the Government has also set up  and  grown  the\r\n\r\nMedifund and the ElderCare Fund, which help the elderly  with\r\n\r\ntheir medical and nursing needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government believes that this is one area where it\r\n\r\nis  important  to have joint responsibility.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  do  its  part  to ensure accessibility  and  affordable\r\n\r\nservices.   The individual must also contribute by leading  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  lifestyle  and planning and saving  for  retirement.\r\n\r\nThe  family  and  the community must also do  their  part  in\r\n\r\nlooking after their elderly family members and the needy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas, Mr Chew Heng Ching, Dr S Vasoo and\r\n\r\nothers  have  asked  that more be done  for  our  pensioners.\r\n\r\nPensioners  receive the same benefits as other  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the CPF top-ups, rebates for S&C charges, Utilities\r\n\r\nSave,  Pre-Medisave  Top-ups and MediShield  Scheme  for  the\r\n\r\nElderly.  In addition, they are eligible for generous medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.   Pensioners have also benefited from the ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayments  given in 1996 and again in 2000, of between  6  and\r\n\r\n13.5  months  of  pensions, depending on the  date  of  their\r\n\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensioners with low pensions are also given the\r\n\r\nSingapore Allowance which is reviewed from time to time,  the\r\n\r\nlast revision being in 1997. With effect from 1st April 2001,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Allowance will be increased by a further $10 to\r\n\r\na  total  of  $150  per month, and the gross pension  ceiling\r\n\r\nraised  to $1,050 per month.  This increase took into account\r\n\r\nthe  cumulative inflation of 3.2% since the last revision  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Allowance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua\r\n\r\nhave  asked for more to be done to bridge the digital divide.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagree  that  Singaporeans need to embrace info-communications\r\n\r\ntechnology (ICT) to take advantage of the availability of  e-services.   However, not all Singaporeans are  familiar  with\r\n\r\nICT  and  are  able  to  transact  over  the  Internet.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's response is therefore two-fold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government will continually enhance the user-friendliness of its own electronic services. By being more\r\n\r\ncustomer-centric  and  integrated  in  the  way  we   deliver\r\n\r\nservices online, we make it easier for members of the  public\r\n\r\nto  switch  from  traditional modes of  service  delivery  to\r\n\r\nelectronic  service delivery, such as the  one-stop  eCitizen\r\n\r\nCentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward in e-Government, we will also need to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that people's attitudes keep up with the  changes.\r\n\r\nHence  our  second prong is to provide ICT  training  to  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  so that they are better able to seize the  benefits\r\n\r\nof  the new technologies.  The IDA has therefore set aside  a\r\n\r\n$25  million  budget spread over three years to  run  various\r\n\r\nprogrammes targeted at the elderly and others who are on  the\r\n\r\nwrong  side  of the digital divide.  Our CDCs too have  taken\r\n\r\nthe  lead  to  implement their own district IT plans  and  to\r\n\r\nbring IT training to the doorstep of residents.  In addition,\r\n\r\nwe need to encourage Singaporeans at the school and community\r\n\r\nlevels who can handle Internet transactions to help those who\r\n\r\ncannot.  Such community-based efforts are essential to bridge\r\n\r\nthe digital divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Harun Ghani, Mr Hawazi Daipi, Mr\r\n\r\nIbrahim Othman and others have spoken about the importance of\r\n\r\nkeeping  our  workers  relevant  in  the  new  economy.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment   recognises  the  importance  of   training   and\r\n\r\nretraining for our workforce. This is necessary to  keep  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy competitive and to help our workers  remain\r\n\r\nemployable and to enjoy good wages. The Government will spend\r\n\r\nmore  than  $30 million this year on the Manpower Development\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme and other initiatives to help the workforce\r\n\r\nupgrade.  The  Government will also contribute  another  $500\r\n\r\nmillion  in  FY2001 to bring the Lifelong Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund to $1 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng has suggested setting up a coordinating\r\n\r\ncommittee  for  workers' training.  I  believe  this  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  as  there already is a National  Manpower  Council\r\n\r\nchaired by the Minister for Manpower to develop, monitor  and\r\n\r\ncoordinate policies on developing our workforce.  The members\r\n\r\ninclude  the  Minister for Trade and Industry,  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation,  Chairman  of  the Public Service  Commission  and\r\n\r\nsenior  officials  from  many other agencies,  including  the\r\n\r\nNTUC,  Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Finance,  Mindef,\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development   Board  and  National   Science   and\r\n\r\nTechnology  Board. The wide representation  in  the  National\r\n\r\nManpower  Council  will help to align  the  various  training\r\n\r\nschemes with the present and future needs of the economy.   I\r\n\r\nam  sure the Ministry of Manpower will take into account  the\r\n\r\ncomments  by  Prof. Simon Tay and others on the  use  of  the\r\n\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has proposed giving tax rebates for\r\n\r\ncompanies   which   employ  older  or   retrenched   workers.\r\n\r\nEmployers  are  already  paying lower  CPF  rates  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers.    Singapore  runs  an  open  market   economy   and\r\n\r\ndistortions  to the market must be kept as low  as  possible.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  offer additional help to older  and  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers by way of training, retraining and re-skilling.  What\r\n\r\ncompanies  pay  their workers must be a reflection  of  their\r\n\r\nproductivity, taking into account their capacity  to  do  the\r\n\r\njob, their reliability and their loyalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang felt that\r\n\r\nUtilities Save eligibility should not be confined to 1- to 5-room  HDB flats.  Utilities Save is meant as a way of sharing\r\n\r\nthe   budget  surplus,  and  not  as  a  means  of  shielding\r\n\r\nSingaporean  households  from  the  effects  of  fuel   price\r\n\r\nincreases.   It  is  targeted at the lower and  middle-income\r\n\r\ngroups,  as the higher income group would benefit from  other\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus sharing measures such as income tax  rebates.\r\n\r\nUtilities Save is therefore limited to households in 1- to 5-room  HDB  flats.  About 75% of households will benefit  from\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government recognises that using HDB flat\r\n\r\nsize  as a proxy for income levels is not perfect.  The ideal\r\n\r\nsolution would be to disburse the rebates in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe financial needs of the households.  Such an approach will\r\n\r\nbe  more equitable, but it will require a comprehensive means\r\n\r\ntest  for  individual  households, taking  into  account  the\r\n\r\nincome  levels,  number of household members and  dependants,\r\n\r\nthe  assets owned by them, and so forth.  This will make  the\r\n\r\nsystem  very  complex  and intrusive.   There  are  close  to\r\n\r\n700,000 HDB households in 1- to 5-room flats alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Ong Ah Heng have asked the\r\n\r\nGovernment to slow down the progress of adjusting  the  water\r\n\r\nand utilities levies.  Electricity and water charges make  up\r\n\r\nthe   bulk   of   utilities  charges  for  households.    Our\r\n\r\nelectricity tariffs are reviewed quarterly, based on fuel oil\r\n\r\nprices at the time of review.  Fuel oil prices have increased\r\n\r\nsteadily from US$11 per barrel in 1998 to a high of US$28 per\r\n\r\nbarrel  in October 2000.   Fortunately, fuel oil prices  have\r\n\r\nsince  eased to about US$22 in recent months.   If  fuel  oil\r\n\r\nprices continue to fall, electricity tariffs will also drop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of water, the Government has, in July 1997,\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  series  of revisions on  water  tariff,  water\r\n\r\nconservation  tax  and  water  borne  fees  to  reflect   the\r\n\r\nstrategic  importance  and scarcity  of  water.   These  were\r\n\r\nphased over four years, from 1997 to 2000.  The last revision\r\n\r\ntook  effect on 1st July 2000.  As of now, there is  no  plan\r\n\r\nfor further revision of water tariff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the CPF Top-Up Scheme, Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked\r\n\r\nthat  Government do away with the requirement for a $100 top-up for certain categories of people.  I should point out that\r\n\r\nco-payment is an important principle of governance, where the\r\n\r\nGovernment  joins together with the individual to look  after\r\n\r\nhis or her well being.  In the case of the CPF Top-up, the co-payment  serves  to  underline the importance  of  individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in saving and planning for one's  future  and\r\n\r\nretirement.   Removing the need for a $100  co-payment  would\r\n\r\nundermine this objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of making the co-payment to qualify\r\n\r\nfor  the  CPF Top-up lies with the individual and the family.\r\n\r\nFor  senior  citizens who are unable to  make  the  $100  co-payment,  the  children or other family members  should  come\r\n\r\nforward  to  help by volunteering to contribute the  $100  on\r\n\r\ntheir behalf, so they can get the top-up from the Government.\r\n\r\nCommunity  groups  such as Citizens' Consultative  Committees\r\n\r\nand  voluntary  welfare organisations have  offered  help  to\r\n\r\nthose without family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has said that steps should be taken to ensure a\r\n\r\nhigher take-up rate of the CPF Top-Up Scheme.  To put matters\r\n\r\nin  perspective,  I would like to point out that  the  latest\r\n\r\nparticipation  rate  of 91.2% compares very  favourably  with\r\n\r\nprevious exercises. The participation rate for the three runs\r\n\r\nof  the Share Ownership Top-up Scheme in 1993, 1995 and  1997\r\n\r\nwas  74%, while the Pre-Medisave Top-up for the elderly given\r\n\r\nfrom 1995 to 1998 had participation rates ranging from 65% to\r\n\r\n73%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Government will work towards getting\r\n\r\nmore Singaporeans to enjoy such top-ups.  As the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  informed this House last month, the CPF Board  will\r\n\r\nconduct  a survey to find out why nearly 200,000 Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndid not come forward to participate in the CPF Top-Up despite\r\n\r\nall  the publicity and encouragement.  We should wait for the\r\n\r\nresults  of the survey before deciding on what else needs  to\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Family</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked for more support to be given\r\n\r\nto  three-tier families through a Senior Citizens Bonus.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  supports and promotes the extended  family  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans  to  foster inter-generational cohesion and provide  an\r\n\r\ninformal support network for childcare and aged care.   There\r\n\r\nare already several incentives in place to encourage children\r\n\r\nto  look  after their parents and grandparents.  For example,\r\n\r\nthe tax relief for adults who live with aged parents has been\r\n\r\nincreased to $5,000.  The CPF Top-up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nScheme, under which taxpayers enjoy tax reliefs for cash top-ups  to  their parents' retirement accounts, is  extended  to\r\n\r\ninclude  grandparents.  HDB has also in place the CPF Housing\r\n\r\nGrant  Scheme to encourage young couples to stay  near  their\r\n\r\nparents.   Under the scheme, young couples who buy  a  resale\r\n\r\nflat  from  the  open market to stay near their  parents  are\r\n\r\ngiven a housing grant of $40,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides monetary incentives, there are other ways to\r\n\r\npromote  three-tier  family living.   MCDS  is  working  with\r\n\r\ncommunity  agencies to promote grandparenting skills  and  3-generation  bonding  activities.  Where  possible,  childcare\r\n\r\nfacilities  will  be  co-located with facilities  for  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  and students.  MCDS will continue to work with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant   agencies  to  identify  policies  and   programmes\r\n\r\ncurrently  targeted at the two-tier family,  which  could  be\r\n\r\nextended to the three-tier family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has raised several issues relating to\r\n\r\nfamily and social services.  MCDS has already some programmes\r\n\r\nin  place.  The Minister for Community Development and Sports\r\n\r\ncan  elaborate  on these programmes during the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply Debate on MCDS' budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has proposed that the Government spend\r\n\r\n$2  billion  of its surplus to improve our education  system.\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam's proposal is commendable.  He should be pleased to\r\n\r\nnote  that the Government is budgeting to spend $6.3  billion\r\n\r\nnext  year on education.  This is an increase over the FY2000\r\n\r\nbudget.   Our  education budget is second  only  to  that  of\r\n\r\ndefence.  We cannot be allocating funds to education  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of whether there is a surplus, or how large the surplus\r\n\r\nis in a particular year, as Mr Chiam wants to recommend.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  always  invested heavily  in  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining.   It is an investment that has paid off handsomely,\r\n\r\nand puts Singapore in a good position for the knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked for subsidies for pre-school\r\n\r\neducation.  Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  subsidised  pre-school education  by  providing  capital\r\n\r\ngrants  to  eligible kindergartens.  The childcare  subsidies\r\n\r\ngiven  by  Government also help offset the  cost  of  sending\r\n\r\nchildren  to  childcare centres with kindergarten programmes.\r\n\r\nIn  FY2001, the Ministry of Education will continue its pilot\r\n\r\nprogramme  on  pre-school education to develop new  materials\r\n\r\nand  train  teachers,  and study how effective  they  are  in\r\n\r\nactual  classroom application.  We have to assess the results\r\n\r\nof  the  study before thinking of further subsidies for  pre-school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim and Mr Leong Horn Kee raised the issue of\r\n\r\nfunding  for  CDCs and RCs. In FY2000, CDCs were allocated  a\r\n\r\nrecurrent budget of $11.7 million from Government to pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir  manpower and other operating costs.  From FY2001,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will raise CDCs' recurrent budget by $3.3  million\r\n\r\nper  year, an increase of 28% over the current funding level.\r\n\r\nThe  increased  budget should allow the CDCs to  employ  more\r\n\r\nstaff  and enable them to take on a larger role in the social\r\n\r\nservice  delivery functions. In line with the  delegation  of\r\n\r\nthe  social  assistance schemes to the CDCs with effect  from\r\n\r\n1st April 2001, the funding for social transfers amounting to\r\n\r\n$98.2 million is also transferred from MCDS to the CDCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the recurrent budget for CDCs, Government also\r\n\r\nprovides  an  annual grant of $1 per resident as  well  as  a\r\n\r\nmatching grant of $3 for every $1 of cash donation raised and\r\n\r\n$4  for every $1 of donation through GIRO.  This is based  on\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of  co-funding,  which  encourages  community\r\n\r\ninvolvement  and  induces discipline  in  the  management  of\r\n\r\nresources.   Easy  availability of funds  without  co-funding\r\n\r\ntends  to  lead  to  loose spending and a \"buffet  syndrome\".\r\n\r\nIndividuals  and corporations qualify for tax  deductions  on\r\n\r\ndonations made to all CDCs and also to funds set up by  other\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations,  such  as  CCCs  and  CCMCs,   for\r\n\r\nspecific  programmes like building, scholarships and  welfare\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, Government is giving about $140 million to the\r\n\r\nCDCs per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  also provides grassroots grant to CCCs,  RCs  and\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Committees at $2.6  million  per  annum.   The\r\n\r\ngrants  help  the CCCs, RCs and NCs organise  more  community\r\n\r\ndevelopment and neighbourhood enhancement projects to promote\r\n\r\nneighbourliness and social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is about\r\n\r\nrepositioning Singapore to ensure our continued survival  and\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  a  constantly evolving global environment.   How\r\n\r\nmuch  and  how fast to change really depends on how fast  the\r\n\r\nworld moves.  Several Members have asked if the corporate tax\r\n\r\nrate  cut  is  the  beginning of a trend towards  even  lower\r\n\r\ncorporate tax rates.  We have not set a new target for income\r\n\r\ntax  rates in the medium term because tax rates globally  are\r\n\r\nin a state of flux.  Our commitment is to keep our rates at a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  level.  We are a price-taker and  not  a  price-fixer.   We thus have to be alert and agile enough to  adjust\r\n\r\nto the price movements in good time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we make these adjustments, we want to be able to\r\n\r\nprovide some certainty to businesses and individuals.  Unlike\r\n\r\nother  countries where Budget is a time when people begin  to\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  taxes  will  be  raised  in  order  to  meet\r\n\r\nexpenditure needs, we believe in assuring predictability,  so\r\n\r\nthat  businesses  and  individuals can  plan  their  finances\r\n\r\nbetter.   When  we cut tax rates, we do not expect  to  raise\r\n\r\nthem again, unless it is part of a total tax structure revamp\r\n\r\nor  unless  some  fundamental  changes  have  occurred  which\r\n\r\nrequire  a  basic  change in strategy.   The  cuts  therefore\r\n\r\nindicate our assessment of future global trends in tax rates.\r\n\r\nWhere  we  are  not ready to make tax cuts, we offer  rebates\r\n\r\nwhen we can afford them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax rebates and budget \"share-outs\" will be available so\r\n\r\nlong  as  the  economy performs well and we set aside  enough\r\n\r\nreserves for contingencies.  They are our way of sharing  the\r\n\r\nnation's    prosperity   with   everyone   and    recognising\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' efforts in working together successfully.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have suggested that the Government\r\n\r\nshould   have  a  formula  for  the  distribution  of  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  This is unrealistic. Government will continue  to\r\n\r\nshare  the surpluses with the people whenever it is able  to.\r\n\r\nHow  much, when and how to share depends on factors  such  as\r\n\r\nhow  the economy has performed and, more importantly, how the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future looks like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, our policies aim at, first, to keep tax\r\n\r\nrates  competitive; second, maintain Government  expenditures\r\n\r\nthat are necessary to provide good public services today  and\r\n\r\nto  invest in infrastructure for tomorrow; and third,  ensure\r\n\r\nthat we preserve and grow the value of our reserves.  What is\r\n\r\nleft after meeting these core goals, we can share out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also suggested that having budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses  mean  that  we are probably  collecting  too  much\r\n\r\nrevenue.   Well,  if  we can be certain  that  we  will  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  sources  of funds in future to  service  all  the\r\n\r\ndemands  like  education, healthcare and  looking  after  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  even  as  our  population  ages  and  the   economy\r\n\r\ncontinually restructures with globalisation, then  of  course\r\n\r\nwe  can  consider collecting less, and further lower our  tax\r\n\r\nrates.   But who can be so certain about the future?  To  act\r\n\r\nlike the future is a simple projection from the present is to\r\n\r\ninvite  disaster.   The alternative of not planning  for  any\r\n\r\nsurplus  is to have a system where taxes go up and down  each\r\n\r\nyear depending on the state of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy.  The Government rejects this alternative, as it will\r\n\r\nintroduce enormous stress and uncertainty in the lives of our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget I have presented for fiscal\r\n\r\nyear  2001 contains measures to help everyone adjust  to  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of the new millennium.  This debate has served  to\r\n\r\nensure  that our policies are robust in both the  short  term\r\n\r\nand  the  longer term.  It is of critical importance that  we\r\n\r\nmove  together  as a united people.  To be  successful  as  a\r\n\r\nnation,  we  must build a cohesive society that leverages  on\r\n\r\nour   collective  strengths  in  forging  a  future  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   This Budget gives a boost to  businesses  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, shares with all Singaporeans the fruits of our\r\n\r\ngood  economic performance, and offers help and hope for  the\r\n\r\nlower income earners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank all Members for their contributions to\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this process.
