This is because we are  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  the governments concerned were not involved  in\r\n\r\nthese unfriendly activities.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer in particular to the cases of Mr Leong Mun\r\n\r\nKwai and Mr Tan Wah Piow, both of whom have been used\r\n\r\nfor  black  operations  not  by  governments  but  by\r\n\r\nhostile groups and individuals in friendly countries.\r\n\r\nIf  hon.  Members  would read Mr Leong's  disclosures\r\n\r\nvery carefully, it is clear that he had been directed\r\n\r\nby officials and politicians who appear to have acted\r\n\r\nwithout the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nknowledge  or  approval  of  responsible  people   in\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Mr Tan Wah Piow is slightly different.\r\n\r\nUnlike  Mr Leong, he was more successful in  doing  a\r\n\r\nbunk  and  finding  sanctuary in a friendly  country.\r\n\r\nHence  we  were  not  able  to  interrogate  him  and\r\n\r\nconfront him with such evidence as we have.  But,  in\r\n\r\nmy  view, he is of the same breed as Mr Leong. Though\r\n\r\nMr Tan Wah Piow transgressed British laws by entering\r\n\r\nthe  country with an ineptly forged passport, he  was\r\n\r\nlucky  enough  to  have had some  rather  influential\r\n\r\nfriends  in that country. Instead of being hauled  up\r\n\r\non  criminal  charges, he has been  rewarded  with  a\r\n\r\nplace  in  Bradford University where he is dedicating\r\n\r\nhimself,   I   understand,  to  the  study   of   the\r\n\r\nintricacies of British law.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, we are satisfied that the responsible\r\n\r\nleaders of government in the United Kingdom could not\r\n\r\nhave  been  parties to the rewarding of a  forger,  a\r\n\r\nblack  agent,  an  army  deserter  and  an  architect\r\n\r\nstudent  who  failed  to  make  the  grade   in   our\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to low level mercenaries like Mr Leong\r\n\r\nand   Mr   Tan  Wah  Piow,  there  are  more   deadly\r\n\r\nideological  operators  and  pseudo  revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nThey  work,  with  the active or passive  support  of\r\n\r\nforeign  governments,  to further  one  of  the  many\r\n\r\nvarieties  of  communism.  Singapore  is   and   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be a target for this kind of  subversive\r\n\r\noperations.     Misguided    liberals,    disgruntled\r\n\r\npoliticians    and   alienated   intellectuals    are\r\n\r\nadditional  grist to the subversive mill. The  latter\r\n\r\ngenerally tend to dismiss all references to communist\r\n\r\nsubversion  and  periodic  arrest  and  detention  of\r\n\r\nsubversives   as  bogies  raised  by   a   government\r\n\r\nintolerant of dissent. This is precisely the frame of\r\n\r\nmind  the  dedicated communists encourage and  foster\r\n\r\namong  the  less dedicated who take up revolution  as\r\n\r\npart-time recreation or as a form of psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the readiness with which this kind of\r\n\r\nrevolutionary breaks down and spills the beans  when,\r\n\r\nwith  the  first arrest, he discovers that revolution\r\n\r\nis a deadly business.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  fact that these are misguided weaklings does not\r\n\r\nmake them any less dangerous to Singapore. By helping\r\n\r\nto  confuse  the people about the ultimate objectives\r\n\r\nof  the  dedicated  communists they,  whatever  their\r\n\r\nintentions, objectively further the communist  cause.\r\n\r\nOnce the communists win, these liberals will be among\r\n\r\nthe first casualties. We only get these weaklings  to\r\n\r\nown   up  publicly  to  their  stupidities  but   the\r\n\r\nCommunists, once they are in power as had happened in\r\n\r\ncountries  in  our  region, treat them  as  dangerous\r\n\r\nvermin to be exterminated.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the earlier part of the question,\r\n\r\nin  the  conduct of our international  relations  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the people must never lose  sight  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that an independent Singapore will always be\r\n\r\na target for subversion. More so in a period of great\r\n\r\nand  small  power rivalries in our region - rivalries\r\n\r\nnot  only between communist and non-communist nations\r\n\r\nbut  also  between  communist  nations.  So  in  this\r\n\r\nbattle,  Singapore  will  always  be  a  target   for\r\n\r\ninfluence by these countries and therefore an  object\r\n\r\nfor  subversion. Singapore may be small  but  in  the\r\n\r\npower  game  control over Singapore is. for  a  rival\r\n\r\npower  or nation, the key to the control of Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how the British saw Singapore in the hey-day\r\n\r\nof  British imperialism and that is how the  Japanese\r\n\r\nsaw  it during their brief hour of glory in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia.  Singapore in Singaporean hands may  not  be  a\r\n\r\nthreat.  But Singapore in the hands of a great  power\r\n\r\nor  some  other  power is a key to  the  control  and\r\n\r\ndominance of Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the day Singaporeans or their government are\r\n\r\npersuaded that subversion, whether from the right  or\r\n\r\nfrom  the  left  is  a bogey, is  a  figment  of  the\r\n\r\nimagination of a desperate government, that day  will\r\n\r\nmark  the  beginning  of the end  of  an  independent\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Once the people develop cynicism  towards\r\n\r\nthe periodic arrest and detention of communists, that\r\n\r\nis  the  day  the communists will have  succeeded  in\r\n\r\ntheir purpose of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngetting  our people to believe that there is no  such\r\n\r\nthing as subversion.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case there is no need for the PAP Government\r\n\r\nwith  its decisive electoral strength to play up  the\r\n\r\ncommunist bogey to win elections or maintain  popular\r\n\r\nsupport.

We\r\n\r\nknew  and  suspected that something of  the  kind  of\r\n\r\neither  black operations or subversion was going  on.\r\n\r\nHad  we  done  so before the elections,  such  action\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  seen as the  desperate  act  of  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  unsure of electoral support in  the  last\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only must our people realise that they must live\r\n\r\nwith  the reality of subversion for a long, long time\r\n\r\nbut   they  must  also  know  how  subversion  works.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Mr Speaker, not many  people  believe\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many people in Singapore who are\r\n\r\neasy  prey  for subversives. After all, in  the  last\r\n\r\nelections  thousands of people were taken  in  by  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Mun Kwai and his friends into voting for their\r\n\r\ncandidates  or  the candidates they supported.  After\r\n\r\nall,  Mr  Leong,  as  did Mr Raman,  did  succeed  in\r\n\r\nimpressing  a very intelligent man like Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nand  his friends in the Workers Party that they  were\r\n\r\ntrue and loyal Singaporeans working for Singapore and\r\n\r\nmany  people  did  vote for Mr Jeyaretnam.  True,  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  claims that he is no fool, but  the  fact\r\n\r\nremains  that  Mr  Leong and Mr  Raman  did  fool  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam. They must have, for it could  not  be,  I\r\n\r\nhope, that Mr Jeyaretnam knew what both of them  were\r\n\r\nup to. In fact, Mr Raman has fooled him so completely\r\n\r\nthat even after Mr Raman\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nadmitted  publicly  that  he  was  a  communist,   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam stated publicly that Mr Raman  was  not  a\r\n\r\ncommunist.  So when one can fool a man to  the  point\r\n\r\nwhere  he  makes a fool of himself, that  is  fooling\r\n\r\nwith  complete success. Maybe Mr Jeyaretnam knows  Mr\r\n\r\nRaman's  mind better than Mr Raman does. If Mr  Leong\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Raman can so completely fool Mr  Jeyaretnam,\r\n\r\nthen  I  do  not  believe that even  tomorrow,  after\r\n\r\nlistening  to  this,  he  will  withdraw  his  public\r\n\r\nstatement that Mr Raman is not a communist.  He  will\r\n\r\nstill  persist in believing that Mr Raman  is  not  a\r\n\r\ncommunist. So if they can fool Mr Jeyaretnam to  make\r\n\r\nfoolish utterances, then that is all the more  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we  should redouble our efforts to  educate  our\r\n\r\npeople  about  the  reality  of  subversion  and  its\r\n\r\ndevious ways. And this is one of the reasons  why  so\r\n\r\nmuch  of  time  and  space is being  devoted  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers   to   publicising  the  statements,   the\r\n\r\nadmissions, by Mr Raman.

The  first category comprises  dedicated\r\n\r\ncommunists  who believe in their cause and  who  will\r\n\r\ndie for their cause. The other category, to summarise\r\n\r\nmy   thesis,  comprises  what  I  would  call  ``goat\r\n\r\ncommunists\".  These  are the  liberals  who  play  at\r\n\r\nrevolution, and the communists often use them, as  in\r\n\r\nWorld  War  II when the Army wanted to clear  a  mine\r\n\r\nfield `they first sent\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngoats to find out where the mines were and to explode\r\n\r\nthem. They are expendables.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the role of people like Mr Raman and others.\r\n\r\nHe  is  not  the  only one to come out  and  confess.\r\n\r\nEarlier  on  we  had  a  ballerina  and  others   who\r\n\r\nconfessed.   These  are  affluent  communists,   goat\r\n\r\ncommunists, who play at revolution. They think  there\r\n\r\nis  a  lot of excitement, hoping to find a place  for\r\n\r\nthemselves  - you know, thwarted ambitions,  personal\r\n\r\ngrudges,  vanity.  So  they  play  around.  And  they\r\n\r\nbelieved that because they had very powerful  friends\r\n\r\nin  the  United Kingdom, the Western world,  who  are\r\n\r\nliberals,  newspaper men, to play up their cause,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  scared to proceed against  them.  But  the\r\n\r\nmoment we do, when they are detained and brought  for\r\n\r\ninterrogation they see the evidence that we have  and\r\n\r\nthe  prospect that if they do not tell the truth they\r\n\r\ncan  be detained for five years. If the PAP is  going\r\n\r\nto  last  for the next 15 years, then they  must  ask\r\n\r\nthemselves,  is this what revolution  is  all  about?\r\n\r\nBecause  if  the communists come, as has happened  in\r\n\r\none  or two countries in this part of the world,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  people they eliminate are the goat  communists\r\n\r\nwho,  they say, are weak enough to simulate communism\r\n\r\nand  therefore are dangerous, because when  Communism\r\n\r\nis  in  power they will simulate liberalism.

Likewise, in terms of the\r\n\r\nnumber of TV programmes telecast in an average  week,\r\n\r\n84  are imported programmes as compared to 67 locally\r\n\r\nproduced  programmes.  The  imported  programmes  are\r\n\r\nstringently  vetted  before  they  are  acquired  and\r\n\r\ntelecast.  Last  year  a  total  of  70  series  were\r\n\r\nrejected outright after auditioning.

H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  support the Motion standing  in  the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found myself much in agreement with what the hon.\r\n\r\nMinister said in his Budget Statement. Our economy in\r\n\r\n1976  was  in much better shape than it  was  in  the\r\n\r\nearlier year. In part, of course, this was due to the\r\n\r\neconomic recovery and dampening of inflation  in  the\r\n\r\nleading  industrial countries. But we  can  take  due\r\n\r\ncredit for the large\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of  sensible domestic measures  and  policies\r\n\r\nwhich  enabled our economy to recover rapidly. I  can\r\n\r\nfind  little fault with the basic policies in respect\r\n\r\nof  manpower, science and technology, infrastructure,\r\n\r\ntaxation and promotion.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me. however, to offer a few comments which I\r\n\r\nhope will contribute to improvement.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's Economic Survey drew attention to the\r\n\r\nrecovery of the manufacturing sector by 10% and noted\r\n\r\nthe  rise by 3% in productivity in that sector.  Lest\r\n\r\nwe rush to congratulate ourselves and our workers for\r\n\r\nthe improvement in productivity, we should not forget\r\n\r\nthat  such  improvements usually occur as an  economy\r\n\r\npulls  out of recession. We shall still need to  bend\r\n\r\nevery  effort  to  make improvements in  productivity\r\n\r\ncontinually.  Furthermore, the Economic  Survey  also\r\n\r\nnoted   that   much  of  the  overall   increase   in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing output was accounted for by an  upsurge\r\n\r\nin  petroleum refining activities. Hon.  Members  may\r\n\r\nrecall   that  the  petroleum  refining  sector   had\r\n\r\nsuffered much in 1975 as a result of the end  of  the\r\n\r\nVietnam War.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col. 571 of the Economic Survey reported that\r\n\r\nprivate  capital expenditure in 1976 grew  by  6%  to\r\n\r\n$2,359 million. The increase, however, was due to the\r\n\r\nacquisitiveness  of  Neptune  Orient   Lines,   whose\r\n\r\nManaging Director has assumed the role of Member  for\r\n\r\nMarine Parade. This increase masked a decline  of  8%\r\n\r\nin  capital expenditure on buildings and works and  a\r\n\r\n10%  decline  for  machinery and  equipment.  I  draw\r\n\r\nattention  to  this,  Sir,  because  the  volume   of\r\n\r\ninvestment  particularly in plant and equipment  will\r\n\r\naffect the productive capacity of our economy in  the\r\n\r\nfuture. This failure of investment to respond is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, not unique to us. As I pointed out during the\r\n\r\ndebate  last  year  and earlier this  year.  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery   in   the  advanced  countries   is   being\r\n\r\nthreatened  by  the failure of new investments  being\r\n\r\nundertaken  in sufficient volume. I hope,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat we can make\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmuch  more  headway  with the  schemes  to  stimulate\r\n\r\nprivate  industrial development such as  the  Capital\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme  and the Small Industries  Finance\r\n\r\nScheme.  Both  of  these add up to  a  paltry  $17.73\r\n\r\nmillion so far!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister may also want to pay some\r\n\r\nattention   to   the   decline  of   private   sector\r\n\r\nconstruction of 12% in 1976. I hope he is  monitoring\r\n\r\nthe situation so that we can avoid cycles of scarcity\r\n\r\nand  excess, particularly of office buildings,  which\r\n\r\nwill affect business rentals, and hence, the costs of\r\n\r\ndoing business in Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honourable Member for Punggol may be concerned\r\n\r\nto know from col. 568 of the Economic Survey that the\r\n\r\nfishing industry declined by 5% in 1976.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> That is not too bad.

Minister gave a number of tax\r\n\r\nconcessions.  In  particular, I welcome  the  further\r\n\r\nrelief  in  respect of estate duty. However,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  raising  the exemption limit  from  $50,000  to\r\n\r\n$100,000  will not lead to a corresponding escalation\r\n\r\nof assessed valuation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister mentioned a budget deficit of\r\n\r\n$1,505   million,  a  32%  rise  compared  to   1976.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Economic Survey, in past years,  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund provided 70% of the loans. The\r\n\r\namount  of CPF contributions in 1977 should be  close\r\n\r\nto  $1,000  million. At the same time  funds  at  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of the Post Office Savings Bank rose by $408\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1976 to a total of $957 million.  And  we\r\n\r\nhave  $8.2  billion  in foreign reserves  as  against\r\n\r\nforeign debt of only $660 million. Clearly, there  is\r\n\r\nno  lack of availability of funds. However,  I  am  a\r\n\r\nlittle concerned about the distribution of public and\r\n\r\nprivate investment expenditure in Singapore. In 1973,\r\n\r\nthe private share of total investment was 82.7% while\r\n\r\nin  1976 the corresponding share was only 75%. I hope\r\n\r\nthat either the Ministry of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nFinance  or  the Monetary Authority of  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nstudying  the  flow of funds and the  utilisation  of\r\n\r\nfunds  in Singapore. While I welcome the Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank's efforts at encouraging saving, part of\r\n\r\nits funds represent a redirection from private banks.\r\n\r\nTo  the  extent that this is so, the private sector's\r\n\r\naccess  to  that savings for investment  purposes  is\r\n\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also note that there is no reference to\r\n\r\nexchange  rate policy in the Economic Survey  or  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement. While I am sure that the  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore is  in  competent  hands,  I\r\n\r\nshould like to see some reference in future. Exchange\r\n\r\nrate  policy  has a bearing on monetary,  fiscal  and\r\n\r\nwage  policies and vice versa. For example,  in  col.\r\n\r\n635  of  the Economic Survey, it is noted that  money\r\n\r\nsupply,  defined as MI, grew at 18%,  due  mainly  to\r\n\r\nlarger inflow of foreign funds. This, however,  could\r\n\r\nbe  due  to  a  repressed exchange rate  designed  to\r\n\r\npreserve the competitiveness of our exports. If  this\r\n\r\nis  so,  the  increase  in  foreign  reserves  is  no\r\n\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to see quarterly figures\r\n\r\npresented  in  the Economic Survey  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nbetter  analyse the trends in our economy.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nend-of-year figures, particularly in such items  like\r\n\r\nmoney supply can be quite misleading.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at our prospects in 1977, although I am very\r\n\r\nconcerned   about   the   undercurrents    such    as\r\n\r\ninsufficient investment in the industrial  countries,\r\n\r\nthe year itself should be fair for us.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in full support of the basic economic\r\n\r\npolicies laid down by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a\r\n\r\nperiod  when  the world economy has barely  recovered\r\n\r\nfrom the oil hike of a few years ago, and the effects\r\n\r\nof  the latest OPEC increase in oil price yet  to  be\r\n\r\nfelt,  it  is most welcome to have a moderate  budget\r\n\r\nfor  the  coming  fiscal year.  I  would  call  it  a\r\n\r\npainless  budget,  for  it provided  no  shocks.  The\r\n\r\nemphasis, as in the past few years, has\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbeen on investment projects and generally to create a\r\n\r\nmore   conducive   economic   climate   for   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  which  will  in  turn  create  more  job\r\n\r\nopportunities. The increase in taxes on  alcohol  and\r\n\r\ntobacco will not, of course, be welcomed by those who\r\n\r\nhabitually  drink  and smoke, nor  by  those  in  the\r\n\r\ntobacco  and  alcohol industries,  nor  by  those  in\r\n\r\nallied trades because of possible falling sales. But,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, who can say that alcohol and tobacco\r\n\r\nare  basic commodities essential for life?  In  fact,\r\n\r\nhealthier living is to do without them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the budget estimates which I\r\n\r\nwelcome  is  the  raising of the  maximum  amount  of\r\n\r\nestate  duty for exemption purposes from  $50,000  to\r\n\r\n$100,000.  As  we  all  know,  every  year  sees   an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of Singaporeans  becoming  owner-occupiers of houses or flats. In many cases, this has\r\n\r\nonly  been  made  possible through  the  Government's\r\n\r\npublic housing schemes enabling CPF contributions  to\r\n\r\nbe  utilised for the purchase of HDB and HUDC  flats.\r\n\r\nFor  these categories of Singaporeans. owning a  flat\r\n\r\nwould  otherwise  not be possible.  These  lower  and\r\n\r\nmiddle income groups must realise that our Government\r\n\r\nprovide them the opportunities and the incentives  to\r\n\r\nhave  a stake in our society. This is their privilege\r\n\r\nas Singaporeans, and as of right.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thus providing for the lower and middle income\r\n\r\ngroups opportunities at home-ownership, we are surely\r\n\r\nstriving for a more egalitarian society. The  private\r\n\r\nproperty  developers and entrepreneurs can no  longer\r\n\r\nhave  a  monopoly on housing. I would say the general\r\n\r\neffect   of   the  Government  housing  schemes   has\r\n\r\nstabilised  the prices on the property  market  -  no\r\n\r\nlonger  can  there be the quick and vast  returns  on\r\n\r\nproperty  speculation  and  development.  Growth  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  housing now take  place  in  a  more\r\n\r\norderly   and  gradual  fashion;  the  not-so-wealthy\r\n\r\nsections  of  Singapore society  are  thus  not  left\r\n\r\nbehind,  nor  are  they denied the  opportunities  of\r\n\r\nhouse ownership. Thus, the budget estimates before us\r\n\r\nin  raising  the amount from $50,000 to $100,000  for\r\n\r\nexemption from estate duty is a very\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelcome  one.  This will ensure that those  who  have\r\n\r\nutilised their CPF contributions for the purchase  of\r\n\r\nHDB  and  HUDC flats will not be penalised. What  the\r\n\r\nCPF is meant for, that is, security at retirement, is\r\n\r\nnow more usefully deployed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all budget debates at the start\r\n\r\nof   every   fiscal  year,  especially  so   at   the\r\n\r\ncommencement  of a new term of office  -  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nParliament of the Republic - it is not irrelevant  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to take stock of  the  machinery  of\r\n\r\nGovernment - i.e. the civil service and the statutory\r\n\r\nboards. We cannot ignore the role played by the civil\r\n\r\nservants  in  implementing  fiscal  policies  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   or   for   that  matter   the   general\r\n\r\nfunctionings of a government. Because the same  party\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  be in power. this must  not  lull  the\r\n\r\ncivil service into an attitude of complacency.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last session of this House, some comments\r\n\r\nwere  made on the civil servants. The point  which  I\r\n\r\nnow  wish to make is that what the civil servants do,\r\n\r\nand   how  they  go  about  doing  their  work,   has\r\n\r\nconstantly to be examined.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil servants, in implementing Government\r\n\r\ndecisions and policies, and especially the top  civil\r\n\r\nservants  who  also  advise Government  Ministers  on\r\n\r\ntheir portfolios must, in my opinion, have as broad a\r\n\r\nperspective  as  possible of the  matters  they  deal\r\n\r\nwith.  I  have observed that the upper ranks  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  tend to be attached to  a  particular\r\n\r\nMinistry  or  Department for many years. Without  the\r\n\r\nconstant  and  regular  rotation  of  the  top  civil\r\n\r\nservants, I get the impression that some of them  are\r\n\r\nso  entrenched  that they have the  full  support  of\r\n\r\ntheir  Ministers,  and therefore,  they  assume  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  they  do  will always be  backed  by  their\r\n\r\nMinisters. This is surely not very desirable.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, pros and cons for the\r\n\r\nfrequency  of  rotation of civil servants  among  the\r\n\r\nvarious Ministries and Departments. On the one  hand,\r\n\r\nthere are valid arguments for\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe need for continuity in the staffing of Ministries\r\n\r\nand  Departments. This is to facilitate not only  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  decision-making by  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nMinisters, but also internal administration,  and  in\r\n\r\nserving  the  public. I recognise that in Departments\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Inland Revenue, Police, Customs  or  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Division  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour,  either  because of the nature  of  the  work\r\n\r\ninvolved  or  the  continuity of  services  rendered,\r\n\r\nthere  need  not  be the same degree of  rotation  of\r\n\r\nstaff   for  the  middle-ranking  and  junior   civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is an equally valid\r\n\r\nargument  that  the  civil  servants  in  the  higher\r\n\r\nreaches of Government service should have as wide  an\r\n\r\nexperience  as  possible  of  administration  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries or Departments, so that they  can\r\n\r\nhave  a better understanding of the people whom  they\r\n\r\nare  supposed  to serve. Members of  this  House  may\r\n\r\nrecall  that  several years back  when  there  was  a\r\n\r\ndifference of opinion over priorities in expenditure,\r\n\r\nthis was resolved by the Minister for Finance and the\r\n\r\nMinister of Defence interchanging portfolios.  It  is\r\n\r\nnatural  for each Ministry to view the priorities  of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic on the basis of the needs and functions\r\n\r\nof  the respective Ministry. My point in quoting  the\r\n\r\nexample  is  that the outcome of the  interchange  of\r\n\r\nportfolios has turned out to be most satisfactory.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very probable that in the functioning of the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries  misunderstandings  might   arise\r\n\r\namong senior civil servants who are attached for  too\r\n\r\nlong  to  the same Ministries, and who might  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to appreciate the dimension of any problem from\r\n\r\nan  overall point of view. There is thus an advantage\r\n\r\nin regularly rotating senior civil servants among the\r\n\r\nvarious Ministries and Departments.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a constant re-appraisal of the functions of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service, undesirable characteristics  may\r\n\r\narise.  Some top civil servants develop the mentality\r\n\r\nof  pleasing  only their Ministers, and,  of  course,\r\n\r\neveryone tries to please the Prime Minister. If  they\r\n\r\nreport  everything is ship-shape to their  Ministers.\r\n\r\nthen nothing is wrong with the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMinistries  they  are in. Should  junior  staff  have\r\n\r\ngrievances. or if their workload cannot be discharged\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily,  this  does  not  matter,  since  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned  does  not  know.  This  has  the\r\n\r\nadverse  effect of junior civil servants  doing  only\r\n\r\nthe  minimum,  and doing things only to please  their\r\n\r\nsuperiors. They no longer discharge their  duties  as\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, rather as chores in order  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs. Staff morale may be low; efficiency  may\r\n\r\nbe  low.  When this bureaucratic attitude builds  up,\r\n\r\nthe  public  is adversely affected. Matters  are  not\r\n\r\nattended  to  promptly. For example, the  problem  of\r\n\r\ngetting  an immediate and satisfactory response  from\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants.  I am sure  some  of  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  in this House have experienced, as  I  have.\r\n\r\nthe frustrations in getting civil servants to act  on\r\n\r\nthe   complaints  we  have  made  on  behalf  of  our\r\n\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When complaints are sent directly to the press, they\r\n\r\nseem  to  be  attended to much quicker by  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  than  those complaints  they  receive  from\r\n\r\nBackbenchers.  This  would  seem  to  me  that  civil\r\n\r\nservants  are  afraid  of the unfavourable  publicity\r\n\r\nwhich  might  draw the attention of their  superiors,\r\n\r\nand.  indeed  the  Ministers, to their  shortcomings.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they have every reason and inducement  to\r\n\r\nact  promptly  on letters of complaint in  the  local\r\n\r\npress. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask: is this right,  or\r\n\r\nis this desirable? While I agree that the local press\r\n\r\nshould serve as a forum for views and complaints, and\r\n\r\nthat   the   Ministries  and  Government  Departments\r\n\r\nconcerned are seen to do their jobs, is this all  for\r\n\r\nshow?  lam  not  suggesting that all  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  Departments are chronically  inefficient,\r\n\r\nbut  there  appears  to be this developing  trend.  I\r\n\r\ncontend,  therefore,  in  order  to  keep  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice on its toes, particularly the rank and  file,\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  regular rotation of  senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  New  brooms, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  can  sweep\r\n\r\ncleaner.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second characteristic which can develop, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  if  the  top echelons  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  are not regularly rotated is the possibility\r\n\r\nof  empire  building. By this I mean  a  tendency  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a power base on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the  top  civil servants,  achieved  I\r\n\r\nsuppose  by  promoting only people who see eye-to-eye\r\n\r\nwith their superiors. I am not saying that this is  a\r\n\r\ncommon practice, but the tendency is surely there. If\r\n\r\nthere  is more frequent and more regular rotation  of\r\n\r\ntop  civil  servants, they will not be able  to  grow\r\n\r\npowerful roots.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third feature of civil servants which I find\r\n\r\nobjectionable   is   the  secrecy   which   sometimes\r\n\r\nsurrounds  their work, and a habit of  name-dropping.\r\n\r\nAs an excuse for not disclosing the true state of the\r\n\r\nmatter,  which  might be embarrassing  to  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants, as possibly the matter concerned  is  in  a\r\n\r\nsorry  state for lack of attention, they  dispose  of\r\n\r\nany queries by saying the matter is being studied  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  who  does not want publicity.  Matters\r\n\r\nwhich  should  be attended to, therefore,  get  swept\r\n\r\nunder a carpet of secrecy. No one need know that  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service is getting more bureaucratic and  less\r\n\r\nefficient. The top civil servants, after remaining in\r\n\r\ntheir positions for long periods of time. would often\r\n\r\nmake  reference to a certain Minister,  or  even  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  in order to deter further  queries.\r\n\r\nLikewise, some are in the habit of quoting the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, e.g. name-drop that so-and-so is  from  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's Office, and he gets attended to very\r\n\r\npromptly. Others, even the Members of Parliament  are\r\n\r\nmet  with  a  sluggish response, if at all  there  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be a response.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope. therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in a budget\r\n\r\ndebate the effect of our fiscal measures must be seen\r\n\r\nagainst the interests of the people, and here I  have\r\n\r\nstressed  how the civil service fits in.  Any  budget\r\n\r\nbefore the House must be aimed at establishing a more\r\n\r\njust and a more humane society. However, the attitude\r\n\r\nmust  never  arise that there is a \"them  and  us\"  - those who are governed. and those who govern. Because\r\n\r\nwe in Parliament are collectively the servants of the\r\n\r\npeople - those in the civil service are not there  to\r\n\r\nserve us, but the people. In this connection, I  have\r\n\r\nasked  for  a  re-appraisal of the  civil  service  - perhaps a kind of \"shake-up\" is in order.\r\n\r\n                                                                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to\r\n\r\nthe  average taxpayer in the wage earning, class, the\r\n\r\nbudget is a disappointment. As the economic situation\r\n\r\nrecovered,  albeit  slowly in 1976,  he  had  perhaps\r\n\r\nwistfully hoped that there would be some form of  tax\r\n\r\nrelief in 1977. In the event he is disappointed. From\r\n\r\nhis  point  of  view,  the budget  is  not  really  a\r\n\r\npainless  one. He is not sure whether  he  should  be\r\n\r\nthankful  or  annoyed  with  the  Hon.  Minister  for\r\n\r\nshowing  such  persistent concern for his  health  by\r\n\r\nraising the taxes on tobacco and liquors second  year\r\n\r\nrunning; even the concession in estate duty on owner-occupied  property appears quite meaningless  to  him\r\n\r\nfor  the  time  being, as he has no  wish  of  taking\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  it  as yet. It would  have  been  more\r\n\r\nmeaningful  if  he were allowed the use  of  his  CPF\r\n\r\nbalance  which  has  by  now  totalled  thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars attracting only a meagre rate of interest, to\r\n\r\nrepay  part  of  the mortgage which  he  has  on  his\r\n\r\nprivate accommodation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our average taxpayer ponders on the implications\r\n\r\nof the Hon.

It seems to him that under\r\n\r\nthe existing tax structure if a person is unfortunate\r\n\r\nenough  to  be a wage-earner who, for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe  Inland Revenue Department, may be defined  as  a\r\n\r\nperson  having  no  chance of being  able  to  either\r\n\r\nlegally  avoid or illegally evade the full  incidence\r\n\r\nof  tax, the better he is in his job the more heavily\r\n\r\nhe is taxed as he rises in his position.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the plights of our tax-paying wage-earners have\r\n\r\nbeen raised time and again in this House but the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance has time and again  refused  to\r\n\r\nconsider  any  change  in  a  system  which  we  have\r\n\r\ninherited  from  our colonial past and,  to  say  the\r\n\r\nleast, is clearly unsuitable for a fast changing  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping society as our own. We aim to motivate our\r\n\r\nmembers to give of their best and to give rewards and\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  those who excel in high  performance\r\n\r\nbut our tax\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsystem does not seem to reflect this philosophy!

There will be only\r\n\r\nfour  cylinders  instead of eight cylinders  working,\r\n\r\nSir. Or maybe two cylinders! Whichever the course  of\r\n\r\naction or attitude he finally adopts, it does  us  no\r\n\r\ngood  as,  at this stage of our economic development,\r\n\r\nwe  need  all the experienced people in the  industry\r\n\r\nand in Government service continuing to give of their\r\n\r\nbest.  It  is  all  very well to say  we  believe  in\r\n\r\n\"taxing the rich to subsidise the poor\", or do we?  I\r\n\r\nam not sure. Are we sure that those bearing the brunt\r\n\r\nof  tax  incidence are really \"the  rich\"  and  those\r\n\r\nbenefitting  from  whatever  little  State  subsidies\r\n\r\nleft, are really \"the poor\"? I am not sure, Sir,  but\r\n\r\nI would humbly suggest to the Minister for Finance to\r\n\r\ngive some thought to my queries. With all the brains\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat  he  has  at his command in his Ministry,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure, Sir, he would be able to come up with an answer\r\n\r\nand  hopefully we, the wage earners, can look forward\r\n\r\nto  a  more equitable system of taxation at the  next\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to turn to the Hon. Minister's\r\n\r\ncomments on Trade Development in 1977. First of  all,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to know what he proposes to  do  about\r\n\r\nnarrowing the very substantial trade deficit of close\r\n\r\nto  $2 billion with Japan. This is not the first time\r\n\r\nqueries  are  raised in this House on this  perennial\r\n\r\nimbalance  of  trade and it would  seem  to  me  that\r\n\r\nlittle has been done to get the Japanese to buy  more\r\n\r\nfrom  us.  If  we  have not already lodged  a  strong\r\n\r\nrepresentation with the Japanese government  in  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I  would  urge the Government  to  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider doing so.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Trade Development generally, I agree with the\r\n\r\nHon.   Minister  that  our  tactics  should   be   to\r\n\r\nconsolidate markets that we already have and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  explore new ones. The idea of setting  up\r\n\r\npermanent  exhibition centres in  selected  countries\r\n\r\nabroad is a good one, but before doing so I feel that\r\n\r\nwe  should  perhaps  look  at  our  export  promotion\r\n\r\nefforts ir. a rather more systematic manner and  with\r\n\r\nthe same degree of special care and attention that we\r\n\r\nhave  devoted  to  the  task of investment  promotion\r\n\r\nabroad.  Up  to  this  point  of  time,  our   export\r\n\r\npromotion  efforts seem to be conducted  haphazardly,\r\n\r\nrather disorganised if I may say so, and without much\r\n\r\nco-ordination.  We  hear  of  trade   missions   from\r\n\r\ndifferent organisations going off every now and then,\r\n\r\nbut  what  follow-up actions are taken and with  what\r\n\r\nresults  -do  like to know. I think we could  achieve\r\n\r\nmore   if   there   is   proper   overall   planning,\r\n\r\norganisation  and  co-ordination  among  the  various\r\n\r\ntrade  and manufacturers' associations. Surely,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of an export promotion agency  is  the\r\n\r\nanswer.  With the Government providing the  necessary\r\n\r\norganisation and the lead. I have no doubt  that  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  will  be only too happy  to  give  their\r\n\r\nwholehearted  support and cooperation.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nshort-cut in trade development. In order to  do  well\r\n\r\nin our export drive, we need to know more about\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\noverseas  markets; to know more. we  need  to  travel\r\n\r\nmore and ultimately we will sell more.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an insurance man, I find it difficult not to\r\n\r\nsay  a few words on the concessionary tax rate of 10%\r\n\r\nannounced by the Minister on reinsurance business. To\r\n\r\nthe   lay  public,  this  gesture  on  the  part   of\r\n\r\nGovernment may not mean very much but, speaking as  a\r\n\r\nprofessional. I cannot help feeling excited over  the\r\n\r\nlikely prospect of Singapore developing rapidly  into\r\n\r\na  significant international reinsurance centre  over\r\n\r\nthe next few years. The concessionary tax rate of 10%\r\n\r\nadded  to  our locational advantage and good business\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,   such   as   a   highly    efficient\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  system among  other  things,  will\r\n\r\ngreatly  assist in the development of  this  type  of\r\n\r\ninternational  business. It is a  little  known  fact\r\n\r\nthat  one  of the larger items of Britain's invisible\r\n\r\nearnings  is  from  insurance  and  reinsurance.  For\r\n\r\nexample, in the year 1974 the City of London  derived\r\n\r\n41%  of  its  invisible earnings from  insurance  and\r\n\r\nreinsurance,  whereas  the  rather  more  prestigious\r\n\r\nbusiness of banking contributed only 20% of  a  total\r\n\r\nsum of 905 million pound.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swiss and the Germans have also over the years\r\n\r\ndeveloped  extensive  interests  in  the  reinsurance\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Given  the  necessary  encouragement  from\r\n\r\nGovernment and the determination on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to succeed, there can be little  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the  tax incentive will go down as an important\r\n\r\nmilestone in the history of the insurance industry in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The gesture on the part of the Government,\r\n\r\nI   hope.  is  also  an  indication  of  the  greater\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the potentials of insurance  business\r\n\r\nby the Government which hitherto has paid very little\r\n\r\nattention  to the development of insurance  industry.\r\n\r\nThis is evidenced by the fact that for some time now,\r\n\r\nthe  Insurance Commissioner's office has been without\r\n\r\na  full-time  Commissioner; the present  Commissioner\r\n\r\nbeing concurrently a Deputy Secretary attached to the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance, and insurance is but one of his\r\n\r\nmany    responsibiIities.   Since   the    Minister's\r\n\r\nannouncement of the tax concession I have read in the\r\n\r\npress that with effect from 1st\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril  the Insurance Commissioner's office will  come\r\n\r\nunder  the  control  of  the  Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and I do sincerely hope that this will  be\r\n\r\na change for the better.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, the efficacy of the tax\r\n\r\nincentive will be determined by two things:-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Willingness on the part of the industry to\r\n\r\ninvest   on   personnel  development  and   training.\r\n\r\nReinsurance   business  by   its   very   nature   is\r\n\r\ninternational in scope. We need, therefore, to  train\r\n\r\nup  a new breed of insurance men who will be not only\r\n\r\ntechnically   competent   but   also    possess    an\r\n\r\ninternational outlook.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Greater appreciation of the technical and\r\n\r\npractical  aspects of the insurance business  by  the\r\n\r\nregulatory   authorities.   It   is   accepted   that\r\n\r\nlegislative  control  on such  type  of  business  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   and   desirable.  Over-regulation   will,\r\n\r\nhowever, on the other hand stifle the growth  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaningful dialogue has hitherto existed between the\r\n\r\nindustry and the Insurance Commissioner's office, and\r\n\r\nI  feel  sure that notwithstanding the organisational\r\n\r\nchange    there   will   continue   to   be   regular\r\n\r\nopportunities for views to be exchanged  between  the\r\n\r\nInsurance Commissioner and the industry.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding his Statement to the House, the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  forecasts that the weather is getting  fine\r\n\r\nand fair and that our Ship of State is in good shape.\r\n\r\nSir,  as  I see it, given the same competent command.\r\n\r\nour  Ship of State should be able to face up  to  any\r\n\r\nweather condition, foul or fair.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nMotion standing in the name of the Hon. Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.  The  Minister  has  described  the  1976\r\n\r\neconomic performance as \"not unsatisfactory.\" With  a\r\n\r\n7%  real growth in GDP, a 2% inflation rate (in terms\r\n\r\nof GDP deflator) and a 8.1% increase in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndomestic fixed capital formation, the performance  is\r\n\r\na  fairly  good  one, particularly  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nsluggish  economic recovery of the advanced countries\r\n\r\nwhich  our  economy is heavily dependent on,  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond   half  of  the  year.  Regarding  our  growth\r\n\r\nprospect  for  1977, the Minister is  more  cautious,\r\n\r\ntaking  note that the OECD countries are expected  to\r\n\r\ngrow at a slower rate than in 1976.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of economic uncertainties, the painless\r\n\r\nbudget as proposed by the Minister is a sensible one.\r\n\r\nOnly  minor  tax  increases  on  liquor  and  tobacco\r\n\r\nproducts are proposed; at the same time, the increase\r\n\r\nin the Government recurrent expenditure is kept to  a\r\n\r\nminimum. thus allowing more revenue resources  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  for  development  purposes.   Hopefully.\r\n\r\nbetween  now  and  the  next  Budget  statement,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will not give us any surprises and  shocks.\r\n\r\nThe  recovery  of our economy is still  too  new  and\r\n\r\nfragile to absorb any shock of major tax increases. I\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  Minister, in  his  Addendum  to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address,  has reserved  the  option  of\r\n\r\nchanging taxes as \"one way of helping to encourage or\r\n\r\ndiscourage  one kind of activity over another.\"  This\r\n\r\nis fair enough. as using tax changes as an instrument\r\n\r\nfor  reallocating resources among economic activities\r\n\r\nis  an integral part of fiscal policy. However, it is\r\n\r\nhoped  that  the important suggestions  made  by  the\r\n\r\nFiscal  Policy  Implementation Committee  are  to  be\r\n\r\ndebated  in  this House before they are  implemented.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be in accordance with the spirit  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  statement  that  \"No  major  policy   or\r\n\r\nlegislation  should  be passed  without  the  closest\r\n\r\nscrutiny,  and  passed only after the  most  thorough\r\n\r\ndebate.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget statement, the Minister has also\r\n\r\nstressed   the  importance  of  diversification   and\r\n\r\nflexibility   in  our  development  strategies.   and\r\n\r\nreiterated    the   five-point   Economic    Strategy\r\n\r\nProgramme.  Diversification means finding alternative\r\n\r\nmarkets,  engaging in different economic  activities,\r\n\r\nand  purchasing  from different sources  of  supplies\r\n\r\nsimultaneously. With diversification, our economy  is\r\n\r\nless vulnerable to a sudden slack of a given activity\r\n\r\nor in a given market. In general. we\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave  been  successful in diversifying  our  economic\r\n\r\nactivities. On the other hand. our economy  is  still\r\n\r\nheavily  dependent  on the USA,  Japan  and  the  EEC\r\n\r\ncountries.  Economic realities dictate that  for  our\r\n\r\nfuture economic growth, we have to continue to depend\r\n\r\non  these  advanced  countries for  markets  for  our\r\n\r\nexports,  sources of capital inflow, and supplies  of\r\n\r\nmachinery and equipment and technology.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geo-political considerations, particularly after the\r\n\r\nCommunist  victory in Indo-China.  have  brought  the\r\n\r\nASEAN countries closer together than before. This  is\r\n\r\nevident from the five ASEAN industrial projects,  our\r\n\r\nbilateral  tariff  accords with the  Philippines  and\r\n\r\nThailand,   and   the  recent  Agreement   on   ASEAN\r\n\r\nPreferential Trading Arrangements. These are  welcome\r\n\r\nsteps  towards greater regional economic cooperation.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, also be realistic. Given the present\r\n\r\ndisparities  in  the  level of development.  economic\r\n\r\nstructure,  trade pattern and pace  and  strategy  of\r\n\r\nindustrialization,   intra-ASEAN   trade   would   be\r\n\r\ncomparatively  less important than ASEAN  trade  with\r\n\r\nthe  USA, Japan and the EEC countries. and the  scope\r\n\r\nfor  industrial cooperation among the ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nwould  remain  limited for a long time  to  come.  At\r\n\r\npresent, the better strategy .for the ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nwould be to form a united front in dealing with these\r\n\r\nthree advanced economic blocs in matters relating  to\r\n\r\ntariff  and non-tariff barriers. In this context,  it\r\n\r\nis  of  particular importance for the ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nto  pressurise  Japan which has  been  enjoying  huge\r\n\r\nsurpluses in trade with ASEAN.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, flexible economic policies mean that we should\r\n\r\ndo  away with any rigid form of economic planning. In\r\n\r\nfact,  the Government has not published any five-year\r\n\r\neconomic  plan  since independence. Instead,  ad  hoc\r\n\r\npolicies  have been implemented to soften the  impact\r\n\r\nof economic crisis originating from external sources,\r\n\r\nand  to  seize new economic opportunities which  have\r\n\r\nappeared   on  the  horizon.  Given  the   need   for\r\n\r\nflexibility and the emphasis on efficiency, it is not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that statutory boards have been  used  to\r\n\r\nimplement or even to spearhead various\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social  development  programmes.   The\r\n\r\nattractiveness of this form of organisation  is  that\r\n\r\nit  enjoys  greater  flexibility and  is  given  more\r\n\r\ninitiative  to  carry  out  its  specific   functions\r\n\r\nwithout  the loss of ultimate responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  Cabinet  Minister.  However,  as   board\r\n\r\nmembers  and top management staff have been appointed\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister concerned, the activities of  these\r\n\r\nboards    are   one   step   removed   from    direct\r\n\r\naccountability to the Parliament.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem area pertains to the appointment of\r\n\r\ndirectors. Top civil servants are normally  appointed\r\n\r\nto  board membership and some of them often  take  on\r\n\r\nseveral directorships simultaneously. On the positive\r\n\r\nside,  interlocking directorship helps to keep  these\r\n\r\nboards in line with major Government policies; on the\r\n\r\nnegative,  it can be a source of strain and  pressure\r\n\r\nto  the  civil  service. With their time  and  energy\r\n\r\ndivided  between several jobs, these  civil  servants\r\n\r\ncannot devote their best efforts and talents to  each\r\n\r\njob  and  at the same time thoroughly understand  the\r\n\r\nproblems  at hand. Also, because of their  positions,\r\n\r\nthe  opinions  of  these top civil servants  normally\r\n\r\ncarry  susbtantial weight in the boards. A  few  over\r\n\r\nzealous  and  powerful civil servants  may  therefore\r\n\r\nreduce managerial initiative.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a national plan which maps out the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  various statutory  boards  and\r\n\r\ntheir relationship with the governmental departments,\r\n\r\ncoordination between these organizations seem  to  be\r\n\r\nlacking, thus giving rise to duplication of effort in\r\n\r\nsome cases and unnecessary delay in others.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the role of statutory boards in our national\r\n\r\ndevelopment is likely to become n-ore important.  the\r\n\r\nabovementioned  problems and some  other  problems  I\r\n\r\nhave  not yet mentioned have to be rectified so  that\r\n\r\ntheir   usefulness  and  efficiency  would   not   be\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the five-point\r\n\r\nEconomic  Strategy Programme. The programme has  been\r\n\r\nexpounded  by the Minister for Finance. The programme\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrealistic, as it reflects the nature of the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  as well as her role as an urban centre.  The\r\n\r\nprogramme  would also help us to attain the long-term\r\n\r\nobjective  of  transforming  our  economy   into   an\r\n\r\nindustrial  centre  and  a  base  for  regional   and\r\n\r\ninternational services. However, I would like to make\r\n\r\na  few  comments. First, on the manpower  development\r\n\r\nprogramme. the Hon. Minister has only made  reference\r\n\r\nto  graduates  of  technical institutions,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the output of university graduates has  been\r\n\r\nincluded   in  the  manpower  development  programme.\r\n\r\nRecently, a local newspaper has flashed the  headline\r\n\r\nabout  the  employment prospects for some  university\r\n\r\ngraduates.  Sir,  it  would  be  a  waste  of   human\r\n\r\nresources   if  we  continue  to  produce  unemployed\r\n\r\ngraduates. I wonder whether the Ministries of Finance\r\n\r\nand Education have arrived at some coordinated policy\r\n\r\non  the  intake of university students  into  various\r\n\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although training and education would\r\n\r\nincrease the working capacity of an employee, whether\r\n\r\nhe  will  give  his  best depends  on  his  attitudes\r\n\r\ntowards  work.  The Minister has mentioned  that  \"to\r\n\r\ninstill   correct  work  attitudes  in  our  workers,\r\n\r\nemployers must provide a proper working environment.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think this is grossly inadequate.  The  much\r\n\r\nmore   important  motivational  forces  are  rewards.\r\n\r\nRewards could be classified into two types: intrinsic\r\n\r\nrewards  such as a sense of accomplishment, pride  in\r\n\r\none's  products  and job satisfaction  and  extrinsic\r\n\r\nrewards,  such as wage increases, bonuses. promotions\r\n\r\netc.  Sir,  I  submit  that in a market  economy  and\r\n\r\nmaterialistic   society  like  Singapore,   intrinsic\r\n\r\nrewards have become impotent as a motivational force,\r\n\r\nparticularly in areas where the production process is\r\n\r\ncharacterized by capital-intensity, a fine degree  of\r\n\r\nspecialisation, and mass production. Thus,  the  most\r\n\r\npragmatic   and   effective  approach   to   motivate\r\n\r\nemployees  (not just workers), to give of their  best\r\n\r\nand to raise productivity is to assure them that they\r\n\r\ncan   derive   monetary  gains  from  such   efforts.\r\n\r\nEmployers must draw up appropriate\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nincentive  schemes, not just provide  better  working\r\n\r\nenvironment if workers are to be motivated.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to this matter, the Minister has\r\n\r\ncorrectly pointed out that while workers must put  in\r\n\r\ntheir best, employers have an equal responsibility to\r\n\r\nimprove their management of personnel or of plant and\r\n\r\nequipment to increase productivity. May I add that it\r\n\r\nis  also  the responsibility of' employers  to  train\r\n\r\nworkers   and  to  upgrade  their  skills.  This   is\r\n\r\nparticularly true in the case where the employers are\r\n\r\nthe  multi-national corporations. Our Government  has\r\n\r\ngiven  various concessions and incentives to  attract\r\n\r\nthese corporations; it is only fair that they should,\r\n\r\nin   return,   train  our  workers,  transfer   their\r\n\r\ntechnology and management techniques, thus helping us\r\n\r\nto increase our economic productive capacity.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has presented\r\n\r\na   very  moderate  and  sound  budget  for  the  new\r\n\r\nfinancial  year on the 28th of last month.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nwell  balanced  budget. The people of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nhappy to hear that there are four tax concessions and\r\n\r\nno  increase in revenue through increased taxation on\r\n\r\nnecessities.  Only  the duties on liquor,  cigarettes\r\n\r\nand tobacco are increased with immediate effect. Such\r\n\r\ntaxes  do  not  concern the people's daily  life.  As\r\n\r\ncigarettes,  tobacco  and liquor  are  considered  as\r\n\r\nluxury  items  and  harmful  to  health,  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are happy to accept the right  decision\r\n\r\nof  the  Government in imposing more taxes  on  these\r\n\r\nthree commodities.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the new Budget\r\n\r\nannounced   by   the  Minister  for  Finance,   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the new financial year will be $5,459\r\n\r\nmillion  as  against  the main  revenue  estimate  of\r\n\r\n$3,362  million.  After  almost  self-cancelling  tax\r\n\r\nincreases   and   tax  concessions,   the   projected\r\n\r\nbudgetary deficit is about 8% up, at $1,505  million.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  my  own analysis, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  this deficit in our Budget does not mean  that\r\n\r\nour  economy  is  in trouble. As I can  see  it,  the\r\n\r\nestimated\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nrevenue of $3,362 million is more than enough to meet\r\n\r\nthe  recurrent expenditure, and secondly the  deficit\r\n\r\nhas  arisen mainly from the appropriation  of  $2,708\r\n\r\nmillion  as development expenditure to stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy and accelerate economic recovery.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, Sir, to meet the deficit,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance has proposed some  drawing\r\n\r\ndown from the Development Fund of Surpluses that have\r\n\r\nbeen  accumulated over the years or borrowing by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  view of the Republic's  high  credit\r\n\r\nstanding  in international markets, there should  not\r\n\r\nbe any problem with the raising of loans.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget is ably presented by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. Therefore, it is very difficult\r\n\r\nfor  a  non-economist like me to make comment on  the\r\n\r\nBudget.  I have read the Budget Statement many  times\r\n\r\nover  the  last  few  days. I  really  find  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to criticise the Budget Statement except to\r\n\r\nbring  out  a  few  points for the attention  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  our manpower development  programmes\r\n\r\nmust   now  emphasise  training  in  more  and   more\r\n\r\nspecialised skills. I think our Government has  taken\r\n\r\na  right step in this direction. As we know, manpower\r\n\r\nis the most valuable resource we have. Therefore, the\r\n\r\nbest possible training and education must be provided\r\n\r\nto   our   young  population  if  they  are   to   be\r\n\r\nsufficiently  equipped  to serve  the  needs  of  our\r\n\r\nnation and industry. Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know,\r\n\r\ntoday,  Singapore still has to rely a great  deal  on\r\n\r\nimported  foreign  expertise  in  both  commerce  and\r\n\r\nindustry.   With   our  present  rate   of   manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes, I hope our  Government  will\r\n\r\ninform  the House when Singapore will be able  to  be\r\n\r\nself-sufficient   in  her  needs  for   professional,\r\n\r\nmanagement,   technological  and  other   specialised\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir. in the rapid process of\r\n\r\nurbanisation and industrialisation in Singapore,  our\r\n\r\nlife  styles  have changed, but I wonder  whether  we\r\n\r\nhave  changed for the better or for worse. Sir, there\r\n\r\nis one thing I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nam quite sure. Progress will bring along with it more\r\n\r\nwealth.  In  some  Western  countries  today,   over-affluence  has caused youths to lose their  diligence\r\n\r\nand willingness to work. They fall out of society and\r\n\r\ntake to escapist life styles, seeking refuge in drug-taking  or  form their own sub-cultures. Fortunately,\r\n\r\nSir,  Singapore is not entirely immune to such social\r\n\r\ndiseases, but with greater preventives, we  can  save\r\n\r\nour  children  from degenerating cults alien  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry,   like   hippism  and  drug-addiction.   The\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  protecting our future  generation\r\n\r\nfalls on us, both Government and parents. It will  be\r\n\r\na  demanding task which we have to carry it out well.\r\n\r\nHow  shall  we educate our children in the future  on\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibility to themselves and  to  society?\r\n\r\nThis  problem must be faced now and it is  one  which\r\n\r\ncalls  for long term planning. Our education must  be\r\n\r\nbilingual,  including moral and civic training.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  primary need if we are to build a  strong  and\r\n\r\nrich nation, with both heart and soul.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our future is full of uncertainties\r\n\r\nand difficulties. Our future is a challenging one. In\r\n\r\nthe  next few years we have to face the challenge  to\r\n\r\ngovern and the challenge to hold the nation together.\r\n\r\nWe must not fail. Otherwise whatever we have achieved\r\n\r\nover the past years under the able leadership of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party Government will be lost through\r\n\r\nchaos  created by ourselves. Mr Speaker, Sir, in  any\r\n\r\nchaotic situation, life cannot remain comfortable, no\r\n\r\nmatter  how advanced we may be or how much we possess\r\n\r\nmaterially.   Normal  life  will  be  uprooted;   for\r\n\r\ninstance,  general strikes and riots in the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government.  We must learn  from  such  painful\r\n\r\nexperiences  if  we  are not  to  be  pushed  to  the\r\n\r\nthreshold of national disaster.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I conclude my speech, may I\r\n\r\nseek  an assurance from the Hon. Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nthat our Financial Policy is not only to continue  to\r\n\r\npursue our long term economic strategy programme  for\r\n\r\nour  economy's transformation to an industrial centre\r\n\r\nand  a  base for regional and international  services\r\n\r\nbut to see that our per capita income distribution is\r\n\r\nalways towards\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequity.  As we know. Sir, for the past few years  our\r\n\r\nper  capita income distribution is not ideal  as  the\r\n\r\ntrend is not always towards equity. There is still  a\r\n\r\nwide  gap  between the rich and poor.  Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I hope the Hon. Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwill  look  into  this serious and  important  matter\r\n\r\nurgently.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, all in all, Singapore is in a\r\n\r\nvery  sound financial position.

In  1976  we  saw  a\r\n\r\ngradual  recovery of the world economy. However,  the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation was still gloomy because  of  the\r\n\r\nuncertainty  of  oil prices and the fear  of  another\r\n\r\nround    of    galloping   inflation.   Under    such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, industrialised countries were not  too\r\n\r\nhopeful  for  a  good  economic  performance.  We  in\r\n\r\nSingapore also faced the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsame  problems  and yet we managed  to  have  a  real\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  rate of 7%, a  satisfactory  growth\r\n\r\nrate considering the overall economic conditions  at.\r\n\r\nhome  and abroad. This, I should say, is due  largely\r\n\r\nto  our  efficient  Government  in  implementing  our\r\n\r\npolicy  of  diversified  economic  activities,  which\r\n\r\nhelps   cushion   the   impact  of   world   economic\r\n\r\nfluctuations on our country.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our nation is a small nation, dependent on foreign\r\n\r\ncountries  for  our requirements.  We  are  therefore\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to unfavourable economic developments  in\r\n\r\nother  countries. In other words, most of the factors\r\n\r\nthat  affect  our  economic  growth  are  beyond  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.  But our Government does not use this  as  a\r\n\r\nscapegoat  for not being able to manage our resources\r\n\r\nwell. On the contrary, the Government tried its best,\r\n\r\nmanipulating the factors which were under its control\r\n\r\nso as to counter the unfavourable economic effects of\r\n\r\nthe  factors which were beyond its control. The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we managed 7% real economic growth rate whereas\r\n\r\nindustrialised  countries  in  the  Organisation  for\r\n\r\nEconomic  Cooperation and Development (OECD)  managed\r\n\r\nonly  5%  real  economic  growth  rate  reflects  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of our Government's efforts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic prospects for 1977 are not very bright.\r\n\r\nThis  is  due  to the slowing down of world  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery.  Industrialised  countries,  fearing   that\r\n\r\nanother  round of inflation will set in, are cautious\r\n\r\nin  their economic development. Another restraint  to\r\n\r\neconomic  stimulation is the uncertainty of  the  oil\r\n\r\nprice  caused  by the split of the OPEC nations  over\r\n\r\nthe  increase  of  oil price which  resulted  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent two-tier oil price. Therefore, as a whole, our\r\n\r\neconomic   prospects  for  1977  do  not   seem   too\r\n\r\npromising.  However, the Government has  a  plan  for\r\n\r\naction.  In  the  efforts to further  strengthen  our\r\n\r\neconomy,  the  Minister for Finance said  that  steps\r\n\r\nwould  be  taken to strengthen our trade,  investment\r\n\r\nand  diplomatic offices in key centres  to  safeguard\r\n\r\nour  economic interests. Greater efforts will be made\r\n\r\nto  attract  more investment from the United  States,\r\n\r\nJapan,  West  Europe and West Asia  and  to  maintain\r\n\r\nsteady progress in our\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\neconomy. With a firm economic base and the steps that\r\n\r\nwill  be taken, the prospects of achieving an  annual\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate of 6 to 8% are not gloomy.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nhoped  that  the domestic policies drawn  up  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will counteract some of the more  negative\r\n\r\neffects  of  the  world  economic  slowdown  of   our\r\n\r\neconomic performance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the aim of the Government to contain wage\r\n\r\ninflation  in our country. Therefore, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas drawn up policies of orderly wage increases. Wage\r\n\r\nincreases  are based on the productivity of  workers.\r\n\r\nIt is largely due to the success of our wage policies\r\n\r\nthat   we   are   able  to  remain   competitive   in\r\n\r\ninternational  trade.  These policies  are  essential\r\n\r\nbecause   of   the   present  world  situation.   The\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries were badly affected  in  the\r\n\r\nsevere slump a few years ago and the slow recovery of\r\n\r\nthe  world  economy that follows. As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\nindustrialised  countries  are  faced   with   severe\r\n\r\nunemployment  and spare manufacturing capacities.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  solve their problems, these countries  may\r\n\r\nreduce  the  prices  of their manufactured  goods  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  their  economies.  Thus  we  have  to   be\r\n\r\nprepared   for  such  action  by  the  industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries.  To  remain competitive  in  international\r\n\r\ntrade, we have to keep the prices of our manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods low. Thus the need to control wage increases.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, increases in wages are based on the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the National Wages Council  (NWC).\r\n\r\nThis method of granting wage increases has favourable\r\n\r\neffects  on  our economy - it prevents  workers  from\r\n\r\ndemanding   excessive  increases  in   their   wages.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  is not without criticism.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndanger  that  employers  may take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  restraint  on  wage  increases  by  not\r\n\r\ngranting  wage increases to workers even  though  the\r\n\r\nproductivity  of the workers has gone  up.  Instances\r\n\r\nwhen  employers pay large amounts of bonus  to  their\r\n\r\ntop  executives and yet refuse to grant pay increases\r\n\r\nrecommended  by the NWC to the workers have  come  to\r\n\r\nlight  from  time  to  time. Perhaps  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould give some\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nattention  to the problem before undesirable  effects\r\n\r\nset in.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC's recommendations for wage increases are\r\n\r\nbased   on  the  productivity  of  workers.  However,\r\n\r\nmeasuring the productivity of workers is by no  means\r\n\r\neasy.  The only guide to the productivity of  workers\r\n\r\nis  the profit of the employer. Therefore, it may  be\r\n\r\nbetter  to make it compulsory for employers to  grant\r\n\r\nsalary  increases  recommended by the  NWC.  The  NWC\r\n\r\nshould  recommend a range of percentage increases  in\r\n\r\nsalary.  To make the increases in salary commensurate\r\n\r\nwith  the  increases  in productivity,  increases  in\r\n\r\nsalary  should  be  based  on  the  profits  of   the\r\n\r\nemployers. Thus employers must grant salary increases\r\n\r\nwithin  the  range recommended by the  NWC.  One  may\r\n\r\nargue that those employers who are just breaking even\r\n\r\nor  are  making a loss will be forced to go bankrupt.\r\n\r\nIf  we  look at it from the economic point  of  view,\r\n\r\nthis may be favourable. Our resources are scarce  and\r\n\r\ntherefore we must make full use of them. If employers\r\n\r\nare  not able to make optimum use of their resources,\r\n\r\nit is better that they go out of business so that the\r\n\r\nresources   can   be   redeployed  more   efficiently\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now touch on the question of tax\r\n\r\nincreases  and concessions. On the whole, the  budget\r\n\r\ncan  be described as a relatively painless one,  with\r\n\r\nincreases in tax only for cigarettes and intoxicating\r\n\r\nliquors.  Generally,  it is very  moderate  and  well\r\n\r\nreceived   as  it  does  not  directly   affect   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the  majority  of  the  people.  Such\r\n\r\nincreases  will undoubtedly be passed on to consumers\r\n\r\nby  the  dealers, and the smokers and  drinkers  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  have  to pay a higher price.  The  aim  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  the tax on cigarettes. according  to  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister, is to discourage smoking and not on\r\n\r\nrevenue consideration since the yield in revenue will\r\n\r\nbe  offset  by tax concessions. However, I doubt  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in the price of cigarettes can be effective\r\n\r\nin  discouraging  smoking. Notwithstanding  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the Government has been making efforts to advise\r\n\r\nand  urge  people against smoking and the mass  media\r\n\r\nhave   long   ceased   carrying   advertisements   on\r\n\r\ncigarettes and tobacco.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe number of smokers has not decreased but tends  to\r\n\r\nincrease instead. Increase in the price of cigarettes\r\n\r\nhas  a very marginal effect on its demand because the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  cigarettes  is  highly  price-inelastic.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the people will continue to pay  for  the\r\n\r\nhigher  prices  and will instead economise  on  other\r\n\r\nexpenses.  For  example,  if  they  save   in   their\r\n\r\nmarketing  by  cutting down on more nutritious  food,\r\n\r\ntheir  health  may be affected in  the  long  run.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve a more effective way to discourage smoking is\r\n\r\nto  educate the people on the grave health hazards of\r\n\r\nsmoking, and this can be done through the mass  media\r\n\r\nand in the schools.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning now to tax concessions, I would say\r\n\r\nthat the general public is pleased to learn that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is very generous in granting certain  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions  at a time when more revenue is  required\r\n\r\nto  cover  the  high expenditure. However,  a  closer\r\n\r\nexamination of the tax concessions shows that only  a\r\n\r\nvery  small fraction of the people stand to  benefit,\r\n\r\nand  the  majority of them are from the upper middle-income group. In particular, the concession on estate\r\n\r\nduty  will not benefit the lower-income group at all.\r\n\r\nOnly  people in the upper middle-income group  and  a\r\n\r\nminority  in  the lower middle-income group  who  own\r\n\r\nhouses valued at more than $100,000 will benefit. For\r\n\r\nthese  people, paying $8,837.50 in estate duty for  a\r\n\r\n$200,000 house is not a problem at all.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in taxation seem to affect the `have\r\n\r\nnot'  and not the `have'. Both the rich and the  poor\r\n\r\nconsume  cigarettes and intoxicating  liquors.  Thus,\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in taxes for these items  will  affect\r\n\r\nboth  groups  of people equally. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthose who will gain from the tax concessions are  the\r\n\r\nrich.  For  the rich, the increase in the tax  burden\r\n\r\ndue  to increases in taxes for cigarettes and liquors\r\n\r\nis  offset  by the gain in tax concessions.  However,\r\n\r\nfor  the poor there is nothing to offset their  extra\r\n\r\ntax  burden.  Thus the gap between the rich  and  the\r\n\r\npoor will widen.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may have noble objectives in giving\r\n\r\nthe four tax concessions. For example, the concession\r\n\r\nin  estate  duty  is  introduced  to  encourage  home\r\n\r\nownership,  the  tax  concession on  offshore  income\r\n\r\nderived from Asian Dollar Market operations is  given\r\n\r\nto  further develop Singapore as a financial  centre,\r\n\r\nand  the  tax  concession on income from  reinsurance\r\n\r\nbusiness  is to take advantage of our ideal  location\r\n\r\nand  good  business infrastructure so as  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  an important centre for  reinsurance\r\n\r\nbusiness. Such objectives are good for the country as\r\n\r\na  whole  and  I  am  not against  them.  What  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  is  that the Government,  being  too  pre-occupied  with  these  objectives,  may  neglect  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the lower income group and the poor.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance concluded\r\n\r\nhis Budget Statement with the remark, \"The weather is\r\n\r\ngetting  fine and fair and our Ship of  State  is  in\r\n\r\ngood  shape.\" I cannot agree more with him about  the\r\n\r\ncondition  of  our Ship of State  but  I  am  not  as\r\n\r\noptimistic as he is with regard to the weather ahead.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  Minister did hint of  impending  dark\r\n\r\nclouds  in  the  horizon which could  jeopardize  his\r\n\r\nforecast, although he did not elaborate on them.  But\r\n\r\nI  think it is necessary to mention the problems  and\r\n\r\nnot just the prospects; and to point out the possible\r\n\r\ndanger  spots  in the year ahead so that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould not be caught unaware if a situation turns  for\r\n\r\nthe worse and a crisis develops.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has indicated that the\r\n\r\nRepublic  is  likely to achieve a growth  in  GNP  of\r\n\r\nbetween  6  and  8%.  In  his calculation,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether   certain  factors  have  been   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Our  economic  growth  is  tied  very\r\n\r\nclosely  to  the  performance of the OECD  countries.\r\n\r\nHence, it is in our interest to take note of a recent\r\n\r\nreport in The Economist which states that, \"there are\r\n\r\nreasons  to  suspect  that prospects  for  the  world\r\n\r\neconomy  are  not  as mildly rosy  as  the  consensus\r\n\r\npredicts.\"  The  OECD countries are  only  likely  to\r\n\r\nachieve growth\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nrates  of  between 0 and 7%: Japan 7%,  U.S.  4 1/2 - 5 1/2%,\r\n\r\nGermany  2 1/4 - 5 1/2%, France 4%, Britain 1 1/2% and  Italy 0%.  And even these expected performances have to  be\r\n\r\nmeasured  against  the  effects  of  certain  events,\r\n\r\nincluding  growing  unemployment in  Western  Europe,\r\n\r\ncontinuing  high inflation, economic  strain  between\r\n\r\nthe   EEC   and   Japan.  slowdown  in  the   oversea\r\n\r\ninvestments and the most severe winter in the history\r\n\r\nof the U.S. Further, there is the prospect of another\r\n\r\nincrease in the oil price. According to the President\r\n\r\nof  OPEC. the two-tier price system may not hold  but\r\n\r\nany  compromise solution would be \"somewhere  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle\"  between the 10 plus 5% decreed by eleven  of\r\n\r\nthe OPEC members and the one time 5% raise imposed by\r\n\r\nSaudi  Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates.  Another\r\n\r\ncomplicating factor is the Arab-Israeli conflict  and\r\n\r\nthe  commitment  of  the OPEC  countries  to  provide\r\n\r\nassistance  to  the  Arab  confrontation  states.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I have mentioned these matters  merely\r\n\r\nto  reiterate the need for caution in our expectation\r\n\r\nof  high  economic  growth. Our  economic  future  is\r\n\r\ndetermined  not  only  by  the  Government  financial\r\n\r\npolicy but also by the political, social and economic\r\n\r\ndevelopments in the world at large.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned in his Budget Statement the\r\n\r\n\"modest beginnings in ASEAN economic cooperation\" and\r\n\r\nhe  gave  the  examples of the five ASEAN  industrial\r\n\r\nprojects and the Preferential Trading Arrangement.  I\r\n\r\nam not quite certain what the stage of implementation\r\n\r\nof  each of these projects is; nevertheless. I am  in\r\n\r\nfull support of all these efforts. However, there  is\r\n\r\none  area of ASEAN activity which the Minister failed\r\n\r\nto  mention, namely, ASEAN's economic relations  with\r\n\r\nother countries, in particular the industrial states,\r\n\r\nnamely, the U.S., Japan and the EEC. According  to  a\r\n\r\nrecent  study, the ASEAN countries in  1974  took  up\r\n\r\nonly  2.9%  of  the world trade: the ASEAN  countries\r\n\r\nexported  83% of the world's natural rubber,  80%  of\r\n\r\nits  palm  oil. 68% of its' tin and 67% of its  copra\r\n\r\nand  coconut products. In that year, 61 .9% of  their\r\n\r\ntotal  exports and 57.5% of their total imports  were\r\n\r\nwith the industrial countries. Thus, it\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould  seem  to  me  that  there  is  scope  for  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of trade between ASEAN and the world,  and\r\n\r\nthat  there is need to consolidate and expand ASEAN's\r\n\r\ntrade with the industrial states.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I welcome the ASEAN initiatives\r\n\r\nto  hold  separate discussions between  the  regional\r\n\r\norganisation  and the United States,  Japan  and  the\r\n\r\nEEC.  The  reality of economic life of ASEAN  is  the\r\n\r\nfact   of   interdependence  between  them  and   the\r\n\r\nindustrial  states. ASEAN depends on  the  industrial\r\n\r\ncountries  for capital. technology and equipment  and\r\n\r\nthe  industrial countries depend on ASEAN for primary\r\n\r\ncommodities   and   certain  manufactured   products.\r\n\r\nBesides   consolidating  trade  with  the  industrial\r\n\r\ncountries,  ASEAN  should explore  other  markets  in\r\n\r\nother  parts of the world, including West Asia, Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica  and  South and East Asia. On this  point,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to support the Minister's appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers, traders, businessmen and if I may add,\r\n\r\nbankers,  to  devote  more  efforts  to  develop  new\r\n\r\nmarkets  for Singapore's products. Within the region,\r\n\r\nthe recent initiative of the Government in concluding\r\n\r\npreferential tariff arrangements with the Philippines\r\n\r\nand  Thailand  should  provide the  impetus  for  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  intra-ASEAN trade.  According  to  the\r\n\r\nstudy  mentioned  above,  the overall  intra-regional\r\n\r\ntrade in 1974 amounted to only 13% of the ASEAN total\r\n\r\ntrade.   I   am  certain  that  with  the   Singapore\r\n\r\ninitiative  and  the  move towards  liberalising  the\r\n\r\npresent  intra-ASEAN trade arrangements.  Intra-ASEAN\r\n\r\ntrade  would improve, and this would benefit all  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  ASEAN. This would be in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  strategy  to develop collective  and  national\r\n\r\nresilience  to  meet  the  problems  confronting  the\r\n\r\nstates in ASEAN.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noticed that the Defence\r\n\r\nMinistry has the highest allocation for the financial\r\n\r\nyear  1977-78, and this may lead critics to  question\r\n\r\nthe need for such expenditure for defence I think the\r\n\r\nneed for a viable defence system for the Republic  is\r\n\r\nimperative   in  view  of  the  uncertain   political\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in the region, and the Government  must\r\n\r\nshoulder the responsibility\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto maintain a level of defence sufficient to meet any\r\n\r\neventuality.  And  as  far  as  the  expenditure   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it is high in terms of per capita GNP, but\r\n\r\nit  should  be  pointed out that,  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nabsolute   amount  and  the  size  of  the   military\r\n\r\nmanpower,  the Republic spends the least for  defence\r\n\r\nand  has  the  smallest military force in  comparison\r\n\r\nwith  other countries including all the ASEAN states,\r\n\r\nThis  is  evident  if we examine  the  Tables#  below\r\n\r\nshowing  the  comparison of defence expenditures  and\r\n\r\nmilitary  manpower of the ASEAN states for the  years\r\n\r\n1972  to 1976. In view of this fact, there should  be\r\n\r\nno   hesitation  on  anyone's  part  to  support  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the Ministry of Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  #The Tables read as follows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Table I\r\n\r\n    Comparisons of Defence Expenditures 1973 - 1976 (US$ millions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               1973    1974    1975    Total 1973-1975    1976\r\n\r\nIndonesia       452     601    1108          2161         N.A.\r\n\r\nMalaysia        287     311     385           983         353\r\n\r\nPhilippines     172     312     407           891         410\r\n\r\nSingapore       210     363     344           817         340\r\n\r\nThailand        358     430     542          1330         N.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Exclude foreign military assistance to Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Table II\r\n\r\n    Comparisons of Military Manpower 1972 -1976 (in thousands)*\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n              1972    1973    1974     1975      1976\r\n\r\nIndonesia    317.0   322.0   270.0    266.0     246.0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMalaysia      50.5    56.0    66.2     61.1      62.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilippines   31.0    42.7    55.0     67.0      78.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore     17.1    20.6    21.7     30.0      31.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThailand     150.0   180.0   195.0    204.0     210.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Numbers in Armed Forces, excluding reservists and para-military forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: The International Institute for Strategic Studies. \r\n\r\nThe Military Balance 1976-77, London, 1976. pp 79 and 81\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the small tax\r\n\r\nincreases  on  tobacco. cigarettes  and  intoxicating\r\n\r\nliquors  will  achieve the objective of  discouraging\r\n\r\nthe  habitual  smokers and drinkers  from  continuing\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nundesirable  practices.

There was a widespread\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecline  in the economic growth of advanced countries\r\n\r\nin  the  world,  in some cases there  was  even  zero\r\n\r\ngrowth.  Although there were signs of  recovery  from\r\n\r\nthe  world economic recession. in the first  half  of\r\n\r\n1976  there  was  fear amongst the  major  industrial\r\n\r\ncountries  that too rapid a recovery might spark  off\r\n\r\nanother spate of inflation resulting in their  taking\r\n\r\npreventive  measures. Consequently, there was  slower\r\n\r\neconomic  growth in the second half of 1976.  Against\r\n\r\nthis  background it is encouraging to note  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  has reported  a  7%  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  in 1976 in his Budget Statement announced  on\r\n\r\nthe 28th of last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the war the sophisticated but\r\n\r\nhigh profit new industries like the oil industry, the\r\n\r\npetro-chemical  industry and the electronic  industry\r\n\r\nin  the advanced countries have been fully developed.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result  of rising costs of raw  materials  and\r\n\r\nenergy  coupled  with the growth in  population,  the\r\n\r\ncosts  of production have mounted and because of  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  population consumption has been  greater.\r\n\r\nWith  this  trend there is going to be a shortage  of\r\n\r\nraw  materials  if  there is  no  recycling  of  used\r\n\r\nmaterials.  So  it will be quite impossible  for  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries to reach a double digit  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  in the years to come. It will also  be  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  Singapore to  achieve  fast  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth as in the early 70s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past decade there have\r\n\r\nbeen  industrialisation efforts in Singapore. But  in\r\n\r\nthe earlier stages of industrialisation the programme\r\n\r\nwas carried out on a smaller scale and the production\r\n\r\nwas  meant  only  for consumption  in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  It  had also been based  mainly  on  light\r\n\r\nindustries,   such   as  food  processing   and   the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  consumer goods. It  is  only  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  four or five years that our industrialisation\r\n\r\nhas entered a new phase, both in terms of capital and\r\n\r\ntechnology.  We  have since made  great  improvements\r\n\r\nquantitatively  and qualitatively  and  our  products\r\n\r\nhave been exported to Southeast Asian countries.  EEC\r\n\r\ncountries and other parts of the world. But,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nunfortunately,  the greater part of the  capital  and\r\n\r\nfactories  in Singapore are in the hands  of  foreign\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs. Local entrepreneurs take only  a  very\r\n\r\nminor  place in our industries, although the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board has an office on the promotion  of\r\n\r\njoint  ventures.  where it collects  and  distributes\r\n\r\ninformation  and  data  and  renders  assistance   to\r\n\r\nprospective investors in joint ventures in  order  to\r\n\r\npromote  our  economic growth. But how many  projects\r\n\r\nhave materialised and are running smoothly under this\r\n\r\nscheme?  I  do not know. Local entrepreneurs  do  not\r\n\r\nseem  to play a great part under the scheme.  So  our\r\n\r\nmain  task in the long-term interest of Singapore  is\r\n\r\nto  try and encourage more local capital to take  the\r\n\r\nplace  of  foreign  capital in the  major  industrial\r\n\r\nsectors of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no country in the world can remain isolated in\r\n\r\nits  economic development by depending solely on  its\r\n\r\nresources, natural or manpowerwise. It will also have\r\n\r\nto   depend   on   external  sources.  For   example.\r\n\r\nindustrial powers like Japan and West Germany have in\r\n\r\nthe  short space of 20-30 years after the War  relied\r\n\r\ngainfully  on  the  supply  of  foreign  capital  and\r\n\r\ntechnological knowhow, coupled with the hard work and\r\n\r\nthe  assiduous  learning of their peoples  to  become\r\n\r\nadvanced  industrial countries  in  the  world.  Sir,\r\n\r\ncapital is an important factor in generating economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Therefore, for our  continued  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  we must create a favourable  investment\r\n\r\nclimate for our industries, just as the Minister  has\r\n\r\nsuggested in his Budget statement a third item of tax\r\n\r\nconcession to strengthen our position as a  financial\r\n\r\ncentre  to  attract  more capital  to  stimulate  our\r\n\r\neconomic  development. Sir, we must also  change  the\r\n\r\ntraditional   investment   habit   of    our    local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs. We have to inject more  confidence  in\r\n\r\nour  local  people for investments in our  industries\r\n\r\nand  provide  the  necessary  service  and  safeguard\r\n\r\nrelating thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than three years of very serious economic\r\n\r\nrecession,  even  developed  countries  as  well   as\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries in the world are taking  proper\r\n\r\nsteps to stimulate their domestic economy and to  cut\r\n\r\ndown unemployment. So they step up their efforts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nin  export  in  order  to increase  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nearning. Therefore, competition has been very keen in\r\n\r\nthe   world   markets.   In   order   to   keep   the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of our economy in the world  markets,\r\n\r\nwe  should improve the quality of our products, raise\r\n\r\nour  labour  productivity and cut down on  production\r\n\r\ncosts.  In  this  way, we will  be  able  to  produce\r\n\r\ncheaply  and compete effectively in the world market.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, we must also launch an offensive to get\r\n\r\ninto  hitherto neglected markets. including  the  oil\r\n\r\nproducing countries. There is, therefore, the need to\r\n\r\nstep  up  a  national export bureau  to  provide  co-ordination  in  our  export activities  and  to  take\r\n\r\ncharge of all services related thereto such as tariff\r\n\r\nexemption. export capital transference, export credit\r\n\r\ninsurance,      information     collection,      data\r\n\r\ndissemination, market research. etc. There should  be\r\n\r\nmore  incentives  and facilities to be  provided  for\r\n\r\nexport  promotion. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  should  have\r\n\r\nthis  national  export bureau to  provide  our  local\r\n\r\nindustrialists  and traders services and  information\r\n\r\nand  data  to  enable them to better  understand  the\r\n\r\npotential  world markets so that they will be  better\r\n\r\nequipped in their efforts to promote exports. This is\r\n\r\na matter for immediate attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because we have international trade we are\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  changes  in the  world  economy,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore our industrialists and management  must  be\r\n\r\nable  to  make  a  quick  and immediate  response  to\r\n\r\nchanges  in the world economy. There should  be  more\r\n\r\nflexibility in our economy so that we will be able to\r\n\r\nweather  through difficult situations that may  arise\r\n\r\nin  the  horizon. We should have this  kind  of  able\r\n\r\nmanagement personnel who would be able to handle  our\r\n\r\nfuture   commercial   and  industrial   affairs   and\r\n\r\nsuccessfully develop further our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the greater economic cooperation\r\n\r\namong  the  ASEAN  countries,  there  has  been  more\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial development in this region.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  there  is  a  greater  need  for  more\r\n\r\ncapital, industrial aid, managerial and technological\r\n\r\nknowhow. consultancy service,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\neconomic  research  and  other  services.

As   technical\r\n\r\ntraining and communication services will develop into\r\n\r\nnew  dimensions in this world, we should be  able  to\r\n\r\nmake the best use of our existing infrastructure  and\r\n\r\nother facilities in Singapore to assist in the mutual\r\n\r\neconomic development of Southeast Asia. We can become\r\n\r\na  kind  of financial and service centre or a  factor\r\n\r\nfor   the  development  of  economic  prosperity  and\r\n\r\npolitical stability in this region.

According to the Finance Minister, from this\r\n\r\nfigure,   we   have  earmarked  $2,708  million   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes, to assist  and  stimulate  our\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery.  For the new financial  year  the\r\n\r\ntotal  revenue  of  about  $3,362  million  will   be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to cover current expenditure.

The   rate   of\r\n\r\ninflation for 1976 has shown that even countries with\r\n\r\nstrong  economies,  such as the OECD  countries,  are\r\n\r\nstill experiencing an inflation rate of about 8%.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  are  certain countries  which  have  an\r\n\r\ninflation  rate  of  30%, such as Egypt,  while  some\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries   like  Nigeria  even  have  a  frightening\r\n\r\ninflation rate which rises to a peak of 40%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we can also see how the industrial\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  OECD which  are  experiencing  an\r\n\r\ninflation rate of 8% can still achieve a real  growth\r\n\r\nrate  of 5%. The United States particularly has moved\r\n\r\none  step  ahead when the Chairman of its Council  of\r\n\r\nEconomic  Advisers, Mr Charles Schultz,  predicted  a\r\n\r\nGNP  growth rate of between 5.5% and 6% for 1977.  It\r\n\r\nis certainly our hope that the growth rate in Western\r\n\r\nEurope  and  Japan  for 1977 will  also  surpass  the\r\n\r\ngrowth rate for last year because should this happen.\r\n\r\nstability  would  be brought about  in  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation of the world as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1977 financial statement our Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance  has  predicted  that  \"barring   major\r\n\r\nupheavals in the world economy, we should be able  to\r\n\r\nachieve an annual growth rate of 6 to 8%.\" This is an\r\n\r\noptimistic prediction. In his concluding remarks, the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In English]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have weathered severe economic storms in the\r\n\r\nlast 3 1/2 years. I hope nothing as shocking as the 1973\r\n\r\noil  embargo  and  quadrupling  of  oil  prices  ever\r\n\r\nhappens  again. The weather is getting fine and  fair\r\n\r\nand  our  Ship of State is in good shape The  command\r\n\r\nshould therefore be \"Steady as she goes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In Malay] Actually, the hopes expressed by the\r\n\r\nMinister  represent the universal hope of mankind  at\r\n\r\nlarge.  But  only  the  human  race  understands  how\r\n\r\ncomplex  the human mind is. Human beings  have  spent\r\n\r\nbillions  of  dollars  on arms for  various  reasons,\r\n\r\nincluding the object of interfering in the affairs of\r\n\r\nothers and breaching the peace. thereby causing those\r\n\r\ncountries to resort to no other course of action  but\r\n\r\nto  prepare themselves for possible attacks so as not\r\n\r\nto be caught napping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the former Chairman of the Food\r\n\r\nand  Agriculture Organisation of the United  Nations,\r\n\r\nDr Eugene Castro, made a statement. (Dr Eugene Castro\r\n\r\nhas   no  relations  with  Dr  Fidel  Castro;  should\r\n\r\nsomebody want to write a book on a comparative  study\r\n\r\nof both men. which I think will\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmake interesting reading.) In his statement Dr Eugene\r\n\r\nCastro  says  that what he is troubled with  is  that\r\n\r\nshould  this  world be free of war and  there  is  no\r\n\r\nchaos, he is confident that the world will be able to\r\n\r\nsupport  10  times the world population of  today  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of food. This is a statement made more  than\r\n\r\n10  years ago and the complex situation of mankind is\r\n\r\nstill continuing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now oil has become a weapon. Industrial\r\n\r\ncountries like Japan with their economic miracle were\r\n\r\nalso affected when the price of oil increased in  the\r\n\r\n1973-75 period because Japan. for instance, could not\r\n\r\nreduce the salaries of its workers so as to strike  a\r\n\r\nbalance with the increase in the cost of oil imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the prediction of the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister about the 6-8% economic  growth  is\r\n\r\nvery moderate. I think we can accept this cautiously,\r\n\r\nextra  cautious  in  fact, or rather  with  `cautious\r\n\r\noptimism.'  We  know  that whatever  happens  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  Western Europe  or  Japan,  it  will\r\n\r\naffect  us.  We  also know that the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nprice of oil will adversely affect us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another matter which is closer to home is that\r\n\r\nwhether  we like it or not two blocs have emerged  in\r\n\r\nthis  region. One bloc is the Communist bloc  of  the\r\n\r\nIndo-Chinese countries (Vietnam, Cambodia  and  Laos)\r\n\r\nand  the other bloc, including us, is ASEAN.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee that what has been going on in the Thai-Malaysian\r\n\r\nborder  is  not  a healthy sign. All  these  matters,\r\n\r\nincluding peace and stability in Singapore,  will  be\r\n\r\nan   important  factor  in  determining  whether  our\r\n\r\nMinister's hopes and predictions will materialise  or\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all these matters should be watched by us\r\n\r\nclosely,  I feel that other positive measures  should\r\n\r\nbe  taken. Firstly, our bilateral agreements with the\r\n\r\nPhilippines and Thailand for a 10% tariff cut  should\r\n\r\nbe   made  a  reality  and  extended  to  all   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries.  Secondly. having achieved  that,  efforts\r\n\r\nshould  be made for a similar situation to be created\r\n\r\nbetween  ASEAN on the one hand and Australia and  New\r\n\r\nZealand  on  the  other. I feel that there  are  many\r\n\r\nsimilarities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nbetween us that can create better understanding which\r\n\r\nin   the  final  analysis  will  benefit  all  sides.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  while  in  the  economic  field   we   must\r\n\r\nconsolidate  our  strength. we must make  efforts  in\r\n\r\npolitics  so  that this region, in particular,  could\r\n\r\nfulfil  the aspiration of the human race, namely,  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  peace, in mutual respect for  each  other's\r\n\r\nrights and settling problems with peaceful means  and\r\n\r\nnot  through interference with the affairs of  others\r\n\r\nor  through  conflicts or minor  wars,  killings  and\r\n\r\nmurders. Until now, people are asking whether we  are\r\n\r\ngood ancestors for future generations to take example\r\n\r\nfrom.  I feel that this question can only be answered\r\n\r\nby making self-corrections. We must correct ourselves\r\n\r\nfirst.  All  human  beings should correct  themselves\r\n\r\nbefore  putting the blame on others. I would like  to\r\n\r\nquote from a Chinese proverb: \"We point one finger at\r\n\r\nothers  but three fingers are pointing at us.\"  If  a\r\n\r\nMalay were to point at someone in a polite manner, he\r\n\r\nwould  do it with his thumb. In this manner, we  find\r\n\r\nthat four fingers would be pointing at our own self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's policy\r\n\r\nfor this fiscal year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister in his Budget Speech summarised  our\r\n\r\nbasic   strategy   to  meet  the  uncertainties   and\r\n\r\ndifficulties in the next few years when he said  that\r\n\r\nwe  need  a  flexible  approach  in  our  development\r\n\r\npolicy.  Changes  in  the region  and  in  the  major\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries will require  us  to  change\r\n\r\nour  own policies and priorities. The problem is  how\r\n\r\nto  get  such  changes in priorities to be  reflected\r\n\r\nquickly  and effectively in the actions of the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  and other public services. During  the  high\r\n\r\ngrowth years between 1968 and 1973. the economy  grew\r\n\r\nat  an  average  rate of 15% and  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector grew at a rate of 20%. (All these figures  are\r\n\r\nin real terms.) It was natural, therefore, that goals\r\n\r\nother  than rapid employment creation and high growth\r\n\r\nbegan to gain emphasis. We began to discourage labour\r\n\r\nintensive operations and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nlaid  greater emphasis on skilled labour and  capital\r\n\r\nintensive  industries. We began to be more particular\r\n\r\nabout  where each type of industry should be located.\r\n\r\nWe set higher targets and demanded greater margins of\r\n\r\nsafety  in anti-pollution measures, industrial safety\r\n\r\nand health measures and so on. We did such a good job\r\n\r\nin  some  areas, for example, in discouraging labour-intensive operations that we now have to put in extra\r\n\r\nefforts to convince potential investors that there is\r\n\r\na  change  in  approach and that  any  viable  export\r\n\r\noriented industry will be welcome, With the change in\r\n\r\nthe  international economic environment  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrestate  our order of priorities and convey  this  to\r\n\r\npotential investors as well as those in the civil and\r\n\r\npublic  services  who  have  something  to  do   with\r\n\r\ninvestments, be it in manufacturing, construction  or\r\n\r\nservice activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there is not sufficient appreciation of\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties  involved  in  achieving  even  the\r\n\r\nmodest growth rate targetted for 1977. Those who  are\r\n\r\nin  the  field trying to attract new investment  know\r\n\r\nonly   too   well   how  much  times  have   changed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately. the great sense of urgency  and  unity\r\n\r\nof  purpose that characterised the administration  up\r\n\r\nto  the end of the 1960s and that enabled us to take\r\n\r\nsuch  effective advantage of the boom  years  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational economy seem to have faded away. We now\r\n\r\nhave  departments and services who are more concerned\r\n\r\nwith   their   own  immediate  objectives.   If   the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  such  departments  is  even   partly\r\n\r\nmeasured  by  the  income they generate,  the  profit\r\n\r\nmotive tends to become supreme. That department  head\r\n\r\nwho has the wider interest of the economy and who  is\r\n\r\nprepared to yield the immediate maximisation  of  his\r\n\r\nown objectives becomes known generally as being soft-headed or weak. Moreover, if something does go  wrong\r\n\r\nas  a result of his flexibility, those who press  for\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility will not be around to carry the can.\r\n\r\nIn  hindsight  when things go wrong  flexibility  can\r\n\r\neasily  be  made to appear as stupidity.  Is  it  any\r\n\r\nwonder  then  why  some departments stick  firmly  to\r\n\r\ntheir own narrow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjectives and are inflexible in their approach?  The\r\n\r\nproblem  therefore is how to achieve  flexibility  in\r\n\r\nadministration to ensure that some of the  objectives\r\n\r\nthat became feasible in high growth years are now  re\r\n\r\nexamined and modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that some instrument must be found\r\n\r\nat   a  supra  ministry  level  that  can  weigh  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  aspects, set new order of  priorities  and\r\n\r\nmake decisions when such problems arise. The Economic\r\n\r\nActivation  Committee comprising  very  senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants seems to be ideal for this. It does not have\r\n\r\nany  decision-making powers at present. It should  be\r\n\r\nreconstituted   and  delegated  some  decision-making\r\n\r\npowers.  The  EAC  can then, on the basis  of  actual\r\n\r\ncases  presented  before  it,  formulate  changes  in\r\n\r\napproach,  in  emphasis, in order of  priorities  and\r\n\r\noverride or confirm individual department's views and\r\n\r\ncommunicate  these  to the departments  and  services\r\n\r\nconcerned  through the decisions  it  makes  on  such\r\n\r\ncases.  It  may even be necessary to have a committee\r\n\r\nof  two  or three Ministers who can perform a similar\r\n\r\nfunction on those matters which are considered to  be\r\n\r\ntoo sensitive to be delegated down to a committee  of\r\n\r\ncivil servants. These measures will greatly speed  up\r\n\r\nimplementation of investment decisions  not  only  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing but also in other fields. I think  this\r\n\r\nis   very  essential  if  we  are  not  to  frustrate\r\n\r\ninvestment promotion efforts or spend inordinate time\r\n\r\nand  effort  trying  to convince  various  government\r\n\r\ndepartments on the need to be flexible when such time\r\n\r\nand  effort  should in fact be spent  in  working  on\r\n\r\npotential   investors   to   commit   themselves   to\r\n\r\ninvestment  in Singapore. Having with much difficulty\r\n\r\nled  the proverbial horse to the water we should  not\r\n\r\nbe pulling away the trough when it wants to drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter that should receive more attention\r\n\r\nand which has been touched upon by the Member for Ang\r\n\r\nMo   Kio  is  the  promotion  of  a  class  of  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  who  can compete successfully  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational market. Firms controlled and managed by\r\n\r\nlocal entrepreneurs probably account for about 45% of\r\n\r\nthe  workers  employed and about 30  to  35%  of  the\r\n\r\noutput\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nand   value  added  respectively  of  the  industries\r\n\r\ncovered  in the Census of Industrial Production.  But\r\n\r\nthese firms account for only about 1 5% of the direct\r\n\r\nexports, although there are, of course, some indirect\r\n\r\nexports. Those who have followed the progress of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   know  that  very   little   local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship has emerged that is able to  make  a\r\n\r\nmark  in the export market. It is quite logical  that\r\n\r\nthose with ready foreign markets have been the target\r\n\r\nof  our  industrial promotion policy. We have rightly\r\n\r\nconcentrated  on  attracting  foreign  investors.  We\r\n\r\nshould  continue to do so and make it attractive  for\r\n\r\nforeign investors to operate in Singapore because  it\r\n\r\nis  to our mutual advantage. But I think that at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time it is necessary also to build up the share\r\n\r\nin  our  export  industries which is  controlled  and\r\n\r\nmanaged by local entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Hong Kong with an export economy similar\r\n\r\nto ours will show how far we lag in the participation\r\n\r\nof  local  entrepreneurs in the export  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector. There are reasons, of course, for Hong Kong's\r\n\r\nlead  in  this respect. Firstly they had a  group  of\r\n\r\nrefugee entrepreneurs from China and, secondly,  many\r\n\r\nwith   potential   to   become   professionals    and\r\n\r\nadministrators often found that the only  avenue  for\r\n\r\ntheir  talents  was  for them to start  something  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own.  In the next few years. many of  our  own\r\n\r\nprofessionals who have been working in foreign  owned\r\n\r\nand  managed firms would have had about 10  years  or\r\n\r\nmore  experience in their jobs. A few may be prepared\r\n\r\nto strike out on their own and set up their own small\r\n\r\nmanufacturing operations for export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help them to get established? Government\r\n\r\nshould  study this problem, firstly to  find  out  in\r\n\r\nwhich  areas assistance can be most effectively given\r\n\r\nand  set up a scheme to provide such assistance.  The\r\n\r\nneed  may  be  in  any one of the areas  of  capital.\r\n\r\nintroduction   to  firms  with  technical   know-how,\r\n\r\ntraining of workers, information about markets,  etc.\r\n\r\nI  say  any one of these areas because if a  would-be\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  is  lacking in all or  most  areas,  no\r\n\r\nscheme  can  help him and in fact the use  of  public\r\n\r\nresources in such instances cannot be justified. I am\r\n\r\nafraid that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  success we have had in attracting  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment  this  aspect has been  relegated  to  the\r\n\r\nbackground. I would urge the Ministry of  Finance  to\r\n\r\ngive the subject more consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\non  28th February which was the 11th day of the first\r\n\r\nmonth  of  the  Year of the Snake,  which  was  still\r\n\r\nduring  the New Year season, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nbrought  a  piece  of  good news  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Apart  from  tax  increases  on   liquor,\r\n\r\ntobacco and cigarettes, there have been no new taxes.\r\n\r\nInstead  there  are  four tax concessions.  This  has\r\n\r\nenabled the people of Singapore to enjoy another year\r\n\r\nwithout  painful increases in taxes. This shows  that\r\n\r\nour  Finance Minister is a person whom we can  trust.\r\n\r\nHe  is a man who keeps his words of not raising taxes\r\n\r\nand he has now brought good prospects for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, people are very sensitive and\r\n\r\nalert whenever the Budget is to be presented, because\r\n\r\nany new tax will have immediate effect on the people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  on  that day when the Budget  was  to  be\r\n\r\npresented, the ROV was crowded with people who wanted\r\n\r\nto  pay  their  road  tax or to apply  for  new  road\r\n\r\nlicences.  Some sensitive merchants were also  trying\r\n\r\nto  hoard  tobacco and liquor in order to  make  more\r\n\r\nprofit  before  new  taxes were announced.  All  this\r\n\r\nshows  that the people are quite acquainted with  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary process. They are just\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nlike frightened birds whenever the budget is about to\r\n\r\nbe  presented. They are nervous and worried that  new\r\n\r\ntaxes  will  be imposed. Therefore, the budget  which\r\n\r\nwas  presented by the Minister has been a  relief  to\r\n\r\nthe  people.  This  manner  of  budgetting  with  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the people in mind is laudable  and  will\r\n\r\ngenerally be welcomed by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without doubt the five basic elements of our long\r\n\r\nterm  development strategy for a sustained growth  as\r\n\r\nannounced by the Minister five years ago is realistic\r\n\r\nand  feasible,  It  serves as  a  guideline  for  our\r\n\r\neconomic  development  and  points  the  way  to  our\r\n\r\neconomic  modernisation, We all know that because  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's good economic policy and  strategy,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  been  transformed  from  an  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrading  centre  into  a  productive,  industrialised\r\n\r\ncountry with enough employment opportunities for  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards employment figures. as of June last year\r\n\r\na total of 870,400 people were gainfully employed, an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  4%  over the previous year  1975.  This\r\n\r\nshows  that  we are on the way to economic  recovery,\r\n\r\nand this is very encouraging to all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The organisation responsible for sports\r\n\r\nfacilities and services is the Singapore Sports Council\r\n\r\n(SSC) which receives an annual grant from Government to help\r\n\r\nit finance its activities. The grant extended to SSC comes\r\n\r\nfrom monies collected as general revenue (including\r\n\r\nSingapore Pools) and I consider the present financial\r\n\r\narrangements satisfactory.
