This  is because the  Government  fully\r\n\r\nrealizes  that investment in education is  crucial\r\n\r\nto  economic  and social progress,  and  that  \"no\r\n\r\nsingle factor is more likely to bring about a more\r\n\r\nfair and just society than equal opportunities for\r\n\r\neducation for all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I outline the Government's education\r\n\r\nprogrammes   for  the  future,  let   me   briefly\r\n\r\nsummarize  our past achievements. By  the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, the present Government will have spent\r\n\r\nnearly  $654 million on education since  1959.  In\r\n\r\nreturn  for  this big outlay of public  funds,  we\r\n\r\nhave  built up an education system that has become\r\n\r\nthe envy of many less fortunate countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved universal free primary education\r\n\r\nwithout  making  it compulsory. There  are  enough\r\n\r\nschool places to admit every child aged six  plus,\r\n\r\nnot  only  now  but for many more years  to  come.\r\n\r\nEvery  child of school-going age is assured  of  a\r\n\r\nplace  in a school using the medium of instruction\r\n\r\nof  his  parent's  choice. Once  admitted,  he  is\r\n\r\nassured  of  ten  years of primary  and  secondary\r\n\r\neducation, finishing at the minimum age of 16 with\r\n\r\nat    least   a   Secondary   Vocational    School\r\n\r\nCertificate.  Of  those  who  obtain  the   School\r\n\r\nCertificate, no less than 25 per cent are admitted\r\n\r\nto  Pre-University  classes  to  prepare  for  the\r\n\r\nHigher   School  Certificate  and  entry  to   the\r\n\r\nuniversities and the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our school enrolment has shown spectacular\r\n\r\nincreases.  In the primary schools, the  enrolment\r\n\r\nin  Government  and Government-aided  schools  has\r\n\r\nincreased from 261,000 in 1959 to 360,000 in 1965,\r\n\r\nor  an  increase  of about 38 per cent.  Secondary\r\n\r\nenrolment   has   increased  in   an   even   more\r\n\r\nspectacular  manner, having risen from  44,000  in\r\n\r\n1959  to 113,000 in 1965, that is, an increase  of\r\n\r\n157  per  cent.  We should note with  satisfaction\r\n\r\nthat our total primary and secondary enrolment  of\r\n\r\n473,000 represents about 25 per cent of our entire\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expansion in enrolment has been made\r\n\r\npossible   by   heavy  capital  outlays   on   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of schools. In this year  alone,  15\r\n\r\nnew schools and four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor  extensions  to existing schools  have  been\r\n\r\ncompleted. All in all, the Government has built 72\r\n\r\nnew  schools  of all types, with 1,700  classrooms - excluding special rooms like the teachers' common\r\n\r\nroom,  the school hail, etc. - affording more  than\r\n\r\n125,000   places.   These   schools   have    been\r\n\r\nconstructed at an average rate of one  school  per\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that no child in Singapore\r\n\r\nshall  remain  illiterate on account of  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  free  primary  education  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced for children born in Singapore or whose\r\n\r\nparents are Singapore citizens. In addition, there\r\n\r\nis  provision  for  15 per cent of  the  secondary\r\n\r\nenrolment  to  be free. About 17,000  pupils  have\r\n\r\nbeen  granted free secondary education under  this\r\n\r\nprovision    on   account   of   their   financial\r\n\r\nbackground.  Malays  who  are  Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nenjoyed  special  assistance in  education.  Malay\r\n\r\nchildren have been guaranteed free education  from\r\n\r\nprimary  schools to the University.  All  in  all,\r\n\r\nabout  35,000  Malay  pupils  are  enjoying   free\r\n\r\neducation at all levels. Annually, large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  have  been  allocated for scholarships  and\r\n\r\nbursaries. In this year, the Government has  spent\r\n\r\n$1.6  million  on scholarships and bursaries,  and\r\n\r\nthis  amount  has enabled 40,266 poor students  to\r\n\r\nstudy  in the secondary schools, universities  and\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic. In addition, the Government  has\r\n\r\nalso spent $259,000 in the provision of free \r\n\r\ntext-books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past five years, the Government has\r\n\r\nfulfilled  its objectives with regard  to  primary\r\n\r\neducation.  From  now  onwards,  the  emphasis  on\r\n\r\neducation will be:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the improvement of the quality of education\r\n\r\nat all levels;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the expansion of educational facilities in\r\n\r\nthe secondary and tertiary levels;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) diversification of educational\r\n\r\ndevelopment which is essential for the development\r\n\r\nof an industrial society; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the further development of education for\r\n\r\nnational unity and tolerance in a multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual and multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future building programmes will reflect the\r\n\r\nshift  in the emphasis on priorities in education.\r\n\r\nLess primary schools will be built. It is expected\r\n\r\nthat  by the end of 1966, six primary schools  and\r\n\r\nthree major extensions to existing primary schools\r\n\r\nwill  be  completed. In addition, four dilapidated\r\n\r\nand  sub-standard-sized Malay schools - the  Telok\r\n\r\nKurau  East  School, the Telok Kurau  Malay  Boys'\r\n\r\nSchool,  the  Siglap Malay School  and  the  Pulau\r\n\r\nBukom  Kechil Malay School - will be reconstructed\r\n\r\nand  completed into standard-sized modern  primary\r\n\r\nschools.  Work will also begin on two new  primary\r\n\r\nschools  under the 1966 school building programmes\r\n\r\nin Toa Payoh and MacPherson South Housing Estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of secondary schools will\r\n\r\nreceive special attention next year. In the course\r\n\r\nof  next  year, 13 new secondary schools and  nine\r\n\r\nmajor  extensions  to  existing  schools  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted, thereby providing an additional  36,000\r\n\r\nplaces  for secondary students. Furthermore,  work\r\n\r\non  eight  new  secondary schools under  the  1966\r\n\r\nbuilding programme will commence early next  year.\r\n\r\nThe  building programme next year will ensure that\r\n\r\nevery child who is now in primary school and  with\r\n\r\nthe  eligible qualification will be assured  of  a\r\n\r\nplace in secondary school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Second Development Plan, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will also build a number of  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  to be known as Junior Colleges  specially\r\n\r\nfor   Pre-University  students.  This  will   make\r\n\r\npossible  the  optimum use of teaching  staff  and\r\n\r\nlaboratory  facilities and relieve  the  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  of the pressure for accommodation  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  Secondary IV level. Construction  of  one  of\r\n\r\nthese  Junior  Colleges will commence  early  next\r\n\r\nyear.   The   Junior  Colleges  will  admit   \r\n\r\nPre-University students from all the language streams,\r\n\r\nthereby bringing integration one stage nearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to diversify our education system to\r\n\r\nmeet   the   demand   of   industrialisation   was\r\n\r\nrecognised as early as 1960. Today there are  nine\r\n\r\nsecondary  technical schools  and  nine  secondary\r\n\r\nvocational  schools which can  provide  a  maximum\r\n\r\nenrolment of 18,000 students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   each  type.  However,  in  1965,  only  4,600\r\n\r\nstudents  were in secondary technical schools  and\r\n\r\n8,600 in secondary vocational schools. In 1966  it\r\n\r\nis   expected  that  the  number  of  students  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  technical schools will increase  by  63\r\n\r\nper  cent  to 7,500 and the number of students  in\r\n\r\nsecondary vocational schools will increase  by  34\r\n\r\nper   cent  to  11,500.  The  1965  enrolment   in\r\n\r\nsecondary  technical  and  vocational  schools  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the total secondary  enrolment  of\r\n\r\n113,000 is only 11 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome the traditional prejudice against\r\n\r\ntechnical  and vocational education in  favour  of\r\n\r\nacademic   education,  a  new  feature  has   been\r\n\r\nintroduced in our educational system, namely,  the\r\n\r\nincorporation  of  workshop  facilities  into  the\r\n\r\nsecondary structure and consequent ending  of  the\r\n\r\nseparation of schools into academic, technical and\r\n\r\nvocational  units.  In  fact,  all  new  secondary\r\n\r\nschools in future will have workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emergence of Singapore as an independent\r\n\r\nand   sovereign  State,  the  necessity   to   use\r\n\r\neducation as an instrument to weld national  unity\r\n\r\nand  to  build  a nation out of its  heterogeneous\r\n\r\npopulation has become urgent and unavoidable.  The\r\n\r\nstudy of the National Language will be intensified\r\n\r\nat  all  levels  without, however,  affecting  the\r\n\r\nmedium  of instruction in schools. For some  years\r\n\r\nit  has  been compulsory for students  in  primary\r\n\r\nschools  to  learn a second language. It  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  decided that the study of a second  language\r\n\r\nwill  be  made compulsory in the Secondary school,\r\n\r\nbeginning  with Secondary I in 1966 and continuing\r\n\r\non  to  Secondary  IV in 1969, when  every  school\r\n\r\ncandidate  for the School Certificate  Examination\r\n\r\nwill  be  required to offer a second language.  In\r\n\r\nthis  manner, all school leavers will at least  be\r\n\r\nproficient  in two languages. This policy,  aiming\r\n\r\nat breaking down the language barrier in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  enabling students of one language  stream  to\r\n\r\nappreciate the cultural and linguistic backgrounds\r\n\r\nof  those  in  another language  stream,  will  be\r\n\r\nextended   to  all  our  institutions  of   higher\r\n\r\nlearning.  In  order that the additional  teaching\r\n\r\nload\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not fall on the shoulders of our  existing\r\n\r\ncorps  of  teachers, extra provision  of  language\r\n\r\nteachers will be made. In the meantime, in-service\r\n\r\ncourses  for  existing language teachers  will  be\r\n\r\nintensified  so  as to raise their efficiency  and\r\n\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the expansion in education could not have\r\n\r\nbeen made possible without co-ordinated efforts in\r\n\r\nincreasing the number and quality of teachers.  In\r\n\r\n1960,  full-time teacher-training was replaced  by\r\n\r\npart-time in-service training in order to meet the\r\n\r\nunprecedented  demand in primary  education.  With\r\n\r\nPrimary  I enrolment levelling-off at the rate  of\r\n\r\nabout  60,000 per annum for the last  three  years\r\n\r\nand  a  declining  birth  rate,  the  problem   of\r\n\r\nincreasing supply is now overcome and emphasis  is\r\n\r\nnow  shifted  to  improving  the  quality  of  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  teachers. A positive  step  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken towards qualitative improvement by a gradual\r\n\r\nreversion   to   full-time  training.   A   second\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College will be built under the\r\n\r\nSecond  Development  Plan to  take  in  fee-paying\r\n\r\nstudents   on   a   full-time  basis.   With   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  this new College,  it  will  be\r\n\r\npossible  for  the  existing  College  to  make  a\r\n\r\ngradual  reduction in the annual intake  of \r\n\r\npart-time  trainees  and  to start  full-time  training\r\n\r\ncourses of its own. Eventually, both Colleges will\r\n\r\nhave only full-time students for regular training,\r\n\r\nand  more  attention can be devoted to  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses  for  qualified teachers. The  anticipated\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the quality of training  will,  in\r\n\r\nthe years to come, be reflected in the quality  of\r\n\r\nteaching throughout our schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum and the intensity of training\r\n\r\nwill,  by and large, be similar to the present  \r\n\r\n3-year  in-service training course but crammed  into\r\n\r\ntwo  years  of full-time training. On  graduation,\r\n\r\nthey  will  become qualified teachers drawing  the\r\n\r\nsame   salary  as  the  3-year  in-service  course\r\n\r\nteachers.  The anxiety expressed by the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTeachers' Union of a multiplicity of salary scales\r\n\r\nand  more  favoured treatment for these  full-time\r\n\r\nstudents will not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the regular school system, vocational\r\n\r\ntraining  will  be  greatly  expanded.  Additional\r\n\r\ntraining  facilities  at the Singapore  Vocational\r\n\r\nInstitute, at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  cost of $1.65 million, are in the process  of\r\n\r\nconstruction.  When completed  by  the  middle  of\r\n\r\n1966,  the  enrolment capacity will increase  from\r\n\r\nthe  present 1,200 to 2,500. In addition, two  new\r\n\r\nvocational  institutes will  be  built  under  the\r\n\r\nSecond Development Plan, one providing courses  in\r\n\r\nthe   manual  and  applied  arts,  the  other   in\r\n\r\nengineering  and  building.  When  completed,  the\r\n\r\nthree institutes together will be able to take  in\r\n\r\nabout  6,500  students, including a proportion  of\r\n\r\nthose   with   the  Secondary  Vocational   School\r\n\r\nCertificate,   for  training  to  become   skilled\r\n\r\ncraftsmen  to  meet the demand  of  our  expanding\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a higher level of technical training, the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  has  finalised arrangements  for  its\r\n\r\ngraduates in Engineering, Building and Accountancy\r\n\r\nto   he  awarded  degrees  by  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  long-term  plans  of   expansion\r\n\r\nenvisaged moving the Polytechnic to a new site  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  into  two  separate  units  -  a  College\r\n\r\nproviding training at Technician Diploma level and\r\n\r\nan   Institute  of  Advanced  Technology  awarding\r\n\r\nDegrees  of  its  own. With the  establishment  of\r\n\r\nthese  institutions, it is expected that Singapore\r\n\r\nwill   become   a   centre   for   technical   and\r\n\r\ntechnological education in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, more attention will be\r\n\r\npaid  to  integrating our higher  institutions  of\r\n\r\nlearning into the national community so that  they\r\n\r\nwill   the   better  serve  society.  Universities\r\n\r\nrepresent the apex of the educational system in  a\r\n\r\ncountry.  They  have an essential and  influential\r\n\r\nrole in society, and the quality and character  of\r\n\r\nthe  universities  are  bound  to  have  important\r\n\r\nimpacts  on  the social, economic,  and  political\r\n\r\nlife  of  a  country. The role  and  character  of\r\n\r\nuniversities have varied from place to  place  and\r\n\r\nfrom time to time. Universities are simultaneously\r\n\r\nconservative   and  progressive  \r\n\r\ninstitutions - conservative  in the sense that they preserve  the\r\n\r\nbest  in the culture of a society, and progressive\r\n\r\nin  the  sense that they introduce new ideas,  new\r\n\r\ndiscoveries, and new inventions, usually  for  the\r\n\r\nbetterment of society. As institutions  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning, universities throughout the world  share\r\n\r\ncertain  common  functions, but they  differ  also\r\n\r\nbecause they have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncater for the different needs of the societies for\r\n\r\nwhich  they  purport to serve. It is obvious  that\r\n\r\nuniversities in homogeneous societies with a \r\n\r\nwell-developed  sense  of national  identity  have  one\r\n\r\nimportant   difference  in  role  to   play   from\r\n\r\nuniversities in newly independent countries  faced\r\n\r\nwith  the  problems of building national  identity\r\n\r\nout  of a heterogeneous population. Problems, too,\r\n\r\ndiffer   from  one  newly  emergent  heterogeneous\r\n\r\ncountry  to  another. Thus, most  of  the  African\r\n\r\ncountries  are  beset by the problem  of  building\r\n\r\nnational identities out of diverse tribes, divided\r\n\r\nby a multiplicity of local dialects, loyalties and\r\n\r\ncustoms. In Singapore, where we are thrown by  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of  history and  geography  on  the\r\n\r\ncrossroads   of   trade  and  cultures,   we   are\r\n\r\nconfronted by the immeasurably greater problem  of\r\n\r\nfostering  a  national identity out  of  competing\r\n\r\ncultures - cultures  which  have  an  inherent\r\n\r\nvitality   of  their  own.  The  hard   facts   of\r\n\r\ngeography,  history, and demography in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia  have forced upon us the realisation that  we\r\n\r\ncannot build our distinctive national identity  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  one  race, one religion,  and  one\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Our  brief experience in  Malaysia  has\r\n\r\ndriven the lesson home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of history that our universities\r\n\r\nwere  founded in different circumstances,  without\r\n\r\ncareful thought as to the burning problems imposed\r\n\r\nupon   us   by  the  complex  character   of   our\r\n\r\npopulation.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  let  me  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture  quote  certain extracts  from  the  much\r\n\r\npublicised  Nanyang University  Curriculum  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee, a document more popularly known as  the\r\n\r\nWang Gung-Wu Report, and named after its Chairman,\r\n\r\nProfessor   Wang   Gung-Wu,   a   local   scholar,\r\n\r\ninternationally  known  for  his  scholarship  and\r\n\r\nlinguistic  proficiency in English,  Chinese,  and\r\n\r\nMalay. Parts of this report run as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...there is an urgent need for people with a\r\n\r\ndeep,  rational  and sympathetic understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe   multi-racial  basis  of  the  country.   The\r\n\r\nUniversity should produce graduates able to  guide\r\n\r\nthe  course  of  the  country's  development,  and\r\n\r\ntrained  to  administer the  public  services  and\r\n\r\nmanage  the  growth of commerce and industry,  and\r\n\r\nspecially equipped to meet the nation's  need  for\r\n\r\nrapid modernisation . . . It should be the aim  of\r\n\r\nthe University to produce graduates who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  at  least bi-lingual, if not tri-lingual,  in\r\n\r\nthe  languages relevant to the development of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  The University cannot depend on  outside\r\n\r\nteaching  staff for an indefinite period of  time.\r\n\r\nThere must he every opportunity for the employment\r\n\r\nof young but highly qualified local graduates with\r\n\r\na  deep  understanding of the  conditions  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  In this way, the University will play  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly valuable role in the service  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the extracts I have just cited\r\n\r\nwere  written in the context of Malaysia and  with\r\n\r\nreference  to  Nanyang University. But  the  views\r\n\r\nexpressed   are   also  valid   for   multi-racial\r\n\r\nSingapore and for the University of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  both  Nanyang  University  and  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore must reflect the character\r\n\r\nof the society which they serve. But the character\r\n\r\nand  the dimensions of the problems differ.  These\r\n\r\narise  from  the fact that in one university,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of university reforms has been  wilfully\r\n\r\nturned  by anti-national elements into a political\r\n\r\nissue  on  the preservation of Chinese  education,\r\n\r\nwhile in the other the problem is one of adjusting\r\n\r\nthe  university  to the realities  of  society  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Nanyang University, the University of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not faced with major re-organisation\r\n\r\nto  bring  it  up  to the requirements  of  modern\r\n\r\nuniversity  education.  Internationally,   it   is\r\n\r\nrecognised  as  an institution of higher  learning\r\n\r\nwith  a  reputation  for scholarship  because  its\r\n\r\nstandard  of scholarship and teaching can  measure\r\n\r\nup  to  international standards. Its international\r\n\r\nreputation   is  likely  to  increase   with   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of its development programme.  This\r\n\r\nexpansion  programme includes two  new  faculties,\r\n\r\nnamely,  a Faculty of Technology and a Faculty  of\r\n\r\nSocial Sciences. It also includes an Institute  of\r\n\r\nMedical  Specialties, a Science  Tower,  which  is\r\n\r\nabout  to be completed, an animal farm to  provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  for teaching and research,  extensions\r\n\r\nto the Medical Faculty and new library facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the University of Singapore, there\r\n\r\nis  no problem of raising standards. However,  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  shares one common defect with  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. This concerns the sensitivity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  universities to the  character  of  their\r\n\r\nenvironment, and the political and social  changes\r\n\r\noccurring therein. To begin with the University of\r\n\r\nSingapore, this institution has been somewhat slow\r\n\r\nin  its  responses. Nevertheless, it has begun  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  more  realistic view of  things.  It  has\r\n\r\nadmitted for some years already students from  the\r\n\r\nChinese-medium stream and from Nanyang University.\r\n\r\nThe  indications are that its response  to  social\r\n\r\nchanges and needs will he quickened, for there  is\r\n\r\na growing national consciousness in the university\r\n\r\nas  more  and more local staff are recruited  into\r\n\r\nthe  university. In fact, about a  year  ago,  the\r\n\r\nlocal  staff, with a few notable exceptions,  have\r\n\r\norganised themselves into an association dedicated\r\n\r\nto making the University of Singapore into a truly\r\n\r\nnational  institution, reflecting  the  needs  and\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  our  society,  without  sacrificing\r\n\r\ninternational  standards. They  demanded  a  local\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor to head the University, and  their\r\n\r\ndemand  was  met. In the University of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nsteps  have already been taken to revive the Malay\r\n\r\nStudies  Department, and to strengthen the Chinese\r\n\r\nStudies  Department in order to take  in  students\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Chinese  stream.  The  Chinese  Studies\r\n\r\nDepartment has already existed for about a decade,\r\n\r\nbut  it  has failed to measure up to expectations.\r\n\r\nObviously,  a  radical  re-organisation   of   the\r\n\r\nDepartment is necessary. But more has still to  he\r\n\r\ndone  to  ensure that facilities for the study  of\r\n\r\nlanguages  will he made available to all  students\r\n\r\nin  the University. In a multi-racial society, the\r\n\r\nintelligentsia has not only to be multi-lingual in\r\n\r\norder  to  play an effective role in all walks  of\r\n\r\nlife,  but  bi-lingual  and tri-lingual  graduates\r\n\r\nhave  better chances in the competition  for  jobs\r\n\r\nand promotions. Even in the field of researches in\r\n\r\nthe  arts  and social sciences, the bi-lingual  or\r\n\r\ntrilingual academic men have advantages over their\r\n\r\nmono-lingual rivals both in the scope and depth of\r\n\r\ntheir  work.  It is pertinent to observe  that  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of Western  Universities  have\r\n\r\nintroduced the study of Asian languages  and  have\r\n\r\nrequired  that  their  post-graduate  students  on\r\n\r\nAsian  studies  should have proficiency  in  these\r\n\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set out to build Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  a  model  multi-racial,  multi-lingual,  and\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural  society in this region  of \r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia.  The contribution that the  University\r\n\r\ncan make towards helping the Government to achieve\r\n\r\nthis  end  is immense. This is a challenging  task\r\n\r\nwhich  I think the University can fulfil,  with  a\r\n\r\nqualitative change in its orientation as more  and\r\n\r\nmore  local staff with a national outlook come  to\r\n\r\ncontrol the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of reforms in Nanyang University is\r\n\r\none  of  great  magnitude,  because  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements   have   turned  the   efforts   of  \r\n\r\nre-organisation  into a political  issue  on  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture.  Before  I  proceed,  let  me  repeat  in\r\n\r\nParliament  what  the Government and  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  authorities have categorically  stated\r\n\r\nso  many  times  in  the past and  also  recently,\r\n\r\nnamely, that Chinese shall continue to be the main\r\n\r\nlanguage  medium  of instruction  even  after \r\n\r\nre-organisation. The objective of re-organisation  is\r\n\r\nto  turn Nanyang University into an institution of\r\n\r\nhigher learning consonant with the needs of modern\r\n\r\nuniversity  education in a heterogeneous  society.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a necessary step in order to fulfil  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's educational policy of equal treatment\r\n\r\nfor  four  languages - Malay, Chinese, Tamil,  and\r\n\r\nEnglish.  Let me repeat the main features  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy on languages.  Malay  is  the\r\n\r\nnational  language.  The  official  languages  are\r\n\r\nMalay,  Chinese, Tamil, and English. In education,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no discrimination against any of  these\r\n\r\nlanguages. All four language streams of  education\r\n\r\nhave been accorded equal treatment. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  not  only  been giving full  grant-in-aid  to\r\n\r\naided Chinese schools, but has also actively built\r\n\r\nschools  for  the Chinese language streams.  There\r\n\r\nwere  only nine Government Chinese medium  schools\r\n\r\nbefore  June  1959.  Today,  there  are  60   such\r\n\r\nschools, 28 of which are secondary schools and  32\r\n\r\nare  primary  schools. This has  made  possible  a\r\n\r\nmajor  increase  in  the enrolment  in  Government\r\n\r\nChinese medium schools. In 1959, the year in which\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. became the Government of Singapore, the\r\n\r\nenrolment  in Government Chinese schools  amounted\r\n\r\nto only 6,500. Today, the enrolment is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  35,000,  or an increase of nearly  540  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  enrolment  within six  years.  All  this\r\n\r\nincrease  and  future increases mean that  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  has to be re-organised so  that  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  the  necessary qualifications  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a proper university education that is their\r\n\r\ndue.   Re-organisation  means   better   qualified\r\n\r\nteachers for the Chinese-medium schools, with  the\r\n\r\nresult that the quality of Chinese education  will\r\n\r\nbe  improved. It also means that Nanyang graduates\r\n\r\nwill  have the necessary qualifications to compete\r\n\r\nfor   other  jobs.  The  best  of  them  will   be\r\n\r\nacceptable   to   do   post-graduate    work    in\r\n\r\nuniversities  abroad, with improved prospects  for\r\n\r\neven  better  and  more lucrative jobs,  including\r\n\r\nemployment in Nanyang University itself, when they\r\n\r\nreturn with post-graduate degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, Sir, the re-organisation of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity will benefit Chinese education  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels  as  well as open up new opportunities  for\r\n\r\nNanyang   graduates.  Each  and  every  individual\r\n\r\ngraduate will gain by these changes; society  will\r\n\r\nalso  gain by them. For there is a great  deal  of\r\n\r\ntalent  in the Chinese stream which has never  had\r\n\r\nthe   opportunity  for  development  because   the\r\n\r\neducation  system has not been adequately  staffed\r\n\r\nand,  at  university level, properly organised  to\r\n\r\ngive it full opportunity for development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real question which the nation has to face is\r\n\r\nwhether Nanyang University is to be allowed to  be\r\n\r\nre-organised  quietly  and  peacefully   so   that\r\n\r\nChinese education will improve in quality  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels   within  the  context  of  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nnation, and Nanyang graduates will be in an  equal\r\n\r\nposition  to compete for jobs and play a  positive\r\n\r\nrole in the life of a multi-cultural society. This\r\n\r\nis  the real issue which all those who profess  to\r\n\r\nlove Chinese education must face. The issue is not\r\n\r\nthe   preservation  or  destruction   of   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. Unfortunately, the Barisan Sosialis and\r\n\r\nother  pro-Communist organisations  have  confused\r\n\r\nthe  real  issue and presented the re-organisation\r\n\r\nas  an attempt to kill Chinese education and  turn\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  into an  English  University.\r\n\r\nBefore  I  explain how the anti-national Communist\r\n\r\nelements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstirred up a campaign against re-organisation, let\r\n\r\nme  briefly explain what they hoped to gain by it.\r\n\r\nSince  1961,  the fortunes of the Communist  Party\r\n\r\nand  its  front  organisations, like  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, have gone from bad to worse. By fighting\r\n\r\nagainst  merger and Malaysia, by getting  involved\r\n\r\nwith  the Brunei revolt and the P.K.I., they  have\r\n\r\nexposed  themselves before the  public.  There  is\r\n\r\nhardly any major issue left in Singapore for  them\r\n\r\nto  exploit  except communalism.  And  it  is  not\r\n\r\nimpossible   to  stir  up  Chinese   feelings   on\r\n\r\nquestions  of Chinese education, with  unavoidable\r\n\r\nincrease in communal feelings between the  Chinese\r\n\r\nand other cultural groups. The re-organisation  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  presents  for  the Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nsupporters an Opportunity to stir up trouble.  But\r\n\r\nthe re-organisation of Nanyang University presents\r\n\r\nto  them more than just an opportunity to stir  up\r\n\r\ncommunal  feelings; it is also a threat  to  their\r\n\r\nsources  of  supply of new recruits. With  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   re-organised,   and   its   graduates\r\n\r\nequipped for better jobs and a meaningful role  in\r\n\r\nour  society, their sources of supply will dry up.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  it  will no longer be  possible  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  make  use  of  Chinese  education  as  a\r\n\r\npolitical issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons then, the re-organisation of\r\n\r\nNanyang University has falsely been presented as a\r\n\r\nmove  to kill Chinese education. Unfortunately,  a\r\n\r\nnumber of errors in the Chinese translation of the\r\n\r\nReport  had been mischievously exploited  to  lend\r\n\r\ncredence   to   their  distortion   that   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  was  to be converted into  an  English\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Under the pretext of the preservation\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  education, a group  of  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nstudents  carried out a boycott  of  classes.  The\r\n\r\nboycott  is a familiar technique employed  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  when  they  stir  up  trouble  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  educational stream. It involves violence,\r\n\r\nintimidation, and even arson, in the present case,\r\n\r\nthe   agitators  resorted  to  physical   violence\r\n\r\nagainst   the  Acting  Vice-Chancellor  and   some\r\n\r\nmembers of the academic and non-academic staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They intimidated and forcibly prevented students\r\n\r\nfrom  attending classes. They committed  vandalism\r\n\r\nby  tampering with the locks of lecture rooms, and\r\n\r\ndefacing  all the University buildings except  the\r\n\r\nlibrary.  They even tried to burn down a dormitory\r\n\r\nblock.  It  is  estimated that it  will  cost  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  taxpayer some $100,000 to renovate  and\r\n\r\nrepair   the   damages  done  to  the   University\r\n\r\nbuildings.  It  will be noted that these  criminal\r\n\r\nand  destructive acts had been perpetrated against\r\n\r\nNanyang  University - itself a  symbol  of  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation and culture - by people who professed to\r\n\r\npreserve  Chinese  education and  language.  Their\r\n\r\nactions  only served to prove their hypocrisy.  In\r\n\r\ntheir   campaign  of  vandalism  and  boycott   of\r\n\r\nclasses,  the  agitators  were  openly  aided  and\r\n\r\nabetted   by   the   usual   pro-Communist   front\r\n\r\norganisations, the Barisan Sosialis, the Old Boys'\r\n\r\nAssociations, and some trade unions. Unfortunately\r\n\r\nfor  them, the public was not convinced  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   was   anti-Chinese   education    and\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Without  public  support,  the  boycott\r\n\r\ncollapsed ignominously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University authorities have taken\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  action against 85 students  involved\r\n\r\nin  the agitations. Nearly half of them came  from\r\n\r\nthe   Federation.  It  would  appear   that   many\r\n\r\nFederation  students find the relative  liberalism\r\n\r\nand  freedom in Singapore a convenient  place  for\r\n\r\nthem  to manifest their suppressed grievances  and\r\n\r\nfrustrations  over the years in  their  home  town\r\n\r\nwhere  the  cry  was and still is \"One  race,  one\r\n\r\nlanguage, and one religion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to point out that with separation\r\n\r\nthese  students  are now in the  territory  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent  country, which has not  only  allowed\r\n\r\nthem  to  pursue their studies here but  has  also\r\n\r\nsubsidised their studies at Nanyang University  at\r\n\r\npublic   expense,  an  educational  responsibility\r\n\r\nwhich   their   own  Government  has  consistently\r\n\r\nrefused  to  shoulder. We are  quite  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  allowing them to come  here  for  higher\r\n\r\neducation,  and  even subsidise their  studies  at\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, for, despite  separation,  we\r\n\r\nare  still one people. But the Government  expects\r\n\r\nthem to observe the laws of the country and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscipline  of the University while  they  are  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  would be a pity if the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  to  send them back to the Federation half-way\r\n\r\nthrough   their  studies  -  a  step   which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment would be reluctant to take.  They  have\r\n\r\nchosen  the  wrong battleground to fight  for  the\r\n\r\npreservation  of Chinese language, education,  and\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since re-organisation began in Nan-yang last\r\n\r\nJuly,  the  Government has donated  a  sum  of  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  for  a new Library Building. Construction\r\n\r\nwork  on  the  Library  has  begun,  and  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  by about July 1966. Another $1  million\r\n\r\nhas   also  been  granted  for  the  purchase   of\r\n\r\nscientific equipment and library books. To  enable\r\n\r\nthe  University to lower the fees for students who\r\n\r\nare  Singapore citizens, Government subsidised the\r\n\r\nUniversity  to the extent of $81,000 in  1964  and\r\n\r\n$137,000 in 1965. In addition, it is expected that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will  have  advanced,  since  \r\n\r\nre-organisation,  a  total of $1.86  million  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity by the end of this year to make up  the\r\n\r\ndeficit  in recurrent expenditure. As further \r\n\r\nre-organisation takes place, Government will increase\r\n\r\nits  financial  assistance to the  University  for\r\n\r\nboth    recurrent    expenditure    and    capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment, so that the University may develop on\r\n\r\na  sound financial footing into an institution  of\r\n\r\nhigh   academic  standing,  free  from  subversive\r\n\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of adult education, the Lembaga\r\n\r\nGerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, now in its sixth year of\r\n\r\nexistence, continues to provide a valuable service\r\n\r\nnot   only  towards  eradicating  illiteracy   and\r\n\r\nraising   standards  of  education  among  adults,\r\n\r\nincluding the provision of facilities for learning\r\n\r\na  second  or  third  language for  those  already\r\n\r\nproficient in one, the running of academic classes\r\n\r\nup  to and including pre-university education, and\r\n\r\nconducting   vocational  classes,  but   also   in\r\n\r\nwidening  the outlook of the citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nby providing extra-mural courses to enable them to\r\n\r\nmake  more fruitful use of their leisure time.  In\r\n\r\n1960,  the  total student population  was  20,000.\r\n\r\nThis year it has increased to 50,000. To cope with\r\n\r\nthe expansion of activities in this field, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  Adult Education Centre will be built  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment under the Second Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have set out some of the\r\n\r\nproblems connected with education we have to face,\r\n\r\nand   certain  targets  to  be  achieved  in   the\r\n\r\nimmediate future. However, the efforts to  achieve\r\n\r\nthese targets would be hampered should there be an\r\n\r\ninflux  of  children  of  school-going  age   from\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore.  As  the  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nexplained  to this House a few days ago,  when  he\r\n\r\nmoved  a  Motion of Thanks to the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara for his Speech, `In the short-term, we have\r\n\r\nhad  to  introduce certain new measures  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  take stock of what our  liabilities\r\n\r\nare,  our immediate liability to give jobs to  our\r\n\r\nown... citizens, provide schools for their children,\r\n\r\nhospitals  and social community services,  housing\r\n\r\nand  so  on.' To this end, we have taken steps  to\r\n\r\ntighten  rules governing admission to schools  and\r\n\r\nto  revise school fees for non-Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nby  requiring them to pay for the actual  cost  of\r\n\r\neducation. It is a well-known fact that  education\r\n\r\nis   taking   up  a  substantial  and   increasing\r\n\r\nproportion of the annual budget of Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  children  born outside  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwhose  parents are not Singapore citizens admitted\r\n\r\nto  schools in Singapore has been on the  increase\r\n\r\neach  year  from  874 in 1960 to  2,026  in  1965.\r\n\r\nAlready  in 1965, the Government had to  subsidise\r\n\r\nnearly $1.4 million on these children who are  not\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens. Obviously, it is  unfair  for\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore to pay for the failure  of\r\n\r\nanother Government to provide for the education of\r\n\r\nits citizens to the extent of ultimately affecting\r\n\r\nour ability to cater for the educational needs  of\r\n\r\nour   own   citizens.  Nevertheless,  the  special\r\n\r\nrelationship  between the people of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthose   of   Malaysia   has   been   taken    into\r\n\r\nconsideration  by the fact that children  of \r\n\r\nnon-Singapore citizens who are in Singapore  with  the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the Singapore Government or who are\r\n\r\npermanent residents of Singapore on or before 31st\r\n\r\nDecember,  1961,  will  not  be  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nincrease in school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfees.  This concession, in practice, will  benefit\r\n\r\nmany Malaysian citizens now in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his address to this House a few days ago, the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah has referred to anomalies in\r\n\r\nthe  salary  structure of the teaching service.  I\r\n\r\nmust  point  out that the multiplicity  of  salary\r\n\r\nscales  and  the complexities of problems  arising\r\n\r\ntherefrom  are not the makings of this Government.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Bras Basah is aware of the complex\r\n\r\nnature of the problem and, because any revision in\r\n\r\nthe salary structure for teachers will have direct\r\n\r\nrepercussions   on   the   other   services,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  decided  to  appoint  a  Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission to review the salary structure  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  services as a whole jointly  with  the\r\n\r\nthen  Federal Government. Since then we have  been\r\n\r\nnotified  that we are no longer a Member  of  this\r\n\r\nJoint  Salaries  Commission, and,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  now  decided  to  appoint  a  new\r\n\r\nSalaries Commission of our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as anxious as the Member for Bras Basah to\r\n\r\nsettle   the  long-standing  issues  as  soon   as\r\n\r\npossible  because, as the Member has pointed  out,\r\n\r\ndissatisfied teachers cannot give of  their  best.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is heartening to note that the problem\r\n\r\nis   one   of  rationalisation  of  the   existing\r\n\r\nmultiplicity  of  salary scales  in  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice  and  not a question of under-remuneration\r\n\r\nfor service performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein raised certain problems\r\n\r\nregarding Tamil education at secondary level. I am\r\n\r\naware   of  the  problems  that  she  has   posed,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  respect of shortage  of  qualified\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  teachers as well  as  qualified\r\n\r\nteacher-educators   in  the   Teachers'   Training\r\n\r\nCollege.   I  shall  certainly  look  into   these\r\n\r\nproblems,  including the desirability  of  sending\r\n\r\nstudents to India for higher studies with  a  view\r\n\r\nto  subsequent  service in our secondary  schools,\r\n\r\nand  the feasibility of recruiting qualified Tamil\r\n\r\nsecondary school teachers from India on short-term\r\n\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I wish to associate myself with my\r\n\r\ncolleagues in expressing my thanks to the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara for his speech on 8th December. In\r\n\r\nhis speech in this Assembly, His Excellency said\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is undergoing a new history because\r\n\r\nSingapore is now an independent and sovereign\r\n\r\nState. Now that Singapore has obtained its\r\n\r\nindependence, we can show to the world that the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore can live in peace and\r\n\r\nprosperity in a multi-racial, multi-lingual, \r\n\r\nmulti-religious and multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while we are making every effort to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  our  newly  independent  and  sovereign\r\n\r\ncountry,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  chosen  to\r\n\r\nboycott  this  Assembly on the  pretext  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government  is not democratic.  But,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  you know that the Barisan Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nno  more  life  in the independent  and  sovereign\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore. The reason why  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have boycotted this Assembly is that they\r\n\r\nare  now  in a precarious position. We have  proof\r\n\r\nthat  the  leaders  of  the Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nquarrelling among themselves on ideologies. As you\r\n\r\nknow,   the  Rightist  Secretary-General  of   the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis is receiving medical attention at\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Hospital. A number of their leaders are\r\n\r\nin  an uncertain position. If the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare still in Singapore, they will definitely be in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber  to  argue in the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. They were elected to this Assembly by  the\r\n\r\npeople,  but they were unable to give their  views\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of the people. You  may  perhaps\r\n\r\nremember, Mr Speaker, the time when the  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis gave a speech  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  which lasted seven hours. He thought  he\r\n\r\nwas a champion fighting for the rights of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people.  But now not even one Member  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  is  seen here.  One  point  can\r\n\r\nclarify  this.  If  I  am  not  mistaken,  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly on Friday, there was a Question for  Oral\r\n\r\nAnswer  put  up  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  This\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  workers in a Bee-boon  company  who\r\n\r\nlost   their  jobs  where  the  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nthemselves were the leaders of the workers there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not only the people who have\r\n\r\nlost  faith in the Barisan Sosialis. Many  workers\r\n\r\nat one time had faith that the Barisan Sosialis is\r\n\r\na Party that can lead the people, but they finally\r\n\r\nrealised  that  they had been led  up  the  garden\r\n\r\npath.  Many  workers have lost employment  because\r\n\r\nthey  have been led astray. Many of the firms  had\r\n\r\nto  dismiss their workers and close down. This  is\r\n\r\nall  because of the Barisan Sosialis who  led  the\r\n\r\npro-Communist unions. Many workers' unions,  which\r\n\r\nwere formerly with the Barisan Sosialis, have  now\r\n\r\nwithdrawn   their  membership  and   have   joined\r\n\r\nnational  unions  which are  affiliated  with  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.  This  is  a  clear indication  that  the\r\n\r\ninfluence of the Barisan Sosialis in the  Assembly\r\n\r\ntoday is dwindling. It is not because Singapore is\r\n\r\nno  longer enjoying democracy but because  of  the\r\n\r\nrealisation  by  the  people  in  regard  to   the\r\n\r\nleadership of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to stress in this House what\r\n\r\nI  have  said just now. Singapore is undergoing  a\r\n\r\nnew  phase in its history. The manner in which she\r\n\r\nwas  forced to receive its independence  fills  us\r\n\r\nwith  a  feeling of sadness. If we were to compare\r\n\r\nSingapore with other countries which have achieved\r\n\r\ntheir independence, we will see that they received\r\n\r\ntheir independence with joy. Even the independence\r\n\r\nachieved  by  the Ian Smith's faction in  Rhodesia\r\n\r\nwas a source of joy to the people of that faction.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand, we received our independence\r\n\r\nwith  sadness because of the doings of the  people\r\n\r\non the other side of the Causeway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read in the papers, particularly the\r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu, that the Malays in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ndowntrodden. The Utusan Melayu very often gives  a\r\n\r\nwrong picture of the true situation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Malays in Singapore. On the other hand, if  we\r\n\r\ndeeply  study the true position, it  can  be  said\r\n\r\nthat  a  great number of people in Singapore  have\r\n\r\nconnections with people in Malaysia who  are  well\r\n\r\naware of the conditions of the people here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to those who allege that there is no\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in Singapore and that the  Malays  here\r\n\r\nare  oppressed,  I  would like  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore is very much  practising\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and  is giving freedom  to  all  races,\r\n\r\nlanguages  and  religions. The Head  of  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  Malay. The Chief  Justice  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese.  And  the  Speaker of this  House  is  an\r\n\r\nIndian. Here, we can see for ourselves that only a\r\n\r\ntolerant  multi-racial  and multi-lingual  society\r\n\r\ncan  bring about this state of affairs. It is this\r\n\r\nsort of society that we must have in order to live\r\n\r\nhappily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the efforts of the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  appear  to  be  directed  against  the\r\n\r\nharmonious  living  together of  the  people.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in the Utusan Melayu of Saturday,  11th\r\n\r\nDecember, Tun Razak in a speech likened the speech\r\n\r\nof  His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to\r\n\r\nthat  of  playing an old film. But  the  new  film\r\n\r\nwhich  will be screened in 1969 was not stated  in\r\n\r\nthat  paper. Mr Speaker, Sir, when old films  are\r\n\r\nre-screened in the same theatre, it means that the\r\n\r\nfilm  is  popular and liked by many. That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  it is re-screened. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nproof  that  that old film was a  film  which  was\r\n\r\npopular.  The shorts of the new film were screened\r\n\r\nin  Ayer  Hitam  in Penang, and  Rahang  in  Negri\r\n\r\nSembilan,  to  attract the people of  Malaysia  in\r\n\r\n1969. This is a new picture, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory serves me right, in 1962 the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government stopped the import of poultry\r\n\r\nand  pigs into Singapore. That was one way to stop\r\n\r\nthe  prosperity of Singapore. But,  on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  because we wish to live, we have to find  a\r\n\r\nway to bring about a better standard of living for\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. We in turn have to  stop\r\n\r\nthe import of their vegetables into Singapore. But\r\n\r\nthis    was   later   discontinued.   All    these\r\n\r\nrestrictions were not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the people of Singapore. If the\r\n\r\npeople  on  the  other side of the  Causeway  were\r\n\r\nshouting  about the oppression of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  particularly the  Malays,  then  these\r\n\r\nrestrictions  which  they  had  imposed  and  were\r\n\r\nagainst  that ideal would further create  distress\r\n\r\nand  difficulties  for  the Malays  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause 90 per cent of the Malays in Singapore are\r\n\r\nwage  earners. If these restrictions were imposed,\r\n\r\nthen  it is the Malays in Singapore who would feel\r\n\r\nthe pinch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we wish to resume barter trade with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  in  order  to  bring  about  a   better\r\n\r\nstandard  of living in Singapore, particularly  to\r\n\r\nthat community of wage earners. But the Government\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia objected to that wish on  the  ground\r\n\r\nthat  it would be against their defence interests.\r\n\r\nHowever,  that  was part of our  effort  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a better standard of living for our people,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Malays. If the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\nstill  continues with that attitude, it will  mean\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not  only not  giving  their\r\n\r\nco-operation   to   the  people  of  Singapore,   but\r\n\r\nindirectly oppressing the Malays of whom  a  great\r\n\r\nmajority  are poor. If they truly wish  to  be  of\r\n\r\nassistance  to the Malays here, then  they  should\r\n\r\nnot  continue to object, because by so  doing  the\r\n\r\nfat  people  will grow fatter and the thin  people\r\n\r\nwill  grow  thinner,  as  what  has  happened   in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, the true\r\n\r\npicture has been misrepresented by the leaders  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  who, through the ultras in  their  midst\r\n\r\nand through the Utusan Melayu, say that the Malays\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  are oppressed and are not  enjoying\r\n\r\nlife. Why I say that the Utusan Melayu is behaving\r\n\r\nthat  way  is  this. There was an article  by  its\r\n\r\ncorrespondent   on   the  16th   December,   1965,\r\n\r\nregarding  the  speech of the Member  for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai, when he referred to Tun Razak's comments on\r\n\r\nthe  speech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  As\r\n\r\nreported in the Hansard of the 14th December,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai continued with his speech\r\n\r\nand  mentioned what had happened in Rahang.  Here,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  that what actually was said  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  misreported in the paper. Thus we can see how\r\n\r\nthe  true  position of the Malays in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nmisrepresented  in  the Malay  paper,  the  Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our effort to build an independent\r\n\r\nsovereign  nation  and  a harmonious  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the  peoples of various races,  religions\r\n\r\nand  cultures  is being countered  by  efforts  to\r\n\r\ndestroy it. We have clarified our efforts to unite\r\n\r\nthe people of various races, and the acceptance of\r\n\r\nMalay  as  the  national language  has  been  well\r\n\r\nreceived by all sections of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  recently  when  the Government  launched  its\r\n\r\nNational Language Month campaign, Ahmad Haji  Taff\r\n\r\nof  U.M.N.O. is reported in the newspaper  Berita\r\n\r\nMingguan  to  have stated that U.M.N.O.  Singapore\r\n\r\nsupported   the   National  Language   Month   and\r\n\r\nsupported the Government's campaign. But, in fact,\r\n\r\nnot  a  single programme was supported by U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nIt  is  difficult  to see how they  supported  the\r\n\r\ncampaign. This is something insincere as Malay has\r\n\r\nbeen accepted by all sectors of the people as  the\r\n\r\nnational language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

I  would rather try to present a  general\r\n\r\npicture  of  the new situation in which  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas found itself since we separated from Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are standard textbooks which military\r\n\r\nstrategists,  Ministers of  Defence  and  aspiring\r\n\r\npolitical   leaders  read  in  order  to   improve\r\n\r\nthemselves and widen their knowledge in the course\r\n\r\nof  their having to administer the affairs of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  One, of course, is the Western  standard\r\n\r\ntextbook by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClausewitz on The Art of War. But there is a  much\r\n\r\nmore  interesting text-book which relates  to  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of the Three Kingdoms in Chinese history.\r\n\r\nThe  Three Kingdoms are the Wei Kingdom,  the  Chu\r\n\r\nKingdom  and  the Wu Kingdom. It is a  history  of\r\n\r\nthree  territories seeking to survive, each trying\r\n\r\nto  preserve  its  integrity and sovereignty,  how\r\n\r\nmuch    political   guile   and    strategy    and\r\n\r\nresourcefulness were shown by their generals;  but\r\n\r\nin  the  end,  unfortunately, all  three  kingdoms\r\n\r\ndisappeared.  They  were  taken  over  by  another\r\n\r\npower.  Although I do not believe  in  the  dictum\r\n\r\nthat history repeats itself, because there are now\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and  devices which  prevent  history\r\n\r\nfrom  recurring  so often, I will  only  add  that\r\n\r\nlooking  around us there are comparable situations\r\n\r\nin  South-East  Asia which are like  that  of  the\r\n\r\nThree Kingdoms in ancient Chinese history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not my intention to spell\r\n\r\nout  what the Three Kingdoms are in modern \r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asian  history. I will  only  say,  for  our\r\n\r\nedification  and education, that we  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  try  to read a little more  of  The  Three\r\n\r\nKingdoms and make sure that we are not one of  the\r\n\r\nvictims  of absorption and conquest as  the  Three\r\n\r\nKingdoms   were.  That  is  why  we   thought   it\r\n\r\nextraordinarily important that Singapore should be\r\n\r\na member of the United Nations Organisation. There\r\n\r\nwas  no  such world body in the days of the  Three\r\n\r\nKingdoms.  So when one territory was  attacked  by\r\n\r\nanother  territory, there was no  recourse  to  an\r\n\r\nappeal or recourse to succour by a world body. But\r\n\r\nit  is  fortunate  for many small countries  today\r\n\r\nthat  there is such a body as the Security Council\r\n\r\nof  the United Nations where a considerable amount\r\n\r\nof dirty linen can be washed in front of the world\r\n\r\nYou   have   perhaps,   to  some   extent,   quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactory measures which can he applied by  the\r\n\r\nworld  body  in  the solution of disputes  between\r\n\r\nsmaller  powers.  It is our good fortune  that  we\r\n\r\nhave   been  admitted  into  the  United   Nations\r\n\r\norganisation, because you never can tell when  one\r\n\r\nof  these  days  we  may appear as  a  complainant\r\n\r\nbefore   the  United  Nations  Security   Council,\r\n\r\nHowever, I hope that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes not happen, because I believe that, like  the\r\n\r\nable  leaders  and generals of one  of  the  Three\r\n\r\nKingdoms, people in Singapore will also  have  the\r\n\r\nresourcefulness to ensure their own survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very interesting story about a famous\r\n\r\ngeneral  in  one  of the Three  Kingdoms.  He  was\r\n\r\ncalled  Chu Ker Liang. General Chu Ker  Liang  was\r\n\r\nshort of arrows and short of ammunition. They were\r\n\r\nusing  arrows in those days. He had only bows  but\r\n\r\nvery few arrows to shoot with. So what he did  was\r\n\r\nhe  had  dummies made of straw, put them on  board\r\n\r\nsome  barges and sailed the barges down the river.\r\n\r\nThe   enemy  thought  Chu  Ker  Liang's  army  was\r\n\r\nattacking them. So they fired thousands of  arrows\r\n\r\ninto these straw dummies. Chu Ker Liang was happy.\r\n\r\nHe  pulled out those arrows, was richer because of\r\n\r\nthe  ammunition he found and used the same  arrows\r\n\r\nto shoot back at the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the Minister of Defence\r\n\r\nshould  acquire his ammunition like Chu Ker Liang,\r\n\r\nbut  we  feel safe and secure because our Minister\r\n\r\nof  Defence is versed in the history of the  Three\r\n\r\nKingdoms.  Only  I  disagree  with  him   on   his\r\n\r\nproposals  to  recruit  only  volunteers  in   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Defence Force. He admits that our regular\r\n\r\narmy  is a very small army - two battalions, 1,600\r\n\r\nsoldiers. In fact, when I went with my colleagues,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Foreign Affairs and  the  State\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Education,  to  all  the   African\r\n\r\ncountries and explained to them that we  just  had\r\n\r\nonly 1,600 soldiers, they chuckled, \"How could you\r\n\r\nbe  an independent country - no Army, no Navy and\r\n\r\nno Air Force?\" They asked us what we were going to\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI said, \"My Minister of Defence has a bright idea.\r\n\r\nHe is going to recruit a militia.\" My disagreement\r\n\r\nwith  the Minister, of course, is that he is  just\r\n\r\ngoing to recruit the militia on a voluntary basis.\r\n\r\nBut  in  other  countries  which  are  seeking  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  too - I could mention a few, but  perhaps\r\n\r\nin  deference  to  my colleague the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs, I would rather not do so, because\r\n\r\nit  may make his work more difficult - I would say\r\n\r\nthat   compulsory  national  service,   compulsory\r\n\r\nmilitia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice,  probably  would he more  effective,  not\r\n\r\nfrom  the point of view perhaps of trying to teach\r\n\r\nrecruits the art of handling sterling guns,  tommy\r\n\r\nguns,  bazookas or howitzers (I do not think  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  the  primary purpose of a militia)  but\r\n\r\nfrom  another point of view, and that is  this;  a\r\n\r\nfar  more  important function of  such  a  militia\r\n\r\nwould   he   to   instill  a  sense  of   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness into the recruits. It is  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary, because Singapore is an open  port,  an\r\n\r\nopen  city, to which people from all walks of life\r\n\r\nand  from  all  races and cultures  migrate,  that\r\n\r\nthese people must he assimilated and absorbed into\r\n\r\na  nation. That is the weakness which we  find  in\r\n\r\nour  efforts  to build a nation,  and  I  think  a\r\n\r\ncompulsory militia would he an extremely effective\r\n\r\ninstrument indeed on which to build our  Singapore\r\n\r\nnation.  We  started the task in  1959  since  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party assumed power.  We  believe\r\n\r\nthe  schools are the real battleground for \r\n\r\nnation-building. But I do not think that is adequate and,\r\n\r\nin  any  case, the results will not be seen  until\r\n\r\nafter 10 to 15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, it is more urgent that able-bodied men\r\n\r\nand  women too should possess a spirit of national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  and  should he able  to  comprehend\r\n\r\nmeaningfully  the  efforts of  the  Government  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  build up Singapore as a viable  nation\r\n\r\nand how we propose to do it. Nevertheless, it is a\r\n\r\nstart  in  having even volunteers in the  People's\r\n\r\nDefence  Force. I have no doubt my  colleague  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence  will  not  only  teach  the\r\n\r\nvolunteers or the militia the art of self-defence,\r\n\r\nbut  also teach them, more important than anything\r\n\r\nelse, the art of how to be a citizen of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that Singapore by just becoming\r\n\r\nindependent   can   remain   isolated   from   our\r\n\r\nneighbour,  much less from the rest of the  world.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we  must keep on remembering  that  the\r\n\r\nCauseway, which is like an umbilical cord, ties us\r\n\r\nto  Malaya. It has been that way for a  very  long\r\n\r\ntime.  Singapore is still a big city in South-East\r\n\r\nAsia.  Therefore, we can always expect a drift  of\r\n\r\npopulation  from  the rural  areas  of  Malaya  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. This problem of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nurbanisation, of course, increases our problem  of\r\n\r\ncontrolling  population  growth.  If  we  were  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  the  estimates  that  annually  about\r\n\r\n10,000  people migrate to Singapore  from  Malaya,\r\n\r\nthen  over  the course of years, in  the  last  10\r\n\r\nyears,  we  would have gained 100,000 people.  All\r\n\r\nthis  is going to defeat the plans of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health  with his I.U.D. campaign.  There  are\r\n\r\nabout  50,000 to 60,000 babies born in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  if all the time you are going to have such  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial   number  of  persons   migrating   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  then,  of  course,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth's plans to limit the population increase by\r\n\r\nusing  this unique contraceptive device are  going\r\n\r\nto  get  nowhere.  Therefore,  we  are  keeping  a\r\n\r\nwatchful eye on migration into Singapore. We  hope\r\n\r\nat   least   to  protect  Singapore  citizens   by\r\n\r\ninstituting  measures, e.g, issuing work  permits,\r\n\r\nso that Singapore citizens will not he flooded out\r\n\r\nin the process of looking for employment. This, of\r\n\r\ncourse, ties up with economic planning. Population\r\n\r\ncontrol  is  just as important as our  ability  to\r\n\r\nplan  for the future. It is necessary that we must\r\n\r\nnot find ourselves in a situation where we keep on\r\n\r\nrunning on a tread mill which moves backwards, and\r\n\r\nin the end, we find that no progress has ever been\r\n\r\nmade at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make only one comment on\r\n\r\nstudents, and students in Singapore in particular.\r\n\r\nI believe that students all over the world have an\r\n\r\nimportant role to play, not just because they  are\r\n\r\npart  of  the educational process, hut  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  in  time come to man the Civil Service,  man\r\n\r\nindustries,  and  a  few will  become  the  ruling\r\n\r\nelite.  In  fact,  my colleague the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs and I had the great advantage  and\r\n\r\nopportunity to address students in London when  we\r\n\r\nwere  there  last  October. I spoke  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents  and I found that they were a  very  keen\r\n\r\nand  enthusiastic  crowd. On my questioning  them,\r\n\r\nthey  told me that they would he very happy indeed\r\n\r\nto  be  allowed to continue to be associated  with\r\n\r\nstudents  from  Malaysia, to  he  allowed  to  use\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Hall  (it was Malaya  Hall  in  the  old\r\n\r\ndays), and also to continue to use the services of\r\n\r\nthe  Students Unit in London. Some of our students\r\n\r\nwere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliving in Malaysia Hall, some were living in  Hans\r\n\r\nCrescent  - a hostel - where students  from  all\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries stay when  they  study  in\r\n\r\nLondon.  I  wholeheartedly agree  with  them  that\r\n\r\nalthough  Singapore  is now politically  separated\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia, at least we should not inflict upon\r\n\r\nthe  students,  upon the younger  generation,  the\r\n\r\nfailures of the older generation. Therefore, it is\r\n\r\nmost  regrettable indeed for me, Mr  Speaker,  to\r\n\r\nread  in  the Press this morning that advice  will\r\n\r\nsoon  be given to the authorities who run Malaysia\r\n\r\nHall  to  evict Singapore students  too.  We  have\r\n\r\nsuffered  eviction  from  Malaysia.  Now,  it   is\r\n\r\nregrettable indeed, and a big disappointment, that\r\n\r\nthis   also  would  be  the  fate  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nstudents who live in Malaysia Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that in the Straits Times of this\r\n\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. Malaya Hall,\r\n\r\nas  it  was  called  when I  was  a  student,  had\r\n\r\nmemories  for me and my colleagues - the  Minister\r\n\r\nof   Defence,   the  Prime  Minister   and   other\r\n\r\nMinisters. And it was in Malaya Hall that we first\r\n\r\norganised  our student political body called  \"The\r\n\r\nMalayan  Forum\".  It was in the  Forum  in  Malaya\r\n\r\nHall,  that  we  first  met those  who  today  are\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  the  Malaysian  Government  or  are\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders in Malaysia. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nmost  unfortunate that a decision is  being  taken\r\n\r\nwhich  reverses completely the process of bringing\r\n\r\nminds together. Perhaps I would say the beginnings\r\n\r\nof  political thinking of independence for Malaya,\r\n\r\nand  of  reunification of Singapore  with  Malaya,\r\n\r\nalso  originated within the Malayan Forum,  within\r\n\r\nMalaya Hall, in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to our advantage, indeed - for the future\r\n\r\ngeneration  at  least, if not for us  -  that  the\r\n\r\nstudents  of  today, students from  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nstudents from Malaysia, should have a common venue\r\n\r\nwhere they can meet and exchange views, study like\r\n\r\nstudents, and act and behave like students.  After\r\n\r\nall, most of their activities at Malaysia Hall are\r\n\r\nnot  political. They are more social, and it  will\r\n\r\nbe  very unfortunate indeed if a Singapore student\r\n\r\nhas a girl friend from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  she cannot take him  to  a  dance  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia Hall, because he would be thrown  out  by\r\n\r\nthe jaga there who looks after Malaysia Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are problems which really ought to\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken into consideration by those  who\r\n\r\nhave arrived at this decision. I think it would be\r\n\r\na  better  example to the rest of the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nif  at  least we make an effort to allow  students\r\n\r\nfrom  neighbouring  Commonwealth  territories   to\r\n\r\nstudy  and  live together. Who in the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nwould believe that we are so anxious and concerned\r\n\r\nover  the  future  of the Commonwealth,  over  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  and  unity  of  the  Commonwealth  when\r\n\r\nproblems  which are much closer to  us  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsolved? Hans Crescent Hostel for students from all\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries has made  no  decision  to\r\n\r\nthrow  out  students from any particular  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  very regrettable  indeed  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Hall  will  now be  empty  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents.  It  is more particularly annoying,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  because  the  Singapore  Government   is\r\n\r\npaying  one-third of the cost of running  Malaysia\r\n\r\nHall.  And  we  are  also contributing  a  quarter\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars annually to the Students Unit  in\r\n\r\nLondon.  Be  that as it may, it is a  decision  in\r\n\r\nwhich we have no say. We are the junior partner of\r\n\r\nMalaysia Hall, and it is a lesson to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Because holding\r\n\r\none-third of the shares would mean that we can  be\r\n\r\nunceremoniously thrown out when the other  partner\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npleases. And there are many other organisations at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  in which we are also a  partner  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  But  I  do  sincerely  hope  that   the\r\n\r\npolitical  separation of Singapore  from  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill   not   bring  everything  to   its   logical\r\n\r\nconclusion,   and   so   make   irreversible   the\r\n\r\nseparation which publicly, and to all intents  and\r\n\r\npurposes, leaders of both sides of the Causeway so\r\n\r\nmuch regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just comment\r\n\r\non  the  absence of the Opposition. It is  a  pity\r\n\r\nindeed  that they are not here. I suppose many  of\r\n\r\nour  Back-benchers  miss the diatribes  which  the\r\n\r\nOpposition could have hurled at us. But  certainly\r\n\r\ntheir  absence has not in the least  hindered  the\r\n\r\nproceedings of this House. The Government Benchers\r\n\r\nhave fulfilled their full quota of time during the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Address. As\r\n\r\nyou  are aware, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a rule  in\r\n\r\nStanding Orders that each speaker is permitted  so\r\n\r\nmuch  time. I am fully convinced we have dutifully\r\n\r\nshouldered our share of responsibility.  If  there\r\n\r\nis  any  unfulfilled  quota  of  time,  then  that\r\n\r\nresponsibility must be borne by the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I hope is that the Opposition will learn that\r\n\r\nsecond  thoughts are best and that they  will,  at\r\n\r\nsome future date, clearly enunciate their stand on\r\n\r\nthe constitutional struggle for power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I want to say now. Mr Speaker, is that\r\n\r\nin the three months since Singapore left Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwe  have  been having an exciting and a busy  time\r\n\r\ntrying to normalise public life. I would only  add\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore will never be allowed,  either  by\r\n\r\nour  neighbours or by the rest of  the  world,  to\r\n\r\nremain  a backwater for the rest of our lives.  It\r\n\r\njust cannot be. I personally for one, Sir, do  not\r\n\r\nmind  very  much if Singapore were  to  be  but  a\r\n\r\n`sleepy   hollow',  like  Malacca.  In   fact,   I\r\n\r\nsometimes wonder why it is that my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence, had ever  left  the  sleepy\r\n\r\nhollow   of  Malacca!  It  is  a  sort  of  little\r\n\r\nparadise, where you are free from all the  world's - [Interruption].

I will only add  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore - two million of them - plus\r\n\r\n10.000  yearly  from Malaya, together  will,  with\r\n\r\nenergy  and  industry, understand the  meaning  of\r\n\r\nsurvival of Singapore. I think with this spirit we\r\n\r\ncan  build a national consciousness which will  in\r\n\r\nthe   end  ensure  that  Singapore  maintains  its\r\n\r\nintegrity and independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech\r\n\r\nof the Yang di-Pertuan Negara he agreed to:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We, the Legislative Assembly of Singapore,\r\n\r\nexpress  our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nfor the speech which he delivered on behalf of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at the opening of the present  Session\r\n\r\nof this Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following motion* stood in the names of Mr\r\n\r\nPoh  Ber Liak, Mr Ong Liang Teng and Mr Kow  Kee\r\n\r\nSeng -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPENSATION FOR EVICTED DWELLERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That in view of the hardships suffered by the\r\n\r\ndwellers  who were forced to move out  from  their\r\n\r\nhomes  without reasonable compensation and  proper\r\n\r\ncare  by the People's Action Party Government this\r\n\r\nHouse  strongly condemns the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  its  unjust acts  and  urges  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  pay attention and give  reasonable\r\n\r\ncompensation  and proper care to the dwellers  who\r\n\r\nare  affected, and to help settle their  means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

For example, the school must, among  other\r\n\r\nthings,  hold a legal title to the land  and  have\r\n\r\nthe amount of its own contribution in hand. If the\r\n\r\nSchool  is  in  a  position  to  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nRegulations.  I see no reason why its  application\r\n\r\nfor   capital   grant  for  building   cannot   be\r\n\r\nconsidered together with others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, Pin Ghee High School is more\r\n\r\na  Primary  than a Secondary school.  In  1957  it\r\n\r\nbegan with one Secondary I class; by 1964, it  had\r\n\r\nonly  6  Secondary classes. The academic  standard\r\n\r\nachieved  has been appalling: in 1964, out  of  36\r\n\r\ncandidates who sat for the Government Secondary IV\r\n\r\nExamination, only 6 passed, of whom 5 passed  with\r\n\r\nGrade  III  and 1 with Grade I certificate.  Since\r\n\r\n1957, when this school began its first Secondary I\r\n\r\nclass,  it  has  been encouraged  to  improve  its\r\n\r\nschool  buildings  and equipment.  The  Government\r\n\r\napproved  in  1962  capital  grants  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$5,241   for   the  school  to  purchase   science\r\n\r\nequipment  and  furniture in  order  to  help  the\r\n\r\nschool  develop  gradually its  secondary  classes\r\n\r\ninto a proper secondary school. But unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  Management Committee of the school  not  only\r\n\r\nhad  not  been able to make any improvements,  but\r\n\r\nalso   allowed   the  school  administration   and\r\n\r\ndiscipline  to  deteriorate.  For  instance,   the\r\n\r\nschool, under its former Management, was known  to\r\n\r\nhave  sold textbooks at list price, thus making  a\r\n\r\nprofit  of  some $9,000 a year from students,  and\r\n\r\nyet  it  owed several bookshops a total of $18,000\r\n\r\nin  September 1964. No serious attempts  had  ever\r\n\r\nbeen  made to improve the school buildings,  which\r\n\r\nstill  consist  of  7 blocks of wooden  structures\r\n\r\nwith asbestos and attap roofing. Repeated requests\r\n\r\nby  the  health authorities to improve its  health\r\n\r\nrequirements  had  not been fully  complied  with.\r\n\r\nOnly one wooden plank room is available for an \r\n\r\nall-purpose laboratory; Chemistry, Physics and Biology\r\n\r\nexperiments are all conducted in it. The secondary\r\n\r\ndepartment   of   the  school  is  notorious   for\r\n\r\nindiscipline. In November 1964, a pupil was caught\r\n\r\nintimidating other pupils to subscribe to  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   Party   Fund.  More  recently,   school\r\n\r\nmonitors, two of whom were known to have  attended\r\n\r\nmeetings organised by the Barisan Sosialis for its\r\n\r\ncadres, defied the authority of the principal  and\r\n\r\nengaged in producing and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndistributing illegal handbills giving a  distorted\r\n\r\npicture   of  Government  policy  towards  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the School Management Committee can work\r\n\r\nselflessly and genuinely for the future well-being\r\n\r\nof  the  school, I do not see how all the  present\r\n\r\nindiscipline,   poor  management   and   political\r\n\r\nmanipulation by the Barisan Sosialis are going  to\r\n\r\nhelp develop this school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work has already begun on the construction of a\r\n\r\nsecondary school at 10 m.s. Changi Road at a  cost\r\n\r\nof  $1.1  million plus an additional $250,000  for\r\n\r\nfurniture  and  equipment.  This  school  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  next year in time for the enrolment  of\r\n\r\nstudents  in  1967.  It will  cater  for  students\r\n\r\nliving  in the Kampong Chai Chi, Changi, Tampines,\r\n\r\nPulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong areas who now have  to\r\n\r\ntravel long distances to attend school. Before the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of this school, if parents  living  in\r\n\r\nthe  village  nearby  Pin  Ghee  School  find   it\r\n\r\ninconvenient  to  send their  children  to  attend\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools  elsewhere  next   year,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  quite prepared to  open  secondary\r\n\r\nclasses at Changkat Primary School situated at  10\r\n\r\nm.s. Changi Road to eater for this need until  the\r\n\r\nnew secondary school is ready.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question for Oral Answer stood on\r\n\r\nthe Order Paper of 20th December, 1965:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAYSIAN MIRROR</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->\"<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>: To ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture and Social Affairs (a) the total number of\r\n\r\nemployees  involved  in  the  publication  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Mirror; (b) the amount of money spent on\r\n\r\neach  issue; and (c) the Head and subhead  of  the 1965 Estimates   which   provides    for    the\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Standing Order No. 20 (2), the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture and Social Affairs supplied\r\n\r\nthe following answer:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \"The Malaysian Mirror, published from March\r\n\r\nthis  year,  stemmed from the  need  to  keep  the\r\n\r\npublic   informed  of  current  affairs  for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of an enlightened public  opinion  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of democratic Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith  our  independent status,  it  has  now  been\r\n\r\ndecided  to  abandon  the  Malaysian  Mirror   and\r\n\r\ninstead bring out a weekly publication called  The\r\n\r\nMirror, with a similar objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The publication of the then Malaysian Mirror\r\n\r\nand now The Mirror is undertaken by the staff of\r\n\r\nthe Publicity Division of the Ministry of Culture.
