FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, digital communication is now an integral part of our lives, both at work and at home. We use email and SMS regularly.&nbsp; For an increasing number of Singaporeans, email and SMS are, in fact,<p align=left>Column: 569<p> default modes of communication. They are personal, convenient, fast and offer global outreach. These advantages also bring along a problem in the form of unsolicited emails and even SMSes. This problem arises when large amount of emails are sent indiscriminately, a practice known as \"spamming\", causing network congestion, inundating users' inboxes and impeding the effectiveness of email and mobile messages as instantaneous communication channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us would have received some form of unsolicited commercial electronic messages or \"spam\" either through email or&nbsp;mobile phones.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) carried out a study in November 2003 and found that email spam caused&nbsp;Singapore users about $23 million&nbsp;in productivity loss. Users are burdened with the time-consuming task of separating the wheat&nbsp;from the chaff.&nbsp; The study further revealed that each of the three major local Internet Service Providers (or ISPs) received close to 5,000 spam-related complaints a month. The users interviewed perceived email spam as the second most important concern after computer viruses. This concern has not changed over time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in this digital age, email and mobile messages are also important means of business communication for reaching external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers.&nbsp; In particular, electronic messages offer direct marketers an important and cost-effective means of reaching out to potential customers on a large scale.&nbsp; It is an important avenue for companies wanting to market their products or services directly and cheaply to potential customers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Approach adopted</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, spam is clearly an emerging global problem, and we have to recognise that in <p align=left>Column: 570<p>the process of formulating our response to address the spam issue here in Singapore, my Ministry has&nbsp;carefully studied the approaches adopted in various other&nbsp;benchmark jurisdictions, including the US, the EU, the&nbsp;UK, Australia, Japan and South Korea.&nbsp; We note that&nbsp;even among the more advanced countries, there is currently no standard solution, ie, there is no one-size-fits-all for this particular problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addressing the spam issue, many countries have realised that several measures have to be adopted.&nbsp; We are no different from countries that have taken steps to deal with spam ahead of us. We also need a multi-pronged approach, including public education, industry&nbsp;self-regulation, international collaboration and, last but not least, legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, users can play a part in dealing with the spam problem by installing anti-spam software (filters and firewalls) on their personal computer to filter out undesirable spam and to prevent spammers from turning vulnerable computers into spamming machines.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the industry action front, IDA has worked with the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation (SiTF) on public education efforts to raise public and industry awareness on spam and how to mitigate its impact.&nbsp; Industry-wise, IDA is also working with the ISPs to set up self-regulation frameworks and the Direct Marketing Association of Singapore (DMAS) to formulate anti-spam and email marketing guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of international collaboration, in 2004, Singapore joined 26 countries in an exercise to reduce the flow of spam internationally.&nbsp; Currently, there are ongoing informal international collaborations&nbsp;between ISPs to address spamming incidents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To strengthen the multi-pronged approach to combat spam, IDA conducted <p align=left>Column: 571<p>extensive public consultations in 2004 and 2005 with both the industry and the general public on the proposal to enact legislation to deal with spam. A total of 90 responses were received during the two public consultations. These public responses&nbsp;provided the support and contributed input for MICA to formulate the Spam Control Bill before this House today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Spam-specific legislation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, besides the importance of public education and industry efforts to curb spam, an anti-spam legislation is needed to discourage the proliferation of email and mobile spam.&nbsp; Members of the&nbsp;House may ask whether we need such&nbsp;legislation when we already have the Computer Misuse Act and&nbsp;Telecommunications Act.&nbsp; These existing laws govern serious and malicious offences, such as denial-of-service attacks and severe disruptions to telecommunications infrastructure.&nbsp;The typical volume of email and mobile messages generated by spammers usually do not result in such severe breakdown of services.&nbsp; Hence, existing laws are not appropriate instruments to use against spam. A more focused approach is needed to signal that spamming is socially unacceptable and to preserve Singapore's status as a trusted infocomm hub for both businesses and consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I must however emphasise that this Bill is not a magic bullet to eradicate all spamming activities overnight.&nbsp; The IDA's 2003 study showed that four out of nearly five spam received locally originates overseas.&nbsp; So about 80% of the spam that are received in Singapore comes from overseas.&nbsp; Our laws would thus only have a limited effect in addressing this problem.&nbsp; However, this does not mean that we should just stand idle&nbsp;and do nothing. By putting in place this spam control legislation, my Ministry is not only acting to deter international<p align=left>Column: 572<p> spammers from exploiting Singapore's world-class telecommunications infrastructure as a base for spamming, but we are also stating clearly and unambiguously that Singapore is ready&nbsp;to address the global problem of spam in concert with other advanced infocomm nations of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Defined scope</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, please allow me now to go through the details of the Bill. The Spam Control Bill seeks to prevent local spammers from abusing direct marketing mechanisms. The Bill sets out basic requirements for&nbsp;legitimate direct electronic mass marketing, and provides civil&nbsp;recourse for any affected persons against illegal spam with a Singapore link.&nbsp; A Singapore link exists, as stated in clause 7 of the Bill, when, for instance, the message originates in Singapore, or if the recipient of the message is physically present here in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from email messages, the scope of the Bill also covers SMS (Short Message Service) messages and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages which are sent to a mobile telephone number.&nbsp; Given that the mobile telephone in today's context is a personalised device, mobile spam can be even more intrusive than&nbsp;email spam.&nbsp; This was made quite clear during the public consultation on spam.&nbsp; Fortunately, mobile spam is currently not a major problem in Singapore.&nbsp; However, consumer complaints have&nbsp;arisen from time to time to suggest that this channel could potentially be abused.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a very high mobile phone penetration rate in Singapore and the likelihood is that the economics of sending SMS and MMS in bulk for marketing purposes may become increasingly cost-effective in the future.&nbsp; This suggests that we should address the problem of mobile spam proactively.&nbsp; The inclusion of mobile spam within the scope<p align=left>Column: 573<p> of this Bill aims to promote the responsible use of mobile messaging services and stave off the undesirable proliferation of mobile spam in the future.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Definition of spam</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part I of the Bill defines \"spam\". A message is \"spam\" when it is an unsolicited commercial electronic message sent more than 100 times, with the same or similar subject-matter, during a 24-hour period, or more than 1,000 times during a 30-day period, or more than 10,000 times during a one-year period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In setting the threshold figures cited above, there is a need to balance the concerns of the individual consumers versus legitimate marketing needs of businesses. &nbsp;Although on the individual basis, users are unlikely to receive this volume of spam within the period stipulated, collectively, at the ISP or organisational server level, the threshold figures do represent practical levels for intervention if warranted.&nbsp; This is also in recognition that while an individual user can simply ignore and delete the&nbsp;spam messages in his inbox, the ISPs and organisations may actually incur costs to handle a huge volume of spam on a regular basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Proposed spam control measures</I>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, an opt-out approach is adopted under the Bill, as it balances the need of companies and marketers to send unsolicited messages for business reasons. &nbsp;An opt-in approach was also considered by my Ministry, but this was not adopted because of industry feedback received during public consultation which indicated that it would impose an additional burden on legitimate businesses, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while not significantly improving the situation for spam control. This is <p align=left>Column: 574<p>because most of the email spams we receive originate from overseas, as I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Total prohibition of unsolicited electronic messages disadvantages our local&nbsp;marketers and businesses without eradicating the spam problem or effectively stopping foreign spammers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to balance between consumer interests and industry needs, the Bill will require that each message contains a valid unsubscribe facility, an&nbsp;\"ADV\" label to mark it out as an advertisement, accurate header information or subject titles and functional contact details of the sender.&nbsp; These requirements are stated&nbsp;in the Second Schedule of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the unsubscribe process has been structured to be consumer-friendly, so that even individuals who receive small volumes of spam have a means of recourse, without resorting to legal action.&nbsp; The Bill makes it mandatory for senders to allow recipients to unsubscribe via the same medium through which the spam was received.&nbsp; This ensures that unsubscribing from the spam can be done easily and conveniently by replying to an email or SMS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sender is also prohibited from making the unsubscribe request a paid service. &nbsp;Likewise, the information contained in the unsubscribe request cannot be disclosed without the prior consent of the individual. &nbsp;Upon receipt of the unsubscribe request, the sender has 10 business days to cease sending further unsolicited messages to the individual concerned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Dictionary attacks&nbsp;and address harvesting</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 9 of the Bill strictly prohibits the use of Dictionary Attacks and Address Harvesting Software to send spam.&nbsp; Spammers use such methods to generate or obtain large numbers of email addresses and mobile telephone numbers.&nbsp; In doing so, they can cause disruption to <p align=left>Column: 575<p>the recipient organisations, such as the ISPs, operators of email servers and mobile telephone service providers. &nbsp;These recipient organisations may incur substantial costs to receive and process the huge volume of spam messages.&nbsp; Hence, such methods are strictly disallowed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Legal action under the Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV of the Bill describes the legal action that can be taken by affected parties against spam sent in contravention of any requirement in the Bill.&nbsp; Aggrieved individuals or companies may be awarded an injunction, damages or statutory damages. Statutory damages of up to $25 per message sent and not exceeding $1 million in total could be imposed. &nbsp;If the plaintiff is able to prove that he suffered greater loss, he could opt to sue for actual damages instead.&nbsp; In addition, the court may order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's legal costs and expenses resulting from the proceedings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may ask why is it that&nbsp;my Ministry has not chosen&nbsp;to make spamming a criminal offence, instead of taking this route of civil action.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the inconveniences that spam brings, I would like to point out that spammers generally do not act with malicious intent. Furthermore, in the international best practices which my Ministry had studied, no other jurisdictions have criminalised the act of spamming <I>per se</I>.&nbsp; While some overseas spam legislation may contain criminal provisions, these are primarily linked to criminal offences committed online.&nbsp; For instance, the US treats spam with fraudulent intent as criminal acts. &nbsp;In Singapore, spams that are sent with a fraudulent or malicious component that results in a denial of service is also criminalised under the Computer Misuse Act.&nbsp; The Spam Control Bill should not be viewed in isolation, but, rather, as an addition to our total legislative framework against technology abuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 576<p><p><I>Other provisions</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Part V of the Bill empowers the Minister to amend any Schedule by an order published in the <I>Government Gazette</I>. This would allow for an expeditious modification of the guidelines relating to the unsubscribe facility and labelling requirements when required.&nbsp; The Bill also provides for the industry groupings to self-regulate by issuing codes of practice with the approval of IDA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The First Schedule of the Bill exempts from the regime authorised messages sent by the Government or a statutory body during a public emergency, in the public interest or in the interest of public security or national defence.&nbsp; This provision ensures that essential public messages during a time of crisis may be transmitted effectively and expeditiously without being impeded by spam control legislation.&nbsp; This will be&nbsp;in the interest of public safety and well-being. This mirrors similar provisions found in the Telecommunications Act and the Broadcasting Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, the Spam Control Bill is aimed at reducing the spam problem in Singapore and preventing spammers from abusing our world-class telecommunications infrastructure to turn Singapore into a spammers' haven.&nbsp; Spam is an issue that transcends national borders requiring international collaboration to effectively curb this abuse.&nbsp; This Bill represents Singapore's efforts in doing our part as a member of the global community to address the spam issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill, taken together with ongoing public education and concerted industry efforts to address the spam problem as well as our other laws on technology abuses, will contribute to a holistic approach to address this growing problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 577<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>1.55 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to applaud MICA and IDA for taking a proactive approach in keeping up with the development in this ICT era.&nbsp; In tandem with changes in communication technology, a revised Spam Control Bill is absolutely necessary.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because spams, or unsolicited e- and mobile-mails, have become a regular but unwelcome guest at every log in. Offers of Viagra, weight-loss programmes, loans, pornography and get-rich-quick schemes bombard us every day.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This represents a tremendous waste of resources.&nbsp; Imagine, we pay to download it, pay to delete it, and if we are unlucky enough to be sent a virus within, it may cost us a whole system.&nbsp; At the very minimum, the time cost per spam is estimated to be between 4-5 seconds.&nbsp; Translated into man hours lost, this represents a formidable economic loss.&nbsp; The Minister has stated that the loss was around $23 million in productivity loss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a Microsoft event in Singapore, Mr Steve Ballmer said, \"Bill Gates literally receives some four million pieces of email&nbsp; every day - most of them spam.\".&nbsp; Now, four million spams times 4-5 seconds per spam and multiply that by Bill Gates' economic life value would be, I think, quite unthinkable.&nbsp; Hence, there is literally a whole department to take care of it.&nbsp; These are all costs to the individual, the company and, of course, in the larger&nbsp;context , the Government.&nbsp; Hence, there is no question that efforts - both legislative and technology - must join hands to fight spam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 578<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The million dollar question is: what are the desirable outcomes of this Bill?&nbsp; The obvious answer is that there will be no more spam.&nbsp; However, a spam-free cyberworld appears remote.&nbsp; Even with a whole department attending to spam, some 10 spam mails still get through to Bill Gates.&nbsp; Will this revised legislation help?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take a recap over the past two years, perhaps the question that I would ask the Minister is whether MICA and IDA have looked into the effectiveness of the first Bill for individuals to bring civil action against the spammers, whether they are local or foreign?&nbsp; How many cases were filed over the last two years?&nbsp; If the revised Bill has indeed considered this aspect, then how will this Bill add more teeth to the individual?&nbsp; If not, what is the essence of reintroducing a revised Bill and what KPIs will be put in place to measure the effectiveness of this Bill?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, MICA should also conduct a regular spam-related survey&nbsp; - &nbsp;I have&nbsp;just heard that they conducted two in recent years&nbsp; - like the one that they did for the Short Message Service (SMS) provided by Public Cellular Mobile Telephone Service operators, to ascertain the end-to-end response time of SMS across local mobile networks; in this case, put in the context of email instead, to provide some useful insights for benchmarking purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the problem,&nbsp;as the Minister has rightly pointed out, is that legislation&nbsp;stops at each geographical and political border, but spams are transnational.&nbsp; In fact, I understand that up to 90% of the spams in Singapore originate from out of the country.&nbsp; So this revised Bill obviously is still something that we could do only within the country itself and, in a way, disadvantages our own commercial operators, while messages that are not linked to Singapore get through unfettered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, while we may penalise and punish locals, we may also encourage local online marketing companies and <p align=left>Column: 579<p>corporate entities to blossom overseas, while Singaporeans still get the spams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is clear that spams cannot be a single-nation fight, and I am heartened to hear that we have joined hands with some 26 countries in this fight.&nbsp; But there needs to be a closer cooperation and common platform.&nbsp; For example, in 2004, 13 European countries in EC have signed an anti-spam voluntary agreement with the following objectives:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Establish a common procedure for handling cross-border complaints on spam, drawn up by the contact network of spam enforcement authorities;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Share information and pursue complaints across European countries; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Cooperate in investigating complaints about cross-border spam from anywhere else within the EU.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I would like to ask the Minister if there is any plan for Singapore to leverage on a regional platform, whether it is ASEAN or APEC, to form a pan-ASEAN or Asian co-operation framework to combat spam.&nbsp; Perhaps, take the lead as well to foster a global cooperation framework, because even if a few countries do not participate, then spammers can always originate their spam from those countries.&nbsp; From a macro perspective, this could be an opportunity to enhance our opportunity as a forerunner in the ICT world, not just in infrastructure but also the legislative aspect.&nbsp; Does the Minister agree that this could be a good desirable outcome?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Micro: Some thorns</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me move on to the details and some thorns.&nbsp; From a micro perspective, the proposed Bill itself is not without its thorns.&nbsp; First, it is an opt-out scheme, where one can reject spams in <p align=left>Column: 580<p>the form of unsubscribing with a reply. Yet, savvy net users would know that a reply can only constitute an&nbsp;'active' email account and attract even more spams.&nbsp; So, should we or should we not reply?&nbsp; The Ministry can issue some guidelines and advisory as&nbsp;do some other countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what is the definition of \"unsolicited\"?&nbsp; The vast majority of recipients of commercial messages do not request nor can they give their consent prior to receiving the messages.&nbsp; So, if a private company sends out its \"commercial messages\" to a 'members' pool, would this constitute spamming or online marketing?&nbsp; If, say, a non-commercial entity, like the NVPC, NCSS, MOE, any NGO, or even a Government agency, sends out non-commercial content spams to thousands of its volunteers, would they also constitute unsolicited spams?&nbsp; Would they be liable under the proposed Bill?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the meaning of \"bulk\" is also problematic for many online marketing firms.&nbsp; As a commercial entity, they cannot restrict themselves to 100 messages per 24 hours when their job is a numbers game.&nbsp; To beat it, they may register more originating accounts, or use individuals/employees to spam.&nbsp; How would they be treated under this proposed Bill?&nbsp; In addition, brick-and-mortar companies may also outsource their virtual marketing campaign to online marketing companies.&nbsp; If their activity is considered spam, who would be liable?&nbsp; Is the real or the virtual company?&nbsp; It is often not easy to tell who is the mastermind when trouble is in store.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the injunction against \"address harvesting software\" is an anachronistic clause.&nbsp; It implies that if we do it manually, then it is permissible.&nbsp; But, surely, in this day and age, using a software to do the work of brute manpower should be encouraged and not discouraged.&nbsp; Thus,<p align=left>Column: 581<p> the focus should not be on how the list was obtained but on how it is used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, the use of civil action as the venue to seek damages puts the burden entirely on the individual complainant.&nbsp; As we all know, the vast majority of individuals simply would not have the inclination or the resources to pursue court action.&nbsp; Would it be useful to think of some additional mechanism through consumer protection principles?&nbsp; For example, in Japan, the government&nbsp;could issue an \"Administrative Order\" to spammers.&nbsp; When a complaint is received from the public, the Research and Consulting Center for Spam, which is a government authority in Japan, would conduct an on-the-spot inspection by transmitting an alert mail to illegal sender, asking for a report.&nbsp; This is a much more efficient, effective and cheaper way of curtailing spamming rather than enforcing through legislative act only.&nbsp; Another suggestion is whether there could be some trigger mechanism whereby the complaint against an individual or entity reaches a certain volume, IDA could be obliged to take action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, despite the limitation of legislation as a venue to seek recourse, it is too unforgiving to pin down the proposed revisions as an ineffective tool, given that the ICT sphere is still evolving.&nbsp; At the very minimum, the proposed changes recognise privacy rights and empower individuals to decide and take responsibility through legal means to protect their rights.&nbsp; This Bill, in essence, should not be one that just provides the right signal, but also one with teeth as an effective measure.&nbsp; Setting a higher penalty sum is to hit spammers where it hurts, which is in the pockets!&nbsp; In taking a more holistic perspective, it is important that a multi-pronged approach be adopted.&nbsp; The current Internet technology helps spammers hide their identity, such that<p align=left>Column: 582<p> spam can only be fought through a combination of technology, public education and law.&nbsp; Therefore, efforts to work with the ISP and software industry to contain spams at the source, broader public education initiatives to ensure better information and anti-spam advisory, stronger anti-spam legislative signals, and work towards a global compact on spams are all part of the anti-spam jigsaw puzzle that must be carried out simultaneously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.05 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Sir, I rise in support of the Spam Control Bill.&nbsp; I applaud the Government for introducing this legislation as it will no doubt enhance Singapore's reputation as an infocomm hub.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill will also prevent Singapore from becoming a regional relaying point for overseas spammers to send their spam to our neighbours.&nbsp; I believe there are very few Members who have not been on the receiving end of spam, and would welcome this Bill if only to see an end to this scourge among all email users.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Sir, I think many Members will be disappointed. This Bill may not stop spam entirely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to voice a few observations of this problem and some concerns over this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Most spam is foreign</I></p><p><I><br>&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first observation, Sir, is that the bulk of the spam we have been receiving is coming from overseas. The sale of Viagra, the solicitation for obscure stocks, and of course the invitation to profit from ill-gotten gains from Nigeria and their many variations - all these have come from overseas.&nbsp; The spam mail appears to be indiscriminate.&nbsp; Forgive me for my biological description.&nbsp; My&nbsp; good friend's&nbsp; husband has received solicitations to have<p align=left>Column: 583<p> his breasts enlarged, and my good friend too has received solicitations to have her&nbsp; 'male member' elongated.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The few spam mails that I do receive from Singapore have more to do with invitations to attend training courses and seminars, and sale of legitimate products and services. Most are from our local SMEs, although I do receive an occasional mail from individual entrepreneurs selling home-made trinkets and other products. In contrast to the foreign spam, I would say our local spammers are quite legitimate businesses, clearly identifiable and quite responsible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would venture to guess that local spam makes up less than 1% - although the Minister had earlier on said,&nbsp;maybe 20% - of the total spam that I receive.&nbsp; Yes, these emails, while unsolicited, are not entirely unwelcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this leads me to ask: why are we introducing a law that does not solve 99% of the problem, but instead goes after the 1% of local spammers whose crime appears to promote local and legitimate products and services?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the intent of this Bill is to prevent Singapore from becoming a transmission point for spam to be sent overseas, then I believe our local ISPs would be better equipped to nip the problem in the bud.&nbsp; Indeed, it would be in the interest of our ISPs to ensure that their servers do not becoming spam relays, as that would impose a heavy and an unnecessary burden on their servers and bandwidth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Opt-out scheme</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am heartened by section 2 of the Second Schedule (Unsubscribe facility).&nbsp; Inherent in this section is the adoption of an opt-out, instead of an opt-in, philosophy. I welcome this as a progressive move, as it is not onerous upon legitimate businesses wanting to promote their goods and services through e-<p align=left>Column: 584<p>marketing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Sir, and this is no fault of those who drafted this Bill, many users cannot always differentiate between local and foreign spam. The very act of unsubscribing confirms to the spammer that he has a 'live' email address, in contrast to one generated randomly by his software. Such 'live' addresses are especially valuable to the spammer and, far from getting the user off a mailing list, it may actually cause the user to receive even more spam!</p><p><br><I>Zombie computers</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many international spammers do not achieve their dubious reputation of being able to send millions of emails by deploying their own computers. They achieve it by 'hijacking' the PCs of innocent users, and using these 'zombie' computers as relays to send out their bulk mail. Many innocent users have become unwitting partners, unaware that their PCs and servers are being&nbsp;used so.&nbsp; This raises the question, Sir, of whether this Bill will implicate such unwitting users who do not even know their PCs and servers have been hijacked and used as relays. I therefore wish to ask: what protection does this Bill provide for&nbsp;such users whose computers are&nbsp;hijacked as 'zombies'?</p><p><br><I>Punishing the innocent and rewarding the guilty</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, section 3 of the Second Schedule (\"Labelling and Other Requirements\") requires every unsolicited electronic message to have the \"&lt;ADV&gt;\" tag in the header or message of the email. Ostensibly, this is to identify the message as an advertisement.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days of the Internet, the &lt;ADV&gt; tag was regarded as part of netiquette, to alert the recipients that the email was an advertisement. The user could then choose whether to open the message.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the &lt;ADV&gt; tag is a kiss of death! Allow me to explain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 585<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Messages tagged with &lt;ADV&gt; can easily be identified by today's anti-spam software and filtered out of the system, ie, relegated to the Junk Mail folder or even deleted automatically. In other words, the user may not even get the chance to view the title of the message.&nbsp; Compare this with the foreign spam which is not tagged, and which can and do bypass most anti-spam software.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I fear the net effect of this &lt;ADV&gt; tag is to punish the innocent (those who abide by this Act) by having their messages filtered out automatically, and reward the guilty (those who do not tag their messages).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that the bulk of spam is from overseas, we can reasonably expect that the winners will be the foreign spammers with their Viagra and organ enlargers. The losers will be our local law-abiding SMEs who are trying to leverage the Internet as a low-cost marketing medium to promote their honest business. I would like to ask the Minister to seriously reconsider the &lt;ADV&gt; tag, if only to give a level playing field to our local SMEs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the intent of the Spam Control Bill is good,&nbsp;but I hope the House will give due attention to some of the concerns that I have raised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.13 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.&nbsp; I contribute commentaries to the <I>Today</I> newspaper.&nbsp; In December 2003, I wrote a piece about spam.&nbsp; That was in the wake of the US passing its CAN-SPAM&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; Three-and-a-half years later, I am speaking in Parliament on Singapore's own Spam Control Bill.&nbsp; I have in a way come full circle.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is timely.&nbsp; In fact, it is perhaps a little late in the game.&nbsp; For instance, both<p align=left>Column: 586<p> the US and Australia passed spam legislation in 2003.&nbsp; The IDA had first conducted a public consultation on spam legislation in May 2004.&nbsp; We have taken almost three years to actually reach the Second Reading of this Bill. Be that as it may, it is better late than never.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill implements an opt-out model for unsolicited commercial electronic messages.&nbsp; The Minister has explained what that means and I would only add that I was previously in favour of an opt-in model, but I now favour an opt-out model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a judgment call as to which model is superior.&nbsp; But all things considered, I would agree that the opt-out model represents a more practical approach to the issue of spam, one that avoids unnecessarily onerous compliance obligations.&nbsp; And to those marketeers who would argue against even the compliance obligations for an opt-out model, I would say that they really should exit the business if their revenue cannot cover this added compliance costs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister has rightly pointed out the limitations of the Bill, and what it will and will not accomplish.&nbsp; The Bill seeks to regulate spam.&nbsp; It does not seek&nbsp;to, and it will certainly not, solve the problem of spam or reduce the volume of spam.&nbsp; It legalises unsolicited messages</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>that comply with the prescribed requirements and may well increase the volume of unsolicited messages received.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to have been the experience in the US.&nbsp; Our opt-out model is very similar to the model used in the US CAN-SPAM Act.&nbsp;According to a <I>New York Times'</I> article in February 2005, the one year period since the CAN-SPAM Act&nbsp; went &nbsp;into effect actually saw spam email going up, from 50% to 60% of all emails sent over the Internet before the law went into effect to 80% after.&nbsp; A more recent <I>New York Times'</I> article, in December<p align=left>Column: 587<p> 2006, reported that the volume of spam email, as a proportion of all emails sent, had risen to more than 90%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the proposed legislation will apply to all unsolicited messages with a Singapore connection.&nbsp; That includes messages&nbsp;sent from outside Singapore to a recipient in Singapore.&nbsp; But enforcement against a spammer operating outside Singapore would be difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the IDA's survey in 2003 found&nbsp; that 77% of the total spam email received came from overseas based companies.&nbsp; This percentage is unlikely to be significantly&nbsp;affected by the Spam Control Bill.&nbsp;Having said that, I still believe that the Bill will be helpful.&nbsp; There is a substantial amount of local unsolicited messages, especially sent to mobile phones, and the Bill will help&nbsp;to regulate that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, my own personal experience is that although local spam email is low in volume,&nbsp;it actually takes up a disproportionate amount of time, compared to overseas spam, which is typically much easier to identify a spam.&nbsp; And mobile phone messages will always take up the time of the recipient, to open, scan and delete the message.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, passing&nbsp;anti-spam legislation will give Singapore the right to a seat at the table, in any eventual international effort to fight spam. &nbsp;And given&nbsp;the cross border nature of this problem, international efforts are the only sort of effort that can effectively reduce spam volume and is probably inevitable in the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, the Bill is not perfect.&nbsp; I had co-authored a submission in response to&nbsp;the consultation paper in 2005 on an earlier draft version of the Bill.&nbsp; I had also, in my previous capacity as a private practitioner, advised clients on the first<p align=left>Column: 588<p> consultation exercise conducted by the IDA and AGC in 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now address several issues in connection with the Bill that have remained&nbsp;despite those two consultation efforts that I hope that the Minister can clarify.&nbsp; Firstly, the status of communications sent pursuant to a pre-existing relationship remains unclear.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has mentioned this, and I would like to add a few comments.&nbsp; The Bill&nbsp;simply does not address this issue, despite it having been repeatedly raised by industry players in the public consultation exercises, including in the first consultation in 2004.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is actually a great concern to most commercial enterprises, who would have&nbsp;to, or want to, send communications to their existing customers from time to time.&nbsp; But if this communication is not initiated by the customer or not asked for by the customer, would it be considered an unsolicited message?&nbsp; It is unclear and clarity on this would be helpful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, from&nbsp;my years of experience specialising in the area of Internet law, I would say that this is possibly the single-most important issue to the industry in connection with this Bill. Indeed, given how this issue had been repeatedly raised by respondents to the public consultation exercises, it seems to me a little unsatisfactory of the IDA and AGC not to have&nbsp;specifically addressed this earlier, either in connection with the second consultation exercise in 2005 or in the Bill itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Bill relies exclusively on civil actions by persons who have suffered loss or damage, directly or indirectly, resulting from&nbsp;a contravention of its provisions.&nbsp; The Minister has explained why it does not provide for criminal sanctions and has pointed out that the criminal offences in the US CAN-SPAM Act are aimed at fraudulent spams.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 589<p> But there is a middle ground.&nbsp; I believe that the US CAN-SPAM Act also empowers the US regulator, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to commence civil enforcement actions against spammers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, spam is like a hydra, cut off one head and another two will grow elsewhere, shut down one's&nbsp;spammer and two more will spring up elsewhere.&nbsp; Spam is also a problem that affects everyone.&nbsp; Its effects are diffuse but it affects many.&nbsp; When added up, the negative effects become substantial.&nbsp; That is why the resources of private enterprise alone will not be sufficient to combat spam effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill would have a lot more teeth, if we have included criminal sanctions for the more serious offences, such as where dictionary attacks or&nbsp;address harvesting software are used.&nbsp; Alternatively, the IDA could be empowered to commence civil enforcement actions against offenders or even to impose civil penalties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would lighten the burden of private industry.&nbsp; It would&nbsp;also have helped to ensure that in cases where the ISPs are unable or unwilling to take action for any reason, there remain other entities able to commence proceedings.&nbsp; The US' example, where the FTC has commenced a substantial number of civil actions against spammers, shows that there is a significant role that regulatory and law&nbsp;enforcement agencies can play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third issue I would like to touch on is the exclusion of telemarketers and junk faxes from regulation.&nbsp; I think most people would agree with my view that telemarketing calls are far more intrusive and far more annoying than spam emails and unsolicited mobile phone messages. And annoyance becomes actual cost when such calls are received on the mobile phone when one is<p align=left>Column: 590<p> overseas&nbsp;and roaming.&nbsp;As for junk faxes, they consume physical resources in the form of paper and, depending on the type of fax machine used, toner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Australia has both&nbsp;a Spam Act and a Do Not Call Register Act which was enacted last year and recently took effect.&nbsp; The Do Not Call Register Act&nbsp;creates a \"do not call\" register that the public can register with, and it is unlawful for telemarketers to call the numbers on the register, although there are certain exemptions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the US and UK also regulate telemarketing, junk faxes and spam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why are we proposing to regulate spam emails and mobile phone messages, but not telemarketers and junk faxes?&nbsp; I do not understand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I accept that it is possible to make a reasonable distinction for spam email on the basis that it costs very little to send massive amounts of spam emails.&nbsp; Telemarketing and junk faxes cost money, which creates an inherent control on the amount of telemarketing and junk faxing done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about mobile phone messages?&nbsp; That also costs money to send.&nbsp; So why regulate that,&nbsp;but not telemarketing and junk faxes? I do not think that any convincing justification for this distinction has been articulated,&nbsp;and I hope that the Minister can clarify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, and finally, the Bill proposes a code of practice for Internet access service providers and telecommunications&nbsp;service providers.&nbsp; The Bill provides that&nbsp;they may, with the IDA's approval, issue a code of practice on&nbsp;minimum standards of technical measures to effectively control unsolicited commercial electronic messages.&nbsp; And if they do issue&nbsp;such a code, they must comply.&nbsp; However, the Bill does not prescribe any consequences <p align=left>Column: 591<p>for non-compliance.&nbsp; There is no requirement for all ISPs and telecommunications service providers to be involved in&nbsp;issuing the code, although&nbsp;all&nbsp;must comply. Having said that, I acknowledge that the IDA could require all of them to be involved before giving its approval.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, the process around the code involves only IASPs, telecommunications service providers and the IDA.&nbsp; But what about other important stakeholders, such as consumers, commercial enterprises, who do send out&nbsp;electronic communications, and direct marketing organisations?&nbsp; They should be involved or, at least, be&nbsp;given&nbsp;an opportunity to be heard in the process as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have said that this Bill is a positive step. And I fully agree with the Minister that the problem of email spam and unsolicited mobile phone messages requires a holistic, multi-pronged solution.&nbsp; And even with the passage of the Bill, spam email, especially from overseas, will remain a real problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, of all these various prongs, education remains paramount.&nbsp; Indeed, education will probably become even more important so as to prevent a false sense of safety amongst the public simply because there is legislation in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to continue efforts to educate the public on what to do when spam is encountered.&nbsp; There are some very commonsensical thing that can be done.&nbsp; The advertisements for drugs, pornography, pirated software and the like, are easy to identify and easy to deal with.&nbsp;Phishing emails and fraudulent spams remain real risks although public awareness&nbsp;on these has improved in recent years. Most importantly, email users need to be taught how to differentiate between local unsolicited emails that comply and non-compliance <p align=left>Column: 592<p>spam.&nbsp; It would be safe to send an unsubscribed request to the former, but certainly not the latter, as Mdm Ho has explained.&nbsp; Users can save themselves a lot of grief, if only they were more informed, and it&nbsp;takes some very commonsensical steps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill is an important component&nbsp;in our&nbsp;efforts to fight spam.&nbsp; It may not be perfect.&nbsp;But it is a positive step forward, and brings Singapore's regulatory environment in this area in line with other leading jurisdictions like the US, Australia and Europe. But this is not the finishing line, and all stakeholders must continue to play their parts in this fight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.25 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Spam Control Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spamming is understood as the sending of unsolicited email, messages in bulk, to people who have not requested for it.&nbsp; And because they are unwanted and \"in&nbsp;your face\", they can be a real nuisance, not to mention an invasion of privacy and&nbsp;even theft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How so?&nbsp; Spamming is actually a loss of money.&nbsp; Junk mails, flyers and even advertising on public space have been spared with the label \"spam\" on the grounds that the distribution costs are borne by the advertisers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spam, however, is paid for by the recipients, in terms of bandwidth, CPU processing time and storage space.&nbsp; Spammers frequently use free dial-up accounts,&nbsp;so their costs may be quite minimal indeed.&nbsp; It is this offloading of costs onto the recipient that many consider spamming to be theft and even criminal conversion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 593<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, junk mail is traceable whereas spammers may not be easily tracked down.&nbsp; Businesses&nbsp;can be held responsible for what they sent.&nbsp; Spammers frequently use the so-called \"anarchy\" of the Internet as a&nbsp;cover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different forms of spam have emerged.&nbsp; In addition to the email inbox, there are instant messaging, voice over Internet Protocol, the SMS spam.&nbsp; All the above further reduces bandwidth capacity which subsequently reduces productivity and that can only mean a loss of money which is not what we want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spam Control Bill was first mooted, as earlier mentioned by many of the Members in this House, in 2004 as part of&nbsp;a multi-pronged effort to tackle spam, which was said at that time to cost Singapore some $23 million in productivity loss each year.&nbsp; Ideally, the fight against spam should be industry-driven.&nbsp; Education is the best option in the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have said that the legislation alone will not solve the problem at hand.&nbsp; This is because most of the messages received come from overseas.&nbsp; In fact, according to IDA, 77% of spam originates from outside Singapore.&nbsp; With no cross-border agreements in this area, there is really very little that can be done to address this at the very moment.&nbsp; Perhaps, so,&nbsp;but legislation is a pivotal part of the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No laws&nbsp;have ever totally removed criminal behaviour.&nbsp; We know this.&nbsp; Nevertheless, having said that, laws are a much needed deterrent.&nbsp; The same can be said in this particular case for the Spam Control Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny Levinson, a representative for anti-spam organisation, the Spamhaus Project in China, was quoted as saying <p align=left>Column: 594<p>that spam is \"like influenza&nbsp;-&nbsp;we can build tools to avoid this scourge but influenza always remain\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Spam Control Bill is meant to safeguard consumers.&nbsp; Marketers are compelled to label their messages clearly as advertisements.&nbsp; A recipient will be given the right to exercise his choice to receive or refuse such messages.&nbsp; If&nbsp;the request of the recipient is ignored, he can take the perpetrator to court.&nbsp; It sounds very straightforward, at least, in theory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me bring the attention of this House to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 in the United States that has been described as a toothless law.&nbsp; Obviously, it has proven to be ineffective.&nbsp; If so, I hope we will not end up in a similar situation in Singapore.&nbsp; Also, I must add -&nbsp;it is possible that we swing to the other extreme of the spectrum&nbsp;in our enthusiasm to implement this new law -&nbsp;we must be careful not to hamper business operations.&nbsp; Legitimate Internet email traffic, such as online marketing, should not be interrupted. I believe this is what industry experts fear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this danger.&nbsp; That is why good laws alone cannot work.&nbsp; We need knowledgeable implementers, people who fully understand</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In addition to anti-spam laws, industry self-regulation and public education on, say, anti-spam technology are vital in helping us&nbsp;to fight against&nbsp;spam.&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, most of the spam is generated overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe that IDA will find ways to work with other international bodies such as APEC and the <p align=left>Column: 595<p>International Telecommunication Union to crack down on spam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

One of my contacts has come across&nbsp;the estate of a man who died more than 20 years ago and he did not make a will, nor did he have a family.&nbsp; So the money of this man's estate is now lying unclaimed.&nbsp; It is a sum of US$1 million and there's a way to get the money released with your assistance.&nbsp; And of course there will be financial rewards for your participation in claiming this money.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I will stop here since by this time, you would have seen <p align=left>Column: 596<p>through my ruse.&nbsp; Yes, this is a spam mail.&nbsp; As this is a trick, of course I do not have anything that could benefit you -&nbsp;only a scam that would benefit me, should you swallow it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although&nbsp;the above&nbsp;is a spam mail, it&nbsp;can still get money out of people.&nbsp; There are thousands of such spam mails flying around in the cyberspace waiting to strike at innocent people.&nbsp; From the stories that we have heard from people or&nbsp;read in the newspapers, indeed there have been people cheated out of their money or even life savings by unsolicited spam mails.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there have been many arguments in support of the Bill which we have heard from a few Members speaking before me.&nbsp; The main one being protection of&nbsp;consumers.&nbsp; Spam mails, such as the one that I had tried to replicate&nbsp;above,&nbsp;often put out false claims and it is to the consumer's benefit that we restrict the propagation of false information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Privacy is&nbsp;another argument being put forward.&nbsp; Spammers invade our privacy, for example, by making us read about&nbsp;Viagra and Mega Man when we are at home writing parliamentary speeches at 12 o'clock midnight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to highlight another argument, ie, there is an economic cost to spam mails.&nbsp; What I did just now in my opening paragraphs took about 50 seconds.&nbsp; If the House was full, it would have meant about 50 seconds from each of the 84 Members and, in total, a full 70 minutes in lost time.&nbsp; And of course we know that the spam multiplies easily and effortlessly, so the economic consequences are also multiplied.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a little survey in my workplace and the purpose was to find out the number of spam mails received by my colleagues over a one-week period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty of my colleagues were respondents or victims to my survey.&nbsp; The total estimated<p align=left>Column: 597<p> number of spam received by them in a week is 2,800, or an average of 10 spam mails per person&nbsp;per day.&nbsp; Only two such mails were found remotely useful - one was for pizza promotion, another on travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither&nbsp;was acted upon in the end.&nbsp; And, yet, each spam mail has taken a few seconds to a minute or two for the recipients to open and read it or to click and delete it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these numbers mean that there is a certain wastage of time and loss of productivity to the email recipients.&nbsp; There is also an increased risk of virus attack on the computer systems.&nbsp; Taking all this as a whole, the direct and indirect costs to our society are substantial&nbsp; and the wastage of time and the loss of opportunity costs are also enormous.&nbsp; The Minister just now put a price tag of $23 million for the loss of productivity a year.&nbsp; I suspect the number will increase.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about numbers, allow me to just&nbsp;churn out a few more statistics to illustrate the power of spam mails and&nbsp;the impact on individuals and countries.&nbsp; In 1978, a spam mail was sent to 600 addressees.&nbsp; This was probably the mother of all spam mails and in 1994, a first large-scale&nbsp;spam mail was sent to about 6,000 newsgroups,&nbsp;affecting millions of people.&nbsp; In June 2005, the number of spam mails rocketed to 30 billion a day,&nbsp;and one year later in June 2006, it reached 55 billion a day.&nbsp; Another six months down the road, in December 2006,&nbsp;it went&nbsp;up to 85 billion a day and in February this year, 90 billion a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as I am speaking now, the number of spam mails is multiplied by the millions worldwide and&nbsp;as the&nbsp;Hon. Member, Ms Penny Low, said just now,&nbsp;even Microsoft Chairman, Mr Bill Gates, received up to 4 million emails a day and most of them are spam.&nbsp; And I recall hearing a report about this on the BBC in November 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-and-a-half years down the road, I am sure<p align=left>Column: 598<p> Mr Bill Gates' email would have been multiplied by now and he has to set up a department whose main function is to filter out all the unwanted mails.&nbsp; Such is the impact of spam mails, and the high cost to filter them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, spam mails are growing in astronomical number, with no sign of abating.&nbsp; Actions must be taken to curtail the growth of spam mails.&nbsp; In the USA, President George W Bush signed the first Anti-Spam Law in 2003 and, likewise, Australia, UK, Japan, South Korea have done so.&nbsp; It is therefore timely for our Government to also put in place a control mechanism to try to prevent the avalanche of spam mails from blanketing and suffocating the email users in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some argue that the proposed Spam Control Bill may be a toothless tiger since most of the spam mails come from overseas.&nbsp; While it is true that many of the spam mails may come from overseas, tightening up the control is nevertheless a useful step forward as a start.&nbsp; Even if it may reduce the total amount of spam by only 10%-20%, it is still 10%-20% increase of the time saved and increase in&nbsp;productivity.&nbsp; As more countries are putting in place anti-spam law, gradually there will be a worldwide effort to check the expansion of spam mails.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the proposed Spam Control Bill has covered email quite adequately, in my opinion, and it has also covered SMS and MMS too.&nbsp; For me, this seems to be a reasonably first step at this stage of development.&nbsp; However, I hope the Ministry could keep the options open on the need to finetune the Bill in future to take into account new technologies that could create new types of spam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a consumer advocate and&nbsp;a member of CASE, I rise in support of <p align=left>Column: 599<p>the Bill.&nbsp; I will be speaking from the point of view as a consumer who has been plagued with spam, although I have not been plagued by interviewers, like Mr Sam Tan, before.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, spam is unsolicited email which is sent to an Internet user or email user in bulk.&nbsp; Spam is a nuisance to Internet users, a threat to network security on valuable computer resources.&nbsp; It also causes the consumer substantial amount of time.&nbsp; In fact, there have been studies which suggest that a person will receive an average of 2,200 emails a year or six spam emails a day, and I am sure many Members of this House would attest to the fact that&nbsp;they have received more than six spam emails a day.&nbsp; If the heading of the spam mail is unclear or vague as to its usefulness, it would take you about 10 seconds to open the email, read the advertisement and then delete the email from your system.&nbsp; Just to give you an example.&nbsp; I went through some of&nbsp;my email and the heading reads \"Waiting for your mail\",&nbsp;\"Possimon&nbsp;or Synchronism\" -&nbsp;whatever that means, \"U VIP Casino\".&nbsp; So when you receive email like this, you really do not know what&nbsp;it is&nbsp;all about, and if you are a bit more inquisitive, you would take that amount of time to open it, read it and then delete it.&nbsp; So, in total, you will waste six to seven hours of your time each year just clearing spam emails.&nbsp; If your computer system is slower, it may take you a longer period of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I recently installed an Internet anti-virus and anti-spam software on my computer but somehow now the regular email even from the Law Society is classified as spam and so too are some of the other emails which I receive from my clients.&nbsp; Even emails from friends, like Sam, about lunch get classified as spam email.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are real limitations to efforts to try to filter or block spam as legitimate email messages may also get blocked out.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 600<p> Hence, I strongly support the Spam Control Bill as it will facilitate the management of spam and provides recourse for individuals and organisations to act against spammers.&nbsp; It also requires spammers to mark their mails as advertisement and this will enable individuals and organisations to differentiate solicited and unsolicited mail.&nbsp; So, as a consumer, you can just click \"Delete\" if you do not wish to open a spam email which is advertisement.&nbsp; I am also glad, Sir, that the Bill empowers individuals and organisations to commence civil action against spammers.&nbsp; They would be able to either claim for damages or seek statutory damages from a spammer acting in contravention of the Act.&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;an individual's point right to commence civil action has its limitation as many individuals will not have the financial resources to want to commence expensive civil suits just because they have been spammed.&nbsp; It will be useful for the Bill to allow individuals to commence class action against spammers so as to decrease legal costs for the individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under the Bill, Internet access service providers and telecommunications service providers may also issue a code of practice that sets minimum standards of technical control for spam.&nbsp; The commitment of these service providers to prevent spam and their compliance to a code of practice will be a boost to fighting spam.&nbsp; I know of a company that sent spam advertisements previously and after a number of complaints were registered, the Internet access service provider closed that account and imposed a hefty fine on the company.&nbsp; Sir, I wish that our Internet service providers and telecommunication service providers would also do likewise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all that, Sir, I would also wish to express some concerns on certain aspects of the Bill which require closer scrutiny.&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;I am concerned,&nbsp;with this legislation, whether we are&nbsp;unwittingly <p align=left>Column: 601<p>legitimising spam.&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the spammers comply with the requirements in the Second Schedule of the Bill, does this mean that they can go ahead to spam consumers as, in this case, consent from consumers is not required under this Bill?&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;like many other speakers before me, I am concerned about the opt-out provision for recipients of spam email in the Bill.&nbsp; This places the onus on individuals to unsubscribe from unsolicited emails.&nbsp; Considering the large volume of spam emails that an individual or consumer may receive, this places an unfair burden on consumers to unsubscribe from this spam email.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some years ago, Sir, I created a hotmail account.&nbsp; A few days after creating the account, I received some spam pornographic emails which I did not want.&nbsp; I then clicked \"Unsubscribe\" for the email.&nbsp; I never really know whether it worked but what happened was that I received lots and lots more of such emails promoting various other types of pornographic services.&nbsp; If any of the Members would like to find out more, just go and create a hotmail account, and they are promoting Viagra, gambling, mortgage services and the like.&nbsp; I was told by members in the industry that spam companies buy data based on your profile when you click \"Create an account\" and when you click unsubscribe, you are effectively telling the spammers that this Internet account is active.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In any event, by the time you click \"unsubscribe\", your email address may have been sold to traders of email addresses. So now, I never click \"unsubscribe\" anymore.&nbsp; I just click \"delete\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For that reason, Sir, I would prefer to have an opt-in provision as this will minimise cost to the individual consumer and shift the onus to businesses to ascertain that mails are only sent to recipients who have consented to <p align=left>Column: 602<p>receiving their advertisements. To increase the effectiveness of the Bill, I would strongly urge for the inclusion of an opt-in provision.&nbsp; And I understand that this is the case in the European Union and in Australia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, in spite of my support, I do wish to highlight that there are severe limitations to this Bill as it is not effective against spam mail that originates from overseas.&nbsp; Mr Eddie Ho, an analyst,&nbsp;wrote in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 24th February 2007 that he estimates that 90% of spam that Singaporeans receive come from abroad. This means that the various pornographic marketing materials, the false stories of recipients striking lottery or the get-rich scams like what Mr Sam Tan had just tried to convince us about, the marketing of health products like Viagra from suspicious origins, etc, will continue to plague us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do recognise, Sir, that this Bill is a small step towards control of a growing problem.&nbsp; And as spam mail becomes a greater concern worldwide, the Government should explore cross border collaboration on the control of spam mail. This will complement our effort to control spam. Otherwise, all the efforts in this Bill will come to naught.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, like Mr Siew, I also wish to ask the Minister whether there are any steps to control spam mail from faxes.&nbsp; I used to receive lots of spam faxes everyday promoting maid agencies, tuition agencies, tours, stationery, computers, etc, and this costs me toner cost and paper cost plus loss of productivity, checking whether they are relevant.&nbsp; I have since installed a software to filter all these out, but, nevertheless, unless you invest in a software, you will continue to receive spam faxes everyday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Miss Penny Low and the other <p align=left>Column: 603<p>Members who have spoken on the Bill.&nbsp; I thank them for their support for the Bill.&nbsp; Even as they gave their support, they also shared their concerns and reservations on certain aspects of the Bill.&nbsp; I appreciate their comments and agree that in some aspects, this Bill is not a \"cure all\" for the spam problem.&nbsp; And I have made&nbsp;quite clear in my Second Reading speech earlier that this is not&nbsp;a magic bullet that will eradicate spam once and for all.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me address some of the concerns that have been raised. Mdm Ho Geok Choo had queried the need for this Bill since most of the spam originates from overseas.&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan and Mr Lim Biow Chuan have also rightly pointed out that most of these spams received in Singapore originate from overseas and such senders will not be subjected to our laws as they will be outside the jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question that we then ask ourselves is:&nbsp; if this is the case, do we then give local spammers a completely free hand or should we at least move to have some orderliness and some norms of behaviour, when <I>bona fide</I> agencies send out spam or unsolicited electronic messages?&nbsp; Other countries have to grapple with this problem - the UK, Australia, US, South Korea, Japan. They have studied this problem. They have decided to&nbsp;enact&nbsp;spam control laws. And as Mr Siew pointed out earlier on, in the case of the US CAN-SPAM&nbsp;Act, it did not turn out to be as effective and it did not result in a drastic reduction in the volume of spam. But that does not mean that these laws are completely unnecessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to&nbsp;expect&nbsp;that as more countries enact legislation to deal with spam, the spammers will be on the look-out for new base and&nbsp;new havens for them to operate from.&nbsp; They are, in fact, very likely to target countries that have advanced infocomm connectivities and are<p align=left>Column: 604<p> without anti-spam legislation. So Singapore&nbsp;could well become a target for spammers to operate from.&nbsp; Of course, we have excellent international infocomm connectivity worldwide and we have a very well-established infocomm industry here in Singapore. So we should not allow ourselves to become a spammer's haven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, a spam control law will signal our readiness to address the global problem of spam.&nbsp; It will certainly help to maintain Singapore's standing as a trusted infocomm hub.&nbsp; I have already pointed out that today, the Internet&nbsp;service providers can only seek legal protection under the Computer Misuse Act if they face severe disruption to network infrastructure or if they suffer a denial of service as&nbsp;a result of spam.&nbsp; Fortunately, or unfortunately, spammers generally do not cause such severe breakdown of services. Therefore, there is a need for this Bill which will address spam specific issues and provide an additional recourse for businesses and consumers adversely affected by spam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Ho's view that local Internet access service providers are better equipped to address the problem of spam than the typical man-in-the-street - the user of email, for instance.&nbsp; But this is not an either/or&nbsp;situation.&nbsp; The Bill aims to provide aggrieved party, be it an ISP or&nbsp;an individual computer email user, with a means for&nbsp;civil recourse against someone who is persistently spamming him.&nbsp; As so vividly described by Mr Sam Tan, spammers indiscriminately send out large volumes of promotional emails with the hope of achieving some financial gains. The remedies proposed under this Bill will provide deterrence in the form of court ordered financial compensation for indiscriminate spamming.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ISPs and operators will now be provided with the means for civil recourse should they be negatively impacted by a surge in Internet traffic as a result of non-<p align=left>Column: 605<p>compliance spamming activities.&nbsp; In this respect, Mdm Ho is correct that the Internet service providers are most impacted cost-wise by their need to handle the large volume of spam that can occur occasionally.&nbsp; ISPs also have access to the system view which makes them well-positioned to leverage on this legislation to take spammers to task.&nbsp; My Ministry is supportive of initiatives, legal and/or operational, undertaken by the ISPs and service providers to deter indiscriminate spamming as any measures to address spam at the network level will certainly also benefit individual&nbsp;users.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low, Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Lim Biow Chuan have expressed concern over the opt-out regime, requiring users to unsubscribe from the unsolicited electronic messages.&nbsp; I note&nbsp;that Mr Siew, who started out also supporting the opt-in approach, had declared that he has come around to see the benefit of a balanced opt-out approach.&nbsp; I thank him for the support of this opt-out approach that we have chosen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the concern expressed by the Members about unsubscribing and that the act of unsubscribing will confirm their email address and could result in more spams being sent to the recipient.&nbsp; This is a real and valid concern.&nbsp; My Ministry and IDA are fully aware of how spammers operate. However, we must know that spam is a fact of life in this age of digital communication. Whatever we do, let us be realistic. Spam is going to be around.&nbsp; It is not going to be eradicated completely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, every user of electronic communication - every email user, every mobile messaging user&nbsp;- will have to learn how to deal with spam.&nbsp; As Mr Zainudin puts it, education is the best way to fight spam and I think Mr Siew also strongly emphasised the importance<p align=left>Column: 606<p> of education.&nbsp; I thank them for their comments in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from having this Spam Control Bill, we must continue with our public education.&nbsp; In particular, we must educate users to exercise their discretion and judgement before unsubscribing. There are several options.&nbsp; Most users will delete all spams as a default action.&nbsp; They will set their mail filter&nbsp;to delete all spams.&nbsp; More sophisticated users, on the other hand, will judge the reliability of the source of the spam before deciding whether to respond, delete, unsubscribe or to filter the message in some other ways.&nbsp; This Bill sets out the basic requirements for legitimate direct electronic mass marketing and configure the unsubscribe process as consumer-friendly as possible. Any user who chooses to unsubscribe with a responsible&nbsp;direct marketer will now have an easy means to do so.&nbsp; I think that is the thrust of the Bill&nbsp;to provide consumers with a convenient way to unsubscribe. Whether you actually unsubscribe or not is a matter of judgement.&nbsp; For that, the consumer himself must take the responsibility and must exercise the judgement of that option carefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I would like to address Mr Lim's concern on whether we are legitimising&nbsp;spam through this Bill. Sir, this Bill should be seen as separating the responsible marketers from the irresponsible spammers so that Internet service providers and users can take those who are irresponsible to task under the provisions of this Bill. Miss Penny Low mentioned that since the Bill targets messages with the Singapore link,&nbsp;our commercial operators,&nbsp;businessmen and companies&nbsp;will be disadvantaged as spams that originate overseas do not have to submit to our requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have to take a practical approach.&nbsp; Like all issues that are of a <p align=left>Column: 607<p>cross border nature, it is inevitable that the effectiveness of our spam control law and regulations could be constrained by the limits of our national jurisdiction. To overcome this constraint, continuing effort in international collaboration by Singapore with other like-minded countries is an essential part of that action to combat spam.&nbsp; I have explained this in my Second Reading speech.&nbsp; Singapore will certainly continue to collaborate with our partners to work on international measures to control the spread of spam.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked that the &lt;ADV&gt;&nbsp; tag be removed so as to create a level playing field for our local SMEs.&nbsp; Sir, I like to point out that the &lt;ADV&gt; labelling requirement balances the needs of the senders and the concerns of the recipients of such messages.&nbsp; Firstly, it empowers the individual to control what actually comes into his inbox.&nbsp; It is true that some users might indeed set their spam filter to delete all messages with the &lt;ADV&gt; label.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the user's conscious&nbsp;choice.&nbsp; He or she is entitled to reject advertisements in any form, with or without the &lt;ADV&gt; label.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, individuals who see the value of legitimate marketing email could set their filter to move these messages into a holding folder for later viewing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the responsible use of the &lt;ADV&gt; label by legitimate marketers enhances the value of email advertisements as a cost-effective marketing tool. This is because the individual who reads and responds to these &lt;ADV&gt; messages implicitly acknowledges the sender as a legitimate marketer.&nbsp;Compliance with the &lt;ADV&gt; labelling requirement could serve as simple first level indication to a consumer that the email sender is a legitimate marketer.&nbsp; This will further encourage responsible marketers to be more targeted in their approach of sending &lt;ADV&gt; messages and to differentiate themselves from the indiscriminate foreign spammers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 608<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low and Mr Zainudin commented on the need for international collaboration. These are valid comments.&nbsp; I agree with them.&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;reiterate that legislation&nbsp;is but one of the measures in our multi-pronged approach to address spam.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another important component is, of course, international cooperation.&nbsp; Once the Bill is passed, it will give clarity with regard to Singapore's spam control regime.&nbsp; This would enable better and more meaningful engagement with the international community for further collaboration in the global effort against spam.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to reassure the House that my Ministry will certainly work with all like-minded countries and international organisations to more effectively combat spam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Miss Penny Low had queried whether unsolicited messages sent by a private company, charitable organisation or Government agency will fall under this Bill.&nbsp; Such messages would fall under the Bill if they are unsolicited and primarily commercial in nature, because the Bill deals with&nbsp; electronic messages.&nbsp; In such cases, these messages would have to comply with the&nbsp;unsubscribe and the labelling requirements set out in the Second Schedule&nbsp;of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; However, I would like to highlight that non-commercial electronic messages, such as those promoting charitable causes or promoting volunteerism which are sent out by non-profit organisations, will not be caught&nbsp;under the Bill, provided these messages do not advertise, promote or offer goods and services for sale.&nbsp; Government agencies that send out mass messages in the context of promoting a public cause or&nbsp;of&nbsp;public interest in an emergency will also not be caught under this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, commercial spam forms the bulk of the spam received by users, and&nbsp;commercial spam&nbsp;is a well defined area.&nbsp; That is the target for this Bill and we should keep it this way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 609<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew expressed concern as to why messages sent as a result of a pre-existing relationship was not addressed under the definition of \"unsolicited electronic messages\" in the Bill.&nbsp; Sir, one key consideration was the ambiguity involved in the definition of what constitutes \"pre-existing relationship\".&nbsp; For instance, a customer may have simply purchased a product from a company leaving behind his contact particulars for the purpose of registration and warranty.&nbsp; In this sense,&nbsp;a pre-existing relationship exists.&nbsp; Most Members would agree that this should not automatically constitute&nbsp;consent for the company to spam the customer with electronic marketing materials regarding other products by the same company, unless the customer has specifically consented to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with Mr Siew that we should have clarity on this point.&nbsp; Hence, the Bill adopts the approach of defining the term \"unsolicited\" as an individual not having requested or consented to receiving the message.&nbsp; In this way, the boundaries are clearly defined with much less ambiguity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this does not mean that companies wanting to leverage on the existing customer database for legitimate marketing purposes cannot do so.&nbsp; It simply means that under the proposed opt-out regime, which Mr Siew supports, these companies would need to comply with requirements stipulated in the Second Schedule of the Bill when sending out their messages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even if a pre-existing relationship exists, I would suggest that it is good and socially responsible business practice to label marketing messages clearly and accurately, as well as to allow customers the choice to unsubscribe from such mass circulation and to honour such choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 610<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low had remarked that it would not be viable to expect online marketing companies to restrict themselves to 100 messages within a 24-hour period, as their business normally depends on a large volume of emails being sent out.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to clarify that this Bill places no such restriction on companies.&nbsp; Instead, it mandates that mass messages above this volume are required to adhere to the requirements set out in the Second Schedule.&nbsp; Hence, companies are not restricted in their legitimate marketing activities as long as they comply with the provisions of this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has also pointed out that there may be various ways of circumventing the bulk threshold.&nbsp; In this instance, I am of the view that the requirements that are imposed by this Bill are not so onerous as to incentivise companies and marketers to adopt such elaborate and complicated manoeuvres.&nbsp; I would like to advise against making this Bill too complex in order to cater to all kinds of possibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the issue of use of address harvesting software&nbsp;or dictionary attacks, Miss Low had proposed that the Bill should focus on how the list was being used instead of the methods that were being employed in the generation of the list.&nbsp; I would like to clarify that clause 9 of the Bill states that \"no person shall send, cause to be sent, or authorise the sending of, electronic message through the use of dictionary attack or address harvesting software.\"&nbsp; This means that the Bill focuses on preventing the use of address harvesting software and dictionary attack to send spam without prohibiting the use of such software for other legitimate purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho raised the issue of computers being hijacked and used to send spam.&nbsp; I would like to highlight that the hijacking of computers to create zombie computers is, in fact, a serious <p align=left>Column: 611<p>offence.&nbsp; Spammers who hijack other people's computers can be dealt with under the existing Computer Misuse Act for committing unauthorised access.&nbsp; I would like to assure this House that unsuspecting owners of hijacked computers would not be caught under this Bill if they can show that the sending of spam was the result of malicious intervention by a computer programme or a third party.&nbsp; The Bill is very clear in its intent to curb illegal spamming activities by specifically targeting the spammer and not innocent third parties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has suggested that we emulate the Japanese spam regime by getting a state agency to intervene on behalf of individual users who suffer the nuisance of spam.&nbsp; Mr Siew has also mentioned enforcement action taken by the Federal Trade Commission in the US.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in response to these examples from other jurisdictions raised by Members, I would like to advise against making such comparison of the role played by governments across the different spam control regimes.&nbsp; While we have studied and tried to adopt other people's best practices, we cannot import wholesale the approaches being used elsewhere.&nbsp; Different regimes have different approaches.&nbsp; Each regime is shaped by the respective historical and infocomm development, which in turn influences the public's view and expectation of the role of government in spam control regimes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight that the enactment of this Spam Control Act is but the first step in erecting a spam control regime for Singapore.&nbsp; We are starting with a light touch approach with more focus on industry self-regulation.&nbsp; If subsequent development of the landscape calls for a heavier role of the Government, we are open to suggestions on how to improve the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Siew had requested for a clarification on the nature of the code of<p align=left>Column: 612<p> practice, as stated under clause 16 of the Bill, given that the consequences for non-compliance&nbsp;are not clear.&nbsp; I would like to clarify that under clause 16(2), the issuance of a code of practice by the industry is voluntary.&nbsp; Compliance may or may not be mandatory depending on the terms of the code that have been adopted by the industry and also the adopted enforcement mechanism.&nbsp; One possibility could be expulsion from an industry group which may result in a certain amount of bad publicity and odium.&nbsp;Industry players may become&nbsp;sensitive to such adverse publicity, so there will be an incentive for them to comply with the code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are really issues for industry players and the relevant industry associations to decide.&nbsp; Hence, I agree with Mr Zainudin when he pointed out that the fight against spam must involve industry players, and this is in line with my Ministry's effort to encourage greater industry self-regulation whenever possible under our multi-pronged partnership approach towards addressing the spam problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in recent years, IDA has been working with the relevant industry associations, such as the Direct Marketing Association of Singapore and the Contact Centre Association of Singapore, to set direct marketing guidelines and a code of ethics.&nbsp; This is in response to Mr Siew's remark on why nothing has been said about telemarketing in the Bill.&nbsp; I am glad to inform him that the industry and the stakeholders have been more than receptive to IDA's concern on telemarketing practices.&nbsp; Hence, we would like to give the industry the opportunity to demonstrate their readiness and ability to regulate their practices in telemarketing before Government steps in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Siew queried the exclusion of fax messages from the Bill.&nbsp; We have focused the scope of this Bill on emails and mobile messages <p align=left>Column: 613<p>owing to the prevalence of email spam and the potential of mobile spam to become a bigger problem in the future.&nbsp; Faxes have been in use much longer than email.&nbsp; Thus far, it has not caused the same level of nuisance or abuse unlike email, although I take note of Mr Lim Biow Chuan's comment about his personal experience in his office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason may be that fax messages do not have the same reach as mobile electronic messages or emails, given that fax machines are neither personalised equipment&nbsp;- we do not carry our fax machines with us everywhere we go - nor are they prevalent in our households, unlike computers.&nbsp; In the light of this experience, my Ministry has decided at this juncture not to include fax transmission within the ambit of the proposed Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Miss Penny Low enquired whether a survey on spam would be carried out after the Bill is passed.&nbsp; I would like to assure this House that IDA will continue to monitor the spam situation and work closely with the industry players and&nbsp;the ISP to have a sense of how this problem is evolving.&nbsp; This monitoring action will include conducting the appropriate surveys to ascertain the impact and the effectiveness of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill represents, as I said earlier on, the first step towards having a legislative regime to regulate and to control spam activities in Singapore.&nbsp; This is not the end.&nbsp; We are taking the first step.&nbsp; And in the light of experience, we will be able to perhaps modify or amend the law in future so that we can have a more effective regime to address this growing problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope I have addressed Members' concerns and seek the support of the House on the Spam Control Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 614<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Dentists (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Dentists Act (Chapter 76 of the 2000 Revised Edition). The proposed amendments will ensure that our laws are relevant to the practice of dentistry today. The amendments will also enhance the powers of the Dental Council so that it may perform its regulatory functions more effectively.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Background</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans enjoy a high standard of dental care that is easily accessible. Today, we have about 1,250 registered dentists working in the public and private sectors providing a wide range of dental care and services to our population.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 20% of our registered dentists have on their own volition upgraded their skills in specific areas of dentistry such as orthodontics, prosthodontics, oral&nbsp;and maxillofacial surgery, periodontics, endodontics and paediatric dentistry. These \"dental specialists\" provide a higher level of dental care to patients whose dental conditions require management by a<p align=left>Column: 615<p> dentist with specialised training. Although developed countries such as the USA, UK, Australia, Sweden and Switzerland already have a separate register for dental specialists, our specialists are neither recognised nor regulated under the present Dentists Act, other than as registered dentists.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral health therapists, ie, dental therapists and dental hygienists, have been providing basic dental care in developed countries such as the USA, UK, Australia and Germany. In Singapore, such therapists, who have been allowed to be employed by the Health Promotion Board, have been providing basic dental care to our schoolchildren for many years. The registration and regulation of oral health therapists will ensure that these therapists, who would now be able to seek employment in the private sector as well, are adequately trained to provide basic dental care to the public.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to update the Act to ensure that our laws continue to be relevant to the practice of dentistry today, by recognising and regulating the work of dental specialists and oral health therapists. The proposed amendments will also enhance the role and processes of the Dental Council to enable it to perform its regulatory functions more effectively, and allow for the introduction of compulsory continuing professional education so that the Council can raise and maintain professional standards of dental practice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now elaborate on the amendments which I have just highlighted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Setting up of a Dental Specialists' Register</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments proposed under clauses 12 and 25 provide for the setting up of a separate register for dental specialists, and the registration of such specialists.</p><p align=left>Column: 616<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dental specialists are recognised in countries like the USA, UK, Australia, Sweden and Switzerland, as I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; In the USA, a dentist is recognised as a specialist when he obtains his specialist board certification.&nbsp; UK, Australia, Sweden and Switzerland provide for the registration of dental specialists in a register that is separate from that for other dentists.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we have a good number of dentists who have specialised in specific areas of dentistry. They provide a higher level of dental care to our patients. A Dental Specialists&rsquo; Register will list these dental specialists and their area of specialty. This will allow patients who require specialised dental treatment to easily identify an appropriate dental specialist. Local and overseas general dental practitioners and medical practitioners will also be able to identify such dental specialists so that they can make referrals when necessary.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By recognising and regulating dental specialists, we would also, firstly, motivate more dentists to aspire towards specialisation; secondly, encourage dental specialists to remain competent in their areas of specialisation; and, thirdly, protect the public by ensuring that only dentists with the appropriate qualifications may hold themselves out to be specialists in the appropriate areas of specialisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Registration and regulation of oral health therapists</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the proposed amendments, a new division will be inserted to provide for the registration of oral health therapists.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In countries such as the USA, UK, Australia, Germany and New Zealand, oral health therapists support a dentist's practice and provide basic dental care.&nbsp; In<p align=left>Column: 617<p> Singapore, oral health therapists have been providing basic dental care to primary school students for many years. Basic dental care includes procedures such as scaling and polishing of teeth.&nbsp; By allowing oral health therapists to provide cost-effective basic dental care, dentists will be motivated to improve on their skills and perform more complex dental procedures. The registration and regulation of oral health therapists will help assure the public that these therapists will be appropriately trained and accredited for the skilled provision of basic dental care.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The registration and regulation of dental specialists and oral health therapists will create a continuum of skilled and affordable dental care that the public can choose from.</p><p><br><I>Enhanced Dental Council</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me move on to the amendments to enhance the role and processes of the Dental Council.</p><p><br><I>Compulsory continuing professional education for dentists</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dental science is constantly improving. Therefore, there is a need for dentists to maintain the currency of their professional knowledge and to stay abreast of developments in dental science and practice.&nbsp; Continuing professional education is a well-accepted mechanism to achieve this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment proposed under clause 14 will enable the Dental Council to prescribe conditions for the grant and renewal of practising certificates, including mandatory participation in continuing professional education. Only dentists who accumulate the minimum continuing professional education points specified by the Dental Council will be issued with practising certificates, or will have their certificates renewed.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 618<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing professional education for dentists is already a requirement in developed countries, such as the USA and UK.&nbsp; In Singapore, continuing medical education has been linked to the renewal of practising certificates for medical practitioners since 2003. Compulsory continuing professional education for dentists will help ensure that standards of dental care in Singapore remain high.</p><p><br><I>Compulsory voting</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voting of members for the Dental Council is currently compulsory for all registered dentists. The proposed amendments will make compulsory voting applicable only to registered dentists with current practising certificates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Registrar of the Dental Council</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2001, the Chief Dental Officer, Ministry of Health, has been appointed as the Registrar of the Dental Council. The proposed amendments will formalise this practice.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enable the Registrar to carry out his duties effectively, he will be empowered to remove from the appropriate Registers the names of persons who have:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; not renewed their practising certificates for a continuous period of five years and who cannot be contacted; or</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; requested and shown sufficient reason for his name to be removed from the register, unless an enquiry or proceedings have commenced against the person.</p><p><br><I>Conditional and temporary registration</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments will allow, in addition to full registration, the conditional and temporary registration of dentists.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 619<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dental Council will conditionally register a dentist if it is of the view that the person should work under the supervision of a fully registered dentist for a time. Such persons include those whose qualifications or experience do not allow them to be fully registered in the first instance, such as a foreign-trained graduate. In such cases, the Dental Council will explicitly state the conditions of registration.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporary registration will be granted to a person who does not have a local degree and who, for instance, is in Singapore for the purpose of teaching, research or to pursue a postgraduate study in dentistry.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This scheme of full, conditional and temporary registration is similar to that for medical practitioners under the Medical Registration Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enhanced disciplinary processes</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enable the Dental Council to carry out its regulatory duties effectively, the proposed amendments will grant the Council and its committees enhanced powers in respect of disciplinary matters.&nbsp; In summary:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;The Dental Council will be empowered to direct that an inquiry be continued even if the complainant withdraws his complaint before it is referred to a Complaints Committee, a Health Committee, a Disciplinary Committee or before the conclusion of the inquiry of the above-mentioned committees.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) A Complaints Committee will be empowered to decide on its own motion to inquire into a matter when it receives information regarding the conduct or physical or mental fitness of a dentist or an oral health therapist which may give rise to proceedings against the dentist or the oral health therapist under the Act.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 620<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) A Disciplinary Committee will be empowered to refer information to the relevant authorities for further investigation if there are reasons for the committee to believe that a criminal offence(s) has been committed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The Chairmen of Disciplinary Committees will be selected from a panel of senior, well-respected dentists appointed by the Minister for Health. A disciplinary committee will also include non-Council members as well as a lay observer.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) The maximum penalty that may be imposed by a Disciplinary Committee will be increased from $5,000 to $50,000.&nbsp; This increase in the maximum penalty will give a Disciplinary Committee the flexibility to impose a monetary penalty that is commensurate&nbsp;with the professional misconduct in question.</p><p><br><I>Appointment of Interim Orders Committee</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inquiries into disciplinary matters may take up to 24 months to complete and, presently, a dentist who is under investigation is still able to practise. This may not be entirely satisfactory in some situations as there may be compelling reasons to suspend such a dentist from practising, even before the outcome of his disciplinary inquiry, in the interest of public safety.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have therefore proposed a provision to allow the Dental Council to appoint an Interim Orders Committee with the power to suspend or restrict the practice of a registered dentist or a registered oral health therapist for the protection of members of the public or in the public interest, pending the completion of disciplinary proceedings against him.</p><p align=left>Column: 621<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To safeguard the rights of dental professionals, however, provisions have been inserted:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; to restrict a member of a Complaints Committee or Disciplinary Committee from participating as a member of an Interim Orders Committee inquiring into the same matter;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; to provide that no interim order shall be made unless the dental professional in question has been given an opportunity to appear before the Interim Orders Committee and present his case (either in person or by a legal representative);</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; to grant a dental professional a right of appeal to the High Court;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) to require the review of an interim order by an Interim Orders Committee after six months to determine if it should be revoked or amended and, following this first review, a further review every three months until the matter is settled, or until an Interim Orders Committee decides that the order is no longer necessary, or eighteen months after the initial issue of the order.&nbsp; An extension beyond eighteen months will require approval by the High Court.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These enhancements to the disciplinary processes, including the amendments to allow the appointment of Interim Orders Committees, are modelled on the provisions in the Medical Registration Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Composition of offences</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments have also been proposed to allow the Dental Council, with the approval of the Minister, to prescribe offences which may be compounded and, where appropriate, compound such offences.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 622<p><I>Change in name of the Dentists Act</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reflect the extension of the Act to cover dental specialists and oral health therapists, we further propose to change the name of the Act to the 'Dental Registration Act'.</p><p><br><I>Conclusion</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has, over the years, seen quantum improvements in the provision of dental care and services. Our dental professionals' standards of competency and commitment have led to a general state of good dental health and treatment in Singapore.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments will ensure that Singaporeans continue to enjoy access to dental care which is affordable and of consistently high standards.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Dentists (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; This Bill is necessary and timely.&nbsp; It will enhance the standards of professionalism in the practice of dentistry and further raise the quality of dental care services that are provided in Singapore.&nbsp; Improvements, such as the Continuing Professional Development Programmes and the Dental Specialists' Register, will also bring the practice of dentistry in line with that applicable to the medical doctors and also the practice found in many developed countries, a plus point for Singapore in our efforts to build up Singapore's reputation as a medical hub and to attract more foreign patients under Singapore Medicine.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has a good standard of dental care comparable to international standards.&nbsp; Among the population, <p align=left>Column: 623<p>especially younger&nbsp;Singaporeans, there is a high level of awareness&nbsp;about dental hygiene.&nbsp; Research done in 2003 showed that 45% of Singaporeans visited their dentists once every six months.&nbsp; Singapore's key approach in maintaining dental health is through prevention.&nbsp; Our school dental programme provides a very useful service.&nbsp; Every day, in our primary schools, all the kids&nbsp;will line up and be made to brush their teeth after recess.&nbsp; I was told that this is still the practice done in some schools, although some schools have discarded that practice. This is a good practice as it certainly helps to increase awareness and instil the habits of good dental hygiene among young children in the early days when such habits are not yet well established among our population.&nbsp; As a result of such initiatives, a 1994 survey showed that a child at the age of 12 had only one decayed, missing, or filled tooth and that 97% of Singapore's population at age 18 did not lose any permanent teeth as a result of tooth decay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite our good progress, one area that I feel deserves closer attention is how to better provide for the dental care needs of a&nbsp;rapidly ageing population, a point that I will revisit later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;let me now touch on some of the specific areas covered under the Act.&nbsp; I support the various measures instituted under the Bill to tighten control over discipline in the practice of&nbsp;dentistry, that is, increasing the fine to $50,000 and establishing&nbsp;an Interim Orders Committee.&nbsp; Although some dentists have expressed concern over the higher fine, this must be looked at in its proper context.&nbsp; Dentists who are honest and exercise their professional duty of care need not worry.&nbsp; But tighter discipline would generate&nbsp;greater public confidence and act as a better deterrent for errant dentists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for the first time, the Bill proposes the setting up of a Dental Specialists'<p align=left>Column: 624<p> Register which is already in place for the medical doctors.&nbsp; About 25% of the 1,250 registered dentists have undergone some form of specialised training.&nbsp; But there is no formal system of accessing and recognising those who have the qualifications and expertise to function as specialists.&nbsp; The register will thus help Singapore to develop and grow specialised dental practice which is required for the management of complex dental cases.&nbsp; It will also provide patients and the public with the proper level of care appropriate to their needs as they can more&nbsp;easily identify dentists who have specialised skills and expertise in specific areas of dentistry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, however, there are two issues that we need to address.&nbsp; First, there is a concern that the establishment of the Dental Specialists' Register and the registration of specialists would result in higher fees for patients.&nbsp; As dental care services in Singapore&nbsp;are primarily provided by private practitioners, this is a genuine concern that needs to be addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a Dental Specialists' Register, it is more difficult for specialists to charge higher fees&nbsp;because, to the patient, he is just like any other dentist.&nbsp; But with the register and a clear recognition of their status as specialists, the fear is that specialists will push up their fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, what we need in Singapore is to promote right siting of dental services.&nbsp; If there is no need for the patient to engage the services of a dental specialist, then it is a waste of resources and an over-consumption if patients start visiting specialists, instead of dentists, even for less complicated treatments, not to mention that this will also drive up cost.&nbsp; One way is for the Ministry of Health to publish the list of specialists as well as their fees for the various dental treatments.&nbsp; I hope that the specialists would also do the same by putting up the schedule of fees in their clinics as well.&nbsp; In <p align=left>Column: 625<p>this way, the public can compare prices and can also decide whether they want to seek the services of a specialist or a dentist with the clear understanding on the different fees that they may be charged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second issue is one of awareness and education.&nbsp; Public awareness of the existence of&nbsp;different types of specialties and the field of dentistry is extremely limited.&nbsp; To them, a dentist is someone who is medically trained to deal with all problems associated with the gums and teeth. In the old days,&nbsp;they used to be just pulling out your teeth.&nbsp; But now, it is a lot more sophisticated.&nbsp;They are not able to differentiate between the different types of specialists, whether it is orthodontists or periodontists, or whatever, that&nbsp;you may have.&nbsp;How to prevent confusion and ensure that people are able to&nbsp;make informed choices as to the level of care that they need?&nbsp; It is necessary to educate the public on the Dental Specialists' Register.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Ministry to look into this and come up with an appropriate education programme for the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also support the proposal to register and regulate oral health therapists, such as&nbsp;dental hygienists and dental therapists, who usually help the dentists but can also on their own&nbsp;do the routine chores associated with the practice of dentistry.&nbsp; I feel that the use of oral health therapists, subject to the various conditions stated in the Act, would help to reduce the costs to patients as&nbsp;there are some tasks that do not require the intervention of the dentist.&nbsp; As this is already done in other countries&nbsp;and as&nbsp;oral health therapists have already been widely used in our schools, registering&nbsp;and regulating them is a correct move.&nbsp; It would also help to promote greater professionalism and growth of the profession.&nbsp; However, there<p align=left>Column: 626<p> are two gaps that the Bill does not address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill does not define the job scope of the oral health therapists.&nbsp;With some&nbsp;ambiguity, will we have a situation where the oral health therapists&nbsp;may even end up doing the work of the qualified dentist although they may not be qualified to do so?&nbsp; I think it is important in the public interest, as well as in the interest of the oral health therapists themselves, to clearly define what would be the scope of work of oral health therapists&nbsp;so that&nbsp;the public is&nbsp;aware and understands what service they can expect from them.&nbsp; Oral health therapists are also now subject to the same discipline and penalties&nbsp;as dentists, stipulated under the Bill.&nbsp; Therefore, Sir, it is in the interest of the oral health therapists&nbsp;also to know what they can or cannot do in order to prepare themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the other point which the Bill does not address is the problem faced by many oral health therapists who are prohibited from providing treatment to patients above the age of 18 years.&nbsp; Last week, I had&nbsp;the chance to speak to some oral health therapists and they feel that this restriction limits their career development&nbsp;and scope of work as they could only provide service within our schools and they have no market value beyond that.&nbsp;The dentists in&nbsp;private practice will not find it practical to employ them since they cannot assist the dentists to treat patients who are above the age of 18 years.&nbsp; So if the intention of the Act in putting oral health therapists under the Dentists Act is that they can expand their scope and&nbsp;they can also practise in the private sector to&nbsp;help to reduce the cost for patients, then I think if this restriction is not removed, it will have limited application and impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the continuing professional development programme.&nbsp; Our dentists must keep pace with rapid changes made in scientific knowledge,<p align=left>Column: 627<p> dental practice and the development of new materials and technologies.&nbsp; The voluntary programme has not worked.&nbsp; Therefore, a compulsory programme has to be put in place in the public interest.&nbsp; I understand that, since September 2005, dentists need to complete 70 hours of continuing development programme over a two-year period and that, by September 2007, annual practising certificates will only be issued to dentists who fulfil this requirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I support this move, I&nbsp;have received feedback that older dentists who are in semi-retirement and who are not working full-time are worried with this requirement as they find that 70 hours&nbsp;are too long for them, considering that they do not work full-time.&nbsp; I would like to ask whether the Ministry can be more flexible in implementing the continuing professional development programme for such dentists so that their training hours could be shorter,&nbsp;or the 70 hours could be spread over a three-year period, instead of a two-year period, so that they will not lose their practising certificates.&nbsp; In this way, we also do not lose their years of skills and expertise which&nbsp;are valuable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, I wish to touch on the use of Medisave for dentistry services.&nbsp; I have received feedback from both patients and dentists who feel that the current provisions allowing Medisave to be used for approved dental procedures are very restrictive on two counts.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;the type of procedures for which it can be used is restrictive and should be expanded as dental technology has advanced so rapidly.&nbsp; But Medisave use is still restricted to the system in place 25 years ago.&nbsp; Second, the fees should also be revised, as the current table of fees is also 25 years old and may no longer be realistic.&nbsp; For example, with&nbsp;a rapidly ageing population, the need for dentures is more pervasive, especially among elderly patients.&nbsp; But they cannot use their Medisave or that of their children to pay for the cost<p align=left>Column: 628<p> of making dentures, which can be quite costly for the average elderly to pay out of their own pockets. I would like to suggest that&nbsp;MOH update or review the current allowable usage of limits for Medisave use for dental services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the population in Singapore is ageing very rapidly. One worry is that the elderly in Singapore tend to give dental care a lower priority than medical care.&nbsp; A study&nbsp;conducted by the Department of Preventive Dentistry of&nbsp;NUS in 1992 on the elderly who were in institutional&nbsp;care supports this finding.&nbsp; There does not seem to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;more recent research, but international research on this&nbsp;in more recent times supports the same&nbsp;finding.&nbsp; The study&nbsp;examined the existing arrangements for financial support of dental and medical care to elderly persons living in 68 long-term care facilities in Singapore.&nbsp; The results showed that&nbsp;a significantly higher number of&nbsp;homes, 93%, assumed responsibility for the provision of &nbsp;medical&nbsp;and dental care. A significantly greater proportion of them offered inhouse medical care,&nbsp;42%, compared to inhouse dental care, only 5%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we all agree that oral health is integral to an elderly person's general health and quality of life, and basic oral health services&nbsp;are an essential component of&nbsp;primary healthcare.&nbsp; There is therefore a need for us to ensure that dental care services are better designed so that there is a geriatric focus, and&nbsp;all students doing dentistry&nbsp;or receiving training as oral health therapists are taught about geriatric care. I hope that the Ministry will pay closer attention to this so that our elderly would also have access to quality dental health services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, this Bill would improve the quality and standard of dental care services in Singapore.&nbsp; And, therefore, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 629<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, dental practice and education are becoming more globalised today.&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Greater practitioner and patient mobility, the free flow of information, increasing global standards of care and new enhanced legal and economic frameworks are forcing countries to review dental licensure&nbsp;and specialisation as well as their continuing education programmes.&nbsp; These changes are to be expected and seen as a springboard of the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outdated concepts of regulation and the assumption that the profession alone knows best must be set aside in order to keep in step with the ever-increasing patient expectations and developments in healthcare provision and regulation. Dental care in Singapore is of world-class standard. The number of foreign patients seeking both general as well as specialised dental care here is certainly increasing.&nbsp; In line with all these changes, the introduction of these amendments&nbsp;is indeed timely and appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On registration, Sir, I fully support the differentiation set out pertaining to full conditional as well as temporary registration.&nbsp; This will make the definition and&nbsp;delineation of roles so much&nbsp;more clearer and, of course, it is also very similar to what the medical practitioners are already practising today which is working very well.&nbsp; Making it comparable for both professions is a positive step.&nbsp; Doctors and dentists, who have been deemed not ready to practise independently, should be given the due supervision they require to mature and excel.&nbsp; It is also important to differentiate between the general dentists and those who are specialised as their scope of practice, the types of equipment,&nbsp;the state-of-art technology and also the risk<p align=left>Column: 630<p> involved are very different. For dentists dealing with medical-related devices, such as dentures, braces, bridges and so on, they should be subjected to the Medical Products Act which has just been recently discussed in Parliament.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The payment of dental practice insurance may also differ from these different&nbsp;groups of dentists, just as we have doctors in the low, medium as well as high-risk disciplines paying different premiums.&nbsp; It is only fair for those performing more invasive and high-risk procedures to be more highly covered and insured as you can certainly say, \"Your bite is only as big as your teeth.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also very glad to see the introduction of registration and regulation for&nbsp;oral health therapists. This is&nbsp;a profession which has certainly not been given much focus and recognition despite the importance of their role.&nbsp; Many are today being sidelined still, except in the school dental health service where they play a very significant role even up to today. These are the group of people who can help with dental public education and creation of awareness, not just for children, but also for the public, and their knowledge and expertise are to be tapped in certainly a positive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this wider range of a more robust regulatory mechanism will also be in the interest of public protection and certainly safety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On accreditation, the Bill stipulates that the Dental Council is to have one academic representative who is the Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry at NUS&nbsp;(section 3.2(b)) and the academic representative of the Oral Health Therapists Accreditation Board to be one member of the academic staff of the dental hygiene and therapy course offered by Nanyang Polytechnic. This, Sir, may turn out to be very restrictive towards other institutions in future which may become engaged in training and education to serve the growing needs of our population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 631<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this new Bill must provide a leeway for future developments without having to propose a new amendment Bill every time to suit changes and evolution.&nbsp; So we hope that could be addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On oral health therapists, just as new fields in dental specialisation develops, the scope of work of&nbsp;oral health therapists should be expansive and not restrictive. The new Bill introduces two groups of oral health therapists, namely, the dental therapists and the dental hygienists, with a very narrow scope of work. Should not the scope of work for&nbsp;oral health therapists be allowed to expand, especially with a formal introduction of dental specialisation?&nbsp; Should not dental therapists be trained to complement, not just general dental works, but also specialised dental works as well?&nbsp; Dental therapists are currently trained in general dental restorative works, such as fillings and basic dentistry for minors up to the age of 18 years in school dental health service.&nbsp; If we are to support that expansion of services, how will they make the transition into practice that involves adult patients?&nbsp; There must, therefore, be some options and avenues for them to develop in order to make the transition and necessary adjustments.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also unclear from the Bill as to whether dental hygienists and therapists can set up independent practice after a prescribed period of supervised practice with a Division I qualified dentist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On CME, Sir, revalidation of members of the dental team is a proactive approach to regulation. Revalidation will now require them to demonstrate on a regular basis that they remain fit for continuing registration and thus worthy of their patients' trust. Acquisition of adequate CME activity points over a stipulated period will allow one to renew the professional practising certificate. This new regulation will promote self-motivation and thus compliance, just as it has done for the medical profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 632<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to highlight and suggest the following to be considered in the setting up of the dental continuing professional development programme and system in Singapore.&nbsp; First, a dialogue for the Dental Council, the Ministry of Health and the dentists to attend and discuss as well as finetune, taking into account their feedback and suggestions, as these are the people who work on the ground and they know the practicalities and issues on the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the setting up of a secretariat to help in the management of the system. Third, the use of on-line submission to facilitate the management of the CME points. Fourth, the use of different categories with different point weightages given, something similar to the current medical CME system.&nbsp; And, finally, to have a system to pro-rate and manage those who have to be overseas for an extended period of training or practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One word of caution I have is that there must be consideration before starting up a core versus a non-core points accumulating system which is used with the medical system today.&nbsp; Core points pertain to points obtained when attending CME sessions related to&nbsp;their area of specialisation, whereas non-core points or general points are for generic dental-related CME programmes. As the discipline is relatively small in Singapore still, we will have to ensure that there are enough such CME sessions in order that&nbsp;the dentists be given a fair chance and, of course, the choice as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On complaints and disciplinary prosecution, with the new Bill, the complaints process is being made clearer with more structures in place and, of course, it is even more fair and effective.&nbsp; It is essential to ensure parties involved get a fair deal and understand early the course of action which is going to be <p align=left>Column: 633<p>involved. This can then ensure that they undertake&nbsp;a series of necessary systematic steps in pursuing the issues concerned. This will certainly contribute towards consistently high quality dental care and practice, aligning with the norms for professionals and perhaps even for everything else in Singapore, which is always to be whiter than white and shinier than shiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also strongly support the proposed formation of an Interim Orders Committee which will be making the decision whether to suspend or restrict the practice of a practitioner whilst he is still under investigation. Currently, such practitioners are allowed to carry out their work which is creating a bit of a sour feeling with a lot of people.&nbsp; Once again, this is consistent with our call for enhancement of patient and public safety.&nbsp; It is also very heartening to see that various safeguard measures have been in place and are clearly stipulated to preserve the rights of the dental practitioners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I concur with the change in name for the Act to the Dental Registration Act,&nbsp;certainly a more appropriate choice and an all-encompassing terminology.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.53 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Dentists (Amendment) Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has taken great strides&nbsp;to be the dental hub of the region.

They <p align=left>Column: 634<p>are here for specialist treatment from prosthodontics to&nbsp;oral surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In another development, next year, Singapore will play host to the International Dental Exhibition and Meeting&nbsp;(IDEM Singapore 2008).&nbsp; This event will be the number one communication platform for the entire dental sector in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing this development, in 2009, the Annual World Dental Congress (AWDC) will hold its annual&nbsp;congress also in Singapore.&nbsp; The congress plays an important role in the international advancement of&nbsp;dentistry and will include a Scientific Programme,&nbsp;a World Dental Exhibition and the World Dental Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading&nbsp;the amendments proposed to the Dentists Bill, I can see that there are efforts to streamline common issues between the Singapore Medical Act and the Singapore Dentists Act.&nbsp; And this also includes the functions and roles of the Singapore Medical Council and the Singapore Dental Council.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Dental Specialists Register</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting up of a Dental Specialists Register is one of the steps taken to assist in the growth and development of specialised dental practice. The registry will also provide patients access to up-to-date and specialised dental care.&nbsp; It will improve the general awareness of the public with regard to&nbsp;general dental practitioners and dental specialists, and help the provision of appropriate dental care at the right level. For example, patients who require preventive dental care, such as professional cleaning, need&nbsp;only to go to a dental hygienist, and&nbsp;patients requiring root canal treatment will go to an endodontist.&nbsp; The registry will also assist referral cases for those who need specific or extensive dental procedures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 635<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;as protection to the consumers, only those with the qualifications and expertise can be registered and claim themselves as dental specialists.&nbsp; This is where the Dental Specialist Accreditation Board comes in to define the qualifications,&nbsp;experience and other conditions for registration as specialists.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the patients to derive maximum value from the creation of the Specialists Register, there need to be public education programmes to promote the use and benefits of the registry.&nbsp; The programme can help patients better understand the dentistry field so that they can make educated decisions regarding all available dentistry treatments.&nbsp; This includes information focused on the subject of general dentistry practices in addition to the growing cosmetic dentistry practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers will find information related to who makes the best candidates for each dentistry procedure,&nbsp;the recovery time after&nbsp;completion of their dental work, and the appropriate expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the other hand, the Ministry of Health must also ensure&nbsp;dental fee transparency to mitigate unwarranted and arbitrary revisions to the guidelines of fees established by the Singapore Dental Association.&nbsp; Just to echo the same concern of Mdm Halimah, I hope that the specialist title should not be used as a licence to charge exorbitant&nbsp;fees.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Continuing professional education (CPE)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The field of dentistry has evolved from dentists being known as drillers and extractors to masters of the art and science of dental practice.&nbsp; I remember the times when a visit to the dentist was like being sent to the dungeons for torture.&nbsp; In fact, I used to think they were paid based on the amount of pain and suffering inflicted onto the patient.&nbsp; Nowadays, going to the dentist is as pleasant and relaxing as a trip to the spa. With soothing music, aromatic candles, cable<p align=left>Column: 636<p> television, plush seats and the magic of&nbsp;anaesthesia, you do not&nbsp;feel the&nbsp;dentist&nbsp;\"lasering\" your teeth away.&nbsp; After a couple of visits, you come out with a set of pearly whites that glow in the dark!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with any professional operation, dental professionals would also need to keep up-to-date by continuing their professional development.&nbsp; Through knowledge expansion, these dental professionals will be able to provide better quality dental care to their patients.&nbsp; Patients would benefit&nbsp;from new developments in dental procedures, new materials and technologies.&nbsp; They can be assured that their dental professional is competent to give advice on treatment options, and provide sound&nbsp;recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By raising their skills, expertise and professionalism, Singapore dentists and dental professionals will further enhance our position as a regional medical and dental hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Registration and regulation of dental care professionals</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch on the registration and regulation of dental care professionals.

There have been many sub-specialties in dentistry, such as orthodontry, prosthodontry, pediatric dentistry and so on, over the years.&nbsp; In fact, there are nine recognised specialisations mentioned in the American Dental Association. This Bill provides the registration of dental specialists and this registration will allow the discerning patients to differentiate one dentist from another if they so wish to ascertain.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My concern is on the registration of oral health therapists.&nbsp; The Bill spelled out the criteria for the registration of oral health therapists but there is no mention on the practising scope of these oral health therapists. For example, are they allowed to practise on their own?&nbsp; Is<p align=left>Column: 638<p> registration synonymous with the permit to operate their own clinics?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral health therapists are Nanyang Polytechnic graduates and trained in limited skills, such as scaling, polishing and filling of teeth after a three-year course, but not trained in the diagnosis and treatment of dental problems.&nbsp; If they are allowed to practise and open their own clinics, their scope of dental care is very limited for patients, but non-discerning patients may not know that. This will lead to dire outcomes, such as misdiagnosis and under-diagnosis of dental problems, to the detriment of patients.&nbsp; But if these oral health therapists are to work under dentists or to the prescription of dentists, then many dentists and specialists can be freed from simple routine work in scaling, polishing and filling of teeth and to concentrate on more difficult jobs, such as dental extraction, root canal treatment, dental prosthesis, and so on.&nbsp; This will thus save time and cost for patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State said earlier that in Singapore, oral health therapists who have been allowed to be employed by the Health Promotion Board have been providing basic dental care to our school children for many years.&nbsp; In the past, school dental nurses (or the predecessors of oral health therapists) were trained by the Ministry of Health under the School Dental Services. The Ministry gave up training these nurses some years ago and transferred the responsibility to the Nanyang Polytechnic. Traditionally, the school dental nurses were allowed to diagnose, plan and carry out treatment for school children due to a shortage of dentists.&nbsp; Singapore has progressed economically over the years to become&nbsp;a First-World country. Singapore now can claim to have one of the best healthcare systems in the world and aspire to be the regional medical hub.&nbsp; And, yet, when it comes to dental care for our school children, MOH is prepared to digress in<p align=left>Column: 639<p> reverse tandem to our progress as a country by engaging oral health therapists to treat our school children, instead of dentists who are qualified dentists in dentistry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I said earlier, oral health therapists are Nanyang Polytechnic graduates and trained in limited skills and not trained in diagnosis and treatment of dental problems.&nbsp; Nanyang Polytechnic began offering its Diploma in Dental Therapy and Hygiene from 2004.&nbsp; It is in its fourth year since inception. The first batch of 20 has just graduated.&nbsp; In the past, dental nurses had been employed to treat our school children as there was a shortage of dentists.&nbsp; Currently, there is one dentist for every 2,500 Singaporeans. This ratio is comparable or better than some of the developed countries like Australia, New Zealand and the UK.&nbsp; Almost one in four of them works in the public sector.&nbsp; Now that we are not short of dentists, is it cost that MOH is trying to save by employing oral health therapists, instead of dentists, to treat our school children?&nbsp; If it is, then I feel that it is a sorry state indeed for the following reasons:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral diseases can exert a multi-faceted impact on an individual with a wide range of effects, including pain, discomfort and inability to eat. The two most common oral diseases - tooth decay and gum disease - are largely preventable if positive oral hygiene practices are inculcated and adopted by individuals. The adage&nbsp;\"Prevention is better than cure\" is most apt here in the dental care of young Singaporeans by maintaining good oral health while they are still in school. It is therefore important to ensure that children in school get the best of care by competent providers. This will ensure these children have deep foundation and a&nbsp;good set of teeth to last their lifetime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporean parents do not bring their children for dental check-up,<p align=left>Column: 640<p> thinking that their children's dental health has already been seen to in schools.&nbsp; They may, in fact, be under a false sense of security with regard to the dental health of their children if MOH continues to employ oral health therapists to do the job.&nbsp; I feel that our school students should deserve the best of dental care and, therefore, HPB should now deploy dentists and not oral health therapists to provide the dental care for all our school children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dental Specialists Accreditation Board consists of not less than eight registered dentists appointed by the Minister, but there is no mention of who the members should be.&nbsp; There are two providers of specialisation courses in dentistry in Singapore and they are NUS and National Dental Centre.&nbsp; Therefore, the members of this Board should at least have one member of the academic staff of the specialist courses in NUS and another one from National Dental Centre.&nbsp; This is so that it is&nbsp;consistent with the other provision of the same on this Bill, that is in new section 21C(2)(b) of this Bill, which spells out that one member of the academic staff of the dental hygiene and therapy course offered by the Nanyang Polytechnic&nbsp;be&nbsp;a member of the Oral Health Therapists Accreditation Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3 of the Dentists Act is amended to include at least one but not more than three registered oral health therapists in the Council.&nbsp; This is a maximum of three out of a total of only nine dentists in the Council apart from the Chief Dental Officer and the Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry of NUS.&nbsp; Is&nbsp;this not a lop-sided representation of oral health therapists?&nbsp; The oral health therapist course is new in Singapore and currently only 15 to 20 are trained per year, and it will take a long time for their numbers to rise to even approximate those of dentists.&nbsp; Moreover, given the limited extent of their work compared to the whole<p align=left>Column: 641<p> dentistry fraternity, there should be a fairer representation of dentistry practitioners in the Council.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last issue&nbsp;on fairer representation in the Council is that&nbsp;there should be provision to ensure the Council&nbsp;consists of representation from as many sectors of the dental profession as possible, such as the varied public dental sector and private dental sector. Therefore, there should not be double representation from any sector.&nbsp; One such example is that the Dental Faculty should not have another dentist seeking election to the Council since the Dental Faculty already has a mandated representative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the Minister of State can address these issues raised.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members for speaking in support of the Bill.&nbsp; As pointed out, this Bill will raise the standards of dental care and dental professional practice in Singapore. Allow me now to respond to the Members' specific comments and concerns.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah wondered if our primary school children are still continuing with the after-recess toothbrushing drills which, as she correctly remembered, had increased dental awareness and instilled in school children good dental hygiene habits.&nbsp; What happened was that that practice actually continued right up to where SARS struck us.&nbsp; At that point, to minimise cross-contamination and possible transmission of unknown infections amongst students, that was scaled down.&nbsp; But, instead, the School Dental Service under the Health Promotion Board moved towards an individualised and enhanced oral health promotion programme which, by their indicator, has proven to be more effective. What happened is that all school children are now instructed, at the chair side during the free dental treatment <p align=left>Column: 642<p>visits, on how to brush their teeth effectively and regularly.&nbsp; In addition, the dental therapists in the schools have also increased the frequency of oral health promotion talks.&nbsp; Dental health education has also been incorporated into the health education curriculum in the primary schools.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, these measures continue to instil good dental hygiene habits amongst our school children.&nbsp; A 2003 survey has found that amongst 12-year-olds, there is 0.54 of decayed, missing or filled teeth. That is an internationally recognised comparable indicator.&nbsp; This number in 2003 of 0.54 was a decrease from the number of one (1) in the year 1994. In other words, there have been fewer decayed, missing or filled teeth in our children.&nbsp; This actually puts us as one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp; So, it is a good result.&nbsp; It suggests that the education programme and the promotion of good habits, in terms of toothbrushing and so on, have yielded results.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah was also concerned about the job scope of the oral health therapists - and I think Dr Fatimah as well as Dr Lily Neo - and asked us to have some clarity about their job scope.&nbsp; Dr Neo was of the view that registered oral health therapists should not be allowed to work independently, but work under the supervision or fulfil the prescription of qualified dentists.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Dentists Regulations, pursuant to the Act, would clearly state the job scope of all oral health therapists as well as that they will work in collaboration with registered dentists.&nbsp; Specifically, they will only be allowed to perform dental procedures that they are qualified to do and will work under the direct supervision of dentists for at least five years. The five years that they spend under the direct supervision of dentists will help them gain sufficient clinical experience. After the five years, they may<p align=left>Column: 643<p> choose to work under a dentist in the same premises or provide the services in their own premises to patients referred to them by any dentist.&nbsp; They may not prescribe treatment or provide dental treatment independently.&nbsp; They may only treat patients referred to them by dentists and may only provide treatment which is prescribed by dentists.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dr Lily Neo's concern that oral health therapists are not sufficiently qualified to perform dental screening of students on their own, I wish to inform the House that oral health therapists go through a 3-year diploma programme at Nanyang Polytechnic.&nbsp; The programme, among other things, trains them to screen school children and provide the necessary basic dental care.&nbsp; Currently, all primary school children and half of the secondary school children are screened and treated by qualified oral health therapists.&nbsp; Some secondary school children are being screened and treated by dental officers due to the shortage of oral health therapists who are fully qualified to do the screening.&nbsp; Once there are sufficient numbers of oral health therapists, all secondary school children will be screened and treated by oral health therapists for the basic care for which they have been trained and qualified to do.&nbsp; Oral health therapists are well qualified to carry out these screenings and provide basic dental care, eg, in scaling, polishing, filling and the extraction of milk or primary teeth.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who need dental treatments that are beyond the scope of oral health therapists are referred to dental officers for consultation and management.&nbsp; The dental officers also supervise and conduct regular checks on the oral health therapists, not only on how they conduct the screenings but also on how they perform treatment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I would like to address another issue which was brought up by Dr <p align=left>Column: 644<p>Fatimah as well as Mdm Halimah.&nbsp; This is with regard to the current rule of dealing with the teeth of those who are below 18 years of age by the therapists.&nbsp; This rule currently does not apply to hygienists. So hygienists can practise what they are trained to do in an age neutral way.&nbsp; They are not limited by this rule.&nbsp; As for therapists, this rule in the regulations started because of the way in which they were trained and deployed - in other words, the job that they were employed to do.&nbsp; Because they were dealing within the school system, there was this specification in the regulations.&nbsp; As the scope of the oral health therapists' work is extended and as we consider the fact that they would be able, if they so choose, to practise after the five years on their own, no doubt under the supervision of dentists, one of the measures that has been taken to assist them in enhancing their employability and their job worth is to equip and certify them for the dental hygienist's work.&nbsp; That is step one.&nbsp; So, an oral health therapist, who also qualifies as a hygienist, can do the hygienist's work without limitation on the age.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about lifting the limitation for therapy work?&nbsp; On this, we would have to look at how things evolve and take concurrent steps.&nbsp; There are a few pieces that we have got to move and adjust in an interdependent way.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, the origin of the rule was because of the nature of the work for which they were trained to do.&nbsp; For the adult population beyond the age, that really comes under the realm of the dentists.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo draws a very strict line as to what dentists can do and what oral health therapists cannot be trusted to do.&nbsp; But Mdm Halimah and Dr Fatimah hold the view that as they upgrade their skills and so on, why is it that we have a limitation of who they can provide services to?&nbsp; So there is an implication on the kind of training that we provide them, what they can be competent in, what kind of supervision they should be put through,<p align=left>Column: 645<p> as we consider whether or not they can then move beyond their current scope, in terms of oral therapy work.&nbsp; This is something that the Ministry will be monitoring and we will have to move in such a way that it balances between not only the interest of the therapists but also those of the dentists, while at every point of time ensuring standards and safety for the people who receive their services and treatment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo was also concerned that oral health therapists may be over represented in the new Dental Council.&nbsp; I just want to explain here that the new Dental Council comprise 11 dentists, of whom up to three may be oral health therapists.&nbsp; These oral health therapist representatives will be appointed by the Minister.&nbsp; The Ministry believes that the oral health therapists have to be sufficiently represented in the Council since they will be working closely with the dentists.&nbsp; The Chief Dental Officer of MOH will recommend to the Minister the actual number to be appointed after considering the total number in proportion to this group of dental professionals in Singapore.&nbsp; So I take Dr Lily Neo's point that we should actually look at the relative sizes in deciding how many oral health therapists ought to be appointed in any one term of the Dental Council, and this is something that the Chief Dental Officer will take into account in making his recommendations to the Minister.&nbsp; Within the amendments proposed, there is a cap of not more than three.&nbsp; Clearly, to have any representation at all, it cannot be less than one.&nbsp; So that is where it stands.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo also alluded to why a representative from the NUS Dental Faculty was included in the new Singapore Dental Council but was not mentioned in the other board.&nbsp; She was saying whether or not there should also<p align=left>Column: 646<p> be a representative of the National Dental Centre on the Singapore Dental Council.&nbsp; I would say that there is no dispute over the merits of having a representative from the NUS Dental Faculty on the Council.&nbsp; If we look at the other provisions of appointment, then we are able to utilise the other limbs of the appointment provisions in order to augment the Council or to take suitable representatives to be on board.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are various ways of looking at this.&nbsp; Dr Fatimah, in her speech, in fact, cautioned against over specifying.&nbsp; She referred to another provision and said, \"Why do you want to specify Nanyang Polytechnic and NUS Dental Faculty?&nbsp; There could be others who might come up.\"&nbsp; The answer, to balance all these concerns, would be to say that for the obvious ones, we put in and then we have other provisions within the appointment processes to allow us to appoint, because all of them would be registered dentists of various Divisions anyway.&nbsp; That gives us the flexibility to do what is necessary and sensible to achieve the purposes.&nbsp; So we have to strike a balance between not trying to specify every single one in nor to inadvertently over specify and ending up with either creating monopolies or actually restricting our own ability to manoeuvre when circumstances change.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Mr Zainudin highlighted the need for public awareness and education programmes and dental fee transparency, which will help the public make informed choices.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also wondered if the establishment of the Dental Specialists Register could lead to higher dental fees.&nbsp; Public awareness and education programmes are indeed in the pipeline, and these programmes will focus on the various types of dental specialties as well as on the oral health therapists.&nbsp; The programmes will help improve the public's awareness of the various dental specialties and when and why they should seek treatment from these specialists.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 647<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Dental Council's website will include the list of dental specialists and their specialties.&nbsp; The oral health therapists' role in the provision of dental care and the scope of their work will also be highlighted through public awareness and education programmes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are dental fees expected to increase because of the establishment of the Dental Specialists Register?&nbsp; I acknowledge that this can be a concern, but I would like to assure the House that the Dental Specialists Register is to formally recognise and make it more transparent to the public which dentists have upgraded and maintained their skills in specific areas of dentistry and who have not.&nbsp; Incidentally, the dentists who will be placed on the Specialists Register, I am told, are already charging appropriate fees for the higher level of specialised dental care that they are providing.&nbsp; So I take it that when they are doing the higher level of dental care, they would explain the difference to their patients and factor that into their charges.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that this Register is unlikely to lead to a fee increase. The reverse, however, may be true as general dental practitioners, who had been performing these procedures and who may have called themselves specialists in some way, will now think twice before quoting or charging higher fees.&nbsp; There is also a relatively healthy referral culture amongst our dentists.&nbsp; The specialists will continue to refer the more basic and less complex cases to the general dental practitioners and vice versa; hence, ensuring right-siting, appropriate care and certainly appropriate charging.&nbsp; To promote dental fee transparency, MOH will be publishing the public dental institution fees for selected dental procedures on the MOH website.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked if the continuing professional education requirements to<p align=left>Column: 648<p> renew a practising certificate could be reduced for older or semi-retired dentists.&nbsp; Continuing professional education will be made a condition for the renewal of practising certificate under the regulations to be enacted after this Bill is brought into operation.&nbsp; A practising certificate allows a dentist to perform the full range of dental procedures on their patients.&nbsp; To safeguard the interest of the public, MOH is of the view that the continuing professional education requirements for older or semi-retired dentists should not be reduced.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidentally, oral health therapists will also be required to renew their practising certificates biennially and obtain half the number of continuing professional education hours of the dentists, because of their different scope of work.&nbsp; Dentists and oral health therapists will be allowed to accumulate their continuing professional education points through various means, such as attending conferences, lectures, workshops, attempting online education programmes and self-reading of research journals.&nbsp; Seventy hours, which is the requirement, over two years for dentists work out to be about three hours a month. We feel that three hours a month is not excessive.&nbsp; In fact, it is probably conservative.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By comparison, the dentists in the UK are required to chalk up 250 hours over five years, which is 50 hours per year, whereas what we are asking for is 70 hours over two years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank Dr Fatimah for her many suggestions on how to operationalise the system for continuing education.&nbsp; We will certainly take all those ideas and suggestions into account in implementation planning.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the use of Medisave for dental services, Mdm Halimah suggested that MOH conduct a review of the dental procedures covered and also update the <p align=left>Column: 649<p>Medisave claimable amount.&nbsp; My Ministry is in the course of an internal review.&nbsp; But I would like to say that, as is already the case now, dental inpatient and some surgical procedures performed in day surgery are already Medisave claimable.&nbsp; We will certainly monitor the needs and developments in our population, in particular the ageing demography, and cross check that with respect to Medisave claims for dental procedures and, if necessary, we will make the adjustments when the need arises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would like to say something about what Medisave is for.&nbsp; As we all know, Medisave is not something that we would want&nbsp;depleted prematurely.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, for a long time, the Ministry of Health has advocated and stuck by the position that we should keep it for hospitalisation, ie, in-patient care.&nbsp; Only very recently have we made&nbsp;a very conscious and calculated deviation from it, and that is in the case of the Chronic Disease Management Programme.&nbsp; We do that for a purpose, but we have built in very good safeguards to make sure that we do not inadvertently cause this to be a slippery slope through which the Medisave of CPF members would be prematurely depleted and causing them other untold problems later on.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in considering whether or not certain scans relating to the treatment of cancer should be included to be Medisave claimable, we also took this into account very seriously.&nbsp; The point is that whatever we do, we must not end up depleting prematurely the member's CPF savings.&nbsp; So, it is a constant monitoring of the developments and to see in what ways can we move that is sensible, and balancing the immediate and longer term needs.&nbsp; We are conscious that obviously when you allow Medisave to be used, then the outlay on the part of the patient could be reduced, and this is attractive to<p align=left>Column: 650<p> the patient.&nbsp; We have to conduct it in a balanced manner.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ageing population, I think Mdm Halimah mentioned in particular&nbsp;cost of dentures.&nbsp; I am told that, in general, dentures are not prohibitive in cost and at this moment we do not think this is something for which&nbsp; we want to make it claimable.&nbsp; But we will continue to monitor all such developments.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her speech on the orthodontal care needs of the elderly, Mdm Halimah believes that our dental education institutions should also provide topics on geriatric dental care and planning the curriculum.&nbsp; The NUS Dental Faculty and Nanyang Polytechnic have incorporated teaching modules on the management of geriatric patients.&nbsp; There is an on-going review of the courses with the intention of increasing instruction, contact time and exposure to elderly patients as well as patients with special needs.&nbsp; One of the primary roles of the soon-to-be regulated oral health therapists would indeed be the management of the elderly in the homes and hospices.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also not forgotten the need to update and educate dentists on the changes and developments in the management of the elderly patients.&nbsp; In fact, a comprehensive health manpower development programme, or HMDP, on geriatric dentistry as well as the management of patients with special needs, organised by my Ministry, has been tentatively scheduled to be held in the first quarter of 2008.&nbsp; This will be an ongoing programme which should reach out to all dentists, oral health therapists and related healthcare professionals in Singapore.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to address one final point by Dr Lily Neo with regard to the quality of care that we are providing to our school children and the parents' belief that with screening<p align=left>Column: 651<p> done in the school, they have completely outsourced the need to those school dental services and therefore there is no need to bring their children for regular dental checkups.&nbsp; First of all, on the quality of screening.&nbsp; At the end of it, I think we need not really look at whether or not it is done by a dentist or by what used to be called a dental staff nurse, or now called an oral health therapist.&nbsp; We look at it by way of the training they are provided, the curriculum, and the final test is really in the outcomes.&nbsp; And if you look at the outcomes that we have achieved so far by way of education, practice of oral hygiene and the decay indicators, and so on, I say the results point to one of confidence rather than one of concern.&nbsp; Therefore, I do not think we can say that because our dental staff nurses or oral health therapists have been the ones doing the screening for our children and, therefore, as Singapore develops, we are shortchanging our children or we are subjecting them to third-world care even in first-world Singapore.&nbsp; I disagree with that.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point about the parents - I would want to take this opportunity to urge parents to remember that it is important that our children have good teeth.&nbsp; I would agree totally with that view and it should be a partnership.&nbsp; Parents should do their part, the school system does its part, the dental health screening service does its part, and together with daily participation of the children themselves, that kind of approach is the best approach,&nbsp;rather&nbsp;than to say that it is to be consigned to any one group to ensure it.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe I have covered most of the points raised by the Members.&nbsp; I thank Members once again for supporting the Bill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On my first clarification, the Minister of State did not reply to my earlier<p align=left>Column: 652<p> question on why can we not use dentist instead of oral health therapist.&nbsp; Does he not agree that oral disease in children will cause the permanent teeth to be missing at the end of the day?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, could I ask him, in the survey done in 1994, it showed that 3% of the cohort of 40,000 of our 18-year-olds had one or more permanent teeth missing.&nbsp; Should we not aim for no young Singaporeans should have their permanent teeth missing?&nbsp;

I propose a multi-pronged approach - many helping hands, so to speak - everybody participating, including the child himself or herself.&nbsp; In this regard, I would say that the quality of the dental screening provided by the School Dental Service is an integral part of that.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; So, whether or not that service provided over the years has yielded the intended positive results, improved results, or has that service over the years done harm and caused deteriorating results in the teeth of our children, as measured by internationally comparable indicators?&nbsp; Dr Neo has just quoted a different figure.&nbsp; I am afraid I do not have that particular chart with me.&nbsp; But for the figure that I have quoted in my speech, clearly between 1994 and 2003, that decay index has improved from one down to 0.54.&nbsp; It therefore conveys to us that we are on the right track, that the care that we are giving through that service to our children has led to further improvement in the dental health of our children.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it also means that there are still teeth decaying in our children and there are still children losing their teeth.&nbsp; We must continue to persist and further<p align=left>Column: 653<p> improve on this. But the answer to a zero missing tooth challenge, I submit, lies in everybody who is involved in it - the child, the parents, the system working together - that will give us the best chance, rather than to say if I have a dentist checking it, the tooth will not be missing.&nbsp; I do not think that is so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Heng Chee How].</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 653<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL:::670--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.42 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is really an implementing Bill in that it&nbsp;amends the Legal Profession Act primarily to implement the recommendations of the Review Committee formed to evaluate the Joint Law Venture and Formal Law Alliance schemes, and the recommendations of the Third Committee on the Supply of Lawyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee on the JLV and FLA schemes was chaired by former AG Mr Chan Sek Keong and included Justice V K Rajah, Senior Counsel Philip Jeyaretnam, President of the Law Society, and Senior Counsel Michael Hwang.

This is provided for in the new section 130L.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing foreign lawyers to have a stake in a Singapore law firm will help Singapore law firms to possess in-house foreign law expertise and grow their practices abroad. Whilst it may be relatively easy for a Singapore law firm to employ, say, lawyers from China to help them in their China practice, it is difficult for the firms to retain these lawyers and secure their commitment unless they are given a direct stake in the performance and growth of the law firm.&nbsp; Moreover, some foreign lawyers with the requisite skills and experience may not find a consultancy relationship with a local law firm to be satisfactory, even if the compensation package is high.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, to ensure that Singapore law firms can continue attracting and retaining experienced and talented foreign lawyers, they will be permitted to own equity shares in and share profits of a local law firm, subject to an aggregate limit of 25% of the total equity shares in or profits of the local law firm. This will help Singapore law firms to expand their capabilities and reach out to the region. By giving regional lawyers working in the regional branches of a Singapore law firm a stake in the firm, I think this will also help local law firms to grow their practices in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Bill prescribes an upper limit of 25%, there is provision for this limit to be revised by subsidiary legislation. Any revision will&nbsp;be carried out only after consultation with the Attorney-General and the Law Society and after a thorough review of how this new scheme works in actual practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 657<p><p><I>Other amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me&nbsp;touch on some of the other proposed amendments.</p><p><br><I>Enhanced penalty for unauthorised practice</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, enhanced penalty for unauthorised practice.&nbsp; Currently, any person practising law without a valid practising certificate may be fined only up to $1,000, or sentenced to imprisonment of up to&nbsp;six months, or both. This penalty was prescribed way back in 1966 and has&nbsp;never been updated since.&nbsp; In the past two years, a few lawyers have been convicted of practising without a valid practising certificate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a maximum penalty of $1,000 is inadequate in today&rsquo;s context.&nbsp; This is a serious offence. Clause 8 of the Bill increases the maximum fine for a first offence to $25,000, and the penalty for a second offence to a maximum fine of $50,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.&nbsp; A higher maximum fine will give the court the discretion to impose a deterrent fine proportionate to the seriousness of the offence without having to sentence the errant lawyer to imprisonment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar increases in penalty are also made for the offence where a body corporate holds itself out to have the capacity or powers of a law corporation or limited liability law partnership when in actual fact it does not.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides a fast-track procedure for disciplinary proceedings against such errant lawyers, without the need to go through the Review Committee, Inquiry Committee and Disciplinary Committee hearings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 658<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased penalties are consistent with the punishments for offences of a similar nature in respect of other professions, such as those related to the practice of medicine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the enhanced penalties, clause 9 will allow the court to order the person convicted of practising without a valid practising certificate to return to his clients&nbsp;or other persons all remuneration earned while practising without the certificate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Mandatory Legal Practice Management Course</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn to mandatory Legal Practice Management Course.&nbsp;Currently, lawyers who have been admitted as solicitors after 1st March 1997 are required to attend the Law Society&rsquo;s Legal Practice Management Course if they wish to manage a law practice as a partner, director or sole proprietor.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that lawyers are equipped with the proper skills to manage a law practice, regardless of when they were admitted as solicitors, the Law Society has proposed that all lawyers be required to undergo the Legal Practice Management Course before they are allowed to manage a law practice as a partner, director or sole proprietor.&nbsp; My Ministry fully supports the proposal.&nbsp; This is provided for in clause 18.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Appointment of AG and SG as Senior Counsel</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn to the provisions on appointment of Attorney-General and Solicitor-General as Senior Counsel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7(b) provides for a holder of the office of Attorney-General or Solicitor-General, if he is not already a Senior Counsel, to be deemed appointed as Senior Counsel.&nbsp; The AG and the SGs are the most senior law officers and, by law, <p align=left>Column: 659<p>they rank in precedence in court before all other Senior Counsel. Moreover, the Attorney-General is a member of the Selection Committee for appointment of Senior Counsel.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;only logical that they should be deemed to be appointed as Senior Counsel.</p> <p><br><I>Conclusion</I></p><p><I><br></I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude,&nbsp;Sir, let me say that the changes to be made through this Bill will further develop and grow the legal services sector. But I want to add that these will not be the only measures that we will need to take.&nbsp; Sir, in this globalised world, the scene, as regards&nbsp;the legal landscape, is fast&nbsp;changing. We must be prepared to make further changes to keep up with the developments and ensure that our legal services sector remains vibrant and competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries are also considering making adjustments to their legal sectors to make them more competitive.&nbsp; For example, according to a recent <I>Bernama</I> report, Malaysia is considering further liberalisation of its legal services in view of the increased economic activity in mergers and acquisitions where international legal expertise was sought.&nbsp; We too cannot stand still.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a committee headed by Justice V K Rajah is undertaking a comprehensive review of the entire legal services sector. I understand that the committee will make recommendations to enhance Singapore's position as an international centre for the provision of legal services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee is expected to submit its Report in the next few months.&nbsp; The committee may make&nbsp;further refinements to existing schemes or the introduction of new schemes.&nbsp; If the proposed measures can enhance the competitiveness of our legal services sector, contribute to our economic growth, and serve the wider<p align=left>Column: 660<p> national interest, then we will consider adopting them.&nbsp; And this may entail further amendments to the Legal Profession Act.&nbsp; In the meantime, however, we have proceeded with the proposed amendments so as not to hold up the changes which have been decided earlier on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill, as explained by DPM and Minister for Law, amongst other things, targets at the need to boost the supply of lawyers,&nbsp;impose higher penalties for errant lawyers and heighten collaboration between local and foreign law firms.&nbsp; The main aim of the Bill is to implement the recommendations made by the Review Committee formed to evaluate two schemes&nbsp;- the Joint Law Venture&nbsp;(JLV) and Formal Law Alliance&nbsp;(FLA) schemes - as well as the recommendations of the Third Committee of Supply of Lawyers.&nbsp;In December 2005, the Government set up the Third Committee on the Supply of Lawyers to review the supply of lawyers as part of its periodic reviews to ensure that the supply of lawyers keeps pace&nbsp;with demand.&nbsp; The last review was done in 2001.&nbsp; The report noted the rising&nbsp;demand for legal talent as well as the attrition of the Singapore Bar in recent years.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Recommendations made by the Committee</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the recommendations made by the Committee is to consider the flexibility of&nbsp;setting up a second Law School in Singapore to produce an additional estimated 90 students per year per term.&nbsp; It also recommended allowing Singapore law firms to hire foreign legal talent who may eventually qualify to practise Singapore law in the areas of finance, banking and corporate work, and other areas of legal or regional practice as may <p align=left>Column: 661<p>be approved by the Attorney-General, provided they pass&nbsp;a Qualifying Examination.&nbsp; The Joint Law Venture and the Formal Law Alliance schemes were launched in 1999 to allow local firms to collaborate with foreign law firms to provide a convenient and efficient mode for delivery of legal services in cross- border financial transactions.&nbsp; While the Review Committee found the range of legal services&nbsp;in foreign laws and Singapore law available here satisfactory, several recommendations were made to enhance the schemes.&nbsp;Apart from these, the Bill also proposes to enhance the penalty for lawyers practising without a practising certificate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another change looked into is that all lawyers must complete a Legal Practice Management Course before being allowed to practise as a sole proprietor, or a partner in a law firm, or a director in a law corporation.&nbsp; Let me assure you, Sir, that I fully support the two points that I have just mentioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I followed the report of the Third Committee of&nbsp;Supply of Lawyers with great interest when it was first released because this is an area that is close to my heart, as a practising lawyer.&nbsp; So I would like to share some of my concerns regarding the new changes in the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; Separately, on a more personal note, I would like to share why I feel that good role models are important to motivate younger lawyers to remain in the profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, establishment of SMU Law Faculty.&nbsp;Sir, in August 2007, the Singapore Management University&nbsp;(SMU) School of Law will welcome its first cohort of law undergraduates.&nbsp; This is in line with the recommendations made by the Third Committee of&nbsp;Supply of Lawyers to set up a second Law School in Singapore to help augment the number of<p align=left>Column: 662<p> law students.&nbsp; While I welcome the idea that SMU has been given the opportunity to develop a new Law School in Singapore, I do have my concerns nonetheless.&nbsp; My&nbsp;chief concern is whether we have the brightest and the best of legal academia to cater to two Law Schools.&nbsp; With the modular and buffet spread of law topics and subjects at university level at NUS, if SMU were to at least have the basic or even replicate the competitive spread to be as good a Law School, will there be sufficient legal academia with quality to spread across both law faculties in NUS and SMU?&nbsp; Sir, this is notwithstanding that some of these academics are teaching at our business schools of NUS and NTU.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, how to motivate the young lawyers to stay?&nbsp; Sir, the recommendations made by the Committee have given me the impression that its focus has been to tap talent.&nbsp; Regrettably, it did not attempt to address the issue of why law firms face shortages of lawyers, particularly the new and young entrants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, there has been a rising demand for lawyers but at the same time, many have left the practice.&nbsp; Why did so many young lawyers leave the practice?&nbsp; What caused them to be disillusioned and gave up practising law after investing years of training and sheer hard work?&nbsp; This question stirred my heart greatly and caused me to wonder why I stayed on&nbsp;and, more importantly, still believe in the legal profession,&nbsp;despite all the upheavals for the past 26 years of my practice.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I chose law because I wanted and believed, and I still believe, I could contribute to the advancement of justice and equality, and betterment of society.&nbsp; I was blessed with a number of good role models that showed me what a lawyer could and should do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a young student, and later a lawyer, I drew inspirations from so many great role models.&nbsp; For instance, Minister <p align=left>Column: 663<p>Mentor, the late Mr David Marshall, Prof. Jayakumar, Dr Thio Su Mien, Prof. Tommy Koh, some of our past Law Society Presidents, including the current President, some distinguished Judges, past and present, noted for their fairness and wit, and lawyers, both senior and junior, whom I deeply respect for their integrity and defence of the defenceless, such as Mr Subhas Anandan, and many others whose names do not make it to the press often but are nevertheless doing much good work in Singapore and beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such great passion and energy, these legal dignitaries have made it their vocation to serve the people and the country to maintain peace and stability and the due process of law.&nbsp; Singapore owes much to them for its reputation as one of the best legal systems in the world.&nbsp; I believe that if the curriculum could have a module on these distinguished persons and their contributions to society, we could inculcate something in the young law students to want to make it their mission to embark on the same trodden path.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, we should not be stressing too much about technology and materialism that we churn out lawyers who seem to miss the fundamentals of being a lawyer in the first instance.&nbsp; Of course, the dilemma is that we must have law students trained in technology, finance and business, so that they could one day become judges or lawyers who have to handle or determine such issues.&nbsp; But these could be done alongside the&nbsp;need to impart humanitarian values and ethos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, has the good work by lawyers gone unnoticed?&nbsp; Sir, on the subject of&nbsp; having a curriculum to impart to our young law students on the good work done by past or existing local lawyers and judges, I would like to mention another observation that I have made.&nbsp; Since March&nbsp;this year, the Law Society's <p align=left>Column: 664<p>electronic bulletin,&nbsp;<I>E Jus News,</I> carried an invitation to attend \"a dialogue on the preservation of the legal heritage of the former Supreme Court Building and City Hall Building.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has announced that the former Supreme Court and City Hall Buildings would be converted into art galleries.&nbsp; The Steering Committee of the National Art Gallery hopes to seek views from the legal profession on the drafting of the preservation guidelines for the former Supreme Court and City Hall Buildings&nbsp;-&nbsp;the preservation of the physical infrastructure, the use of space for commercial purposes and how best to preserve the legal heritage of these buildings.&nbsp; The dialogue session will be held next Thursday, 19th April 2007, at 6.00 pm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when I first read that notice, I wondered why the Government showed so much interest in preserving buildings but not the good work done by lawyers and judges, past and present.&nbsp; I would like to ask that the Government include the significant good work done by our Judiciary, the legal fraternity and the academia of Singapore from the early years of nation-building till today to be included in these two buildings as part of our legal heritage.&nbsp; Sir, I strongly urge the Government to consider this proposition.&nbsp; This will be a good testament that the Government values local talent and upholds the important contributions that these people -&nbsp;our local heroes and heroines -&nbsp;have done for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are enough bad publicity on errant lawyers and those who embezzled clients' money.&nbsp; Except for two notorious ones who are still at large, those caught have been punished and struck off the roll.&nbsp; The media, in reporting these black sheep, had not been very sensitive to the backlash it creates on the vast majority of the good lawyers in the legal profession.&nbsp; It is unfortunate&nbsp;but that should not deter us from searching and upholding really <p align=left>Column: 665<p>good role models to inspire young Singaporeans.&nbsp; There are already so many honourable and respectable lawyers who volunteer their time and expertise not for the glory or the awards to be given by the President on National Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can find them in so many Government bodies, and my personal observation is that the Ministries of Law and Home Affairs seem to have the largest concentration of volunteer lawyers.&nbsp; Many other lawyers are also volunteering their time and expertise in statutory boards, churches, temples, mosques, grassroots organisations, meet-the-people sessions, and many other voluntary welfare organisations quietly and without calling any attention to themselves.&nbsp; Granted that we may never prevent bad sheep in the legal profession, but there are so many good ones to bury the bad.&nbsp; Sir, it is time that we saluted these good role models and make known their stories and sacrifices to the younger law students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fourth and final point, Sir, is&nbsp;on empowering the Council of the Law Society to handle money-laundering. My other observation is that clause 15 amends section 71 to empower the Council of the Law Society to make certain rules relating to make money-laundering.&nbsp; I find it strange that the Law Society should be tasked to make&nbsp;these rules when the Police Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) already has a unit to handle money-laundering.&nbsp; Would it be more appropriate for the law enforcement officers to handle and investigate into such a serious offence?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> Sir, I thank Ms Ellen Lee for her support of the Bill.&nbsp; She has raised several interesting and important points. First, I wish to commend her for her passion&nbsp;for the practice of law which I <p align=left>Column: 666<p>hope will inspire younger entrants to the legal profession.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deal with some of the points that she has raised.&nbsp; First, about the setting up of the new Law School.&nbsp; She is concerned whether there would be enough suitably qualified professors to cater for both the NUS and SMU Law Schools.&nbsp; As our legal sector grows, additional professors will be required for the increase in the number of law students, whether they are educated in one or two law schools.&nbsp; After the numerous discussions I have had, I am confident that the law schools will be able to recruit suitably qualified numbers of faculty staff, both locally as well as from overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when the&nbsp;university legal education was first introduced in Singapore, there were very few lawyers and no legal academics to begin with.&nbsp; And we all know that we succeeded in building a Law School that has trained lawyers who are able to work around the world and cities in London, New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai.&nbsp; I think we are in a much stronger position to develop faculty staff for a second Law School now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has also expressed opinion that the Third Committee on the Supply of&nbsp;Lawyers had focused on tapping talent, and not so much addressing the issue of why there is a shortage of lawyers.&nbsp; Sir, lawyers may leave the legal profession for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; Some may discover other passions, some may want to do something else with their life, to do non-legal work and so on.&nbsp; Actually, these factors are not peculiar to the legal profession.&nbsp; I think it reflects modern-day realities and circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some lawyers who stop practising law in a law firm or corporation have taken up positions&nbsp;as inhouse counsels.&nbsp; Others have moved to places, like in London and&nbsp;Hong Kong, to practise law.&nbsp; Sir, these are <p align=left>Column: 667<p>forces at work which we cannot fight against.&nbsp; But in planning for the supply of lawyers, we need to take these realities into account, and not assume that every single lawyer whom we train will end up practising law.&nbsp; The Committee's mandate was therefore on whether the supply of lawyers should be increased rather than how to stem the outflow of lawyers, although I want to add that I do not disregard the importance of the factor and it is something that my colleagues and I have been discussing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the general thrust of her speech, that it is important for our law schools to provide a balanced and rounded legal education.&nbsp; From my own experience as a former law teacher, I would say that this is not something that we can easily achieve through specific course content or specially devised courses or appropriate teaching methodology or getting the right academic staff.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member's specific suggestion that the Law School curriculum should include a module on distinguished legal luminaries and their contributions to society to inspire young law students follow in their footsteps, I think I will have to leave this suggestion with the two law schools to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp; My own view is that it may not be necessary to be so prescriptive.&nbsp; I am confident that our law schools will develop their own approaches to train lawyers in a way that it can inspire the next and future generations of lawyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Ms Lee would also like the Government to include the significant good work of our own Judiciary, our legal fraternity and academia from Singapore from the early years of our nation building till today, and she would like it to be included in the former Supreme Court and City Hall Buildings as part of our heritage.&nbsp; The person in charge of that is my colleague, the Minister for Information,<p align=left>Column: 668<p> Communications and the Arts.&nbsp; I am sure he is going to consider that.&nbsp; I agree with the Member that our rich legal history should be preserved in some form, but I would not want to pre-empt the plans that MICA may have for the National Art Gallery for the two historic buildings.&nbsp; But I would like to encourage her to vigorously raise this point at the dialogue organised by the Steering Committee of the National Art Gallery, which I assume she will attend if she is free.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, the new Supreme Court, as&nbsp;she knows, indeed has a gallery that chronicles significant milestones and developments in Singapore's legal history as well as the major legal milestones since the founding of Singapore in 1819.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, she asked why the Law Society should be making rules relating to money-laundering and not the CAD.&nbsp; I am sorry that I did not touch on this because I did not take that to be a controversial provision.&nbsp; But since she has raised this, I think I should clarify that it is not as if we are passing the buck to the Law Society to do the work of other agencies.&nbsp; The criminal law enforcement agencies will, of course, be very much involved in investigating money-laundering offences.&nbsp; However, lawyers, like banks, are at the frontline of the fight against money-laundering, as they receive and hold moneys on behalf of their clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Law Society which is responsible for regulating the professional conduct of lawyers will therefore be making rules really intended to help prevent lawyers from unwittingly becoming involved in criminal money laundering.&nbsp; That is the objective.&nbsp; The Law Society's controls and monitoring will provide a first line of preventative measures against money laundering by promoting good governance in law firms.&nbsp; The Law Society's rules will prohibit lawyers from holding anonymous accounts because, just like banks, they have to report suspicious transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 669<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawyers will also be required to take reasonable efforts to establish the identity of their clients and the nature of the business relationship when acting for clients in certain transactions and to retain records of such efforts.&nbsp; The Law Society already has powers under the existing provisions of the Legal Profession Act to enact such rules.&nbsp; The amendment in clause 15 is therefore to enable rules to be made to confer on the Council of the Law Society powers of inspection to ensure that such rules are complied with.&nbsp; Sir, I hope I have explained the ambit of&nbsp;this new proposal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me thank her again for her support of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 670<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
