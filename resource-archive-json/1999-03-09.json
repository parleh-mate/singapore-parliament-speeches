One was a $2-billion off-budget package announced last\r\n\r\nJune,  and  the other a $10.5-billion cost-cutting supplementary\r\n\r\npackage announced last November.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this year's Budget has adequately and\r\n\r\nreasonably  taken  care  of  Singaporeans  of  different  income\r\n\r\ngroups.  I am glad that the largest allocation of the Budget has\r\n\r\ngone  to  Defence   -   at  25%  of total  Government  spending,\r\n\r\nfollowed by Education at 19%.  National defence is one area that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  always emphasised.  In  times  like  this,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a small country and when there are social  unrest\r\n\r\nand  chaos  in  some other countries, we need to  be  even  more\r\n\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on education is also appropriate. Singapore\r\n\r\nis a small country with no natural resources.  Human resource is\r\n\r\nwhat we depend on most for our success.  As economic competition\r\n\r\nintensifies in the region and in the world, it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to move into a knowledge-based economy  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  and  continue to grow.  The second largest spending  on\r\n\r\neducation therefore should help develop our human resources\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  this  challenge.  However, I urge the  Government  to  also\r\n\r\nsupport  training and retraining programmes for our semi-skilled\r\n\r\nand unskilled workers, because they will remain in the workforce\r\n\r\nfor at least another 20 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area that I want to give special attention to is the\r\n\r\n10% personal income tax rebate that the Budget provides for this\r\n\r\nyear, up from 5% given in the last financial year.  Though  only\r\n\r\n35% of the taxpayers enjoy this 10% rebate, the remaining 65% of\r\n\r\nthe  population  have  also not been forgotten,  as  the  Budget\r\n\r\nprovides for rebates in rents and conservancy charges for  those\r\n\r\nstaying in rented and owner-occupied HDB flats.  The amounts  of\r\n\r\nthese  housing rebates range from two months' net rent and three\r\n\r\nmonths'  net  service  and conservancy (S&C)  charges  for  one-roomers to one month's net S&C charges for the 5-roomers.  It is\r\n\r\nright  that due emphasis and consideration be given to the lower\r\n\r\nand  middle income groups.  This approach certainly deserves our\r\n\r\napplause.   It  shows that the Government is able to  present  a\r\n\r\nbudget for everyone during this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, due to the prudent fiscal policies,\r\n\r\nSingapore is able to enjoy budget surpluses.  This has helped to\r\n\r\nbuild  up surplus funds that can be used during difficult times.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  Budget,  one can see that the projected  expenditure,\r\n\r\nwhich will lead to an operating deficit of $5.1 billion or  3.5%\r\n\r\nof  GDP for FY99, is drawn from the accumulated surpluses.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  no need, at this moment in  time,  to  use  the\r\n\r\ncountry's  reserves to help Singapore to tide over this  crisis.\r\n\r\nThis   is   another  area  that  we,  as  Singaporeans,   should\r\n\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the Prime Minister and his team will be\r\n\r\nable  to  lead  Singapore out of the regional financial  crisis.\r\n\r\nBut  we  should unite together to fully support the Government's\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 10% across-the-board income tax cut\r\n\r\nwill help to cushion the impact of the CPF and wage cuts for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers.  However, the workers would like to ask if it  will  be\r\n\r\nenough  to carry them through this year if the economy registers\r\n\r\na  negative growth.  If the economy goes into a recession,  does\r\n\r\nit  mean  that workers will have to go through another round  of\r\n\r\nCPF  and wage cut?  Besides, when will the workers know if  they\r\n\r\nhave to bite the bullet again to help the economy to pull out of\r\n\r\nthe  recession?  When will these workers be able to know whether\r\n\r\nthe cost-cutting measures announced last year are working?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement has yet to provide answers to these\r\n\r\nquestions uppermost in the minds of the ordinary workers.  It is\r\n\r\ntime  now for them to have a clearer picture of what is in store\r\n\r\nfor  them this year.  It is only fair that they be warned  early\r\n\r\nof the painful adjustments, as in the last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after\r\n\r\nthe  major cost-cutting package announced last November, it  was\r\n\r\nnot  expected that there would be anything spectacular about the\r\n\r\nBudget.   True  enough, the Budget contained few surprises.   As\r\n\r\nexpected,  there  was an income tax rebate and  rebates  on  HDB\r\n\r\nrentals  and S&C charges; and sector-specific fiscal incentives.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad that spending on education has increased to  19%  of\r\n\r\ntotal  Government spending or just under 4% of  GDP.   Preparing\r\n\r\nthe  young  for  their  future is  one  of  the  most  important\r\n\r\nchallenges that we face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only aspect that I think is insufficiently covered is\r\n\r\nexpenditure on the upgrading and retraining of workers.   In  my\r\n\r\nview,  this  is  a  task of some urgency.  The transfer  of  $79\r\n\r\nmillion   for  the  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme   in   FY98\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding,  surely  more  than  $150  million   could   be\r\n\r\nallocated  to  the  Ministry  of Manpower  this  year  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projected deficit is $5.1 billion. The majority view\r\n\r\nexpressed  yesterday  was  that this  deficit  was  appropriate,\r\n\r\nciting  as a reason the increase in development expenditure.   I\r\n\r\nshare this view.  I would also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  to  add  that  the  deficit is  well  within  the  current\r\n\r\nGovernment's  means.   After taking  into  account  the  overall\r\n\r\nprojected deficits in FY98 and FY99 - the technical term is  net\r\n\r\nreceipts  in excess of outlays  -   there is still an  estimated\r\n\r\n$2.6  billion  left in Government reserves during this  term  of\r\n\r\ngovernment.  The actual budget surplus in FY97, the  first  year\r\n\r\nof  this  current government, was $5.25 billion,  which  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient to cover the combined budget deficit in FY98 and FY99\r\n\r\nof  $5.5 billion.  However, the receipt in excess of outlays  in\r\n\r\nFY97,  which  includes land sales, was $13.5 billion,  which  is\r\n\r\n$2.6  billion  more  than  the net outlays  in  FY98  and  FY99.\r\n\r\nHence, in terms of the Government reserves, the Government would\r\n\r\nnot  be  drawing  down on past Government  reserves.   The  $5.1\r\n\r\nbillion  deficit therefore, in my view, is entirely  appropriate\r\n\r\nin  a  time  of  crisis and, in short, I support  the  financial\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the remainder of my speech, I would like to focus on one\r\n\r\naspect  of  the  economy  that  deserves  particular  attention.\r\n\r\nCompared  to  other countries in the region, Singapore  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  as badly affected by the financial crisis.  This, in large\r\n\r\npart,  has been due to the sound economic structure and  capable\r\n\r\neconomic  governance,  including the  series  of  decisive  cost\r\n\r\ncutting   measures,   the  proactive  drive   towards   building\r\n\r\ncapabilities for the future, and the promotion of innovation and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  particularly  technopreneurship.   In  short,\r\n\r\nduring  this  period  of crisis, the macro  framework  has  been\r\n\r\nrefined and updated in order to sustain economic growth, both in\r\n\r\nthe immediate future as well as in the medium term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the macro-economic aspects of economic governance are well\r\n\r\nin  hand,  I  believe that it is now time to examine the  micro-economic aspects of economic governance.  What I have in mind is\r\n\r\na   comprehensive  and  systematic  review  of  the   regulatory\r\n\r\nenvironment in Singapore, to serve two objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is cost. Regulations can, inadvertently or\r\n\r\notherwise, contribute to cost.  The second objective is to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexamine  whether regulations inhibit the flexibility and freedom\r\n\r\nrequired for creativity and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three categories of regulations which I have in mind.\r\n\r\nThe  first  category comprises regulations which,  because  they\r\n\r\ndiscourage  competition, either do not allow prices to  fall  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  they can, or do not provide sufficient incentives  for\r\n\r\nsuppliers to offer better quality products or services.  What is\r\n\r\nneeded, in this instance, is to examine whether deregulation  or\r\n\r\nliberalisation   will  be  beneficial  to   consumers,   without\r\n\r\naffecting the financial viability of existing suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of regulations comprises those which have\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  for perfectly good reasons in  the  past,  but\r\n\r\nwhich could be rendered outdated and obsolete today, because the\r\n\r\nreasons for which they were introduced may no longer be valid in\r\n\r\ntoday's changed environment.  However, because these regulations\r\n\r\nare  still in place, there is an added cost of compliance  which\r\n\r\nmay be an unnecessary burden on businesses and consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of regulations are what I call kiasu\r\n\r\nregulations.  These are regulations which have the objective  of\r\n\r\nprotecting  the consumer or general public, but because  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  they  are overly protective, they may  inadvertently\r\n\r\nhinder entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twin objectives of lowering cost and encouraging\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship   should  be  readily   accepted.    In   fact,\r\n\r\nregulatory reform is precisely what has been occurring in  three\r\n\r\nsectors  in Singapore today  -  finance, telecommunications  and\r\n\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the financial sector, we are all aware of what is amounting\r\n\r\nto   a   paradigm   shift   where  a  wide-ranging   series   of\r\n\r\nliberalisation  and  promotional  measures  have  already   been\r\n\r\nannounced,  including the demutualisation of the stock  exchange\r\n\r\nand   SIMEX.    These   are  designed  to  enhance   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and to further promote Singapore's  positioning\r\n\r\nas a financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the telecommunications sector, we have witnessed how the\r\n\r\nentry  of  additional  suppliers in  various  telecommunications\r\n\r\nmarket has resulted in dramatic reductions in cost of service to\r\n\r\nthe  consumer.   For example, the launch of the  third  Internet\r\n\r\nservice  provider,  Cyberway, in 1996, led to  the  offering  of\r\n\r\nattractive   price  packages  by  the  three  Internet   service\r\n\r\nproviders.  Till this day, both SingNet and PacificNet  continue\r\n\r\nto  take full-page advertisements to advertise innovative offers\r\n\r\nto  attract  new  customers.  Similarly,  in  the  mobile  phone\r\n\r\nmarket,  Mobile One and SingTel continue to engage in aggressive\r\n\r\nprice  competition,  much to the satisfaction  of  mobile  phone\r\n\r\nusers.   In  the  fixed  line segment of the  market,  a  second\r\n\r\noperator, Starhub, is due to start operations next year.  I look\r\n\r\nforward to likely reductions in price when this occurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson we learn from this is that in industries where there\r\n\r\nare  few, or even one supplier, a monopoly situation, the  entry\r\n\r\nof  new  operators will, by intensifying competition, result  in\r\n\r\nmore  competitive prices and a wider range of  products  with  a\r\n\r\nbetter   quality.    Consumers  definitely  benefit.    Existing\r\n\r\noperators also seem to be energised by the enhanced competition.\r\n\r\nThey  have risen to the challenge and continue to be profitable.\r\n\r\nFor  example, PacificNet was even successfully listed on  Nasdaq\r\n\r\nrecently.   This also goes to show that the Singapore market  is\r\n\r\nnot too small to support more than one or two suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another industry which is in the midst of reform is\r\n\r\nelectricity.   It  was  only very recently  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nElectricity  Pool  came into operation.   This  is  a  wholesale\r\n\r\nelectricity  market  designed to facilitate competition.   There\r\n\r\nare  currently  three supplies to the Pool -  Power  Senoko  and\r\n\r\nPower  Seraya  - which are separate entities owned by  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower as well as Tuas Power.  I look forward to the awarding  of\r\n\r\nthe  tender  of  majority ownership of Tuas Power  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture,  for  it would be interesting to see if  the  change  of\r\n\r\nownership would result in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlower  prices of electricity which would benefit both businesses\r\n\r\nand the general public alike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely this kind of liberalisation, which we have\r\n\r\nalready  seen  in  these three markets, which serves  as  useful\r\n\r\nexamples.   And  we  need to see if there are  other  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  could  benefit  from  liberalisation  and  the  entry  of\r\n\r\nadditional operators.  During the Committee of Supply, I will be\r\n\r\nspeaking  on  certain areas where I believe  that  a  regulatory\r\n\r\nreview would be beneficial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might ask why the need for a regulatory review now, at\r\n\r\nthis  point in time.  There are strong reasons to support  this.\r\n\r\nFirst,  Singapore  is likely to encounter even  more  aggressive\r\n\r\ncompetition  in  the  near  future  when  the  region  recovers.\r\n\r\nCompanies  in  the  region  will not only  be  leaner,  trimmer,\r\n\r\nhungrier  for  business, but they will  also  have  the  initial\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  a  nominal depreciation vis-a-vis  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar.  Hence, it is important that costs in Singapore  do  not\r\n\r\nbounce back quickly to pre-crisis levels in the near future.  In\r\n\r\nthe  light of this, a thorough examination of regulations  which\r\n\r\nimpact on costs would be timely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I believe that the crisis has accelerated the\r\n\r\npace  of  Singapore's  restructuring towards  a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, just as the previous crisis in 1985/86 accelerated  the\r\n\r\npace  of  restructuring towards a higher value added economy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Hence,  it  is  important  to  remove   or   modify\r\n\r\nregulations  which  hinder the move today towards  a  knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the Government\r\n\r\ninitiate   a   systematic  and  comprehensive  review   of   all\r\n\r\nregulations, to examine whether they inadvertently or  otherwise\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  costs or inhibit entrepreneurship in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  can be done by each and every Ministry, with feedback from\r\n\r\nthe  business sector which would know best which regulations are\r\n\r\nexcessively   irksome   where  cost  and  entrepreneurship   are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  This applies not only to business costs but also  to\r\n\r\ncosts which impact directly on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsumer,  and  which would ultimately feed back  into  business\r\n\r\ncost through the demand for higher wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, now that the macro framework has been\r\n\r\nsettled, it is time to focus on the micro and, in particular, on\r\n\r\nmodifying  regulations, where necessary, in order to keep  costs\r\n\r\ndown and remove unnecessary constraints to entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must say\r\n\r\nthat given the prevailing economic conditions, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance's  Budget  is an appropriate one.  It  is  a  remarkable\r\n\r\nbalancing act in ensuring that Singapore lives within its means,\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our  ability to compete in  the  market  place  and\r\n\r\nlooking after the needs and welfare of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very relieved that despite the relentless calls\r\n\r\nfrom  various quarters, the Government has rightfully not dipped\r\n\r\ninto   our  reserves.   Singaporeans  must  realise  that  these\r\n\r\nreserves are built up painstakingly over many years.  Hence,  it\r\n\r\nmust not be drawn at the first sign of trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the ordinary Singaporeans are also not\r\n\r\nleft  out  of the scheme of things.  The service and conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges,  utilities and rental rebates for the HDB  heartlanders\r\n\r\namounted to a sum of $142 million.  This is a big testimony that\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government is a caring one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the effective measures put up by the CSC\r\n\r\nand  the  rebates  from the Budget, there  will  still  be  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  need  help. They have  many  worries.   Jobs,\r\n\r\nschool  fees  and daily expenses are nagging concerns.   Meeting\r\n\r\nthe  medical  expenses  will  be  another  challenge.   In  each\r\n\r\nfinancial  year,  from FY94 to FY97, the Government  contributed\r\n\r\n$100  million to the capital sum of Medifund.  I am  pleased  to\r\n\r\nnote that for the year 1998 Medifund has paid out $13 million to\r\n\r\npatients  from  the  lower-income families.   As  for  my  ward,\r\n\r\nPunggol  South,  about $50,000 was granted  over  the  last  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   Therefore, I urge the Government to continue  to  make\r\n\r\ngenerous provisions for Medifund to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensure  that the proceeds from its capital sum would be able  to\r\n\r\nmeet the increasing demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Development Council (CDC) is slowly but\r\n\r\nsurely  providing  its  worth during this  trying  period.   Its\r\n\r\nactive  role  of  helping the needy in our  community  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  assistance schemes deserves the Government's continuous\r\n\r\nfinancial backing.  In Punggol South, we see an increase in  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   applicants  for  our  one-time  interim  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme  for  the unemployed.   For  the  last  three\r\n\r\nmonths, we have an average of 20 cases per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other entities that have seen a growing role for\r\n\r\nthemselves are the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs).  They\r\n\r\nare   often   very   spontaneous  in  offering   assistance   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who need them. Thus, the Government can enhance the\r\n\r\neffectiveness and ability to help Singaporeans by providing more\r\n\r\nfunds to the VWOs to computerise and to train their personnel in\r\n\r\nsuch  areas like counselling management and care-giving  skills.\r\n\r\nThe  better  the trained VWO volunteers are the better  equipped\r\n\r\nthey are to offer help to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area of concern amongst Singaporeans is the\r\n\r\nrising  bill  each  time they have to incur at  their  favourite\r\n\r\neating outlets like the coffeeshops and food courts.  Many of my\r\n\r\nresidents have come to share with me that they are very  puzzled\r\n\r\nabout  the price increases at the coffeeshops and wondered  what\r\n\r\nthese outlet proprietors have done with the rebates given by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   For instance, the 55% property tax  rebate  for  a\r\n\r\ncoffeeshop  of  about 4,000 sq ft means a saving of  $12,000  to\r\n\r\n$15,000.   NTUC FairPrice and NTUC Foodfare are often  cited  as\r\n\r\ngood  examples of how cost savings have been ploughed  back  for\r\n\r\nconsumers' benefit.  These residents have wanted to know whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government has any monitoring mechanism to ensure at  least\r\n\r\nsome  justice is being done with regard to ploughing  back  cost\r\n\r\nsavings  from  tax  rebates and lower  prices.   I  think  their\r\n\r\nconcerns are valid and their request reasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nrecently I represented the NTUC at a conference of trade  unions\r\n\r\nin  Seoul.  What struck me was the passion in which many  fellow\r\n\r\nunionists  in South Korea called for a move to bring the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement  into the mainstream of activity.  Obviously, they  are\r\n\r\nvery unhappy with the present lot.  It is the Government and the\r\n\r\nmajor  employer  groups that are calling  the  shots.   All  the\r\n\r\nunions  could  do  now  is  to  react.   They  expressed   their\r\n\r\nfrustration  by  calling  for massive  demonstrations  and  even\r\n\r\nstrikes.   What the Korean trade unionists want is to  influence\r\n\r\nevents, and not just to respond to decisions already taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hall reverberated with slogans, I counted myself as\r\n\r\nfortunate that we have a system in Singapore where trade  unions\r\n\r\nare a partner with Government and management in nation-building.\r\n\r\nHow  did  we  get to where we are today?  It was  because  of  a\r\n\r\ncritical decision taken by political and trade union leaders  in\r\n\r\nthe 1960s.  SM Lee Kuan Yew was then Prime Minister.  The labour\r\n\r\nmovement  was  headed by Mr C V Devan Nair.  At that  time,  our\r\n\r\nlabour  movement was already linked in a symbiotic  relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the  PAP.   But SM Lee felt that it was  not  enough  that\r\n\r\nunions  worked  in harmony with  Government.  He wanted  to  see\r\n\r\nunions develop equally close relations with management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's separation from Malaysia and the British withdrawal\r\n\r\nwere  events that made our union leaders sit up and realise that\r\n\r\nthe  old-fashioned confrontationist policies would be  suicidal.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  the  groundwork  was laid for the  kind  of  industrial\r\n\r\nharmony we enjoy today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble is that our style of industrial relations is often\r\n\r\nseen  totally  in a different light in some other countries.   I\r\n\r\nread  with  amusement a report that people in high  position  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong think that we have been able to cut wages in Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause our unions are under the control of the Government.  Our\r\n\r\nunions do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndance  to the tune of the Government or management.  We play  an\r\n\r\nactive   part   in  identifying  problems,  and  in   suggesting\r\n\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face daunting challenges. Our economy has been affected by\r\n\r\nthe regional crisis.  Close to 30,000 workers were retrenched in\r\n\r\n1998.   How  many more will be laid off this year?  Workers  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  job  security.  So  our  labour  movement  has\r\n\r\ninitiated  training  programmes.   And  we  are  encouraged   by\r\n\r\nworkers'  response to training and retraining.  We  are  working\r\n\r\nwith  Government and management to find jobs for those  who  are\r\n\r\nretrenched.   We know that some workers would have  problems  in\r\n\r\npaying  for  their  children's textbooks and  uniforms.   So  we\r\n\r\nprovide education grants to them.  Our cooperatives also help by\r\n\r\nlowering  cost of basic items. Other traders followed suit.   We\r\n\r\nalso got the bus companies and the MRT to lower costs.  Our  aim\r\n\r\nis  to  get  workers to acquire skills so that they  can  remain\r\n\r\nemployable  for  life.  Our workers must  have  the  ability  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  a  knowledge economy.  Of course, IT is  what  will\r\n\r\ndrive  the knowledge economy.  We must find imaginative ways  to\r\n\r\ntell our workers what a knowledge economy is all about.  We need\r\n\r\nto make them feel comfortable.  Not everyone can become computer\r\n\r\nliterate.   But  this  does  not mean that  they  cannot  access\r\n\r\nknowledge  through computers.  There are computer  screens  that\r\n\r\noperate  on  the touch system.  There is no need to key  in  the\r\n\r\nsecret codes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People not familiar with the computer system should go to the\r\n\r\nURA  Gallery.  As you walk across the room, a big cinema  screen\r\n\r\ncomes  alive.  There is no need to touch anything.   Then  there\r\n\r\nare  also computer screens where all you need is to touch.   You\r\n\r\npoint  to  what you want to see, and bingo, you get to see  what\r\n\r\nyou want to see!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is working with a company to develop IT kiosks, with\r\n\r\ncomputer screens, operating also on the touch system.  Soon, you\r\n\r\nwill  find  the  i-ONE  kiosks  all  over  Singapore,  providing\r\n\r\ninformation about our labour movement, among other things.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In due course, many things which now seem so complicated will be\r\n\r\nmade  simpler.  In a sense, it would be like the development  of\r\n\r\nthe telephone.  Initially, the vast majority of Singaporeans did\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  telephone at home.  Now there  is  hardly  a  home\r\n\r\nwithout  a  phone.   Today,  mobile  phones  are  used  by  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the labour movement is committed to\r\n\r\nplaying  its part in moving Singapore into a knowledge  economy.\r\n\r\nWe  will spare no effort to look after and enhance the interests\r\n\r\nof our workers.  We believe that we can do this by working as  a\r\n\r\nsocial partner with Government and employers.  Together, we  can\r\n\r\ncreate  even better paying jobs in the economy so that  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  enough  opportunities  for  all  Singaporeans  to  pursue.\r\n\r\nTogether,  we can create new and better skills in our  workforce\r\n\r\nso  that  every  Singaporean  can  participate  in  a  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy, and live a better life in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  last  year  when  we were debating  the  budget  that  was\r\n\r\npresented  by the Minister, the recession was still not  on  us.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone into recession and we did not know what scars it\r\n\r\nmay leave in our society.  Indeed, the Minister and a number  of\r\n\r\nothers  were indulging in some wishful thinking that perhaps  we\r\n\r\nwould  not be hit hard and we would be all right, although there\r\n\r\nwere warnings from the outside that the recession would be worse\r\n\r\nthan the 1985 recession.  But now, a year down the road, we  can\r\n\r\nsee what the recession has done.  The evidence is all around us.\r\n\r\nWe  have  28,300 workers thrown out of employment  just  in  one\r\n\r\nyear.   We  do not have the figures for January and February  of\r\n\r\nthis year.  I do not know why they are not available.  I rang up\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Manpower and they said, \"We only produce  them\r\n\r\nevery   quarter.\"   These  28,300  workers  have   swelled   the\r\n\r\nunemployed in Singapore to 82,400 as at 31st December 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we were also told sometime ago that there were 21,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans above the age of 55 who have no CPF savings at  all\r\n\r\nto  fall back on.  Many of our workers have not just lost  their\r\n\r\nemployment, but almost all others have suffered wage  cuts,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  on  top of the cuts in the CPF savings.   And  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  said  in his Budget Statement, it has  badly  affected\r\n\r\nthose  above  40 years of age.  It is not just the workers,  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are down.  We have been told of the drop in  tourist\r\n\r\narrivals  and  we know that several businesses have  closed  and\r\n\r\nbankruptcies are on the increase.  So it is altogether a  gloomy\r\n\r\npicture.  As the Minister said, we do not know whether 1999 will\r\n\r\nbe  any  better.  He says it is still too uncertain  to  predict\r\n\r\nanything for 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of all these, the revenue is down by $3.1 billion.\r\n\r\nIt  is  against this background that the Government has come  to\r\n\r\npresent  its  programme to the people.  I say advisedly  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, because let us not forget this is a programme of how the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes to use our people's monies in planning  for\r\n\r\nthem through this difficult period and beyond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite interested to see Mr Ngiam, the Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry of Finance, writing in the economic newsletter\r\n\r\nfrom the Department of Economics of the University, say that the\r\n\r\none constant in every administration is the political imperative\r\n\r\nbehind   every  economic  decision.   He  says  politics  drives\r\n\r\neconomics.   I  was glad to see that admission  from  Mr  Ngiam.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course, it is not new, without being disrespectful  to\r\n\r\nhim.   That was stated by Aristotle many centuries ago  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid that politics was the master science.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am tempted to ask, and this does not appear in the\r\n\r\nMinister's  Statement,  what  is  this  Government's   political\r\n\r\nimperative in presenting the programme, not just for the  period\r\n\r\nof  the  recession, the crisis, but beyond?   Do  the  political\r\n\r\nimperatives include a concern for all our citizens, not  just  a\r\n\r\nparticular section or sections, but for all our citizens and for\r\n\r\ntheir  plight  during the economic difficulties  that  they  are\r\n\r\nfacing?  This is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical  imperative because it is not just  simply  welfarism.\r\n\r\nIt shows a concern for those who have contributed to Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  during  the  good  days.  Or  is  it  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolitical imperative that they have to get along as best as they\r\n\r\ncan?  We have got other matters to attend to, not that they  are\r\n\r\nunimportant,  to  try  and  get the businesses  moving  and  the\r\n\r\neconomy  revived,  and  we cannot be over-concerned  with  their\r\n\r\nplight.   That would show a complete lack of concern  for  their\r\n\r\nsituation and particularly, as I said, of the workers  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed to economic progress.  And, of course, in  the  good\r\n\r\ndays,  we  had  tributes paid to them for their contribution  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other imperative I wish to know, whether it is one of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  imperatives, is how does it plan to  minimise  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of  further  recessions  down  the  road.   How  does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  see  this as possible?  Is it by  having  a  society\r\n\r\nwhere all our citizens are well-equipped, that means, having the\r\n\r\nnecessary  basic  education to recognise  the  pitfalls  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety that contribute to any recession that may come our  way?\r\n\r\nOr  is  the imperative a society where the majority is left  out\r\n\r\nfrom  making any contribution, and the contribution is  left  to\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  and foreign companies, and the decision-making\r\n\r\non  economic matters left to a small minority of our people?  If\r\n\r\nwe adopt the latter, then we are robbing ourselves of the talent\r\n\r\nin  our community.  We have got to make sure that we draw in all\r\n\r\nthe  talents that are available to us in Singapore, and not just\r\n\r\nrely  on  the talents of a few people and particularly just  the\r\n\r\nforeigners.   Of  course, it goes without  saying  that  if  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  are to play this role in making their contribution  to\r\n\r\nour  economic  welfare  and progress, then  they  must  be  well\r\n\r\ninformed - and this is openness - on all economic activities  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  and be allowed to comment and  even  criticise\r\n\r\nanything  that the Government proposes to do.  So  the  question\r\n\r\nis:  is  the Budget preparing us for such a society  or  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing to continue in the same way as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe have continued from one recession to another?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking in last year's budget, Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that the\r\n\r\nBudget was disappointing.  I am afraid I have the word again for\r\n\r\nit this year.  It is not only disappointing but it is imbalanced\r\n\r\nin  the allocations made to the various Ministries.  Why  is  it\r\n\r\ndisappointing?   A writer in the Straits Times,  the  Government\r\n\r\nmedia, reporting on the Budget said it was a Budget for the man-in-the-street.   I  do not know how he came to that  conclusion,\r\n\r\nand  he  also  called it a \"Singapore vintage\".   Again,  I  was\r\n\r\npuzzled by this.  It looked to me it was certainly a PAP vintage\r\n\r\nBudget but hardly a Singapore vintage Budget, in the sense  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would  all be very happy and  overjoyed  with  the\r\n\r\nBudget.  He perhaps called it a Budget for the man-in-the-street\r\n\r\nbecause  of what the Straits Times in another article hailed  as\r\n\r\nthe  \"goodies\" for the heartlanders, the people who dwell in HDB\r\n\r\napartments.  I should not look at a gift horse in the mouth.  My\r\n\r\nParty, of course, welcomes the relief that is being given and we\r\n\r\nwould  like  to say `thank you'.  But may I say that  even  that\r\n\r\nmight  appear  to be given grudgingly because the Minister  says\r\n\r\nthey would not get the benefit of the 10% income tax rebate that\r\n\r\n35%  of the population will be receiving.  But, as I have  said,\r\n\r\nlet  us  not  be stinting in thanking the Government  for  this.\r\n\r\nBut,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, may I say it is small fare.  The rebates\r\n\r\non  utilities are offset by the increase in the water-borne fees\r\n\r\nand  the conservation tax to take effect from 1st July.  So  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would appear to be taking away with one hand what  it\r\n\r\ngives with the other hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's debate, my Party called for a suspension of the\r\n\r\nwater  conservation  tax.  Clearly, that  has  not  merited  any\r\n\r\nconsideration  with  the  Government.   We  also  called  for  a\r\n\r\nsuspension  of the GST, or at least an exemption for  the  basic\r\n\r\nnecessities.  That, again, has fallen on deaf ears.  But  may  I\r\n\r\nask  the  Government how does it think these 82,400 people,  who\r\n\r\nwere  unemployed as at 31st December, are going to pay for their\r\n\r\nfood, their children's education and healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTalking  about  healthcare,  I see  that  the  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  gone up by $2,066,000 whilst running  costs  have\r\n\r\ncome  down  by almost $18 million and the other operating  costs\r\n\r\nhave  come  down by $25 million.  But the charges  made  to  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  for attending outpatient centres and clinics and  cost\r\n\r\nof  medicines would appear to remain the same.  Should they  not\r\n\r\nbe given some relief from the high costs of healthcare?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the children's education. I know there are\r\n\r\nvarious  funds.   But  we  have called for  free  education  for\r\n\r\nchildren  of  low income families, at least at the  primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary  levels.  Why is that not possible if our  aim  is  to\r\n\r\ncreate a knowledge-based economy?  If that is the purpose,  then\r\n\r\nwe  should be spending money on providing education for all.  We\r\n\r\nshould be aiming for an egalitarian society, not a society where\r\n\r\nthere are few elitists and the rest are left out.  How are  they\r\n\r\ngoing  to pay for their transport costs and public transport  is\r\n\r\nnot  cheap?  The Minister says that the duration of unemployment\r\n\r\nin 1998 was about 8.9 weeks.  How long have they been unemployed\r\n\r\nnow?   We were told some time ago that they had savings only  to\r\n\r\nlast them for about three months and for some, up to six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, like the previous Budgets, does very little for our\r\n\r\ncitizens who will suffer most in this economic crisis.   Yet  it\r\n\r\nis  those  people  who have been contributing  to  our  economic\r\n\r\nprogress.  We seem to take no account of that when it comes to a\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that we must not succumb to the lure of\r\n\r\nwelfarism  because, once we succumb, it will  be  impossible  to\r\n\r\nreverse  it.   May  I assure the Minister, and  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   knows,  that  Singaporeans  are  not   asking   for\r\n\r\nwelfarism.   I do not think Singaporeans want welfarism  in  the\r\n\r\nsense  that  it has been understood as paying them for  nothing.\r\n\r\nBut  these people have been thrown out of jobs through no  fault\r\n\r\nof  their  own.   It has been forced on them.   They  have  been\r\n\r\nforced to take pay cuts, again, through no fault of theirs.   So\r\n\r\nis it welfarism to see that they are helped?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIs  it welfarism to see that their children's education does not\r\n\r\nsuffer?   We  keep talking about our only resource, our  people.\r\n\r\nAnd is not education the best investment in that resource, if it\r\n\r\nis our only resource?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is not welfarism that we are\r\n\r\nasking  for, but a recognition of the contribution made  by  our\r\n\r\nworkers  and adequate caring for them in their times of trouble.\r\n\r\nMay I propose that the Government consider very seriously giving\r\n\r\na  cash  allowance to families who are in need during the period\r\n\r\nof the crisis?  We called for this cash allowance to families in\r\n\r\nneed a long time ago but nothing has been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must move on, Mr Speaker, Sir. I said it is also an\r\n\r\nimbalanced Budget.  Although the revenue has gone down by 11.4%,\r\n\r\nI  see  the  operating expenditure has gone up by 2% over  1998.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  recall  that the Minister, speaking last  year  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, said that the Government intended to keep a tight lid  on\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  and this year, he again speaks about  the  aim  of\r\n\r\nkeeping  the  public sector lean and trim whilst  maintaining  a\r\n\r\nhigh  quality of public service.  I do not want to run down  the\r\n\r\npublic  service.   It  is good.  But I am not  sure  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean will agree that our public service is of a very high\r\n\r\nquality.   The running costs, we were told, amount to about  $14\r\n\r\nbillion  and  92%  of  this goes to the  running  costs  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistries.   The manpower expenses, we are told, amount  to  $3\r\n\r\nbillion.   That leaves about $11 billion for other expenditures.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what these running costs are.  Should we not have\r\n\r\nsome breakdown of the running costs of the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a population of three million, or is it\r\n\r\nthat  we are approaching four million?  Do we need to spend  $14\r\n\r\nbillion,  in running costs, in governing ourselves?  I have,  in\r\n\r\nthe  past, and I was here in 1981 to 1986, called several  times\r\n\r\nfor  a  committee to examine the running costs of governing  us.\r\n\r\nBut, again, it has fallen on deaf ears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the imbalance is seen sharply, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\ndisproportionate allocations made to the Ministries.  Of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncourse, I go straight to defence.  I may be the only speaker  in\r\n\r\nthis  House who queries this expenditure on defence year in  and\r\n\r\nyear  out.  But may I assure the Minister that there are a great\r\n\r\nmany people outside who want to know why we are spending so much\r\n\r\non  defence.   Should  we not be told clearly  in  simple  terms\r\n\r\ninstead of just general language about the need to be ready, why\r\n\r\nwe  need to spend 25% of our monies on defence?  If you  add  to\r\n\r\nthat the cost of policing us and the civil defence, it comes  to\r\n\r\nalmost 1/3 of our monies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Mr Speaker, Sir, I informed the House of the spending\r\n\r\nin  various  countries.   I said that out  of  a  total  of  167\r\n\r\ncountries,  only  about 24 or 25 were spending more  on  defence\r\n\r\nexpressed as a percentage in terms of their GDP.  That  was  for\r\n\r\n1996.  I have not got any figures after that.  The Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence, replying partly to my call last year, spoke of the need\r\n\r\nfor high technology and the need to spend the money on providing\r\n\r\nhigh technology.  Well and good.  But the question still remains\r\n\r\nunanswered.   What is the threat that we are facing?   Where  is\r\n\r\nthe threat coming from?  And what form will the threat take that\r\n\r\nwe  need  to spend 25% of our monies on defence?  Is it that  we\r\n\r\nwish  or  that  we intend to impose a mentality in our  citizens\r\n\r\nthat  they  are under siege, that they are besieged  by  enemies\r\n\r\noutside  and  therefore we have to be prepared?  That  may  have\r\n\r\nbeen  the  position years ago, in the 1950s or 1960s,  but  does\r\n\r\nthat still continue that we are being besieged or surrounded  by\r\n\r\nhostile  neighbours?   After  all, we  are  members  of  several\r\n\r\ndefence pacts under which the members are obliged to come to the\r\n\r\ndefence of any country if it is attacked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a paranoia about being attacked from outside.\r\n\r\nIn  the  same way, I suppose, the Government and the PAP  suffer\r\n\r\nfrom  opposition  parties.  There is a paranoia  about  allowing\r\n\r\nopposition  parties to function and perform their  role  in  the\r\n\r\nsociety.   I think one speaker in last year's debate  asked  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  look  at what happened to Kuwait.  What  happened  to\r\n\r\nKuwait?  When Kuwait was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattacked, the international community moved in.  So we have  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations now and we should be backing the United  Nations\r\n\r\nto  see that they provide some security for the small countries.\r\n\r\nBut  most important is we have got to make a calculation on  our\r\n\r\nspending and see whether it is cost effective.  That is the most\r\n\r\nimportant thing.  And again, I have been calling for a committee\r\n\r\nto  study our defence needs and how much we need to spend on it.\r\n\r\nThere  has not been enough thought given to all this.  All  this\r\n\r\nis  decided  for  us and we are told, \"You, be careful,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be attacked.  So, we have got to be ready.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly is the amount proposed to be spent on education.\r\n\r\nThat  is  only less than a quarter of our monies.   And  health,\r\n\r\nwhich  is another important factor, takes up only about 1/25  of\r\n\r\nour  monies, whereas defence and security take up a third.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness rightly stresses  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  education in our economic progress and it is not  just\r\n\r\nthe retraining of our workers, important as it is, ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up your\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  support  the  Budget  Statement by the Finance  Minister,  Dr\r\n\r\nRichard Hu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, this budget would appear to be uneventful.\r\n\r\nSome  people  commented  that it is like drinking  plain  water.\r\n\r\nYet,  it is a budget which is popularly supported by the  people\r\n\r\namidst this South-east Asian financial crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget deficit in 1999 has been increased from $470\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1998 to $5.05 billion this year, or 3.5% of our  GDP\r\n\r\nwhich  is the highest deficit in recent years.  The increase  in\r\n\r\nthe budget deficit is mainly due to the increase in  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  which is as high as S$13.94 billion,  accounting  for\r\n\r\n48%  of our total expenditure or 9.8% of our GDP which is  again\r\n\r\none of the highest figures in the recent history of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Finance Minister, this is to be treated as an\r\n\r\ninvestment for our long-term development of our educational  and\r\n\r\neconomic  infrastructure. For the education budget, it  receives\r\n\r\nS$5.7  billion, which is 4% of our GDP and is much  higher  than\r\n\r\nthe  3% in 1997 or 3.4% in 1998.  On the Development Expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  the Ministry of Education, it has also increased by 31%  or\r\n\r\nS$2.2  billion, out of which S$1 billion will be  used  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of schools and the other S$315 million will be used\r\n\r\non  IT facilities.  I am very glad that our Government would  be\r\n\r\nable  to  spend so much money on education despite the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  we  are facing.  I hope that the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nwould  build more schools so that they could implement the full-day  school  programme  as  soon  as  possible,  and  that  more\r\n\r\ncomputers would be purchased to facilitate our students with  IT\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tax reduction, there is no big change in this budget,\r\n\r\nexcept  for  a 10% rebate for corporate and personal income  tax\r\n\r\nonly.   However,  provisions are made to help our  lower  income\r\n\r\nfamilies  tide over these difficult times, unlike what the  NCMP\r\n\r\nhad  said  just  now. I welcome the rebates  given  to  the  HDB\r\n\r\ndwellers in terms of rentals, utilities and S&C charges.  I hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government could also provide some form of assistance\r\n\r\nto  those  who  are  retrenched or  unemployed  because  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn, as their families are suffering  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir loss of income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that after the off-budget measures and\r\n\r\nthe   $10.5  billion  cost-cutting  package  announced  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  last year, if the Government again gives some  cost-cutting  provisions  in this budget, it  would  send  the  wrong\r\n\r\nmessage  to  foreign  investors and local businessmen  that  our\r\n\r\neconomy is getting worse.  Therefore, I feel that although  this\r\n\r\nBudget is very cautiously tabled and seemingly uneventful,  like\r\n\r\nplain water, it is nevertheless a confidence-boosting budget.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  foreign investors will continue to come  here  to\r\n\r\ninvest  and  local  businessmen would also make  a  comeback  to\r\n\r\nrecapture  lost ground, thereby helping to  resolve our  present\r\n\r\nunemployment problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, to look beyond the economic crisis and put our\r\n\r\nfocus  on  the  strategic industrial development after  recovery\r\n\r\nfrom the crisis is the correct thing to do.  Our Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  cautious in avoiding over-reacting to the present  crisis,\r\n\r\nparticularly at this time where there are signs of recovery  for\r\n\r\nthe  economies in the  region.  I think this budget  would  give\r\n\r\npeople  more confidence and would alleviate their worries  about\r\n\r\nour economic future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its inception in July 1997, the\r\n\r\nAsian  financial crisis has been sustained for  more  than  11/2\r\n\r\nyears.  Although the crisis has quite seriously impacted on  us,\r\n\r\nour  sound financial system and solid economic fundamentals have\r\n\r\nstood  us  well  in withstanding this financial  turmoil.   Now,\r\n\r\nwith  some signs of recovery in the Asia-Pacific region, I  feel\r\n\r\nthat the Government and our people should not be too pessimistic\r\n\r\nabout  our  future.   We  should see how  we  could  seize  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  and  move one step higher.  The  Government  should\r\n\r\nalso  consider  creating an environment which  is  conducive  to\r\n\r\nforeign  investors and local businessmen to invest  here.   This\r\n\r\nwill help them to build up their business and, at the same time,\r\n\r\nbring out the  entrepreneurship among our Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first day of Chinese New Year this\r\n\r\nyear,  when   community leaders, friends and relatives  came  to\r\n\r\ngreet  me, at first, I would avoid using the traditional Chinese\r\n\r\ngreeting of \"Gong Xi Fa Cai\" because with this financial  crisis\r\n\r\nand all the troubles in this region, no one will believe that we\r\n\r\ncan  fa cai or strike a fortune this year.  So I just said  very\r\n\r\nplainly, \"Good Luck, Good Health\".  But then by the sixth day of\r\n\r\nChinese New Year, my feelings changed because on the fourth  day\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese  New Year, ie, on 19th February,  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nParliament  approved an unprecedented  huge budget of  S$1,211.5\r\n\r\nbillion to rescue the Japanese economy with the hope that in the\r\n\r\nnew  financial year starting on 1st April, it would be  able  to\r\n\r\nrescue  Japan  from  its  economic  recession  which  had   been\r\n\r\ntroubling them over the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlast  eight days.  I have full confidence in this rescue package\r\n\r\nof the Japanese Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the sixth day of Chinese New Year, ie, on 21st February,\r\n\r\nthe Government of the People's Republic of China decided that it\r\n\r\nwould  expand  its domestic demand and strive  for  7%  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth this year and they also stated categorically that the RMB\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  devalued.   With  all  my  years  of  experience\r\n\r\ninvesting  in China, I feel that this is not an impossible  task\r\n\r\nfor  the  Chinese  government.  And then on 19th  February,  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  of Taiwan also announced that  Taiwan's  five\r\n\r\nmain financial reform measures were receiving immediate positive\r\n\r\nresults.    Therefore, from the sixth day  of  the  Chinese  New\r\n\r\nYear,  I  began to say \"Gong Xi Fa Cai\" again because I  was  no\r\n\r\nlonger pessimistic about our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Chinese New Year this year, there are a lot of\r\n\r\nchanges  in the economic situation in Asia-Pacific.  Apart  from\r\n\r\nIndia  and  Indonesia,  there  are  many  countries  which   are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  see light of recovery at the end of  the  tunnel.\r\n\r\nFor  some countries, they see hope of getting out of the present\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis.   Apparently, the  launch  of  the  Euro  and\r\n\r\nBrazil's  financial turbulence have also caused  some  upheavals\r\n\r\nto  the  stock  markets in this region.  However, the  financial\r\n\r\nmarket was able to recover its tranquility in a relatively short\r\n\r\ntime.  Apart from the attempt to stimulate its economic recovery\r\n\r\nby  the  passing  of  a S$1,211.5 billion budget,  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  adjusted  its currency  policy  to  lower  the\r\n\r\nJapanese yen exchange rate to its lowest in  three months.   The\r\n\r\nmargin  of depreciation of the currencies of the other countries\r\n\r\nin  this  region remains quite normal. There was  no  particular\r\n\r\nupheaval  in the forex market. On the contrary, I have  observed\r\n\r\nthat  the  exchange rates of the currencies of  these  countries\r\n\r\nhave  rebounded by about 5% to 30% vis-a-vis last year's values.\r\n\r\nIn  the stock market and real estate market, there have been  no\r\n\r\nmore  slips  and there seems to be a tendency of  stable  climb.\r\n\r\nAll these changes are very encouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, many countries in the Asia-Pacific have also\r\n\r\nincreased their budget to stimulate their country's economy  and\r\n\r\nto  increase the need for their imports.  According to a report,\r\n\r\nin  January,  Korea  has increased 15.4% in  their  imports  and\r\n\r\nThailand has increased by about 1.6%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a speech delivered at a function of the New York Foreign\r\n\r\nPolicies Association, the Managing Director of IMF, Mr Camdessus\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Apparently, the economy of the Asia Pacific region is  in\r\n\r\nthe process of recovery, and for the world's economy,  the worst\r\n\r\nseems  to  be over already.\"    He admitted that, of late,   the\r\n\r\nmistake  of  IMF was to be over-pessimistic about  the  economic\r\n\r\nprospects.  He also felt that the economic reform plans  adopted\r\n\r\nby  the  Asia-Pacific  region were already  beginning  to  prove\r\n\r\neffective,  and that Korea and Thailand have apparently  stepped\r\n\r\nout of their economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that there are already some silver\r\n\r\nlinings  appearing from the black clouds overhanging  the  Asia-Pacific's   economy.  The  financial  situation  is  stabilised,\r\n\r\nforeign  trade is gradually improving and foreign  reserves  are\r\n\r\nincreased.    This  year, the Philippines  issued  international\r\n\r\nbonds  to  secure  more financing from  international  financial\r\n\r\nhouses  and  to  buy  in  US dollars from the  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nmarket,  thus substantially increasing the foreign  reserves  of\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines.   Malaysia  has  also  increased  its  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves  by 40%, attaining a high of US$28 billion in  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod of time. The Philippines' foreign reserves reached  US$12\r\n\r\nbillion  in  February this year, back to the  level  before  the\r\n\r\ncurrency  crisis.   As  for Thailand and  Korea,  their  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves  have  risen to US$29 billion and US$52.2 respectively.\r\n\r\nAll these increases in foreign reserves will help the countries'\r\n\r\ndebt repayment and import capabilities, and indirectly stabilise\r\n\r\nthe  exchange  rates.  More importantly, the five countries  and\r\n\r\nterritories  which  have  the highest foreign  reserves  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  namely,  Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  all  in  the  Asia-Pacific region.   This  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nresilience and ability to rebound in the Asia Pacific's  economy\r\n\r\nis very strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the world's semi-conductor industry is also showing\r\n\r\nsigns  of  recovery with expected growth of 8% this year.   This\r\n\r\nwill  in  turn  bring about more exports of electronic  products\r\n\r\nsuch  as  personal computers,  mobile telephones, etc. and  this\r\n\r\nwill  be  beneficial  to South-East Asian countries  whose  main\r\n\r\nexports are   electronic products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, I would say that there are already signs of\r\n\r\nrecovery  in  the  Asia  Pacific's economy.   I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and our people will not  be overly pessimistic  about\r\n\r\nthe Asia Pacific's economy.  We must be properly prepared. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  consolidating our domestic economy  so that we would  have\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  good  years of economic prosperity  ahead,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  also  do  more  to  create  an  environment\r\n\r\nconducive  to investment by foreign and local entrepreneurs,  by\r\n\r\nproviding financing facilities and simplified procedures.   This\r\n\r\nwill  not only help our business people to tide over the crisis,\r\n\r\nbut  also  prepare them properly so that they would be  able  to\r\n\r\nseize  good  opportunities   when  the  Asia  Pacific's  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers,  and  make  a  comeback to better  contribute  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our local businessmen must also seize the\r\n\r\nopportunities that may be available to them with the recovery of\r\n\r\nthe  Asia Pacific's economy.  In general, we must encourage  our\r\n\r\nlocal  businesses  and MNCs to venture into   the  Asia  Pacific\r\n\r\nregion this year.  Be the \"early bird that catches the worm\" and\r\n\r\npick  the  right  opportunities  to  invest  and  develop  their\r\n\r\nbusiness   for   good  returns.  I  hope  that   the   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions in Singapore will quickly and resolutely take  this\r\n\r\nkind  of economic recovery into consideration, and be daring  in\r\n\r\nproviding  financing facilities to the more  reliable  promising\r\n\r\nlocal  businesses so as to help them to seize such opportunities\r\n\r\nas  they  come  along.   This will be helpful  to  our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a survey by MasterCard International revealed that\r\n\r\nthere  has been significant increase in the  consumer confidence\r\n\r\nindex.   As a businessman,  my feeling for the economy  and  the\r\n\r\nmarket is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  direct  and sensitive.  In view of  this  whole  bunch  of\r\n\r\ngood  news,  I believe that the new year ahead will indeed be  a\r\n\r\ngood  year for us to  gong xi fa cai.   Let us work hand in hand\r\n\r\nto prepare ourselves to receive gong xi  fa cai .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would describe this as a strategic budget, one for the long\r\n\r\nterm  and  one  that  would allow us to take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nopportunities when the region recovers.  Because we  can  expect\r\n\r\nsome  intense competition from neighbours when and should  their\r\n\r\nrestructuring  efforts succeed in making them  more  competitive\r\n\r\nand efficient.  It is a predictable budget but, in this case, it\r\n\r\nis  good  because it demonstrates that we are not distracted  by\r\n\r\nshort-term   challenges  and  remain  focused   on   fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciples that have proven to be successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, however, to highlight five main areas which I\r\n\r\nthink   deserve   more   attention  from   the   Minister:   (1)\r\n\r\nstrengthening  our commitment and presence in  the  region;  (2)\r\n\r\nenhancing the capacity and capability of our SMEs; (3) assisting\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched  and unemployed; (4) encouraging and  motivating\r\n\r\npositive  attitudes  towards conservation;  and  (5)  developing\r\n\r\nsocial cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening our commitment and presence in the region</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite great efforts in regionalisation, we still face\r\n\r\nmany problems.  We hear of many failures than success.  What has\r\n\r\nhappened  to  our  Growth Triangle?  Our  investments  in  China\r\n\r\ncontinue to throw up many surprises.  But such is the nature and\r\n\r\nrisk  of  investment despite the fact that we are most  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  the  region.   One of the problems we have  today  is  the\r\n\r\ninability  to  reconcile  the dichotomy  between  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  relationships, that when political  relationship  goes\r\n\r\nthrough a bad patch, it seems to discourage many companies  from\r\n\r\ncommitting themselves or investing in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountry.   Should  this  be  so?  Can  businesses  and  economic\r\n\r\nrelationships  not  be  based on mutually  rewarding  principles\r\n\r\ncontinue  to survive the occasional and, of course, of  late,  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more frequent, political challenges?  Like it or not,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot change our geography.  The region will continue to be\r\n\r\nour  major market for our products and hinterland to expand  our\r\n\r\nindustrial base.  It is still the region we know best where  our\r\n\r\nrelations are still strong, where our best hopes lie.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our forefathers brought prosperity to this country as\r\n\r\nmiddlemen.  With only goodwill and friendship with neigbours  as\r\n\r\ntools  of  trade, now, more than ever before,  we  need  to  re-establish this goodwill between our people and our businesses to\r\n\r\nbe  strong enough to withstand the occasional political hiccups.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  strengthen and deepen this relationship  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbours   beyond  political  relationships,  which   can   be\r\n\r\nuncertain, but between businesses and between people.  We should\r\n\r\nsend  a  strong  signal to encourage and motivate  companies  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  reinforce this relationship.  We  should  not  let\r\n\r\nfailures  to  discourage us from continued  commitment  to  this\r\n\r\nregion.   The  financial  policies  and  budget  allocation  can\r\n\r\nreflect  this by making the necessary provision to assist  these\r\n\r\ncompanies to establish their presence and infrastructure in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   The  economy in the region may be bad, but  there  are\r\n\r\nstill good companies out there.  We can help local companies  to\r\n\r\ndevelop strategic relations through mergers and acquisitions, as\r\n\r\nthis may be the right time to forge such relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the humanitarian front, we can do more to help and\r\n\r\nassist  our  neighbours,  through  food  aid  and  other  social\r\n\r\nprojects.   We  can create long-term goodwill, for  example,  by\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  number of students under the ASEAN  scholarship\r\n\r\nprogramme, or perhaps offer training and scholarships  not  only\r\n\r\nin  educational institutions but to broaden the  scope  of  this\r\n\r\nprogramme,  eg,  to  train other professionals  in  the  region.\r\n\r\nGovernment institutions, eg, hospitals and social agencies,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  all  participate in this effort to strengthen relationships\r\n\r\nand reinforce ties with our friends in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing the capacity and capability of SMEs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of SMEs are traders and distributors. They have\r\n\r\nstrong  entrepreneurial skills, but many do not  own  their  own\r\n\r\nunique product of service.  Most of them are suppliers to  MNCs.\r\n\r\nWe  need to do more to help our SMEs.  They must be nurtured  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  strong  base of our economy, very much  like  in  Taiwan,\r\n\r\nbecause  an  economy  that  is too  dependent  on  MNCs  can  be\r\n\r\nvulnerable.   If  these companies decide to  withdraw  from  the\r\n\r\nregion  to support their local industries back home, our economy\r\n\r\ncan  be  severely affected.  While the Local Enterprise  Finance\r\n\r\nScheme has been expanded, it is still primarily to finance plant\r\n\r\nand  machinery and for investment in Singapore.  What is  needed\r\n\r\nis  to  help SMEs to strengthen their presence and operation  in\r\n\r\nthe region, and to support initiatives to explore new markets in\r\n\r\nother  regions.  We need to do more to encourage SMEs  to  merge\r\n\r\nand  form  bigger  companies and be  better  able  to  withstand\r\n\r\nincreasing  competition.   GLCs can take  the  lead  by  forming\r\n\r\nstrategic alliances and partnerships with local SMEs.  This  may\r\n\r\nbe  a  difficult  task  but one that we cannot  run  away  from,\r\n\r\nbecause  it is extremely important that our SMEs are strong  and\r\n\r\nlarge  enough to be regional or perhaps global players.  I  hope\r\n\r\nto  see  a  more  focused and determined effort to  nurture  and\r\n\r\nfinancially  motivate  SMEs  so  that  they  can  enhance  their\r\n\r\ncapacity and capability to be  truly regional players.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assisting the retrenched and unemployed</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retrenched or unemployed are not just unskilled or poorly\r\n\r\nskilled  workers.   It  affects also the  skilled  managers  and\r\n\r\nexecutives.   Even good and hardworking staff can be retrenched.\r\n\r\nFor  most  of  these  people, the need for help  is  urgent  and\r\n\r\nimmediate.  Not many have enough savings to help them cope  with\r\n\r\nlong  periods of unemployment.  With depreciating asset  values,\r\n\r\nselling  off  their  homes and cars may no longer  be  a  viable\r\n\r\noption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThey  cannot  think of retraining or other long-term  solutions.\r\n\r\nTo  them,  the most pressing need is to get a job and  ease  the\r\n\r\npain  of  their  financial burden.  The  subsidies  for  rental,\r\n\r\nutilities  and S&C charges are timely.  But I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould   be  more  generous  in  allocating  funds  for  welfare,\r\n\r\nbursaries and scholarships and to make them more accessible.  We\r\n\r\nshould do more to help their children and families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can also help lessen the burden in other ways by\r\n\r\nbeing more understanding in the collection of various Government\r\n\r\nand  statutory  board  charges and fees.  We  must  ensure  that\r\n\r\ndeficit  spending  does  result  in  either  job  creation   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans or helping them ease the burden.  Deficit  spending\r\n\r\ndoes  not necessarily translate to higher GDP growth because  of\r\n\r\nthe  large  import content of our spending.  But as long  as  it\r\n\r\ncreates jobs or helps them pay their bills, it would improve the\r\n\r\nwelfare of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Manpower Ministry and NTUC have done quite a lot to\r\n\r\nhelp  retrenched workers, we can do more to help a higher  level\r\n\r\nof  managers  and  executives.  Why not  make  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower a first-stop placement agency and help search  or  find\r\n\r\nanother job for all types of employees?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not training for managers and executives too? They too need\r\n\r\nto  be  retrained, retooled and reskilled.  Where can they  turn\r\n\r\nto?   Can  the civil service and statutory boards, for  example,\r\n\r\ntake  in more part-time or outsource most of their work to these\r\n\r\nself-employed professionals, not only to support these people in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  economic crisis but perhaps to make  Government  lean\r\n\r\nand,  hopefully,  develop a whole new industry of  self-employed\r\n\r\npeople?   This is becoming increasingly common in some countries\r\n\r\nlike the US, but I suspect will be more significant in Singapore\r\n\r\ntoo in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Encouraging positive attitudes towards conservation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the issue of water supply has brought about greater\r\n\r\nconsciousness amongst Singaporeans about the need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  conservation.  I would therefore like to see, in  fact,  in\r\n\r\nthe Budget, a more specific attempt to motivate and incentivise,\r\n\r\neg,  property developers and industrialists to invest in  energy\r\n\r\nconservation programmes and equipment as part of our  consistent\r\n\r\nand  long-term effort to make energy conservation a way of life.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in reality, some of these equipment tend  to  be  more\r\n\r\nexpensive than conventional ones and, until and unless  we  help\r\n\r\ndevelop   a  local  market  that  is  large  enough  to  support\r\n\r\nconservation  efforts,  energy  conservation  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nremain expensive and inconvenient.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing social cohesion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen recent attempts to test social cohesion and\r\n\r\nmulti-racial   understanding  of   our   people.    Fortunately,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are determined not to let foreigners interfere with\r\n\r\nour  social issues or agenda.  However, we cannot take this  for\r\n\r\ngranted.   The  recent  debate on discrimination  faced  by  job\r\n\r\nseekers,  if  not  well managed, can lead  to  problematic  race\r\n\r\nrelations.   We have agencies like the CDCs that are now  tasked\r\n\r\nto  forge community bonding amongst our people.  Perhaps we  can\r\n\r\nhave  programmes where self-help groups are encouraged  to  come\r\n\r\ntogether;  all  this  for the purpose of  exposing  our  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  our children, to have more contact with  friends  of\r\n\r\nother races, religions and economic backgrounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  in  support of the motion standing in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement this year, though cautious, is a\r\n\r\nprudent  one against a backdrop of the regional crisis  and  the\r\n\r\ntwo   off-budget  measures  last  year.   The  most  significant\r\n\r\nhighlight  in  this  year's Budget is perhaps the  unprecedented\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit projected at $5.1 billion.  The projected budget\r\n\r\ndeficit  is  mainly a result of reduced revenues than  increased\r\n\r\nexpenditures.  In fact, the expenditure is rising only  by  $1.5\r\n\r\nbillion  or  about  6%  compared to the past  year.   While  the\r\n\r\nreduced  revenues  resulting  from tax  concessions  are  indeed\r\n\r\nwelcomed by all,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  are  those who feel that there could have been a  greater\r\n\r\nbalance  in  the  range  of  growth sectors  which  should  have\r\n\r\nbenefited   from  these  fiscal  measures.   For  example,   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  services sector is very pleased with the measures  to\r\n\r\ndevelop the bond market.  However, with the Government's  stated\r\n\r\nintention  to  make  Singapore a knowledge-based  economy,  more\r\n\r\nfiscal  measures  could  have been  introduced  in  this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention three of these possibilities\r\n\r\nbased on feedback from the public and media.  First, there is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  introduce  tax  deduction for  the  purchase  of  home\r\n\r\ncomputers.   Presently, there is a heavy emphasis to  equip  our\r\n\r\nschools  with  computers  on a ratio  of  two  students  to  one\r\n\r\ncomputer  within  the next few years.  But school  students  and\r\n\r\nworking  adults alike would find that having a home computer  in\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  the  Internet and e-commerce  is  very  essential.\r\n\r\nAlready more than 40% of homes in Singapore have a computer.   I\r\n\r\nfeel that to help the remaining homes own a computer through the\r\n\r\ndeduction  of the hardware cost against the personal income  tax\r\n\r\nor  through a grant for HDB dwellers who may not be in  the  tax\r\n\r\nbracket,  will go a long way in enhancing our nation's  computer\r\n\r\nliteracy.  This will also help level the playing field  for  the\r\n\r\nyounger generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to lower the cost of information\r\n\r\nand  knowledge acquisition.  One of the key ways  in  which  new\r\n\r\nknowledge  and information are tapped is through licensing.   It\r\n\r\nis  common now to exploit licensed knowledge and information  in\r\n\r\nthe reseller markets where licensed technology is repackaged for\r\n\r\nsale, either as products or services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of licensing is the royalty or licence fee\r\n\r\npayable.  Typically, there is a withholding tax cost, which  the\r\n\r\nlicensee is required to bear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our knowledge infrastructure getting in place,\r\n\r\nSingapore is well positioned to become a reseller hub.  Reducing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  withholding  tax  costs  would certainly  help  boost  this\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchase of information and knowledge outright requires\r\n\r\ncapital  investment.  I understand that presently our  tax  laws\r\n\r\nconsider  the  acquiring  of  patents,  know-how  knowledge  and\r\n\r\ninformation  as  capital  in nature.   Unless  it  qualifies  as\r\n\r\napproved  patents  or know-how, no deduction is  given  for  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  cost  incurred.  From an economic standpoint,  these\r\n\r\nintellectual  properties and rights are  the  very  things  that\r\n\r\nhelp create the final outputs, be it goods or services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets used in a business are given wear and tear\r\n\r\nallowances  only  if they qualify as plant and  machinery.   But\r\n\r\nthis  concept  is somewhat dated.  In this information  age,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  completely review this if Singapore  is  to  become  a\r\n\r\nknowledge based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual properties and rights, whether purchased or\r\n\r\ncreated  in-house, are like plants and machinery in a knowledge-based  economy.   These are the tools with which businesses  are\r\n\r\ndone   and  carried  out.   Such  costs  should  be  given   tax\r\n\r\ndeductions, just like plants and machinery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a need to encourage employee share options\r\n\r\nespecially  as  we try to attract foreign talent  to  build  our\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy.   In  the  US,  many  IT  firms   have\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in attracting and retaining IT professionals  because\r\n\r\nof  their  very attractive employee stock options.  The  US  tax\r\n\r\nlaws also facilitate this use of employee stock options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, tax is imposed at the time the options are\r\n\r\nexercised.  The taxable amount is based on the excess of  market\r\n\r\nvalue  at the time of the exercise over the cost of acquisition.\r\n\r\nThis  does  not  necessarily encourage  employee  share  options\r\n\r\nbecause  share options are exercised when the market values  are\r\n\r\nhigher than the option price but the full amount is taxed in the\r\n\r\nyear  of exercise.  As the values of quoted shares move  up  and\r\n\r\ndown over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime,  the  tendency  is to sell at least  some  of  the  shares\r\n\r\nimmediately to fund the tax payment and to lock in the reward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current tax code does not encourage employees to hold\r\n\r\non  to  their  shares, and there is a need to  make  fundamental\r\n\r\nchanges in this regard.  The present system could be adopted  in\r\n\r\na  number  of  ways to encourage share ownership  and  long-term\r\n\r\nemployee commitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Finance Minister would consider\r\n\r\nthese three tax change suggestions to develop and grow our human\r\n\r\ncapital as we move towards a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has attributed to, as one of the\r\n\r\nmain factors contributing to Singapore's economic slowdown,  the\r\n\r\nsharp   contraction  in  regional  demand.   The  economies   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Thailand, Malaysia, Korea and Hong  Kong,  have  all\r\n\r\nsuffered recessions.  The financial crisis has brought  with  it\r\n\r\ndamage  to  economies, decimation of wealth, job  loss  and,  in\r\n\r\ncertain   instances,  political  fall  outs.   As  a  relatively\r\n\r\nunaffected  country amidst the regional turmoil,  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen  facing increasing pressure to provide financial assistance\r\n\r\nas a favour to aid its fellow ASEAN members.  One may also argue\r\n\r\nthat  such monetary transfers may be the necessary stimulant  to\r\n\r\nrevive and reinstate the much needed regional demand so vital to\r\n\r\nour own economic well-being.  The Budget, however, is silent  on\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The validity of such claims needs to be assessed using two\r\n\r\nyardsticks: firstly, does Singapore have the capacity to provide\r\n\r\nsuch forms of foreign aid and, secondly, is foreign monetary aid\r\n\r\nthe  best  solution  to the problems that cause  chaos  in  such\r\n\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Singapore economy grew very\r\n\r\nrapidly  in  the  past,  but the size of  our  national  income,\r\n\r\nmeasured  in monetary terms, is much smaller than the  potential\r\n\r\nincome of our neighbours.  A suitable analogy is that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  akin  to  a  rabbit and our  neighbours  are  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  of  elephants.   As a small  state  without  natural\r\n\r\nresources,  Singapore  bears  no illusions  about  its  inherent\r\n\r\ncapabilities, with its GNP at only around 1% that of the  United\r\n\r\nStates, a major provider of foreign aid.  As such, we are in  no\r\n\r\nposition  to  make available, in unconditional  terms,  monetary\r\n\r\nassistance  to the magnitude that major developed countries  are\r\n\r\ncapable of.  Nevertheless, we have consistently tried to  assist\r\n\r\nIndonesia  within  our  limited means since  the  start  of  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.   Examples  include  the proposed  US$5  billion  trade-financing  credit facility, and our commitment  to  extend  S$12\r\n\r\nmillion  worth  of  rice  and supplies as  humanitarian  aid  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has, however, come under criticism for\r\n\r\nstipulating  tough  conditions  for  the  usage  of  the  trade-financing  credit  facility.   The  real  problem  lies  in  the\r\n\r\ndivergence  of  views  on  how  Singapore  can  or  should  help\r\n\r\ncountries which are suffering from the current crisis.  There is\r\n\r\na  general belief that the rich should help the poor,  that  the\r\n\r\nhaves should assist the have-nots.  Moreover, the interdependent\r\n\r\nnature  of  regional trade and investment has led to  assertions\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore's  prosperity has, to an extent,  been  achieved\r\n\r\nusing the resources of its regional neighbours.  As such, we are\r\n\r\nnow expected to give generously and without conditions.  It must\r\n\r\nbe  reiterated that the proposed trade financing package serves,\r\n\r\nessentially, an enabling function: the main impetus  is  to  aid\r\n\r\nIndonesia along the path to recovery by allowing normal economic\r\n\r\nfunctions,  like trade, which have been hampered by the  crisis,\r\n\r\nto  continue.   The folly of advancing financial transfers alone\r\n\r\nwithout  ensuring  its effective usage is  well  illustrated  in\r\n\r\nacademic  studies  on  the efficacy  of  foreign  aid.   Let  me\r\n\r\nelaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been extensively documented that cash transfers\r\n\r\nalone  are unable to foster economic growth and recovery if  the\r\n\r\nmoney  was  deployed  poorly.  In many instances,  economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical   difficulties  are  concoctions   of   specific   and\r\n\r\nparticularistic circumstances prevailing within  countries,  and\r\n\r\nfew of such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblems  are  amenable to external intervention or  assistance.\r\n\r\nSound   domestic  policies  remain  the  key  solution  in   the\r\n\r\ngeneration  of economic recovery and growth, such as reforms  in\r\n\r\nthe  financial sectors, the adoption of appropriate  fiscal  and\r\n\r\nmonetary  policies  and  the  nurturing  of  a  solid  political\r\n\r\nfoundation  and a firm social fabric.  Countries suffering  from\r\n\r\neconomic difficulties should try to help themselves by restoring\r\n\r\nsocial  stability which is necessary for growth and development.\r\n\r\nOnce   stability  is  restored,  foreign  investors,   including\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, will start to trade and invest again.  This is the\r\n\r\ncorrect  way  to  generate badly needed  economic  recovery  and\r\n\r\nsocial  stability.  This is also a more dignified way  for  such\r\n\r\ncountries to emerge from the economic chaos, continue growing at\r\n\r\ntheir own momentum and realise their inherent potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the offering of aid need not be manifested in cash\r\n\r\ntransfers.  Singapore has provided assistance in other  concrete\r\n\r\nforms.   We  have been a strong advocate that ASEAN moves  ahead\r\n\r\nwith  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area initiative.   Such  policies\r\n\r\nprecipitate  positive  externalities  which  benefit  all  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also set aside S$12 million under the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Cooperation   Programme   to   provide   about    30\r\n\r\nundergraduate  scholarships a year for ASEAN students  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  three  to  four  years for study in Singapore.   Upon  the\r\n\r\ncompletion of their studies, these students will return to serve\r\n\r\nand contribute to their own countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's fortunes and ASEAN's are intertwined.\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  afford  to let  other  countries  falter.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that within our means we have done our best to  assist,\r\n\r\nand hope that they do not falter.  In this regard, I support the\r\n\r\napproach taken by the Government in offering assistance packages\r\n\r\nto countries in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget tabled by the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate on the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise some comments on Finance policy that\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister might respond to and clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who think that this Budget is a \"non-event\".\r\n\r\nTo  the contrary, I think that there are people who are watching\r\n\r\nwhat  Singapore does in the face of this crisis.  What we do  or\r\n\r\ndo  not do has significance, not just for individual pockets and\r\n\r\ncorporate coffers in Singapore, but also in the region  and  the\r\n\r\ninternational context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the recent past, economists and politicians alike\r\n\r\nbelieved,  \"We are all Keynesians now\", as the late US President\r\n\r\nRichard Nixon said.  What this means is that when faced  with  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  or economic downturn, the answer lies with a  greater\r\n\r\ngovernment  role.  Government has to tax and spend, or  if  they\r\n\r\ncannot   tax,  then  it  should  go  into  deficit  and   spend.\r\n\r\nGovernment spending and Government's role was the central key to\r\n\r\ncontinued  economic good times.  Government, in this  view,  was\r\n\r\nnot  only  the  regulator but also the active  manager  and  big\r\n\r\nplayer  in the economy.  State-owned enterprises, subsidies  and\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  state were outgrowths of this thinking.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  in Europe, but also in many parts of the  developing\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have changed since then. Internationally, in almost\r\n\r\nevery  continent,  we  have  seen  a  movement  away  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  the  market  as  an  arbiter  of  the   economy.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has not been left out of this movement.   Indeed,  we\r\n\r\nhave been one of the first countries to move away from socialism\r\n\r\ntowards   the   world   market   emphasising   investment    and\r\n\r\ninternational  trade.  As a marker of this, some observers  have\r\n\r\napplauded our economy as the \"freest economy\" in Asia, ahead  of\r\n\r\nHong Kong.  This movement and accolade are largely welcome.  But\r\n\r\nan emphasis on the market is not an absolute blessing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries that have moved to the market have lesser ability to\r\n\r\nparticipate in their economies and less ability to control\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  economies.  In good times, this may not matter.   In  bad\r\n\r\ntimes,  however, there may be fewer tools and policies available\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to intervene.  If the Government intervenes\r\n\r\nto bail out bad companies, or to establish welfare services that\r\n\r\nare  beyond  the  ability of its budget, then the  international\r\n\r\nmarket  will  rate  their  economic  potential  for  the  future\r\n\r\naccordingly and they will go elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, the first limitation to what our Government\r\n\r\ncan  do  for  our economy and our people.  In a  world  that  is\r\n\r\nmoving towards the market, it would prejudice the confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  international community if we pull back.   Yet,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nstand  idly  by as our economy and our citizens are hit  by  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.   It  therefore becomes a question of making  the  right\r\n\r\ninterventions  that  are helpful for the  present  and  for  the\r\n\r\nlonger  term, and which are acceptable to our people and to  the\r\n\r\ninternational community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question that Government can do everything or, on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  that  we should rely  only  on  the  markets.\r\n\r\nRather,  it becomes a question of governing the market,  as  the\r\n\r\npolitical economist, Robert Wade, suggests.  That is to say,  we\r\n\r\nrequire  government  action and policy that  are  in  line  with\r\n\r\nmarket forces, but allied to achieving public and social good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we are not alone in this. In many developed countries,\r\n\r\nthere  is a wish to continue and restore growth through economic\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  but  also a wish to soften the  sometimes  harsh\r\n\r\nconsequences of the market on ordinary people.  There  has  been\r\n\r\nas such, talk of looking for a \"Third Way\", especially in the UK\r\n\r\nand USA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, when we consider this deficit\r\n\r\nbudget  and the financial policy of this Government, it  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  size  per  se of the deficit that should  concern  us.   We\r\n\r\nshould  instead  consider  two  basic  questions:   (1)  Are  we\r\n\r\nspending  money  in  the right way?  (2)  Are  our  policies  in\r\n\r\ntaxation sending the right incentives and signals to our people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn, first, to the money we are spending. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  emphasised  the need  to  continue  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure in key areas such as education and defence.  I agree\r\n\r\nthat  we  must  think of the long term and use our  reserves  to\r\n\r\ndevelop areas that will advantage us in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, I welcome the continued expenditure. But in this\r\n\r\nlight, in planning for the future, I would call for Government's\r\n\r\nassistance in two areas of more immediate concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is of children and education. Schooling is not\r\n\r\ncompulsory  by  law in Singapore.  In good times everyone  knows\r\n\r\nand  most  can afford to emphasise education for their children,\r\n\r\nfor  their future.  My concern is that this calculation  changes\r\n\r\nin  this  time of crisis.  I urge the Government to monitor  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of drop-outs where this may result from changed economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   Sufficient and more generous bursaries  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.   These should support not just the direct  costs  of\r\n\r\nschooling  a child but the opportunity cost of the family  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second immediate concern regarding education is of self-improvement by our citizens. As we tool up for the knowledge-based economy (KBE), we should try to make sure that all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  a  chance  and  the  incentive   for   self-improvement.   Government has generously funded schemes  as  the\r\n\r\nmain plank, but individuals may also wish to invest in their own\r\n\r\nself-improvement.   And where they choose to do  so,  Government\r\n\r\nshould  support  those decisions with the right incentives.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  the Budget proposes an exemption  of  $2,500,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of $500.  But perhaps this may be insufficient,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Minister to consider a higher tax exemption.   In\r\n\r\nthis sense, I am arguing that we need to link the long-term view\r\n\r\nof  investing in education to the short-term realities in  these\r\n\r\ndifficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn next to defence expenditure. Like many other\r\n\r\nspeakers, I see the need for good defence force as a factor of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstability in these troubled times.  Peace and security  are  the\r\n\r\nbedrock  for  our democracy.  I would, however, raise  two  more\r\n\r\nspecific questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I note that it is not only the development expenditure\r\n\r\nthat  has increased, but also the operating expenditure, by some\r\n\r\n$160   million.    The   difference  between   development   and\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  a bit like between investment and  consumption.\r\n\r\nMay  I  ask  the  Minister or his colleague,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence,  to  clarify the need for increases in consumption,  in\r\n\r\nthis  sense, in this time of crisis?  More, generally,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Government if there are ways of  benchmarking\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  sufficiency in the Armed Forces.   I  ask  this\r\n\r\nparticularly in light of the recent second report of the  Public\r\n\r\nAccounts Committee of November 1998 that reports some lapses  in\r\n\r\nMINDEF's accounting practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on defence. Our expenditure has remained quite\r\n\r\nconstant, if not increased, and this is a stark comparison  with\r\n\r\nreductions among many of our neighbours in this time of  crisis.\r\n\r\nOf  course, we should be well defended, and I am not encouraging\r\n\r\nus to downgrade our expenditure according to our neighbours.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not  beggar ourselves because they  are  poor.   But  my\r\n\r\nconcern is that our defence spending should not by itself  be  a\r\n\r\nsource  of misunderstanding and concern in the region.  I  would\r\n\r\nencourage dialogue and transparency to allay any suspicion  that\r\n\r\nwe are taking an aggressive posture and not simply an investment\r\n\r\nin a sound defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn next to another area of expenditure - social\r\n\r\nassistance.   There have been many calls to assist  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  this  time of crisis.  I do not wish to add to  the  various\r\n\r\nwish  lists.  This crisis should not see the overnight  creation\r\n\r\nof  a welfare state in Singapore.  I do however wish to call  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government to consider ways of innovating the ways in which\r\n\r\nit  will  spend  money.   We too should, between  a  suffocating\r\n\r\nwelfare  state  and often harsh local marketplace,  look  for  a\r\n\r\n\"third way\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One clear area for innovation is to specifically target\r\n\r\nthose  who  have lost their jobs.  The Budget has  given  a  10%\r\n\r\nrebate to all individuals.  Some may consider this insufficient.\r\n\r\nBut  I understand that Government cannot help everyone all  that\r\n\r\nmore,  given the current deficit already.  But there  should  be\r\n\r\nspecial   targeting  in  Government  assistance.   I  think   in\r\n\r\nparticular  of  those who have lost their  jobs  and  have  been\r\n\r\nunable to find employment again for extended periods.  For these\r\n\r\npeople,  I hope the Government will consider temporary  measures\r\n\r\nto  assist  them further.  Areas such as housing,  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ntheir  children's  education, re-training and the  creation  and\r\n\r\nmatch-making to casual or part-time work should be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second area is in jobs and discrimination. This is an\r\n\r\nissue  that  has arisen recently, especially as regards  private\r\n\r\nsector  hiring.   If this is not addressed, the economic  crisis\r\n\r\nwill test our social cohesion.  The Government has responded  to\r\n\r\nthat  by  saying  that  it  will discourage  discrimination  and\r\n\r\nencourage  meritocracy.  I support this.  I would also  call  on\r\n\r\nthe Government to monitor the situation closely and continue  to\r\n\r\nset  a  moral  leadership in its own hiring.  We sometimes  take\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  and rights against discrimination for granted  when\r\n\r\ntimes  are good.  But especially in these bad times, meritocracy\r\n\r\nand human rights must be a shield to protect our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third way in which I think we should innovate in our\r\n\r\nspending  is  to encourage giving among the citizens themselves.\r\n\r\nOur Government has moved away from a welfare state, dependent on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and its spending, to a policy of  many  helping\r\n\r\nhands.   This requires private sector help and giving.  In  this\r\n\r\ntime  of  crisis,  there is a pressure on these  private  hands.\r\n\r\nWhen  companies  are showing bad results or losses,  it  becomes\r\n\r\nvery difficult to sustain the giving to charities and other good\r\n\r\ncauses.   If companies, families and individuals still  give,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  should receive greater support from Government.   I\r\n\r\ncall  on  the Government to double tax exemptions for  companies\r\n\r\nand  individuals who continue to give to charities, arts  groups\r\n\r\nand other causes, and to give tax\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincentives  to  families who support their own members  who  are\r\n\r\ndependants or who have lost their jobs.  This approach does not,\r\n\r\nI  want to emphasise, create a dependency on the State.  Rather,\r\n\r\nI  call  on  the State to encourage members of our community  to\r\n\r\nhelp  each  other.  This will increase our social  cohesion  and\r\n\r\ngrow our heartware.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn finally to Singapore and the region. The\r\n\r\nBudget  reacts to the regional economic crisis.  For it  is  the\r\n\r\ncrisis, and not our own internal factors, that is affecting  our\r\n\r\nperformance.   Conversely, I believe that we must  consider  and\r\n\r\nrespond to the crisis.  In so doing, our foreign and our foreign\r\n\r\neconomic policy is not a distraction from the economic situation\r\n\r\nbut  an  important  task that is linked to  possible  routes  to\r\n\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region's financial crisis has led to social and\r\n\r\npolitical changes in our region, among our neighbours.  There is\r\n\r\na  sense  of  autarky  and a narrow nationalism  rising  in  the\r\n\r\ncountries around us.  There are inclinations to close borders to\r\n\r\nforeign   capital.    There  are  great   social   dislocations,\r\n\r\nespecially  among the poor, the young and the women.   A  UNICEF\r\n\r\nreport  has warned of a lost generation in our region - children\r\n\r\nwho drop out of school with little or no education.  Neither  of\r\n\r\nthese developments - the autarky or this lost generation - would\r\n\r\nbe in Singapore's interest, or our neighbours'.  What can we do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our role in this may be very difficult. There have been\r\n\r\nunwarranted  and  unfounded criticisms of us by our  neighbours.\r\n\r\nThese may anger our own citizens.  But we should not over-react.\r\n\r\nPeople  will say things in desperate times that they  would  not\r\n\r\nnormally.   We  should look to the longer term.  We  should  re-emphasise  the  win-win nature of cooperation in the  region  to\r\n\r\nseek  engagement  with those who welcome it  to  provide  useful\r\n\r\nforms  of assistance to those who most need it.  We should offer\r\n\r\ncooperation and assistance to our neighbours in ASEAN.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  previous speaker, the Member of Parliament,  Dr  Ker,\r\n\r\nthat  this  need  not be in terms of dollar  aid  only  but  our\r\n\r\nassistance should be tangible and sufficient.  Additionally,  we\r\n\r\nshould offer cooperation and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nengagement  to others outside our region, such as  the  USA  and\r\n\r\ninternational agencies, whose help and attention can assist  the\r\n\r\nregion's recovery and, therefore, our own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asia has been struck by a contagion. But because we have\r\n\r\nkept  ourselves fiscally, not physically, fit over these  years,\r\n\r\nwe  are less affected.  Among the stricken economies, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  should  be among those assisting in the process of recovery.\r\n\r\nI  shall  propose specific policies in the cuts in the Committee\r\n\r\nof  Supply.  I hope the Minister will respond to my comments and\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  allowing me to join in the debate.  Sir, the most  striking\r\n\r\nfeature of Budget 99 is clearly the $5.1 billion deficit.   Over\r\n\r\nthe past decade, there has been a recurrent constant refrain  in\r\n\r\nthis  House and outside for the Government to reduce its  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus  and  redistribute funds to individuals and  corporates.\r\n\r\nOur  current  circumstances, in my view, amply  demonstrate  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of the Government's stated approach.  It has got prudence\r\n\r\nin  years of plenty and preparation for the years when  we  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like to congratulate the Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  Government for not flinching at a time  like  this  in\r\n\r\nincurring  a  substantial budget deficit.  I  trust  this  would\r\n\r\nclear  the  doubts of many of its detractors.  I also hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will  remain steadfast  in  its  commitment  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with such largesse if the need arises in  future  with\r\n\r\ncontinued economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said in the course of this debate on\r\n\r\nvarious aspects pertaining to the business and economy.  I  wish\r\n\r\nto confine my comments to the social dimension.  One significant\r\n\r\nimplication  of  this  economic  downturn  has  been  the  stiff\r\n\r\nchallenge it has posed to our resilience and unity as a  nation.\r\n\r\nOur  social cohesion has been tested and continued to be  tested\r\n\r\nby  external as well as internal forces.  Some manifestations of\r\n\r\nthis  are,  firstly,  the  more negative  attitude  one  detects\r\n\r\ntowards  the  infusion of foreign talent; secondly,  in  a  more\r\n\r\npronounced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsocio-economic  divide  and consciousness  as  those  with  less\r\n\r\nskills  lose their livelihood first; and, thirdly, in  the  more\r\n\r\nrecent  debate, which is the revival of something that has  been\r\n\r\nlying  low  for a while, in terms of discrimination in  the  job\r\n\r\nmarket on the basis of age, sex or ethnicity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Sir, as the pie shrinks, the instinct for self-preservation is heightened. So we need to be vigilant and guard\r\n\r\nagainst  such  divisive forces if our social fabric  is  not  to\r\n\r\nfray.   The question then is how the financial policy in  Budget\r\n\r\n99 supports this objective - the need to maintain and strengthen\r\n\r\nour social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, there is much that has been done in the form\r\n\r\nof  S&C rebates, GST-related offsets, personal tax rebates, etc,\r\n\r\nand a quick back-on-the-envelope calculation suggested something\r\n\r\nto  the  tune  of  $500  million  has  been  set  aside  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   in   terms  of  direct  support   for   individual\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, particularly those who may need help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, the question is not whether the Government\r\n\r\nhas  been generous, but whether it has been too generic  in  its\r\n\r\nefforts  to  help Singaporeans.  More specifically,  can  we  be\r\n\r\nsharper  in the way we structure financial policy to help  those\r\n\r\nwho  need  help?   Allow  me  to illustrate.   If  we  have  two\r\n\r\nneighbours  in  adjacent 4-room flats in the same  block,  their\r\n\r\nexperiences pertaining to this economic downturn could be vastly\r\n\r\ndifferent.   It would depend on whether they bought  their  flat\r\n\r\ndirectly  from  HDB or on the resale market,  when  they  bought\r\n\r\ntheir flat, the number of children they have in the family,  the\r\n\r\nemployment  situation, whether anyone has been retrenched,  etc.\r\n\r\nSome  would have two properties, others would be servicing their\r\n\r\nfirst  mortgage.  Some may drive cars and others would  rely  on\r\n\r\npublic  transport.  Yet the structure of the financial  benefits\r\n\r\nwhich  uses  HDB flat size as a proxy for socio-economic  status\r\n\r\nor,  more  importantly, their financial need begs  the  question\r\n\r\nwhether it is appropriate as an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindicator of where Government funding should be channelled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, using HDB flat size on its own is a less\r\n\r\nthan  perfect indicator and it is one that the Government should\r\n\r\nre-examine  closely.  In particular, I think the system  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved  and the Government could be more targeted and  layered\r\n\r\nin its approach.  For example, whilst we could have a base layer\r\n\r\nof S&C rebates and other grants which are distributed along this\r\n\r\nline  of flat size, there could be additional layers, especially\r\n\r\nthose that emerge in these times, which can be more specifically\r\n\r\ntargeted at those who need help.  For example, instead of having\r\n\r\nan  across-the-board  town  council S&C  grant,  we  could  have\r\n\r\ninstead  taken  this money, put it into a fund,  and  say,  \"OK,\r\n\r\nlet's  target  this  at those individuals who specifically  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty and can go through CDCs, self-help groups  and  other\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations to apply for such  assistance.\"\r\n\r\nThese  organisations  are  already in  close  contact  with  the\r\n\r\nground.  They know the needs.  They know the individuals in many\r\n\r\ninstances  and they would bring about a better matching  between\r\n\r\nthe  Government's intent, in terms of setting up  such  schemes,\r\n\r\nand how it takes effect on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using voluntary welfare organisations, CDCs and self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  is  one  method.  Even if it is to  be  done  centrally,\r\n\r\nperhaps  by  referring  to CPF accounts  and  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nmultiple  property owners or single property owners, or  perhaps\r\n\r\nby  reference to their property ownership in particular, we  may\r\n\r\nbe  able  to distinguish those who truly need help.   My  point,\r\n\r\nSir, is not to deny Singaporeans in need of their dues.  Rather,\r\n\r\nit  is  to  state  the  point  that  Government  has  set  aside\r\n\r\nsubstantial sums to help those in need.  It is equally important\r\n\r\nthat these sums be directed at those who truly need it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>2.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.  Some might say that this  is\r\n\r\na  very appropriate Budget for the times that we are in.  It  is\r\n\r\nindeed a good Budget!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter  last  year's  off-Budget  measures  and  after  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has come up in terms of the various programmes,  this\r\n\r\nyear's budgetary response is very appropriate to the times  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  in.   And  as  the Minister has said,  the  Budget  was\r\n\r\ncarefully calibrated to respond to the regional crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take heart in the use of the term \"calibrated\"\r\n\r\nbecause it denotes a sense of exact measure, not more, not less,\r\n\r\nbut  just  right.  It also means that the response would  change\r\n\r\naccordingly  depending  on  how the  regional  crisis  develops.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  Sir, it is a very pragmatic strategy in these  changing\r\n\r\nand troubled times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, a number of MPs have called on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take care of our own people in  these  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes  and  that  we  should  be more  careful  in  giving  PRs,\r\n\r\nemployment pass and/or work permits to foreigners.  Sir,  I  too\r\n\r\nsupport  this call.  In fact, I have had the same comments  from\r\n\r\nmy  own  ground.  But, Sir, in the larger scheme  of  things,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to caution the Government to be very careful on  this\r\n\r\nissue.   There is a need to have a very fine balance of  helping\r\n\r\nour  people  and making sure that we do not reject  the  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  that  will be very necessary to our economy.   Sir,  we\r\n\r\ncannot afford to be a closed economy.  We should not over react,\r\n\r\nclose  ranks  and help our people to the long-term detriment  of\r\n\r\nour economy and, ultimately, our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, closing ranks and rejecting foreign talents is not the\r\n\r\nway  to  compete.   We have in fact only one resource,  a  point\r\n\r\noften mentioned in this House; our human resource.  The only way\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  compete is to provide the means  to  make  our\r\n\r\npeople, entrepreneurs and companies stronger and better than the\r\n\r\nforeign  competitors.  In this respect, I  am  not  disappointed\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government has provided ample resources  for  these\r\n\r\ngoals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, in the larger sense, I must still admit that I am\r\n\r\ndisappointed,  not  because  of this  Budget,  but  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister  did  not  make long-term changes to  our  tax  system;\r\n\r\nchanges  necessary  to promote Singapore  as  a  total  business\r\n\r\ncentre, not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonly  for  the region, but for the world.  This Budget  and  the\r\n\r\npast  Budgets have done much to promote Singapore as  a  premier\r\n\r\nfinancial centre.  But I ask, despite my own background  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial area, why only the financial centre?  Why do  we  stop\r\n\r\nthere?  We want to be a first world economy competing not on low\r\n\r\ncost  but on high productivity.  We want to be an industrialised\r\n\r\ncountry, not just only a centre for financial services.  We want\r\n\r\nto  attract  top-notch MNCs to set up headquarters in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhether  world headquarters or regional headquarters.   We  want\r\n\r\nour  home-grown companies to be world beaters, both in Singapore\r\n\r\nand abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want these and more, it is time for us to have a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive review of our tax system.  We need to have  a  tax\r\n\r\nsystem  compatible with these goals and not one  which  provides\r\n\r\nobstacles.  For example, take the issue of group income.   Other\r\n\r\nMembers  have  spoken  on group income  in  relation  to  single\r\n\r\npurpose  or  single property companies.  Here, I am thinking  of\r\n\r\ngroup income on a very much wider basis because our overall  tax\r\n\r\nsystem still treats companies within the group as individual tax\r\n\r\nentities.  Not only is it wrong but it is out of step  with  the\r\n\r\nrest of the advanced economies in the world.  The United States,\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries and even Australia have some form  of  group\r\n\r\nincome  taxation.  I am not asking the Minister  to  have  group\r\n\r\ntaxation in Singapore just because these countries are doing it.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would like to ask the Minister why these countries  have\r\n\r\ngroup  taxation.   If  you look at it,  the  answer  is  simple.\r\n\r\nBecause  a  group of companies, related to each  other,  through\r\n\r\nownership and management, constitutes a single economic unit for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of strategic management and financial planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a very important phrase here. These companies\r\n\r\nwithin  a  group should not be considered as different entities,\r\n\r\nbut  as  a single economic unit.  Our current tax system ignores\r\n\r\nthis  economic  reality and thus helps to  create  economic  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  distortions.  I suppose it provides good business  for\r\n\r\ntax planners and tax consultants.  But on the negative side,  it\r\n\r\nuses up a lot of management time,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwastes  resources and distorts strategic planning in  trying  to\r\n\r\nachieve the tax plans to beat the irrational system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is that group taxation recognises this. Thus, it\r\n\r\nhelps  the single economic unit, that is, the group, to maximise\r\n\r\nits  potential.  Sir, this is not a new issue.  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nMinister is well aware of the pros and cons of group taxation as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  way  to move towards such a system  with  minimum\r\n\r\ndislocation,  cost  and loss of the tax  base,  if  only  he  is\r\n\r\nwilling  to consider this.  In fact, while I do not wish  to  go\r\n\r\ninto any detailed argument on this, there is ample literature on\r\n\r\nthis.   For  example,  in  1994, the  South  African  Government\r\n\r\ncommissioned  the  Katz Commission to study  this  whole  issue,\r\n\r\namongst other issues.  If Members are interested in this report,\r\n\r\nI can make it available to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are compelling reasons why, in a modern economy, group\r\n\r\ntaxation should be adopted.  It is not because others are  doing\r\n\r\nit,  but  because it is a very rational thing to do.  There  are\r\n\r\nmore  issues,  such as tax on remitted income and capital  gains\r\n\r\ntax.   Our  tax  system  is  based on a  territorial  principle.\r\n\r\nHowever,  today,  the  world is one big marketplace.   There  is\r\n\r\nglobalisation.   There  is freedom of capital  and  funds  flow.\r\n\r\nThere  are  WTO  regulations and a host of other  liberalisation\r\n\r\nmeasures which have made the world into one big marketplace, and\r\n\r\nour   companies   are  competing  in  that   marketplace.    Our\r\n\r\nterritorial principle of taxation compounded by the  absence  of\r\n\r\ngroup  taxation  really  hampers our  companies  not  only  from\r\n\r\ncompeting in Singapore compared to the rest, but also  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, financial innovations have made nonsense of what\r\n\r\nconstitutes  capital gains and income.  Therefore,  to  preserve\r\n\r\nthe  integrity of our tax base, the IRAS has come out  with  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  interpretations  to remove  what  they  deem  as  tax\r\n\r\nloopholes.   But  in  doing  so, they  distort  the  very  basic\r\n\r\nfundamentals of our tax system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give some over-simplified examples. If a company in\r\n\r\nSingapore were to have income overseas, such income, as long  as\r\n\r\nit is not remitted to Singapore, will not be taxed in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be considered as income earned outside Singapore,  not\r\n\r\nderived  from Singapore and not remitted to Singapore.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, if this company were to use these funds to pay  for\r\n\r\nthe  expenses  of one of its subsidiaries overseas,  then  IRAS,\r\n\r\nunder  present interpretation, will most probably deem  this  as\r\n\r\nremitted income to Singapore, although the funds do not actually\r\n\r\ncome   to  Singapore.   This  is  what  they  call  constructive\r\n\r\nremittance.  Sir, this is a new interpretation.  They  have  put\r\n\r\nthis in place some two or three years ago.  But it is causing  a\r\n\r\nlot of difficulties for companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, for example, we allow companies to buy back their\r\n\r\nown shares.  One would think this is a simple issue from the tax\r\n\r\nangle.   These companies are returning back the capital  to  its\r\n\r\nshareholders, ie, capital which they feel they cannot use to the\r\n\r\nbest  of  their  ability.  Again, IRAS is saying that  if  these\r\n\r\nfunds  do not come from contributed capital, that means  capital\r\n\r\nthat  was contributed in the first place, then these funds which\r\n\r\nare being used in a buy-back scheme would also have to be taxed.\r\n\r\nHow do these funds arrive in the first place?  These funds arose\r\n\r\nbecause  companies are able to generate some capital  gains  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  they  put  these  funds into  some  form  of  capital\r\n\r\nreserve.  It is part of the company's capital formation.   These\r\n\r\nfunds are therefore returned back to the shareholders in a  buy-back  scheme.   But  they  are not contributed  capital,  having\r\n\r\narisen  out  of capital gains.  If they are taxed,  then  it  is\r\n\r\nactually equivalent to IRAS taxing on capital gains.  Again,  it\r\n\r\nis causing problems and distortions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main point is that these tax matters are knee-jerk\r\n\r\nreactions.   Because the world has changed,  because  there  are\r\n\r\nfinancial innovations, because the way businesses are  done  all\r\n\r\nover  the world has changed, and the taxman is so worried  about\r\n\r\nthe   tax  base,  they  come  up  now  with  all  these   ad-hoc\r\n\r\ninterpretations which in essence,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  I  have said earlier, distort the way business is being done\r\n\r\nand  it does not help our companies when they compete with other\r\n\r\ncompanies  in the international global marketplace.  The  reason\r\n\r\nis very simple - shareholders want after-tax returns, not before-tax returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at our tax system, it came into being when\r\n\r\nSingapore was a colony, when the world consisted of many  closed\r\n\r\neconomies, when we were limited by our shores and our vision  by\r\n\r\nWhitehall.  Now, we have changed.  More significantly, the world\r\n\r\nhas  changed.   So  it  is time for us to have  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview  of  our tax system to support Singapore's dream  in  the\r\n\r\nnext millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget with the hope that the Minister could\r\n\r\nbe  persuaded  to  initiate a comprehensive review  of  our  tax\r\n\r\nsystem  so as to maximise the potential competitiveness  of  our\r\n\r\ncompanies on the world stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe motion proposed by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while there were no surprises in this year's Budget,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  could  have done more  than  just  focus  on  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector if we are really serious about the next  phase\r\n\r\nof growth of our economy that has to be driven by more than just\r\n\r\nbeing a financial hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, through a series of budget and off-budget measures,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  addressed mainly  short-term  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  in some of the sectors of our economy and I feel  that\r\n\r\nit is about time that we started focusing on long-term strategic\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget has failed to introduce new initiatives that are\r\n\r\nbadly  needed for the next phase of growth for the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector,  the  knowledge-based economy  and  in  encouraging  the\r\n\r\nemergence of a more vibrant small and medium enterprise  sector.\r\n\r\nSo  I  feel  the  Government needs to start doing something  now\r\n\r\nbecause  we have the unique opportunity to widen our competitive\r\n\r\nedge against our neighbours and we will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  far  ahead  when the region recovers from the crisis  if  we\r\n\r\nstart now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since many Members have commented on the details of\r\n\r\nthe  budget,  I plan to touch on a few long-term  issues  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech today.  Firstly, I would like to touch on the lessons the\r\n\r\nGovernment can learn from the experience of the last few  years,\r\n\r\nand  second,  I  would like to share my views on  the  areas  we\r\n\r\nshould focus on for the long-term growth of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have observed a few areas of weaknesses in the way the\r\n\r\nGovernment has executed the role for the planning of our economy\r\n\r\nin  the  last  few  years.   While the Government  has  done  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  job in many areas, there are always opportunities  to\r\n\r\nbe  even better and I would like to suggest that there are three\r\n\r\nlessons  that  we  can learn from the way we  have  managed  our\r\n\r\nplanning process for the past three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lesson  No.  1:   The Accuracy of Economic Indices Used  by the Government</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight that as far back as in early\r\n\r\n1997,  even  before  the regional economic crisis  hit  us,  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector saw signs of our economy starting to slow down in\r\n\r\na  few sectors, including the manufacturing and service sectors.\r\n\r\nThen  again  in early 1998, the business community  projected  a\r\n\r\nrapid  decline  in  our economy, while in his Budget  speech  in\r\n\r\n1998, the Minister for Finance talked about recovery and growth,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  recovery  of the electronics  and  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsectors in 1998.  However, many industry players, including some\r\n\r\nMPs  in this House, expected a decline in these same sectors and\r\n\r\npredicted that Singapore will go into a recession in 1998, while\r\n\r\nthe  Government maintained a 2.5% to 4.5% growth rate.   Results\r\n\r\nshowed  that  instead  of  a  growth  in  the  electronics   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sectors, we saw a decline since the second quarter\r\n\r\nof  1998  and  going into negative territory in  the  third  and\r\n\r\nfourth quarters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consistent pattern I have observed is that there\r\n\r\nis  a gap between what the business community sees and what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies are able to measure.  I also see  that  the\r\n\r\nplanning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagencies  may  not  have a good feel of the real  pulse  of  the\r\n\r\nground and I also see a significant time lag for the information\r\n\r\ngathered  by  the  various Government agencies  to  be  used  to\r\n\r\nmeasure the state of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the information gathered and the measurement indices\r\n\r\nare used for economic planning and policy making, any inaccuracy\r\n\r\nor time lag could lead to policies that may not be optimal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first thing that needs to be seriously addressed is\r\n\r\nthe type of indices and how these should be collected so that we\r\n\r\ncan  do  a better job in predicting our economy.  New mechanisms\r\n\r\nand indices need to be introduced if we want to do a better job.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lesson No. 2:   The Inefficiencies of Small Incremental Measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also learn a lot about this from the mistakes that\r\n\r\nJapan  has made in the last few years in trying to recover after\r\n\r\nits  bubble economy burst.  In Japan, the government of the  day\r\n\r\nfor  the  last  few  years had attempted to recover  from  their\r\n\r\nrecession  by taking small step-by-step measures and the  impact\r\n\r\non  their  economy  has  been  insignificant,  despite  draining\r\n\r\ntremendous resources.  We in Singapore also attempted to take  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  route  by  trying to make small  piecemeal  changes  by\r\n\r\nannouncing  a  conservative 1998 Budget and tried to  follow  up\r\n\r\nwith  a  small $2 billion off-budget expenditure.   However,  we\r\n\r\nfailed to create an impact and finally we decided to take a bold\r\n\r\nstep by introducing the $10.5 billion off-budget measures at the\r\n\r\nend  of  last year.  The second issue that needs to be seriously\r\n\r\naddressed  is  therefore our willingness to take bold  steps  in\r\n\r\ntrying to influence changes to our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lesson No. 3:  Timing of Changes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this area, I would like to say that the Government\r\n\r\nhas a mixed track record.  We have shown that we are willing  to\r\n\r\ncome  out with off-budget measures when needed and not wait  for\r\n\r\nthe regular budget cycle to make changes.  Similarly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  have been prepared to make other non-fiscal changes  if  the\r\n\r\nneed  arises.  On the other hand, we were at least one year late\r\n\r\nin implementing the May 1996 property market measures to address\r\n\r\nthe  growing asset price bubble.  Therefore, the third  area  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  address is the speed at which we are willing  to  make\r\n\r\nchanges because sometimes, even a slight delay could result in a\r\n\r\ndisaster  as we can learn from Indonesia's delay in implementing\r\n\r\nthe  IMF  measures  which caused the rupiah  to  be  drastically\r\n\r\ndevalued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to focus on the long-term strategies\r\n\r\nthat  I feel the Government should focus on if we want to ensure\r\n\r\nanother  30  years of economic prosperity.  I feel  that  it  is\r\n\r\nabout time we looked at three key areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) how to ensure growth and new markets, including\r\n\r\nglobalisation - not just regionalisation;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) putting in place new capabilities, technologies and\r\n\r\nmechanisms   to  plug  into  the  knowledge-based  economy   and\r\n\r\nencourage technopreneurship;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) to change the direction and to re-orientate Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  to  include  a  vibrant SME sector  to  encourage  more\r\n\r\ntechnology intensive companies and to avoid over reliance on  an\r\n\r\nasset-based economy, as we have done in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the areas that the Budget for 1999-2000 has\r\n\r\nfailed  to  address.  However, I still have hope that  the  much\r\n\r\nbigger development expenditure set aside this year will focus on\r\n\r\nthese  areas.  I urge the Government not to over spend in  fixed\r\n\r\nassets, unless these directly support the above three new areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on these three areas that we should be\r\n\r\nfocusing  on.  First, on globalisation and exploring new  growth\r\n\r\nmarkets.   In  addition to being cost competitive, it  is  about\r\n\r\ntime we explored new markets, farther afield and go to new areas\r\n\r\nnot  explored  before.  In this respect, I  believe  the  Budget\r\n\r\ncould have been more proactive to accelerate growth and to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the opportunities available in the region  as  well\r\n\r\nas around the world.  Because Singapore has been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelatively unhurt by the crisis, we are in an excellent position\r\n\r\nto  be the first to take off and find the best opportunities and\r\n\r\nmarkets  as compared to our neighbours.  So some tax changes  to\r\n\r\naccelerate   globalisation  and  in  encouraging   mergers   and\r\n\r\nacquisitions  could  have been helpful.  I strongly  believe  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  restructure the current tax system,  as  some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this  House have spoken about, to  be  more  future\r\n\r\noriented so that businesses will be prepared to invest early for\r\n\r\nfuture returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on technopreneurship and encouraging the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  spirit.  In my opinion,  technopreneurship  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit are the most important areas we  need  to\r\n\r\naddress for the future growth of the Singapore economy, and this\r\n\r\nis where I find the current Budget has a serious shortcoming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our success in building a flawless infrastructure\r\n\r\nthrough  a  strong civil service and our education  system  that\r\n\r\ninculcates  benefits of stable professions and  the  glamour  of\r\n\r\nworking  in  multi-nationals  is  now  causing  our  failure  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more entrepreneurs to emerge.  We have  to  seriously\r\n\r\naddress  these mindsets among our young which, as I  have  said,\r\n\r\nare  the  results  of our style of governance for  the  past  30\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, after a decade of government led growth, the\r\n\r\ncountry  is now looking at entrepreneurs to lead the economy  to\r\n\r\nits next stage of growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taiwan's success is also attributable to its quest to\r\n\r\nencourage   technopreneurship.    From   1988   to   1998,   the\r\n\r\ncontributions made by science and technology-based companies  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan  to the economy has grown from 26.3% to almost 40%  in  a\r\n\r\nshort span of 10 years.  Sir, we too have to now shift our focus\r\n\r\nand I suggest the following four areas to be looked into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our education system, from one that is vocation\r\n\r\nbased  to  one  that is knowledge based.  In Singapore,  we  are\r\n\r\nstill relying on old methods of teaching which were designed  to\r\n\r\ntrain  people  to fit into the various jobs for  the  industries\r\n\r\nplanned  for our economic growth.  While I can see some changes,\r\n\r\nI think we have to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccelerate  these changes if we are very serious  about  growing\r\n\r\nthis  part  of  our economy.  In the 9th November 1998  Newsweek\r\n\r\nreport on 'Silicon Valley' aspirant cities, it was reported that\r\n\r\nanalysts felt Singapore's education system depends on \"out-dated\r\n\r\nteaching  methods  and learning by rote with little  chances  of\r\n\r\nindependent  thinking\".  This together with  the  reward  system\r\n\r\nthat focuses on academic excellence and on a scholar system  are\r\n\r\nbecoming an obstacle in our drive towards nurturing more  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  willing  to  take  the path of  entrepreneurship  that\r\n\r\nentails taking risk in more cases.  We need to develop a  reward\r\n\r\nsystem  that  recognises creativity and encourages doing  things\r\n\r\ndifferently.  The streaming in schools, the labels we  place  on\r\n\r\nour  children  and the fear of failing to make it  to  the  best\r\n\r\nschools  and the fear of failing to make it to the best streams,\r\n\r\nall add to this problem of discouraging creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote our Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\r\n\r\nIn  an  interview published in the Straits Times on 3rd February\r\n\r\nthis  year,  he  said  \"many of the entrepreneurs  are  innately\r\n\r\nbright people.  It takes more than paper qualifications to be  a\r\n\r\ngood entrepreneur\".  That is, we need a good combination of both\r\n\r\nstreet smart as well as academic smart people to be successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, tolerance to failure. The way we define and punish\r\n\r\nfailures  has  a  big  impact on creating  an  environment  that\r\n\r\nencourages  entrepreneurship.  We, as  a  society,  have  a  low\r\n\r\nthreshold  to failure.  The way we measure success  is  narrowly\r\n\r\ndefined  along  the  lines of academic excellence  and  material\r\n\r\ngains.  We need to give second chances to people who have  tried\r\n\r\nbut failed.  Sir, failure should be treated as just an event  in\r\n\r\na  long  process, and not to be treated as an end.   Our  people\r\n\r\nmust be able to handle failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a reply to a question on how many times he failed in his\r\n\r\nefforts  to  invent the light bulb, Thomas Edison said,  \"I  was\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  knowing 1,800 ways of how not to  make  a  light\r\n\r\nbulb.\"   Sir, we need to encourage such positive thinking  about\r\n\r\nfailure in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the availability of funds. This is one area where\r\n\r\nSingapore has a long way to go if we are serious about  becoming\r\n\r\nthe  Silicon  Valley  of the east.  In my opinion  and  from  my\r\n\r\nexperience, while we have a number of Government-linked  venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists,  the  decision  makers are  very  conservative  and\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  and  behave  more like  administrators.   What  we\r\n\r\nreally need is a big pool of entrepreneur-led or managed venture\r\n\r\ncapital funds, where decision makers too think in the same  wave\r\n\r\nlength as the entrepreneurs they hope to support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Taiwan, small funds were introduced in the early\r\n\r\n1980s and the government participated, not directly, but through\r\n\r\nequity in technology-oriented private venture capital companies.\r\n\r\nToday,  I  believe there are more than 100 such venture  capital\r\n\r\nfunds  managing a total of about US$2 billion, which means  each\r\n\r\ncompany  manages an average of US$20 million, making  them  very\r\n\r\nnimble and able to move fast and to make decisions fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a well-known fact that in Taiwan, venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists will commit to investments if they see  even  a  30%\r\n\r\nchance  of success for a project, while the feeling is  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, venture capitalists will need to see at least  a  90%\r\n\r\nchance of success before participating.  Furthermore, the saying\r\n\r\ngoes that in Taiwan, there are 100 venture capital funds chasing\r\n\r\nafter  one  project, while in Singapore there are  100  projects\r\n\r\nchasing after one venture capital fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an urgent need to encourage more Taiwan or\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley  type venture capital funds  to  be  set  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Perhaps some Government funds could be used as  seed\r\n\r\nmoney for technology savvy venture capitalists willing to set up\r\n\r\nbase  in  Singapore.  For example, Temasek Holdings could  allow\r\n\r\nsome private sector entrepreneurs to manage a certain proportion\r\n\r\nof its funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the role of the Government. Sir, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nGovernment direct involvement should be as minimal as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npossible;  otherwise,  they  risk crowding  out  private  sector\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  as  our GLCs have done in  the  past   The  most\r\n\r\nimportant  role  the  Government  can  play  is  to  create   an\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  allows  entrepreneurship  to  flourish.   One\r\n\r\nuseful  role  for  the  Government is  to  fine-tune  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations   that   are  obstacles  and   stifle   a   creative\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Rules  like our bankruptcy laws,  initial  public\r\n\r\noffering rules for technological start-ups, restrictions in fund\r\n\r\nraising  for  small  venture capitalists and taxation  of  stock\r\n\r\noptions are examples of rules that need to be revised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do feel that until we can have a vibrant\r\n\r\nenvironment  developed, the Government can play the  role  of  a\r\n\r\nmatch  maker,  especially in the area of making funds  available\r\n\r\nand  in  revising  some  of the incentive schemes  that  require\r\n\r\nupfront  spending before a company can collect  the  incentives.\r\n\r\nWe  also  need a new EDB-type one-stop organisation  to  support\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs who now have to go to multiple agencies for help.\r\n\r\nOnce we have a natural environment, the Government should take a\r\n\r\nstep  back and play a purely supporting role and let the private\r\n\r\nsector flourish on its own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the people responsible for\r\n\r\nadministering the many schemes and in setting policies all  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the  same  mould, because of the hiring and the  promotion\r\n\r\npractices  of  the  Government.   I  suggest  it  is  time   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  considered a system where we  have  a  good  mix  of\r\n\r\nstreet-smart as well as academic-smart people at the helm.  Sir,\r\n\r\nultimately,  the \"dare to dream\" attitude must come from  within\r\n\r\nand it cannot be Government driven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I think we should be focusing on for\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  growth of our economy is a  thriving  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium enterprise sector.  In the past 30 years, we have focused\r\n\r\non  attracting  foreign multi-national companies  to  locate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Our  lower  cost,  our  hardworking  and   educated\r\n\r\nworkforce  and  stable Government were the attractions  for  the\r\n\r\nforeign  multi-national companies.  However, as we have recently\r\n\r\nlearnt, our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncost  is no longer competitive, our neighbours also have a  good\r\n\r\nworkforce.   They  may still lack in good governance,  but  they\r\n\r\nwill  soon  catch up.  Singapore may no longer  be  a  preferred\r\n\r\nchoice for many foreign investments.  And while we should  still\r\n\r\ntry  to bring in such companies, especially in the area of  high\r\n\r\ntechnology, we need to make a significant shift in our  policies\r\n\r\nto  pay  more attention to building a vibrant small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprise  sector  with high emphasis on  technology  intensive\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons I feel why the Taiwan's economy has not\r\n\r\nbeen badly hit by the economic crisis this time round is because\r\n\r\nof  its  heavy dependence on SMEs who are engaged in  technology\r\n\r\nintensive activities.  On the other hand, South Korea was one of\r\n\r\nthe  first to be hit by the crisis and they built their  success\r\n\r\nbased on big conglomerates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the EDB's Industry 21 programme and its recent\r\n\r\nannouncements to co-invest in local companies to help them  grow\r\n\r\nis  indeed a good move.  I do see a shift of focus towards  SMEs\r\n\r\nand  I  hope all of us will develop a positive attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthem  as  being key players needed to bring our economy  to  the\r\n\r\nnext stage of growth.  However, I feel a lot more can be done to\r\n\r\nreach  out  to even a small fraction of the 100,000 or  so  SMEs\r\n\r\npresent in Singapore today.  I hope we, in Singapore, can try to\r\n\r\nemulate what happens in the USA where one new company is started\r\n\r\nevery 3.5 seconds!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by once again emphasising\r\n\r\nthat  while we have done an excellent job in addressing the cost\r\n\r\ncomponent of the equation in the last few budget sessions, it is\r\n\r\nabout time we started preparing for the future by working on the\r\n\r\nother  parts  of  the  equation  that  focus  on  the  long-term\r\n\r\nstrategies of growth.  I will be giving detailed suggestions  on\r\n\r\nhow   we  can  achieve  this  during  the  Committee  of  Supply\r\n\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, capable\r\n\r\nhands  crafted this Budget to meet the exigencies of  the  time.\r\n\r\nThe nation and the market received the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBudget with confidence.  I commend the Minister for an excellent\r\n\r\neffort and extend my strong support for the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative appreciation of the Singapore dollar to the\r\n\r\ncurrencies  of  the  competing economies is  one  among  several\r\n\r\nfactors  that  has  eroded  our national  competitiveness.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment   resisted  the  temptation   of   relying   on   the\r\n\r\ndepreciation  of  the Singapore dollar as  a  means  to  restore\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   Instead, we embarked on  the  more  difficult\r\n\r\noption of cutting costs.  Our people and businesses support this\r\n\r\noption.  Investors too have reacted positively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting workers' pay is key to this option. That we have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to do so, credit must  go to our people, our workers,\r\n\r\nour  unions  and  the Government.  When the Government  realised\r\n\r\nthat  cutting  workers' pay could be necessary,  it  took  great\r\n\r\nefforts  to  prepare the ground for it.   The Government  worked\r\n\r\nhard  to  explain  the issues to the people,  the  labour  union\r\n\r\nleaders  and  the workers.   The union leaders, on understanding\r\n\r\nthe issue, worked hard to help their members to understand them.\r\n\r\nThe people and the workers, on understanding the issues, made  a\r\n\r\nfree and informed choice to sacrifice for the nation.  There was\r\n\r\nthus  a  lot  of  hard work, a lot of learning  and  sharing,  a\r\n\r\nwillingness  to  choose  the better solution  for  the  country.\r\n\r\nHence,  contrary to the mistaken belief, Singapore was  able  to\r\n\r\ncut  workers'  pay not because the Government had  dictated  it.\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  able to cut workers' pay because the  Government\r\n\r\nworked with our people to help them understand that this was the\r\n\r\nbetter way.  And Singaporeans gave their support, even though it\r\n\r\nwas painful.  Thus, let not others belittle the noble sacrifices\r\n\r\nof our people and workers.  This is our competitive strength and\r\n\r\nI am proud of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly happy that the Minister has now agreed\r\n\r\nthat  it  is important, necessary and possible to seek  out  new\r\n\r\nmarkets   overseas.   In  June  last  year,  when  the  Minister\r\n\r\npresented  his  first  off-budget  measures,  I  had  asked  the\r\n\r\nMinister about expanding into new markets overseas and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  was  not  very positive in  his  response.  I  am\r\n\r\ntherefore  glad that the prospects of new markets overseas  have\r\n\r\nimproved in the meantime.  This is timely. During trying  times,\r\n\r\nthere  are  more  incentives  to experiment  and  explore.   Our\r\n\r\ncompanies will be motivated to find new markets for their  goods\r\n\r\nand  services.  I am encouraged at the speed with which  efforts\r\n\r\nhave  been  made  to  tap  into new  markets.   A  comprehensive\r\n\r\nprogramme  has  been put in place and implemented with  generous\r\n\r\nsupport.  The Minister is also right to remind our companies not\r\n\r\nto  forsake our existing markets while we look for new ones.  We\r\n\r\nmust  nurture our existing markets while we foray into new ones,\r\n\r\ndeveloping both together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confidence in overseas markets is also timely to\r\n\r\ncounteract  the  disillusionment felt by our  businessmen  about\r\n\r\nventuring  overseas as a result of an increase in the number  of\r\n\r\noverseas  ventures that have floundered because of  the  crisis.\r\n\r\nBusiness  has its risks. We cannot just withdraw to and  isolate\r\n\r\nourselves  in Singapore.  We must continue to engage the  world,\r\n\r\nfor this is our destiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the spending on our security. The relevance of\r\n\r\nsecurity becomes sharper in times of crisis.  Our past decisions\r\n\r\nto build up our security capability have proven right.  Being  a\r\n\r\nsmall  nation,  we become an easy and convenient  scapegoat  for\r\n\r\nthings that have gone awry elsewhere.  There are others who  may\r\n\r\nwant  to  cow  us, to alter the status quo of our  relationship.\r\n\r\nWith  a strong security capability we can respond with calm  and\r\n\r\ncomposure  to  such provocation.  But national security  is  not\r\n\r\njust  about  money  and infrastructure.  It  is  about  love  of\r\n\r\ncountry,  about a spirit of and willingness to sacrifice,  about\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  defend and to protect what one holds  dear.   We\r\n\r\nmust  therefore be steadfast in our resolve and action  to  show\r\n\r\nthe   world  that  we  are  prepared  to  defend  our   national\r\n\r\nsovereignty  and  protect  our right to  live  as  equals  among\r\n\r\nnations.   Developing  our security capability  is  a  long-term\r\n\r\nprocess,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand we should not slacken just because of a temporary glitch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and harnessing of our human capital is\r\n\r\nimportant.  We cannot afford to miss developing our young,  even\r\n\r\nin a crisis, for to do so is to lose an entire generation, which\r\n\r\nbeing   less   educated  and  skilled  has  impact   on   future\r\n\r\ngenerations.   As  we  move  into the knowledge-based  era,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our human capital becomes even more  important.\r\n\r\nBesides  educating our young, we must also help our  workers  to\r\n\r\nadvance   with  technology  if  we  want  to  avoid   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment, which can become a permanent societal problem.   I\r\n\r\ncommend  the  trade  unions  for  recognising  the  problem  and\r\n\r\nundertaking the difficult task to encourage and help our workers\r\n\r\nto  upgrade,  retool and re-skill.  The Government responded  by\r\n\r\nsetting  up several training initiatives and generously  funding\r\n\r\nthem.  Now  it  is  up to our people and workers  to  seize  the\r\n\r\nopportunities made available.  I realise that it is not easy for\r\n\r\nour older workers to learn new skills and knowledge, but we must\r\n\r\npersevere  to  encourage,  convince and  support  them.   Skills\r\n\r\nobsolescence  can also occur among executives and professionals.\r\n\r\nI  am  therefore  glad  that  the  Minister  also  supports  the\r\n\r\nupgrading of our executives and professionals.  I would in  fact\r\n\r\nask  the Minister to do more to help them to upgrade.  With  the\r\n\r\nlengthening of our working life, there will be much  wastage  of\r\n\r\nour  manpower resources if we fail to upgrade our older workers.\r\n\r\nThis  can  lead  to  other problems, which will  be  costly  for\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lessons that our people, especially our young,\r\n\r\ncan  learn  from the current crisis.  First, we must  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  vicissitudes of the market.  When we rejoice in good times,\r\n\r\nwe  must  not  assume  that it will last forever.   During  good\r\n\r\ntimes,  we  should prepare and set aside something for difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.  The Government has shown that this approach works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our people must understand the growing intensity of\r\n\r\nglobal competition.  In the long term, our competitive edge will\r\n\r\ndepend on our productivity and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  ability to function in a knowledge-based world.  This means\r\n\r\nthat we have to become a better educated and a more creative and\r\n\r\ninnovative  society, and to work even harder.  Let us  not  look\r\n\r\nfor  an  easier  life,  but a balanced and  fulfilling  one.   A\r\n\r\nSingapore that can compete with the world but does not  need  to\r\n\r\nwork  hard is an illusion.  Let us aim for a life where we  need\r\n\r\nto   work  hard,  but  where  there  are  sufficient  time   and\r\n\r\nopportunities for relaxation and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our people must take this opportunity to appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  importance of good government.  There are many reasons  why\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing  better  than many other  economies  during  this\r\n\r\ncrisis, but the most important is good government.  To ensure  a\r\n\r\ngood  future  for  our  children and us,  we  must  demand  good\r\n\r\ngovernment.  There is no better insurance than this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current crisis has also exposed the danger to\r\n\r\norganisations  of straying from their areas of core  competence.\r\n\r\nIt  is  clear  that organisations must consider  more  carefully\r\n\r\nbefore  diversifying from their areas of core competence.   This\r\n\r\nis  most  clearly illustrated by organisations that rushed  into\r\n\r\nproperty developments for quick gains during better times.   Not\r\n\r\nonly  does it sap limited management talents, but the market  is\r\n\r\ncapricious and what seemed like a pot of gold at the end of  the\r\n\r\nrainbow quickly becomes an albatross around the neck when  there\r\n\r\nare  not  enough  management  talents  to  handle  the  changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An organisation must also use its manpower resources,\r\n\r\nespecially its expensive expertise, appropriately.  For example,\r\n\r\nwe  should avoid using professional manpower for administration.\r\n\r\nNot only is this misuse of manpower resources costly, but it can\r\n\r\ndemoralise  administration staff who  find  their  career  paths\r\n\r\nblocked.  This does not mean that there can be no cross-over  of\r\n\r\ntalents,  but such cross-overs must be done through an  explicit\r\n\r\nre-designation  of post and duties.  While the  concern  applies\r\n\r\nalso  to  organisations in the private sector, I  am  addressing\r\n\r\nthis concern in particular to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour Government and statutory board organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the individual and family felt left out in\r\n\r\nthe  two off-budget exercises last year.  The Minister had taken\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to rectify this neglect. The Minister had taken\r\n\r\na  step  further to spread the benefits.  To the better off,  he\r\n\r\nincreased  the  tax  rebates.  To the less  well  off,  he  gave\r\n\r\ngenerous  rebates  and grants on HDB flat  rental,  service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy  charges and public utilities bills,  calibrated  to\r\n\r\ngive  more  benefits  to those who needed them  more.   In  this\r\n\r\ntrying  time, the benefits are most helpful.  The Minister  also\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  this economic crisis has  bitten  deeper  into\r\n\r\nsociety when he extended service and conservancy rebates to  the\r\n\r\n5-room flats.  I thank the Minister for this extension.   I  had\r\n\r\nasked for it last November when this House debated the report of\r\n\r\nthe Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, most people will not see the money given to\r\n\r\nthem.  The transactions will be carried out electronically.   It\r\n\r\nis, however, important that our people know, understand and feel\r\n\r\nfor what the Government has provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget does not fully describe the care and concern\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has for the people.  Government has set  up\r\n\r\nand  generously funded many grassroots organisations such as the\r\n\r\nCDCs,  CCCs, CCMCs, RCs, NCs and NGWOs to reach out to and  care\r\n\r\nfor   the   people.   Last  year,  as  in  years   past,   these\r\n\r\norganisations have done a good job in bonding the community  and\r\n\r\ngiving  help and hope to many people in need.  Many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfrom all walks of life have volunteered their time to serve  and\r\n\r\nsome  have  even  contributed resources.  They  are  the  unsung\r\n\r\nheroes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot and must not take our national unity and cohesion\r\n\r\nfor granted.  We must strive to maintain and strengthen the ties\r\n\r\namong our people, especially during difficult times.  We can see\r\n\r\nin  the  neighbouring  countries how quickly  social  order  and\r\n\r\nstability can unravel and how devastating the effects can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as Singaporeans continue to stand together, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to face the storms and emerge intact  from  them.\r\n\r\nLet me conclude by saying that I share the Minister's confidence\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans will rise to the occasion, and we will emerge\r\n\r\nfrom the crisis stronger and leaner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of worsening economic and political\r\n\r\nconditions  in  the region with Singapore showing  in  1998  its\r\n\r\nfirst  spending shortfall in 10 years and a forecast deficit  of\r\n\r\nS$5.1  billion in 1999, a no-frills Budget containing no radical\r\n\r\nmoves is a prudent and measured approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we have to appraise the Budget within the context\r\n\r\nof having had two other off-Budget measures in June and November\r\n\r\n1998,  which had benefitted the business community in more  ways\r\n\r\nthan one.  This time more individual relief is given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen, I am grateful that we have accumulated funds\r\n\r\nto  fall  back  on to cushion our spending shortfalls.   We  are\r\n\r\nstill  able  to  fork  out large sums of money  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and  employability  of  our  workforce  through\r\n\r\nretraining  programmes and IT in education.   And  now,  we  all\r\n\r\nstand    behind   this   country   to   ensure   its   continued\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and viability, in preparation for  making  that\r\n\r\nquantum leap when the economy recovers in the millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This steadfast, resilient and committed \"Singapore Spirit\",\r\n\r\nSir, is what I would like to highlight and give credit to.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has done a good job, so have the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn the recent parliamentary visit to Hong Kong led by MP Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai  Yuen, I had the opportunity to meet up with some of my  old\r\n\r\nprofessors in Hong Kong University as well as some old  friends.\r\n\r\nOne  common reflection from them was: \"You Singaporeans are `One\r\n\r\nheart in cohesion' (yak tiu sam).  No way can we  push\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough  a  cost  cutting  package in Hong  Kong  the  way  your\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done.  And without violent  protests  from  the\r\n\r\npeople too!  And you are making all the critical investments now\r\n\r\nto  prepare for the future.  It is truly an enviable spirit that\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  should learn to emulate and nurture.\"  I  could  not\r\n\r\nfail  to  note  the  strains of envy, frustration  and  helpless\r\n\r\nanxiety  among  my  Hong  Kong  friends.   I  felt  proud  as  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in my four years stay in Hong Kong in the late\r\n\r\n70s,  the perception of Singaporeans was \"they talk, eat,  walk,\r\n\r\nthink and act far too slowly and too cautiously.\"  I used to  be\r\n\r\nrather  defensive  about these comments but now,  on  hindsight,\r\n\r\nmaybe these attributes which have characterised Singaporean over-prudence and excessive cautiousness have stood us in good  stead\r\n\r\nin  the  past two decades.  They reflect our underlying  anxiety\r\n\r\nabout  survival and a tested conviction that things  can  always\r\n\r\nget  worse  but as long as we steadily chip our way through  the\r\n\r\nodds to make the best of the situation, in measured prudence, we\r\n\r\nwill see the light at the end of the tunnel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have observed similar prudent financial and lifestyle\r\n\r\nmanagement in many Singaporean households today.  Parents,  with\r\n\r\ngrowing children whose needs are never ending, are careful about\r\n\r\nhow  they spend their dollar.  Instead of buying three  sets  of\r\n\r\nnew  clothes for the children for Chinese New Year, they  bought\r\n\r\ntwo sets, maybe only one; and one pair of good shoes to last two\r\n\r\nyears instead of several fashionable ones which last less than a\r\n\r\nyear and in total cost more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some families I know have adjusted their meals to include\r\n\r\nless  meat  -  which is healthy anyway - and have  cut  back  on\r\n\r\neating in restaurants.  Some have sold their flats and moved  to\r\n\r\na  smaller  home  in  order to save the profits  as  contingency\r\n\r\nreserves.   Others have sold their cars and travel only  by  bus\r\n\r\nand  MRT.   In some cases, I have been offered cats and  special\r\n\r\nbreed  dogs,  even  goldfish!   In other  cases,  children  have\r\n\r\nstopped  taking  tuition classes, and foreign  maids  have  been\r\n\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are scaling down their expectations and re-adjusting their lifestyles in order to cut costs at a personal\r\n\r\nand  household level.   They are willing to do this because they\r\n\r\nknow they have in previous years enjoyed the prosperity and  had\r\n\r\nreserves  to  fall back on.  They also know that we  are  not  a\r\n\r\nwelfare  state  and personal financial prudence is  the  key  to\r\n\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if or when the crunch comes and their personal\r\n\r\nreserves become depleted, they will hold the Government  to  the\r\n\r\npromise that no Singaporean will be out on the streets without a\r\n\r\nshelter  and  no Singaporean will be uncared for if  he  or  she\r\n\r\nfalls  sick and is unable to pay the medical bills, and no child\r\n\r\nwill  be forced to leave school because of the inability to  pay\r\n\r\nschool fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this recession persists, and even if we are to\r\n\r\nachieve only stagnant and very slow and low rates of growth  for\r\n\r\nthe  next  few  years,  the number of Singaporeans  who  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered the marginal poor will increase.  They may not be the\r\n\r\ntotally  destitute  and homeless, or denied hospital  care,  but\r\n\r\nmany  heads of households, particularly the older, lower-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers,  may  be unemployed for a long time, and the  household\r\n\r\nmay be in dire need of some financial assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we have a number of assistance schemes already\r\n\r\navailable in different Ministries and at grassroots levels  that\r\n\r\nrespond  to those in need.  Whether the assistance is sufficient\r\n\r\nand how we can better meet the needs of the less fortunate -  as\r\n\r\nwe  make  this difficult transition to a knowledge based economy\r\n\r\nin  the  midst  of a recession - I hope will be a  policy  focus\r\n\r\nfollowing the debate and suggestions proposed by MPs during  the\r\n\r\nlast two days and in the following days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy must adopt a policy perspective beyond\r\n\r\nwelfarism.  Beyond the economic fundamentals, what resources  we\r\n\r\nallocate for strengthening the social service components  within\r\n\r\nour  society to nourish the hearts and souls of Singaporeans are\r\n\r\ncritical  in  securing our cohesion.  Could we in  extraordinary\r\n\r\ntimes adopt more flexible and responsive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolicies  to  meet the needs of families in distress?   Have  we\r\n\r\ndone  enough?  Could we, instead of cynically viewing such moves\r\n\r\nas  falling  prey  to  the  \"lure of  welfarism\",  see  enhanced\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes as strategic investments in reinforcing  the\r\n\r\nsocial contract between our people and Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in concrete terms, could we allow Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  the  older  age groups after 40 to draw upon their  Medisave\r\n\r\naccount  for medical needs such as annual screening tests  which\r\n\r\ndo  not  classify as \"treatment\"?  This is consistent  with  our\r\n\r\ncall  for  a  healthy  lifestyle  through  early  detection   of\r\n\r\ndiseases.   Could  we  allow family members  to  draw  on  their\r\n\r\nMedisave account to pay for their parents' medical bills?  Could\r\n\r\nwe  increase medical and living subsidies for the needy  elderly\r\n\r\nafter  60  according  to  age  categories?   Could  we  consider\r\n\r\nallowing  single mothers with a stable job and children  to  buy\r\n\r\nfirst-hand  two-room HDB flats in designated residential  zones,\r\n\r\nsince  we  allow  single mothers to do so under joint  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme?    This  is  consistent  with  our  policy   of   family\r\n\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just some examples which I hope to\r\n\r\nillustrate my call for the Government to allocate our  resources\r\n\r\nusing  a  multi-tiered  and multi-faceted approach  to  flexibly\r\n\r\nbenefit  needy families, instead of applying one policy for  all\r\n\r\nwhich may err on the side of being over restrictive and rigid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While guarding carefully against irresponsible welfarism,\r\n\r\nwe should also not neglect principles of reasonable distribution\r\n\r\nof social security benefits for the vulnerable.  We need a fresh\r\n\r\nperspective  to  focus the family as a primary unit  for  policy\r\n\r\nformulation.  This perspective may require a critical review  of\r\n\r\ndefining  who are the vulnerable and the potentially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nWe  can  easily  spot  the destitute and the  disabled  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been prompt to assist them.  But we may  need  to\r\n\r\ndefine  the  less obviously needy, what I call the  marginalised\r\n\r\nsegment of our society.  And these are people, I would call, the\r\n\r\ndis-enabled, the dis-advantaged and the dis-empowered.  They are\r\n\r\nlike what MP Sin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoon Ann described yesterday - not poor and not paying tax,  and\r\n\r\nnow unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was heartened by PM's call for \"family care\" during the\r\n\r\nweekend  when  he  opened the 3-in-1 FSC  in  Tampines.   Indeed\r\n\r\nfamily  members  should  do  their  utmost  to  care  for  their\r\n\r\nfamilies,  but  I  also  hope that  the  spirit  of  giving,  as\r\n\r\nexemplified  by  PAP  Members handing  out  $200  \"ang-pows\"  to\r\n\r\nresidents  in Potong Pasir will be adopted as a broad  principle\r\n\r\nof  \"family care\" by the Government.  Sir, there are many women-run  single  parent  families  who are  facing  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  basic  necessities,  like  food,  transport,  rent  and\r\n\r\nutilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases, due to working adults not being able to\r\n\r\nfind or pay for home help, they left their elderly parents alone\r\n\r\nin  their  homes,  all  locked  up because  they  suffered  from\r\n\r\ndementia.  Such unintentional or cannot-be-helped neglect  could\r\n\r\nbe dangerous if the flat caught fire and the elderly was trapped\r\n\r\ninside.   If family members are working, who supplies  the  food\r\n\r\nfor  the  elderly?  Sir, \"family care\" or filial  piety  is  not\r\n\r\nsimply a matter of the heart or culture, it is a function of how\r\n\r\nmuch  children  can shoulder the real burden  of  caring.   When\r\n\r\nthere  is no job, carers have no money to care.  The rich should\r\n\r\nhelp  the  poor, we heard many MPs said today.  But  they,  too,\r\n\r\nfacing  business downturn, feel \"less rich\" to be generous.   It\r\n\r\ntakes  months to organise fund-raising events and needy families\r\n\r\ncannot wait.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not have adequate information on the families.\r\n\r\nI  propose  the  setting  up of a multi-disciplinary  FAMILY  21\r\n\r\nWorking   Committee   to  identify  new   policy   changes   for\r\n\r\nstrengthening the families.  I would also propose that the  CDCs\r\n\r\ncarry  out a comprehensive crisis monitoring survey to find  out\r\n\r\nthe  impact of the crisis on families.  And together, they  will\r\n\r\nexplore what has to be done to ease the misery in the community.\r\n\r\nIf the finding shows that I have exaggerated the misery picture,\r\n\r\nthen it is good news.  If the finding shows that problems are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmounting, then we can plan on what we must do as a community  to\r\n\r\nset things right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, may I add that I am curious why, after so\r\n\r\nmany  calls from this House during last year's debate  for  more\r\n\r\nallocation of funds for MCD, the development expenditure for the\r\n\r\nMCD in 1999 is even less than last year, from 0.38% to 0.34%  of\r\n\r\nthe GDP?  If we compare with the various Ministries, MCD's total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  estimates  for  1999  show  a  decrease  by  10.5%,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the  second lowest after MTI  in  estimated  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  over  1998.   MTI's  decrease  was   due   to   the\r\n\r\nacceleration  of development expenditure in 1998  to  boost  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   In  the  same year, a number of  projects,  like  the\r\n\r\nGirls'  Home and the extension of Kwong Wai Shiu Old  Age  Home,\r\n\r\nhad to be shelved due to shortage of funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During current difficult times one would expect an increase\r\n\r\nin   overall  allocation  for  MCD,  in  particular  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure, due to increasing demand for services to cope  with\r\n\r\nneedy  families and rising social problems.  Not only had  MCD's\r\n\r\nrevised FY98 development expenditure showed 2.9% lower than  the\r\n\r\nactual  FY97  sum,  the  development  expenditure  for  1999  is\r\n\r\nbudgeted  with a further decrease by 15.4%.  Has the development\r\n\r\nbudget  been axed to this low level by the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nor  is it because the Ministry of Community Development did  not\r\n\r\nask for more?  And if MCD did not ask for more, why not?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek clarification, Sir. For whatever reasons, this is\r\n\r\nsending the message that either community development needs  are\r\n\r\nnot  a high priority, or that we have already arrived at such  a\r\n\r\nnear Utopian state that we do not actually need to spend more on\r\n\r\ncommunity  services.   Yet,  we  can  allocate  for  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  318%  more than last year for  MOM,  28%  more  for\r\n\r\neducation - all of which I agree with, incidentally.  Surely the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Community Development has many community projects in\r\n\r\nthe  pipeline  which  should be financed.  I  propose  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister take a longer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nview  and build the institutions that the community will in time\r\n\r\nneed.   I  also  propose that we consider easing  the  financial\r\n\r\nburden of VWOs by increasing Government funding from 50% to  80%\r\n\r\nof  total operating costs so that social workers can concentrate\r\n\r\non delivering quality service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If money is scarce, and we do not think it is prudent to dip\r\n\r\ninto  our  reserves,  then I propose we  seriously  adopt  cost-cutting  measures at the operation level at all  Ministries  and\r\n\r\ndonate the \"savings\" to worthy and needy community causes.  Just\r\n\r\nlike in the private sector, some companies did not send greeting\r\n\r\ncards  for  Christmas and New Year in 1997, 1998  and  1999  and\r\n\r\ninstead donated money to needy community causes.  We should look\r\n\r\nfor  innovative ways of saving money and giving it back  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply wish to reiterate here that while Singaporeans at all\r\n\r\nlevels  are  mustering  their mettle to  uphold  the  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nSpirit\" to help our country ride through these difficult  times,\r\n\r\nthose  in the job of governance must also make sure that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  bend,  distort and stretch this Spirit already malnourished\r\n\r\nwithout extending timely and appropriate help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-term competitiveness, Sir, apart from the focus on the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and service sectors, which we all  support,  must\r\n\r\ninclude the nurturing of this positive Singapore Spirit, through\r\n\r\nconcrete help, not only by persuasion or in words.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to recap. This is a prudent Budget. I applaud\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Spirit among Singaporeans who have adjusted to the\r\n\r\ncrisis   by  scaling  down  their  expectations.   We  need   to\r\n\r\nnevertheless  identify  the potentially  poor,  adopt  a  policy\r\n\r\nperspective  beyond welfarism, by focusing  the  family  as  the\r\n\r\nprimary  unit for policy formulation.  I propose the setting  up\r\n\r\nof  FAMILY 21 and call for more resources for strengthening  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, including the family, and the Singapore Spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded with\r\n\r\nbeyond 4.30 pm and the proceedings thereon be exempted at this\r\n\r\nday's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Dr\r\n\r\nLee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br>3.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir, Mr Chiam See Tong, mentioned yesterday  that  for\r\n\r\nour  economy  to  make the next leap, our people  must  be  more\r\n\r\ncreative  and  more innovative.  Further, he said that  for  our\r\n\r\npeople to be more creative and more innovative, Singapore should\r\n\r\nhave  more  political freedom.  Mr Chiam was right on the  first\r\n\r\npoint  but,  sadly, he was completely awry on the second  point.\r\n\r\nHe was right in saying that for Singaporeans to justify a higher\r\n\r\nincome  than others, we must provide higher value-added.   There\r\n\r\nis  a  limit on the premium other people will pay for our better\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  clean  and  more  efficient  government,   etc.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  the  differentiating factor  is  our  products  and\r\n\r\nservices that people are prepared to pay more for.  But if  that\r\n\r\nis  his  point, then he is not saying anything new.  Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh earlier has also mentioned how to create a more innovative\r\n\r\nand  creative  society.  The whole emphasis on the Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness towards a knowledge-based economy is\r\n\r\nto  inculcate creativity and the inclination to innovate in  our\r\n\r\nyoung  people.   That  is  the reason why  in  this  Budget  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  providing more money for education  despite  the\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable that Mr Chiam was barking up the wrong\r\n\r\ntree by saying that we can only do so by having more freedom.  I\r\n\r\nhope  he  is  not  equating greater chaos in  the  countries  he\r\n\r\nmentioned  with  greater democracy.  Perhaps  he  is  advocating\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  demonstrate and freedom to speak  from  the  street\r\n\r\ncorners as being more democratic.  This, he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbelieves,   will   lead  to  a  more  creative  and   innovative\r\n\r\npopulation.  Unfortunately, there is a fallacy in his  argument.\r\n\r\nThe  greater  freedom he has advocated is meant  for  the  adult\r\n\r\npopulation  whereas  creativity  and  innovativeness   must   be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and  inculcated when the individuals are  still  very\r\n\r\nyoung,  maybe  starting  as  young as  pre-school  kindergarten.\r\n\r\nActually,  we  are talking about two different segments  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.   It is indeed a rare individual who will  transform\r\n\r\nhimself  or  herself  into a more creative  or  more  innovative\r\n\r\nperson  as an adult just by having greater freedom, ie,  freedom\r\n\r\nof any kind, political freedom, personal freedom.  We can verify\r\n\r\nthat  by checking with friends and acquaintances who have  lived\r\n\r\nand  worked  overseas,  for  instance,  in  the  United  States,\r\n\r\npresumably the model country Mr Chiam is referring to.   I  have\r\n\r\nalso  lived and worked in US for a long time.  I do not think  I\r\n\r\nhave  become  more creative and innovative by being  there.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  is  a saying that one cannot teach  old  dogs  new\r\n\r\ntricks.   So  Mr  Chiam would have been right  if  he  advocates\r\n\r\nreviewing  our  school  curriculum  to  promote  creativity  and\r\n\r\ninnovativeness.  But then it would not be as headline  grabbing,\r\n\r\nwould it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam further mentioned that he would like to see a\r\n\r\ncommittee of businessmen and chief executive officers  of  major\r\n\r\ncorporations  to  deliberate the issues faced by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  and  coming up with suggestions without the involvement\r\n\r\nof  a  Minister.   Perhaps, he has overlooked that  the  various\r\n\r\nsubcommittees  of  the Committee on Singapore's  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nare  chaired by captains of industries from the private  sector.\r\n\r\nOnly  the  main  committee was chaired by  two  Ministers.   The\r\n\r\nFeedback Unit had in fact conducted several feedback sessions on\r\n\r\nthe  report  of the CSC.  No one had ever complained  about  the\r\n\r\ninvolvement  of two Ministers.  On the contrary,  they  welcomed\r\n\r\ntheir involvement as an indication of the importance Cabinet has\r\n\r\nattached to the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Feedback Unit convenes similar workshops\r\n\r\ninvolving notable persons from businesses and CEOs annually with\r\n\r\nregard to the Budget Statement.  And these workshop sessions are\r\n\r\ntypically  chaired  by  Members of Parliament  on  the  Feedback\r\n\r\nPanel.   I  believe  the  participants in those  workshops  also\r\n\r\nwelcomed  the involvement of MPs.  They do not see as  \"control\"\r\n\r\nby  the PAP Government but as an assurance that their views will\r\n\r\nget an airing in Parliament as I am doing right now.  This year,\r\n\r\nthe  Feedback Unit brought forward this discussion session ahead\r\n\r\nof  the Budget Statement so that this feedback can be considered\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to give a summary of the\r\n\r\nsession  chaired  by  me on 9th February  this  year.   In  that\r\n\r\nparticular  session,  41 participants from  trade  associations,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Institute  of  Management  corporate  members,  trade\r\n\r\nunions   and  feedback  groups  attended  the  session.   Senior\r\n\r\nGovernment officials from the Ministries of Finance as  well  as\r\n\r\nTrade  and  Industry were also present.  The mood was  generally\r\n\r\nsubdued  as  the Prime Minister had commented earlier  that  the\r\n\r\nBudget is unlikely to contain any more surprises or goodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback, let me summarise. On corporate taxes,\r\n\r\nseveral   participants  requested  the  Government  to  consider\r\n\r\npermitting   group   taxation,  or  what  we  call   inter-group\r\n\r\noffsetting,  a  subject  that Mr Heng Chiang  Meng  has  already\r\n\r\ntouched  on, by allowing the losses of one subsidiary to  offset\r\n\r\nagainst profit in another subsidiary within the same group.   In\r\n\r\nthis  recession, many companies are finding themselves in a very\r\n\r\ndifficult  situation where one subsidiary will be  making  major\r\n\r\nlosses while the other subsidiary will have some profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for property development industry, companies are\r\n\r\nrequired by law to set up a clean sheet single asset company for\r\n\r\neach  project if they were to bid for Government land.  In  this\r\n\r\ncase, the entire group is engaged in the same business but  only\r\n\r\nbecause of the Government requirements, they have to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nform  subsidiary companies.  This is especially glaring in  this\r\n\r\nperiod  when  the  losses of some of those  companies  could  be\r\n\r\nsubstantial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Heng has mentioned, Mr Speaker, Sir, this request has\r\n\r\nmerits.   As  it  stands  today, the  way  we  operate  our  tax\r\n\r\nstructures  is that the companies bear all the risks  while  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not share the burden of business  risks.   The\r\n\r\nbasic principle of group taxation, or inter-group offsetting, is\r\n\r\nbasically  sound.  Companies could have achieved tax savings  by\r\n\r\nnot  setting up subsidiaries in the first place.  However,  they\r\n\r\nare  set  up  for  many reasons, often times for efficiency  and\r\n\r\nfocus  on management attention.  Therefore, the current taxation\r\n\r\nregime penalises this division necessitated by business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the concept is basically sound, the devil is in the\r\n\r\nimplementation.  It is possible that some companies  might  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of inter-group offsetting to avoid paying  their  due\r\n\r\ntaxes.   Nonetheless, I think it would be better to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nissue  head-on  than to avoid it just because of  implementation\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  The basic fact of the matter is that single group\r\n\r\noffsetting is a reasonable idea whose time has come as this will\r\n\r\nreally help companies caught by the regional crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving vent to the concept of inter-group offsetting, it\r\n\r\nis   inevitable   that   the  matter  of   loss-making   foreign\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries   was  brought  up  in  the  discussion.    Several\r\n\r\nparticipants mentioned that it was the Government who encouraged\r\n\r\nSingapore to spread a second wing by going regional in the first\r\n\r\nplace.   Now  that these foreign subsidiaries are losing  money,\r\n\r\nmany  are requesting that the losses in the foreign subsidiaries\r\n\r\nbe  offset  against  profits in the home company  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMany  CEOs  would  like to see the Government as  a  partner  in\r\n\r\nshouldering  business  risks,  as  I  mentioned  earlier.   This\r\n\r\nconcept is already in operation within one single company in the\r\n\r\nsense that losses in one year could be carried forward into  the\r\n\r\nfuture  against future profits.  Inter-group offsetting is  just\r\n\r\ntaking this concept one step further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several businessmen involved in the trading business pointed out\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties they are facing as a result  of  the  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Current tax structure on inventory receivables is based\r\n\r\non  estimates.   This  is  problematic in  these  current  years\r\n\r\nbecause  of the late payment or non-payment of inventory already\r\n\r\ndelivered  to  the customers, especially those in Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  These companies are facing the cash-flow problems  as\r\n\r\na  result of non-payment or late payment.  Yet, they have to pay\r\n\r\ntaxes on estimated profits.  So they are asking the Minister  to\r\n\r\nreview the tax payable to reflect the actual payments received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many CEOs pointed out that because of our tax\r\n\r\non  profit remitted from overseas, many companies or individuals\r\n\r\nhad  parked  their profits derived from previous  years  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Now that they are running into cash-flow and  credit\r\n\r\ncrunch  problems  in the current crisis, one participant  called\r\n\r\nfor  a  tax  moratorium  for several  years  to  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nrepatriation of these profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone present in the workshop lauded the emphasis on the\r\n\r\ntraining of workers.  However, they pointed out that there is  a\r\n\r\nlack  of incentives for the training of executives and managers.\r\n\r\nThe  contributions  of these people to the economy  is  no  less\r\n\r\nimportant.   The participants seem to support a form of  payroll\r\n\r\ntaxes  for all employees rather than the current SDF which  only\r\n\r\ntakes care of the lower income workers.  On the other hand, most\r\n\r\nof  the participants would like to defer any action on this idea\r\n\r\nuntil the economy has recovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants also welcomed the reduction of property taxes but\r\n\r\ncommented   that  property  tax  assessment  by  the  Department\r\n\r\nconcerned  is  fast on the upswing but sticky on the  downswing.\r\n\r\nSo  they  would  like the relevant authority to  be  faster  and\r\n\r\nquicker in responding to the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several participants pointed out that to provide and promote\r\n\r\npromising enterprises, perhaps the Government could provide  tax\r\n\r\nbreak for smaller companies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  allow them to grow into bigger ones.  Some of them mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  UK  has  such  a law and we could follow  that  particular\r\n\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On taxes on individuals, the 2% gap between corporate and\r\n\r\nindividual  tax ceilings attracted quite a number  of  comments.\r\n\r\nThe question is when would the Government remove this gap as  we\r\n\r\nhave  learned  in  the  past  that  individuals  would  tend  to\r\n\r\ncorporatise themselves to take advantage of lower corporate  tax\r\n\r\nrate.   The other ever green topic is that tax relief  for  non-working spouse should be raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out that the tax relief for insurance premiums\r\n\r\nwas insufficient.  Most taxpayers are unable to claim tax relief\r\n\r\nfor  their insurance premiums as their CPF savings had  exceeded\r\n\r\nthe maximum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One participant pointed out the total sum of estate duties\r\n\r\nraised  in the last fiscal year is relatively small.  He  called\r\n\r\nfor its total abolition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum income beyond which CPF contribution would be\r\n\r\nmade  was  set  some 30 years ago.  To encourage more  part-time\r\n\r\nworkers  to  join the workforce, it was felt that  these  income\r\n\r\nceilings should be revised upwards.  Personally, I do not  agree\r\n\r\nwith  this  request  because  of  our  ageing  population.    If\r\n\r\nanything, my own sentiment is that all incomes should be subject\r\n\r\nto CPF regardless of its amount.  Perhaps, the ceilings were set\r\n\r\nmany years ago to reduce the hassle of implementation in the age\r\n\r\nwhen the use of IT and computers was not as widespread.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several participants pointed out that our current practice\r\n\r\nof  paying  taxes of last year's income in the current  year  is\r\n\r\ncreating some difficulties. Especially in the current recession,\r\n\r\nsome  individuals have actually in the current year dramatically\r\n\r\nlower  income,  some have even lost their job.  Therefore,  many\r\n\r\nfind  it  a burden to pay income tax.  To avoid similar problems\r\n\r\nin  the future, perhaps we should move towards a withholding tax\r\n\r\nsystem like many developed countries.  And we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nphase-in  this  particular structure over time to  minimise  the\r\n\r\nburden on the tax payable by people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One participant highlighted the problem of what they call\r\n\r\nhigh  net  worth bankrupts.  At first glance, it sounds  like  a\r\n\r\ncontradiction of terms.  It turns out that these are individuals\r\n\r\nwho  have  used their CPF savings to buy a high price  property.\r\n\r\nAs  a result of the recession, because of their loss of jobs  or\r\n\r\nincome,  they were forced to sell their properties  as  they  no\r\n\r\nlonger could service their mortgage loans.  As we all know,  CPF\r\n\r\nhas  the  first claim on the proceeds for such sales.  For  some\r\n\r\nindividuals, the balance left behind was so small that the banks\r\n\r\nhave  no choice but to sue them for bankruptcy.  So as a result,\r\n\r\nthese are bankrupts.  But they have a lot of money in their  CPF\r\n\r\naccount.   So  the new term is called high net worth  bankrupts.\r\n\r\nThe  participant asked for relaxation of the return of CPF funds\r\n\r\nto  prevent  unnecessary bankruptcies.  While  I  am  personally\r\n\r\nsympathetic with these high net worth bankrupts, my own  opinion\r\n\r\nis that any relaxation of the CPF rules at this point of time is\r\n\r\nunwise.   Individuals should have known the rules ahead of  time\r\n\r\nand be prudent in their use of CPF funds in their investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of bankrupts, it was felt that the restriction\r\n\r\non  bankrupts from holding any directorship for five years seems\r\n\r\nto  be  too  harsh and reflects our society being intolerant  of\r\n\r\nfailure, which I think Mr Inderjit Singh has also touched on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government assistance for small and medium sized businesses\r\n\r\ndrew quite a few comments, and much of these I would bring up in\r\n\r\nthe debate in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few have suggested that TDB promote more missions overseas to\r\n\r\nexplore  new  markets.  I am glad to note that the Minister  has\r\n\r\nalready disclosed in his Budget Statement that TDB would do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes my summary of the Feedback Session on the Budget\r\n\r\nfor  FY99.   I must compliment the participants for  being  very\r\n\r\nreasonable and realistic in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  proposals.   Everyone accepted that we should  allow  the\r\n\r\ncost  cutting measures implemented from 1st January 1999 to work\r\n\r\nthrough the system before the Government evaluates again whether\r\n\r\nmore stimulations are necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to move on to my own comments\r\n\r\non  the Budget Statement for FY99.  As the last but one speaker,\r\n\r\nmuch  of what I would want to raise has already been brought  up\r\n\r\nby  the  30-plus  speakers ahead of me.   So  I  find  it  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  bring up new ideas.  Therefore, I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  completely different tack and focus on the use of  past\r\n\r\nreserves,  this  being  the  first  budget  deficit  after   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Elections Act was passed  in  this  House.   I  am\r\n\r\nparticularly interested in the interplay between the role of the\r\n\r\nPresident and the use of reserves as enacted in the Presidential\r\n\r\nElections Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter Fernandez of the Straits Times in his article \"Spotlight\r\n\r\non  the  $5 Billion Deficit\" touched on a very pertinent  topic,\r\n\r\nnamely, the provisions of the Elected President and the  use  of\r\n\r\nreserves accumulated in the current term of Government.   I  was\r\n\r\ninterviewed by Walter and basically gave him an outline of  what\r\n\r\nI would be covering in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since this Parliament was returned in January\r\n\r\n1997,  there are only three fiscal years so far, FY97, FY98  and\r\n\r\nFY99.   Only  in  FY97,  there was a surplus  of  $5.2  billion.\r\n\r\nDeficit in FY98 was $0.466 billion.  FY99 is projected to have a\r\n\r\ndeficit of $5.05 billion.  So just looking at the total  sum  of\r\n\r\nbudget surplus and deficit, the Government has already exhausted\r\n\r\nthe  surpluses  accumulated in the current term  of  Government.\r\n\r\nNote   that  I  use  the  word  \"surpluses\"  and  not  the  word\r\n\r\n\"reserves\".  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan, earlier in her speech,  has  also\r\n\r\ntouched on this particular topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reasonable question to ask is whether the Government could\r\n\r\nhave  been more aggressive in stimulating the economy if it  has\r\n\r\naccumulated  greater  surplus.   The  budget  deficit  of  $5.05\r\n\r\nbillion  is the largest in memory but only in dollar terms.   In\r\n\r\nterms of percentage of GDP, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n3.5%.   On the other hand, the last budget deficit of a  similar\r\n\r\nmagnitude occurred in FY86 when the budget deficit at that point\r\n\r\nwas  $2.5 billion.  However, in terms of percentage of  GDP,  it\r\n\r\nwas  6.3%.   Moreover, it was also followed by another  year  of\r\n\r\nbudget deficit in FY87 of $1.16 billion or 2.6% of GDP.  So,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  percentage of GDP, the budget deficit in  FY86  would\r\n\r\nhave  a  greater impact on the economy than the deficit that  we\r\n\r\nare  seeing in FY99.  As Mr Inderjit Singh has said earlier,  we\r\n\r\nshould  take bold steps.  The question I would like to  ask  is:\r\n\r\nare we being bold enough in this particular Budget?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all remember the recession of 1985 and 1986 and those\r\n\r\nwere  indeed difficult years.  The Government's budgets were  in\r\n\r\ndeficit  for  two consecutive years.  Yet, was the recession  of\r\n\r\n1985/1986  more severe than the current one?  Probably  not,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have mentioned  on\r\n\r\nseveral  occasions that the recession in 1998 and  1999  is  the\r\n\r\nworst since Singapore became independent.  If we think that this\r\n\r\nis the worst recession ever, why are we only having a deficit of\r\n\r\n3.5%?   So  the  relative impact of our current deficit  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  I think, is only 56% of what took place in FY86.   Let\r\n\r\nus  assume that the Government wants to inject the same level of\r\n\r\nstimulants in the economy as in FY86, 6.3% would work out to  be\r\n\r\nabout $9 billion.  Whether the economy needs or could take  such\r\n\r\na  stimulus, I do not know.  But at least we know if we were  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  same  rate  of  recovery  as  in  1985/1986,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  have  done  more.   Would  we  need  to  make\r\n\r\nprovision for another year of budget deficit?  Would we be short\r\n\r\nof  reserves accumulated in the current term of government if we\r\n\r\nwere  needed to do so?  When asked by the reporters on 5th March\r\n\r\n1999  regarding the issue of past reserves, Prime  Minister  Goh\r\n\r\nChok   Tong   mentioned  that  the  Government  has  accumulated\r\n\r\nsufficient reserves since January 1997 to finance a deficit  for\r\n\r\nanother two years, if it is necessary to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, besides the budget deficit, the definition of\r\n\r\nreserves  must have included other income sources for which  the\r\n\r\ntwo major ones are investment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome  and  land sales.  Investment income was $3.8 billion  in\r\n\r\n1997, and $4.3 billion in 1998.  Land sales were $14 billion  in\r\n\r\n1997  and $5.9 billion in 1998.  If these figures are considered\r\n\r\nreserves accumulated in the current term of government, then  it\r\n\r\nis  absolutely true that there is a lot of money in  the  kitty.\r\n\r\nEven  if  these are considered part of reserves, it  still  begs\r\n\r\nother  questions  in  my  mind.  Should  not  investment  income\r\n\r\nderived from past reserves accumulated in the previous terms  of\r\n\r\ngovernment be considered part of the past reserves of  the  past\r\n\r\ngovernment  but  not  the  reserve of  the  current  government?\r\n\r\nPhilosophically, I think part, if not all, of such income should\r\n\r\nbe considered as reserves for the past government.  My reasoning\r\n\r\nis as follows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good fund manager could provide better yield but even a\r\n\r\nmediocre  fund manager would yield a return not less than  fixed\r\n\r\ndeposit.   Therefore, the measure of how good a fund manager  is\r\n\r\nonly  the incremental improvement in yield rather than the total\r\n\r\nyield  of  the investment.  Similarly, maybe only  part  of  the\r\n\r\ninvestment income from past reserves should be credited to  good\r\n\r\ngovernance  of the current Government and not the total  sum  of\r\n\r\nthe investment.  Before I get all tangled up in this theoretical\r\n\r\ndiscourse, perhaps the Minister could give the House a  definite\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the same rationale, I think, applies to land\r\n\r\nsales.  Could the proceeds from land sales be considered part of\r\n\r\nthe  reserves for the current government or is it  part  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  government?  If it is considered so, then I have  also\r\n\r\ntwo issues.  State land is an inheritance held by Government in-trust  for  all future generations of Singaporeans.  Other  than\r\n\r\nreclaimed  land  which is created, all lands are an  inheritance\r\n\r\nassociated with the sovereignty of the Government at the time of\r\n\r\nindependence.   Land has inherent value and  its  value  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  the current term of government can  be  assessed.\r\n\r\nLand sale to me is a process to realise the value of land or its\r\n\r\nlease in cash.  It would seem\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreasonable to assume that the proceeds of a sale should  not  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  part of the reserve accumulated by the current  term\r\n\r\nof government.  In my mind, one should not credit the entire sum\r\n\r\nof  land sale to the current Government as such.  Again, if land\r\n\r\nfetches  better prices because of good government, perhaps  only\r\n\r\nthe  enhancement of its value as a result of the performance  of\r\n\r\nthe  current  government  can be considered  accruable  to  good\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if these two sources of income - investment income\r\n\r\nand land sales - were considered part of reserves accumulated by\r\n\r\nthe   current  term  of  government,  then  one  would  question\r\n\r\nseriously   the   effectiveness  of  the   provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Elections  Act  to  protect  past  reserves.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the  day  could always make  use  of  these  two\r\n\r\ninstruments - sales of land and investment income - to raise the\r\n\r\nnecessary  funds to meet this budget deficit without ever  going\r\n\r\nback to the President to exercise the second key.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the definition of reserves, it would seem that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy is a wonder machine.   Why  do  I  say  so?\r\n\r\nBecause in the current term of government, we have only one good\r\n\r\nyear  in  1997, two lean years in 1998 and 1999.  Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  said  that we could handle two more lean years.   So  taken\r\n\r\ntogether,  the reserves generated in one year could handle  four\r\n\r\nlean  years  without  ever going back  to  unlock  the  reserves\r\n\r\naccumulated  by the past terms of government.  This  reminds  me\r\n\r\ntoo  of  a passage in Genesis relating to how Joseph interpreted\r\n\r\nPharaoh's  troubled dreams of seven fat cows devoured  by  seven\r\n\r\nlean  ones and seven stalks of healthy corns devoured  by  seven\r\n\r\nswivelled  ones.   Joseph  interpreted  it  as  seven  years  of\r\n\r\nabundance  followed  by seven years of famine  and  advised  the\r\n\r\nPharaoh  to make the appropriate preparations, a task which  the\r\n\r\nPharaoh  had  entrusted to Joseph.  Mr Sin Boon Ann has  already\r\n\r\nalluded  to this particular passage yesterday.  In the  case  of\r\n\r\nEgypt,  it took one good year to prepare for one lean year.   In\r\n\r\nthe case of Singapore, one good year\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  have saved enough for four lean years.  I think  this  is\r\n\r\nvery impressive indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one should not compare any mortal with the\r\n\r\nbiblical  Joseph.   But  one cannot deny  the  strength  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy  after 33 years of  stewardship  by  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment.   If we look over the past decade during  which  the\r\n\r\npresent  Cabinet  was in charge, there were  indeed  seven  good\r\n\r\nyears  where  the  budget  surplus exceeded  3.5%  of  the  GDP.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we are very well-prepared for many lean years if it ever\r\n\r\ncomes  to pass.  Singaporeans should be thankful that we have  a\r\n\r\nCabinet worthy of Joseph.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, at a time when our country is facing an economic crisis, we\r\n\r\nare  fortunate  because we have leaders who  have  the  calibre,\r\n\r\nability and honesty in discharging their duties.  If it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause of them, our country, which has no natural resources and\r\n\r\nalso  limited land area and having a population of less  than  3\r\n\r\nmillion,  will be turned into chaos by demonstrations comprising\r\n\r\nunsatisfied citizens against the Government which they feel  has\r\n\r\nnot  discharged its duties correctly, especially at a time  when\r\n\r\nwe  have almost 28,000 retrenched workers and a large portion of\r\n\r\nthem  are  still unemployed.  But our Government has  not  faced\r\n\r\nthis situation because our leaders have set up wise measures  to\r\n\r\novercome this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other reason is that our leaders are calm and not panicky.\r\n\r\nThey  have  always  emphasised on understanding,  tolerance  and\r\n\r\nharmonious  living among us.  As citizens, we should  also  play\r\n\r\nour  part in upholding the spirit of harmony.  We should  always\r\n\r\ncooperate  with  one another and respect one another.   Economic\r\n\r\nstability  also  depends  on such a  harmonious  situation.   We\r\n\r\nshould  be wary when we listen and read the speeches of  leaders\r\n\r\nof  our  neighbours.   We should not react on  the  explicit  or\r\n\r\nimplicit  intention  in  their  speeches,  especially  when  our\r\n\r\nworkers are facing retrenchment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement for the year 1999 by the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, generally, is accepted by the community, because  they\r\n\r\nare conscious that the Budget Statement is based on an uncertain\r\n\r\neconomic  background.  As Members of Parliament, we are thankful\r\n\r\nfor  the generosity of the Minister for Finance to grant rebates\r\n\r\nto the flat dwellers, and this is most encouraging.  I hope this\r\n\r\nwill  be treated as a privilege and not regarded as a matter  of\r\n\r\nright, because if these rebates were to be granted every year in\r\n\r\nthis bad economic situation, it is a question which will not  be\r\n\r\ndifficult for the Minister for Finance to decide.  But when  the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation is unstable, it will be  difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  make  a decision.  I believe the  grant  of  these\r\n\r\nrebates  has been fully considered.  Despite that, I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister will be able to consider my appeal.  It all depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether  we  could meet the expenditure for this financial  year\r\n\r\ndespite the deficit of more than $5 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% tax rebate for the Year of Assessment 1998 should\r\n\r\nremain.   It  will be able to assist the expenses of  taxpayers.\r\n\r\nBut  if  we  take into account the unemployment situation  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  28,300 retrenched workers, I believe  some  of  them\r\n\r\nwould  still  have  to pay their income tax,  and  it  would  be\r\n\r\nonerous  on  them.  Therefore, I hope the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwill consider increasing the income tax rebate for 1998 from  5%\r\n\r\nto 10%.  If it cannot be granted to all the taxpayers, it should\r\n\r\nbe  granted to taxpayers who are unemployed or who have remained\r\n\r\nunemployed till today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement for 1999 is good and has been\r\n\r\nexpected.  But once again this year, I will ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  consider the financial problems of those  taxpayers\r\n\r\nwho  are taking care of their parents-in-law.  This is the third\r\n\r\ntime  that I have raised this issue.  And I would also urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider giving rebates for full-time housewives who\r\n\r\nare without income.  I believe it is the duty of the children to\r\n\r\nlook after their parents, even though they are not their natural\r\n\r\nparents.  The duty to take care of their parents-in-law is  also\r\n\r\nburdensome,  especially in terms of the household  expenses.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the number in this category is small and  it  will\r\n\r\nnot affect the expenditure of 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moderate expenditure of 1999 is a surprise. Because in\r\n\r\na  situation where we promote savings and spending according  to\r\n\r\nour  ability, the water tariffs have suddenly gone up.  I  think\r\n\r\nin an uncertain economic situation, it is not proper to increase\r\n\r\nwater  tariffs.   Therefore, I hope, and  for  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a whole, water tariffs should not be increased  at\r\n\r\nthis  time,  but  it  could  probably be  implemented  when  the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation is stable or when salary increase and  bonus\r\n\r\nare reinstated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was given to understand that 6,000 motorcyclists were fined\r\n\r\nfor offences in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconnection   with   entering   the   Restricted   Zone,   either\r\n\r\nintentionally  or otherwise, in the last five months.   For  the\r\n\r\nwhole year, this number may increase by two or three times.   It\r\n\r\nalso involves other vehicles like cars and lorries.  The payment\r\n\r\nfor  entering this zone is aimed at reducing congestion.   I  am\r\n\r\nthankful to LTA for granting a road tax rebate.  But it would be\r\n\r\nbetter  if  the  road tax be further reduced so  that  motorists\r\n\r\nwould  be  relieved  of  the  expenses  and  use  it  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  school expenses and household expenses.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  will  say  that  Singaporeans  are  always   not\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  When given a piece, they always want a bigger share.\r\n\r\nBut this is the reality of life for Singaporeans.  In fact, this\r\n\r\nis  the  time for us to ask the Minister for Finance to consider\r\n\r\nwhatever problems that they face, especially relating to  money.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  saying,  if  you  are fortunate,  it  will  float,\r\n\r\notherwise it will sink.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, for the first time, there is a budget\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  $5 billion for the estimates of 1999-2000  and  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  have been taken have not yet shown  any  result.\r\n\r\nWhat  happens if the economy does not recover or becomes  worse?\r\n\r\nIs  the  Minister  for Finance ready to face such  a  situation?\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Prime Minister has said that fellow  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  not be worried, because we are able to use the  reserves\r\n\r\nof 1997 to face this economic recession, I hope the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance will look for other means to use the reserves so that we\r\n\r\nneed not be worried when we face a worse situation if it were to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this year's Budget is the second deficit budget since  the\r\n\r\nindependence of Singapore, and  we are in a situation where  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries are facing political and social  upheaval\r\n\r\nand their stability is in trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country, like a small boat in a sea of\r\n\r\ntowering  waves.  We need a very capable helmsman  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nboat  under  control.   We  also need  the  cooperation  of  all\r\n\r\npassengers on board\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  boat to balance it properly.  In this way, we will be  able\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that this small boat will sail through the  towering\r\n\r\nwaves  to  reach  our  destination eventually.  So  we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared for all eventualities and face any unforeseen worsening\r\n\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 is a challenging year. At this very critical moment, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  able  to give a 10% across-the-board  rebate  on\r\n\r\npersonal  and  corporate  income tax and  also  rebates  on  HDB\r\n\r\nrentals, utilities and S&C charges to lighten the burden of  our\r\n\r\npeople.   For the business people, there is also a whole  series\r\n\r\nof  assistance schemes to help them, in addition  to  the  $10.5\r\n\r\nbillion  cost-cutting package announced in November  last  year.\r\n\r\nThis  year's budget is one  in which the Government  is  sharing\r\n\r\nthe  people's  hardship.  This budget has the support of all the\r\n\r\nordinary folks as well as the business community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the budget itself, I would like to make the following\r\n\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We must have more tax rebates for donations to charity and\r\n\r\nsocial  community  services.    I  support  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say's\r\n\r\nproposal that the Government should give more incentives  during\r\n\r\nthese  bad  times.  When we feel that money is  not  enough,  we\r\n\r\nshould  make it possible for more enthusiastic charitable people\r\n\r\nto  donate more money to charitable and community organisations.\r\n\r\nI  believe and suggest that the Government would be able to give\r\n\r\nthem double tax deduction for their donations, just like what we\r\n\r\nhave done for the foreign maid levy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should revalue the commercial and residential\r\n\r\nproperties more readily so as to keep  in line with their market\r\n\r\nvalue.  The Government is granting a 55% property tax rebate.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a good policy.  But some commercial properties  were\r\n\r\nbought  in the year 1995/96, when the property value was at  its\r\n\r\npeak.    Now that the property market value has dropped by about\r\n\r\n30% to 40%,  I hope the Property Tax Department will take a more\r\n\r\nrealistic approach to revalue these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperties, particularly commercial properties, to reflect their\r\n\r\npresent market value  and give them the proper tax rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On GST, I also support Mr Lew Syn Pau's proposal that\r\n\r\nGST  should be reduced from 3% to 2% for a period of two  years.\r\n\r\nAt  present,  businesses with  annual business turnover  of  not\r\n\r\nmore  than  $1 million are exempted from GST.  I feel  that  the\r\n\r\nceiling  should  be raised to $2 million.  This  will  help  the\r\n\r\nsmall and medium  enterprises and the neighbourhood shops in HDB\r\n\r\nestates as well as the residents there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Liberalise the rules on subletting of land and factory\r\n\r\npremises.  Last year, I successfully proposed to the Minister to\r\n\r\nliberalise  the subletting of  JTC and HDB factories and  shops.\r\n\r\nFactories  are  now allowed to sublet 50% of  their  space   and\r\n\r\nthose  companies  which  are linked to the  parent  company  are\r\n\r\nallowed to sublet up to 75% of the factory space.  However, this\r\n\r\nrule  applies only to factories which are in occupation of  more\r\n\r\nthan  5  years.   In other words, only those who  have  been  in\r\n\r\noccupation  of  the property for not less than  five  years  can\r\n\r\nenjoy this kind of preferential treatment.  I think JTC and  HDB\r\n\r\nshould  repeal the 5-year limit to allow those who bought  their\r\n\r\nfactories at the peak prices in 1995/96 to sublet part of  their\r\n\r\npremises so as to collect some rent to help them tide over these\r\n\r\ndifficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Financing for SMEs. Many small and medium enterprises\r\n\r\nmanaged to   obtain bank loans in 1995 and 1996 through the help\r\n\r\nof EDB at low interest rates.  This is a good policy.  Many SMEs\r\n\r\nhave  benefited  from this.  However,  because  of  the  1997/98\r\n\r\neconomic  recession,  the business of these  SMEs   is  severely\r\n\r\naffected.   At  the  same  time, these  companies  have  to  pay\r\n\r\ninterest  to the bank at rates higher than before.  During  this\r\n\r\ncritical period, can the Government consider setting up a   two-year bridging loan at preferential rates to help these companies\r\n\r\ntide over these difficult times?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me deal with the expenditure on education. This\r\n\r\nyear,  the  Ministry of Education's budget is 3.2%  higher  than\r\n\r\nlast year's.  The idea is to train and educate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore people so that they can serve society and contribute to the\r\n\r\ncountry.   This is a long-term investment on our human resources\r\n\r\nso as to prepare Singaporeans to face the challenges of the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   I  believe all Singaporeans will support  the  bigger\r\n\r\nbudget for the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few issues I would like to raise on Education. One,\r\n\r\nwe   must  ensure  that  there  are  sufficient  places  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversities  for  our own local students.  I  strongly  believe\r\n\r\nthat  every Singapore citizen should be given at least 10  years\r\n\r\nof  education in primary and secondary schools. Those with  good\r\n\r\nresults  may  go  to  junior  colleges,  polytechnics  and  even\r\n\r\nuniversities.  At the moment, we have two universities - NUS and\r\n\r\nNTU.   Every year, we are able to provide for 9,000 places, with\r\n\r\n10%  reserved  for foreign students, ie, about  900  places  for\r\n\r\nforeign  students.   According  to  the  newspaper  report  this\r\n\r\nmorning,  the Ministry of Education intends to raise the  number\r\n\r\nof  places  reserved for foreign students to 20%  of  the  total\r\n\r\nenrolment  each  year. I would like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nthis extra 10% of places for foreign students will come from the\r\n\r\nexisting  9,000 places or is the Ministry of Education going  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more  places  in the universities for  foreign  students\r\n\r\nwithout  reducing the places for our local students,  since  our\r\n\r\nthird university will only start to enroll students in the  year\r\n\r\n2004.   There  are still five years to go before  2004.   During\r\n\r\nthese  five  years, if we take away another 10% from  the  9,000\r\n\r\nplaces  for  foreign  students, that means our  local  students'\r\n\r\nopportunities will be correspondingly reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, graduates from the polytechnics have to work for two\r\n\r\nyears  to  earn  some credits to qualify for  admission  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.   I  think  this is a good  idea.   But  polytechnic\r\n\r\nstudents who graduated in 1997/98, when we were facing a  severe\r\n\r\neconomic crisis, are experiencing great difficulties in  finding\r\n\r\njobs  because many factories and companies are retrenching their\r\n\r\nworkers.   In  these  circumstances, many polytechnic  graduates\r\n\r\ncannot get jobs, thereby jeopardising their chances of admission\r\n\r\nto the NTU.  Those who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  afford can go overseas to get their degrees, but those  who\r\n\r\nare  not  so well to do will lose the opportunity to  enter  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.  In view of the economic crisis, this policy  should\r\n\r\nbe adjusted accordingly so as to ensure our students will not be\r\n\r\ndeprived of the opportunity to enter the university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to deal with the problem of brain drain.\r\n\r\nEvery  year,  we have only 9,000 places in the universities  for\r\n\r\nour  students.  Many parents are telling me that their  children\r\n\r\ncannot gain admission to the local universities and have  to  go\r\n\r\noverseas.  To  be able to go overseas for further studies  is  a\r\n\r\ngood thing.  SM Lee has also said that when students go overseas\r\n\r\nfor  study,  they can mingle with students of foreign  countries\r\n\r\nand  establish  rapport with them. After their graduation,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to strengthen relations with other countries  and\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the development of our nation.  I have  not  been\r\n\r\nable to get the statistics from the Ministry of Education on how\r\n\r\nmany  Singapore students have to go overseas each  year  because\r\n\r\nthey  are unable to get places in our local universities. I  was\r\n\r\ntold  that  the Ministry did not have the relevant  data.   This\r\n\r\ngives  me cause for concern.  It is important that we keep track\r\n\r\nof  the  number  of  students who have  to  go  to  universities\r\n\r\noverseas  because  there  is no place  for  them  in  our  local\r\n\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry of Education set up a\r\n\r\nspecial  department to assist our students in finding places  in\r\n\r\nforeign  universities and to maintain contact with  them.   This\r\n\r\nway, we will be able to know when they have graduated from these\r\n\r\nuniversities, and find some way to make them come back, so  that\r\n\r\nour  good  talents  will  not be lost.  Our  students  who  went\r\n\r\noverseas and do not come back after graduation are a loss to our\r\n\r\nsociety.   We  have invested at least 10 years of  education  on\r\n\r\nthem.   I would ask the Minister how much money we have invested\r\n\r\non  each  student  for the 10-year period from  primary  one  to\r\n\r\nsecondary four.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Budget this year is not particularly\r\n\r\nspectacular, it is not a bad\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbudget  either.   If  the Government and  the  people  can  work\r\n\r\ntogether to overcome our difficulties, we will be able  to  tide\r\n\r\nover the difficult times. We hope that at the end of the tunnel,\r\n\r\nwe can see some light.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support this Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Suspension of Standing Orders)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I  seek your consent and the general  assent  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  present to move that the proceedings on the item  under\r\n\r\ndiscussion be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No.\r\n\r\n45,  so as to remove the time limit and enable the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance to adequately reply to all the points raised by Members?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I give my consent.

So I will focus on  major  issues\r\n\r\nand  leave  matters of details to the Committee of Supply  where\r\n\r\ncuts on these subjects have been raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the release of the FY99 Budget, many have commented\r\n\r\nthat  it  is prudent, and geared towards the long-term  good  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, some felt that the FY99 Budget is  cautious\r\n\r\nand contained few new measures to stimulate the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the FY99 Budget should be seen in the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  the  total response Government has made  since  the\r\n\r\nstart  of  this crisis.  When the economic outlook  deteriorated\r\n\r\nafter  the FY98 Budget last February, we did not wait until  the\r\n\r\nFY99  Budget to introduce the $2 billion off-Budget  package  in\r\n\r\nJune,  and the subsequent $10.5 billion cost-cutting package  in\r\n\r\nNovember  1998.   The  Government  has  responded  promptly  and\r\n\r\nappropriately as the situation develops.  As I have said  in  my\r\n\r\nBudget   Statement  earlier,  we  should  let  the  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  work  through the system first.  The Budget  therefore\r\n\r\ndid  not  contain  any new major cost-cutting initiatives.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  be  monitoring  the  economy   and   external\r\n\r\ndevelopments very closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with this House Government's thinking behind\r\n\r\nthe   formulation  of  the  FY99  Budget.   The  Government  has\r\n\r\nconsistently  adhered to the wisdom of a prudent fiscal  policy.\r\n\r\nWe  live within our means, accumulating surpluses in good  years\r\n\r\nof  strong economic growth and drawing down on our reserves only\r\n\r\nin  years  of  economic downturn.  Government has been  able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain budget surpluses in normal years, not by overtaxing the\r\n\r\npeople and businesses, but by spending judiciously and fostering\r\n\r\neconomic growth.  On hindsight, it is plain that Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen correct in resisting the temptation to simply spend what we\r\n\r\nhave when economic growth was buoyant.  The accumulated reserves\r\n\r\nnow give us a valuable buffer against the present downturn.  The\r\n\r\npolicy  of spending what we need, and always with an eye to  the\r\n\r\nfuture, is a fundamental pillar for Singapore's economic health,\r\n\r\nsocial stability and long-term security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY98, Government is expected to run a deficit of $466\r\n\r\nmillion.   After  taking  into account the  impact  of  the  tax\r\n\r\nbenefits and rebates announced in my FY99 Budget Statement,  the\r\n\r\nforecasted budget deficit for FY99 is $5.4 billion.  FY 2000 may\r\n\r\nstill  be  in deficit, given the carry-over effect of the  cost-cutting  measures,  and  the time lag in  the  increase  in  tax\r\n\r\ncollection when the economy does turn around.  Even  so,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to bear in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmind  what  the  FY99  budget  deficit  will  be  incurred  for.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  Government has carefully prioritised its  spending  by\r\n\r\nfocusing  on developing long-term capabilities, with substantial\r\n\r\nincreases   in  spending  on  social  and  community   services,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  education.  Secondly,  FY99  Budget  introduces\r\n\r\nfurther  tax  incentives to help Singapore seize the  window  of\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  further  develop certain  economic  activities.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Budget offers relief to individuals and households,\r\n\r\nboth in tax rebates and household rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government wants to help our people tide over the\r\n\r\ncurrent  difficulties as best as possible, partly by alleviating\r\n\r\ncosts  with  rebates, but even more so by miminising job  losses\r\n\r\nthrough  helping  companies survive and prepare  themselves  for\r\n\r\nfuture  competition.  We must understand that Government  cannot\r\n\r\nfully  offset  the  impact of this recession,  which  is  caused\r\n\r\nlargely  by the fall in external demand.  Adjustment is painful,\r\n\r\nbut unavoidable.  We must adapt to changing circumstances.  This\r\n\r\nmay  mean  that  many of us will need to tighten  our  belts  or\r\n\r\nretrain  for  a  new  job, or that some companies  may  have  to\r\n\r\nrestructure or even close down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present recession has forced us to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  what the essentials are for building our future.   It\r\n\r\nhas  exposed  the areas which need improvement, and  accelerated\r\n\r\nthe pace of economic restructuring which we will need to undergo\r\n\r\nin  any event to remain competitive in the long term.  If we act\r\n\r\nwisely,  we  will emerge fitter than our competitors  after  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis has also made us less complacent as a people, and to\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  significance  of  the  fundamentals,  like  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  skills,  maintaining  competitive  costs,  having\r\n\r\nstrong  reserves,  and most important of all, preserving  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.   This crisis is not merely a test of the Government's\r\n\r\nskills,  but  also a test of the resilience of  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nnation and a people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must not just aim to survive the economic crisis. We\r\n\r\nmust emerge from the crisis fitter for the race ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  have  elaborated  in  my  Budget Statement  our  five-pronged\r\n\r\nstrategy,  which is, cutting business costs, ensuring access  to\r\n\r\nworking  capital,  market diversification, investment  promotion\r\n\r\nand  capabilities building.  This Budget, as well as the earlier\r\n\r\noff-Budget   and   cost-cutting   packages,   manifests    these\r\n\r\nstrategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to the specific concerns raised by Members of\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to thank Mr Lim Swee Say for his timely\r\n\r\nreminder that what the Government has done in the 34 years since\r\n\r\nindependence  has  been focused not only  on  creating  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth for its people, but more importantly, on the creation  of\r\n\r\na  nation  from the disparate parts with which it started.   The\r\n\r\nlatter  is  an imperative which is often forgotten by  observers\r\n\r\nwhen   they   compare  Singapore's  circumstances   with   other\r\n\r\ncountries.   I  believe that the Singapore of today,  a  unified\r\n\r\nnation,  with  its  strong  institutions,  is  perhaps  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment's greatest achievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim has also pointed out that in moving into the next\r\n\r\ncentury, it is important that all sectors of the nation, public,\r\n\r\nprivate  and  individuals,  must  be  prepared  to  change   its\r\n\r\ncollective  mindsets, not to work in compartments, but  to  work\r\n\r\ncollaboratively with a common purpose.  I do not disagree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim also urges the public sector to be cost conscious, and\r\n\r\nwork  on  a  new mindset of promoting knowledge-based  companies\r\n\r\nthrough  an incentive package.  The latter point I will take  up\r\n\r\nin the Committee of Supply.  As for the public sector being cost\r\n\r\nconscious, we have various systems currently to ensure  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  prudent  public  sector that is  effective,  efficient,\r\n\r\nresponsive  and enterprising.  Thus, we have the  Budgeting  For\r\n\r\nResults  framework  to promote cost- consciousness  and  result-orientation,  and  the  Public  Service  for  the  21st  Century\r\n\r\ninitiative to promote continuous improvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a specific example, keeping costs low in the construction of\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuildings,  like schools and hospitals, has always  been  a  key\r\n\r\nconsideration.  We have in place a system of building norms as a\r\n\r\nmeasure  to  control  costs.  We also  pay  attention  to  other\r\n\r\nfactors  such  as upgradability, and the need to  maximise  land\r\n\r\nuse.   I  agree  that  our Government buildings  should  not  be\r\n\r\nostentatious,  but neither should we go back to  building  plain\r\n\r\nold boxes.  Where the architectural finishes will cost virtually\r\n\r\nthe same, whether the architecture style is modern or dowdy,  we\r\n\r\nshould go for the modern style.  In any case, the finishing of a\r\n\r\nbuilding  only  forms a small part of the total cost,  the  most\r\n\r\npart   being   structural,  mechanical  and  electrical   works.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, we are undertaking an exercise  to  review\r\n\r\nbuilding norms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr Chiam See Tong does not often agree with the\r\n\r\nGovernment, this time he is correct in his assessment  that  the\r\n\r\npresent   recession  is  due  primarily  to  external   factors.\r\n\r\nHowever,  he strays when he claims that Taiwan has coped  better\r\n\r\nwith  the  economic crisis because the country has  become  more\r\n\r\ndemocratic.  He also says that the Singapore Government has been\r\n\r\ntoo   paternalistic   and  this  has  stifled   private   sector\r\n\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these statements, he has taken a grossly simplistic\r\n\r\nview   that   more   democracy  always  means  better   economic\r\n\r\nperformance,   hence,  the  Taiwan  economy   has   outperformed\r\n\r\nSingapore.   A  quick look around the world should convince  him\r\n\r\nthat some of the world's most democratic countries are mired  in\r\n\r\neconomic problems.  He himself has recognised that the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomic  performance  has been dragged  down  by  the  external\r\n\r\nfactors  outside our control.  Our exports of goods and services\r\n\r\nhave  been  severely depressed by the economic collapse  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours,  whereas Taiwan's economy has been less affected  as\r\n\r\nits  export  markets are largely to the US  and  China.   Taiwan\r\n\r\nitself  has  not  entirely  escaped  from  the  effects  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial turmoil in the region.  To pump-prime its economy,  it\r\n\r\nhas   introduced  a  NT$194  billion,  or  about  S$10   billion\r\n\r\nequivalent, stimulus package in August 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's claim that the Government stifles private sector\r\n\r\ninitiative  is also contradicted by the International  Institute\r\n\r\nfor  Management  Development.  In its 1998 World Competitiveness\r\n\r\nYearbook,  it  rated  Singapore  top  in  three  areas:   first,\r\n\r\nGovernment economic policies, second, our political system being\r\n\r\nwell  adapted  to  today's  economic challenge  and  third,  the\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  not hindering business development.  I should  also\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  CSC (Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness)\r\n\r\nand  its  various subcommittees were private sector  driven  and\r\n\r\nmany   of  its  recommendations  have  been  accepted   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also confess that I was grossly disappointed by Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia Khiang's approach in criticising the FY99 Budget.  His\r\n\r\nviews  are myopic.  He claims that there is no need for a budget\r\n\r\ndeficit.   Since  development expenditure accounts  for  48%  of\r\n\r\ntotal  expenditure for FY99, excluding development  expenditures\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Budget  balance would automatically create  a  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus.   He  has further said that the Government  could  have\r\n\r\ncapped  its  development spending at FY97 levels to avoid  going\r\n\r\ninto  a deficit.  However, if we do as Mr Low suggested, we will\r\n\r\nlose out in the race to develop our human resources and build up\r\n\r\nour infrastructure to enhance our long-term competitiveness.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  Mr Speaker, Sir, not many governments can afford to spend\r\n\r\nmore  in  the midst of a recession.  Even if they do, the  focus\r\n\r\nwill  tend  to  be more on relief measures or measures  to  pump\r\n\r\nprime  the  economy,  rather than in the  long-term  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   The fact that we are able to spend  50%  more  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure in FY99 than in FY97 clearly shows  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has the resources, the will and the confidence to  not\r\n\r\nonly  overcome the current crisis, but to prepare for the  post-crisis future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also said that the PAP should apologise to the\r\n\r\npeople  for the current economic slowdown.  I find this  request\r\n\r\nvery  strange,  since  even Mr Chiam  has  recognised  that  the\r\n\r\neconomic downturn was brought about by external factors  outside\r\n\r\nthe Government's control.  Astute foreign observers of the Asian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  scene have noted how Singapore has stood  out  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also claimed that the special monthly S&C\r\n\r\nrebates ranging from $2 to $6 are piddling and of not much  help\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans.  His analysis is deliberately misleading.   If\r\n\r\nhe  had  added up all the various S&C rebates and grants in  the\r\n\r\nBudget, he would find that households in, for example, 1- and 2-room flats would enjoy annual savings in S&C charges of $170 and\r\n\r\n$200  respectively.  This means that they need only pay  between\r\n\r\n1/4  and  1/3 of their annual S&C bills respectively.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is passing back some $490 million  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nindividuals  and  households in the  form  of  tax  and  special\r\n\r\nhousehold rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also refute Mr Low's point that the increase in water\r\n\r\ntariffs  shows  that the Government does not want  to  help  the\r\n\r\npeople.   Water  is a strategic and precious  resource.   It  is\r\n\r\nprecisely because the Government has in mind the future good  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that the increase in water tariffs has  to  proceed\r\n\r\nas scheduled.  However, the Government is mindful of the need to\r\n\r\noffset  the  increase for lower income households.  A  total  of\r\n\r\n$114  million will be passed back to 1- to 4-room HDB households\r\n\r\nwhich will more than offset the water rate increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hougang has also questioned the need for the\r\n\r\nProgrammes  Central Vote in MOF.  This provision is  to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's capacity in the current economic climate to meet\r\n\r\nhigh  priority and urgent spending needs if and when they arise,\r\n\r\nand  cater for new operating expenditures arising in the  course\r\n\r\nof  the  year.  The central vote is no blank cheque - it  has  a\r\n\r\nfixed  ceiling.   This  request for  some  treasury  flexibility\r\n\r\namounts  to  a minuscule 0.4% of total expenditure  or  0.8%  of\r\n\r\noperating expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam has criticised the disproportionate Budget\r\n\r\nallocation  for defence.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we are living  in  an\r\n\r\nuncertain world.  A strong defence capability is the cornerstone\r\n\r\nfor the development and well-being of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWithout an adequate defence, it is not possible to continue  our\r\n\r\nway  of  life.   It is also not sufficient, as suggested  by  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam,  to  rely  on  defence cooperation  and  support  of\r\n\r\ninternational  organisations.  Ultimately, we have  to  rely  on\r\n\r\nourselves.  We need to be prepared for all circumstances and for\r\n\r\nthe  worst.  Therefore, to allocate funds for the defence budget\r\n\r\nonly  when we face a clear and impending threat to our security,\r\n\r\nas suggested by Mr Jeyaretnam, is foolhardy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has asked if the budget deficit could have been\r\n\r\nbigger  without  the  provisions  on  the  protection  of   past\r\n\r\nreserves,  and  whether  we would need  to  draw  down  on  past\r\n\r\nreserves  in  FY2000.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy  in  this crisis has not been constrained by the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident's safeguards.  The size of the cost reduction packages\r\n\r\nhas  depended only on what the Government judged was  necessary,\r\n\r\ngiven  the state of the economy and the prospects in the region.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has  accumulated substantial  reserves  in  its\r\n\r\ncurrent term of office.  It therefore does not expect the fiscal\r\n\r\ndeficits  in 1998, 1999 or 2000 to exhaust its current reserves,\r\n\r\nand make it necessary to draw upon old reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong Teng Cheong has told Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong\r\n\r\nthat  if  the Government needs to draw on past reserves to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  current  crisis, he would support  it.   Mr  Goh  has\r\n\r\nthanked  the  President, but told him that the Government  would\r\n\r\ntry its best not to draw on past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution protects the reserves that were not accumulated\r\n\r\nduring  the  Government's current term of office.  The  reserves\r\n\r\nthat are accumulated during the Government's term of office, and\r\n\r\ntherefore  are  not  subject  to  the  Presidential  safeguards,\r\n\r\ninclude  the  budget surplus, as well as net  investment  income\r\n\r\n(NII).   Net  Investment Income is defined as  the  Government's\r\n\r\nannual  earnings from its stock of reserves.  These are  current\r\n\r\nearnings accruing from interest and dividends alone.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexclude capital gains arising from the sales of bonds and equity\r\n\r\nholdings from past reserves.  NII is below-the-line item in  our\r\n\r\nannual  budget.  As for proceeds from the sales of State  lands,\r\n\r\nthese  have  always accrued fully to past reserves  even  though\r\n\r\nthese  proceeds  are  treated  as  operating  revenue  in   some\r\n\r\ncountries such as Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government took office on 25th January 1997.\r\n\r\nBetween  25th  January 1997 and 31st March 1998, the  Government\r\n\r\ngenerated an operating budget surplus of $6,273 million.   After\r\n\r\ntaking into account expected deficits in FY98 and FY99, we  will\r\n\r\nstill  have accumulated surplus of $368 million as at 31st March\r\n\r\nin  year  2000.  If we were to add in the NII since 25th January\r\n\r\n1997, the Government's current reserves would comfortably exceed\r\n\r\nthis figure.  This is because our investments have done well  in\r\n\r\nrecent years.  Hence, I do not see any immediate need to draw on\r\n\r\npast   reserves  that  will  require  the  Elected   President's\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chay Wai Chuen's and Mr Seng Han Thong's concern on the\r\n\r\nfiltering  down of the cost cutting effects on prices,  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  measures will flow directly to the companies and consumers,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the CPF cut, reduction in foreign workers levy,  rental\r\n\r\nreductions,   transport   and   electricity   tariff    rebates,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications tariff reduction and GST  offsets.   For  the\r\n\r\nproperty  tax rebate, public sector landlords, such as statutory\r\n\r\nboards,  will pass on the rebates fully.  Government also  urges\r\n\r\nlandlords  in  the  private sector to pass on  the  rebates.   A\r\n\r\nrandom survey of landlords conducted last year revealed that the\r\n\r\nmajority  of landlords are passing on at least half  the  rebate\r\n\r\nsavings  to  their  tenants.  With the keen competition  in  the\r\n\r\nslowing   market,  rentals  and  consumer  prices   have   eased\r\n\r\nconsiderably in recent months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Ong Ah Heng have asked how the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will keep track of the economy and the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  the  cost cutting package.  Being a small and open  economy,\r\n\r\nSingapore's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  growth is heavily influenced by external developments.\r\n\r\nEven  in  good  times, the Government is constantly  interacting\r\n\r\nwith businesses to obtain feedback and refine our policies.  MTI\r\n\r\nuses  a  combination of hard and soft information in  monitoring\r\n\r\nthe  economy.   Hard  information includes  data  on  trade  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  production, while soft information includes  surveys\r\n\r\nof  business  expectations and regular  meetings  with  industry\r\n\r\nplayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we try to be as accurate as possible in our forecast,\r\n\r\nGovernment  recognises that we are in a period of discontinuity.\r\n\r\nNon-economic  factors  such as the confidence  of  international\r\n\r\ninvestors  are  critical in a state of  uncertainty.   For  this\r\n\r\nreason,   we   have  adopted  scenario  planning  to  complement\r\n\r\nconventional  economic forecasting.  Last  month,  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee  had  outlined three economic scenarios  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould have to be prepared for.  The world does not run according\r\n\r\nto  our  wishes:  we must make our future by planning ahead  and\r\n\r\nbeing  able to respond in good time to develop any opportunities\r\n\r\nthat come up even in the midst of crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin spoke on the need to\r\n\r\nhelp  SMEs.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir, we  know  that  SMEs  are  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable   in   economic  downturns.   The  Productivity   and\r\n\r\nStandards  Board  (PSB) has just issued a press  statement  last\r\n\r\nweek  which detailed how PSB has helped SMEs on five  fronts  in\r\n\r\n1998  -  access  to finance, information and IT, technology  and\r\n\r\ninnovation, markets, and human resource development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are already more than 60 programmes to\r\n\r\nhelp  local  enterprises in various stages of development,  with\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Enterprise  Finance  Scheme  (LEFS)  and  the  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise  Technical  Assistance  Scheme  (LETAS)  as  the  two\r\n\r\nflagship  programmes.  The Government recognises  that  the  top\r\n\r\nconcern  of  SMEs now is short-term cash-flow.  Thus,  LEFS  has\r\n\r\nbeen expanded to $2 billion in June 1998 and enhanced further in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1998 to cover more SMEs.  From April 1998 to  January\r\n\r\nthis year, about 1,320 loans were approved under LEFS,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\namounting  to $533 million, which is 32% higher than the  amount\r\n\r\napproved  from April 1997 to January 1998.  Where  feasible  and\r\n\r\npractical,  the  Government will consider enhancing  the  scheme\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help SMEs reduce operating costs and build up capabilities,\r\n\r\nLETAS  is  very flexible and can be used for any aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  upgrading  for qualifying SMEs.  From  April  1998  to\r\n\r\nJanuary  1999,  about  800 SMEs were assisted  under  LETAS,  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to 643 companies from April 1997 to January 1998.   To\r\n\r\nhelp SMEs upgrade the skills of their workers, SDF is positioned\r\n\r\nto  place  greater emphasis on skills such as those required  in\r\n\r\nelectronic-commerce  while continuing to support  training  that\r\n\r\ncaters  to  current  needs.  As at January 1999,  about  230,000\r\n\r\nplaces have been approved to support SME training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua spoke on the need for local businesses to\r\n\r\nseize  opportunities in the region, while Mr Ong Kian Min  urged\r\n\r\nthat  we develop our local MNCs.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Promising\r\n\r\nLocal Enterprises (PLE) programme, launched in 1995, targets  to\r\n\r\nproduce  a  pool of 100 PLEs with a turnover of  at  least  $100\r\n\r\nmillion each by the year 2005.  Today, there are about 300 PLEs.\r\n\r\nMost  PLEs were able to weather the regional crisis in  1998  as\r\n\r\nthey served the  OECD markets.  Just last week, to help PLEs  in\r\n\r\nboth the manufacturing and hub services sectors, to be trim  and\r\n\r\nfit  for  the race ahead when the economy recovers, EDB launched\r\n\r\nthe   3Cs   programme   -   Co-investment,   Collaboration   and\r\n\r\nConsolidation.  Under this programme, a $100 million  fund  will\r\n\r\nbe  set aside for EDB to take short-term equity stakes of up  to\r\n\r\n30% in PLEs to support their growth for an appropriate period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has touched on the issue of the credit\r\n\r\nsqueeze  arising from the current crisis.  Total credit extended\r\n\r\nby  commercial  banks moderated significantly through  1998,  in\r\n\r\nline  with  the  slowdown in the economy  and  a  more  cautious\r\n\r\nlending  policy  by banks given the increased risk  environment.\r\n\r\nOur  banks  are accountable to their depositors and shareholders\r\n\r\nto act on sound commercial decisions, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  and  should  not  put  pressure  on   banks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Association of Banks in Singapore has  advised\r\n\r\nits  members  not to take a short-term view of the viability  of\r\n\r\ntheir  clients' businesses, nor to pull back on loans  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing regularly serviced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng, Mr Ong Kian Min and Dr Wang Kai Yuen\r\n\r\nhave  raised queries on group offsetting and taxation of foreign\r\n\r\nincome.   As this is a complex subject, I would reply  to  their\r\n\r\nqueries in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng has also asked whether we have inadvertently\r\n\r\nmoved towards taxing capital gains, by taxing the recipients  of\r\n\r\ndividends distributed out of capital gains.  Whether  or  not  a\r\n\r\nreceipt is taxable depends on the nature of the receipt  to  the\r\n\r\nrecipient.  If the receipt is income, it is taxable.  If  it  is\r\n\r\ncapital  gains, it is not.  To the shareholders,  dividends  are\r\n\r\nreturns  on  their investment and thus constitute income.   This\r\n\r\napplies  irrespective of whether the dividends  are  distributed\r\n\r\nout  of the company's operating profits or capital gains.   This\r\n\r\ntax  principle  of  dividends  being  income  in  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nshareholders  and  thus  taxable has been  confirmed  by  Courts\r\n\r\nincluding  those in the UK and Australia.  Our tax treatment  of\r\n\r\ndividends  does  not contradict our system of no  capital  gains\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau has asked when we will cut the corporate\r\n\r\nincome  tax rate to a long-term level.  The Government has  just\r\n\r\ngiven  a  10% corporate tax rebate for Year of Assessment  1999.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore too early to consider reducing  the  corporate\r\n\r\nincome tax rate at this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng may wish to note that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  continually reviews our tax system, together with  IRAS\r\n\r\nand  economic  agencies such as EDB, TDB, NCB and  the  MAS,  to\r\n\r\nalign  tax rules with changing business environment.  The  views\r\n\r\nof  the  private sector have also been sought, such  as  through\r\n\r\ncommittees  like the CSC and the Financial Sector Review  Group.\r\n\r\nIRAS and the Ministry of Finance also have regular meetings with\r\n\r\ntax  practitioners  such as the Institute  of  Certified  Public\r\n\r\nAccountants of Singapore (ICPAS).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua have\r\n\r\nspoken   on   the   need   to   promote   entrepreneurship   and\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship  by  creating a conducive  environment  via  a\r\n\r\nreview   of  regulatory  framework,  the  establishment   of   a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  funding provider and promotion of  venture  capital\r\n\r\nfunds.  Mr Sinnakaruppan also spoke on how the tax treatment  of\r\n\r\nstock  options  could help companies attract  talents.   I  will\r\n\r\naddress these issues in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the many Members who have made\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on these various matters.  Some, like  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh,  have  expressed disappointment with the Budget  for  not\r\n\r\ndoing  enough  to  encourage entrepreneurship.   Time  does  not\r\n\r\npermit me to address the many suggestions that have been raised.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Members  of  this  House  should  be  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21 (T21) Ministerial Committee, chaired by the\r\n\r\nDeputy   Prime  Minister,  Dr  Tony  Tan,  has  been   set   up,\r\n\r\ncomplemented by a private sector subcommittee led by Mr Sim Wong\r\n\r\nHoo,  the CEO of Creative Technology.  They will be touching  on\r\n\r\nareas  mentioned by Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr Lee, Mrs  Lim  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan.  The recommendations of the T21 Committee will be\r\n\r\nannounced this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, such as Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Lim Swee Say,\r\n\r\nMr  Sin Boon Ann and Mr Ahmad Magad, have spoken on the need  to\r\n\r\nbuild up the software and step up workers' training such as  via\r\n\r\nmanpower development schemes, and a \"Skillsave\" CPF account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already an array of initiatives in\r\n\r\nplace   to  promote  lifelong  learning  and  skills  upgrading,\r\n\r\nincluding among the older and lower skilled workers.  Retraining\r\n\r\nis  critical,  especially  among the less  skilled  workers,  to\r\n\r\nminimise the adverse impact on people from the transition  to  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  Let me elaborate on these initiatives.\r\n\r\nFor  FY99,  the budget allocation for the promotion of  manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is $150 million versus $58 million  in  FY97.   The\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nProgramme  which aims to retrain the unskilled and  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nmid-career workers has been expanded by $120 million,  of  which\r\n\r\n$20  million  has been committed to set up a Skills  Development\r\n\r\nCentre.   For  the Skills Redevelopment Programme, SDF  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  defray up to 80% and 70% of the course  fee  support\r\n\r\nand  the absentee payroll respectively.  For manpower in leading\r\n\r\nedge  technologies, we have the $800 million Initiatives in  New\r\n\r\nTechnology (INTECH) grant scheme, of which $50 million has  been\r\n\r\nset  aside for EDB's new Training and Attachment Programme.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  also given a grant of $9 million  to  the  NTUC\r\n\r\nEducation  and  Training  Fund  to  support  training  by  union\r\n\r\nmembers.   Companies can enjoy tax deduction for their  workers'\r\n\r\ntraining  expenses.  Government agencies also work with  private\r\n\r\ntraining  institutions to develop training  programmes  for  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.    In   recognition   that   the   individuals   will\r\n\r\nincreasingly have to be responsible for their own employability,\r\n\r\nthe  tax  deduction for qualifying educational expenses incurred\r\n\r\nby individuals has been raised to $2,500 in the FY99 Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 (M21) Committee is studying what more needs to\r\n\r\nbe  done to support in-employment training and lifelong learning\r\n\r\nby  individuals.  The use of the \"Skillsave\" CPF Account is  one\r\n\r\noption, but we have to ensure that the use of CPF funds will not\r\n\r\ndeplete  members' CPF savings.  The M21 study will be  finalised\r\n\r\nby the middle of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Dr Teo Ho Pin have spoken on\r\n\r\npromoting  IT awareness and use.  I want to assure both  Members\r\n\r\nthat  NCB  aims  to create an IT culture where people  from  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life  are comfortable with using computers  at  home,\r\n\r\nschool,  work  and  at  play.  First, NCB is  already  promoting\r\n\r\nawareness  of  the benefits of IT through computer roadshows  at\r\n\r\nshopping malls, libraries and schools.  Second, IT training  and\r\n\r\nupgrading is accelerated and Government is reaching out to  more\r\n\r\nthan 300,000 workers, including mature workers,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough the SDF IT Power training programmes.  Also, the use  of\r\n\r\nInternet  and Singapore-ONE services is being stepped  up.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, the mobile IT Coach has already reached out to  16,000\r\n\r\nfactory workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also suggested that the Government should upgrade\r\n\r\nNCB  to  be  an  IT Power Ministry which will act as  a  central\r\n\r\nministry  responsible for overall IT planning  for  the  nation.\r\n\r\nThere  is  considerable merit in her proposal.  Such a  Ministry\r\n\r\ncan bring together the functions of the NCB, TAS and SBA.  IT is\r\n\r\nnot  only a major new basis of economic activity, but it is also\r\n\r\na key capability for making Singapore a fully developed country.\r\n\r\nIT will change the way we live, how we study, work and enjoy our\r\n\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IT, telecommunications and broadcasting sectors are not only\r\n\r\ngrowing   rapidly,  but  are  also  quickly   converging.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   actively  studying  how  to   streamline   and\r\n\r\nconsolidate   the   agencies  concerned  with   regulating   and\r\n\r\ndeveloping   these  related  sectors.   Besides  the   principal\r\n\r\nagencies  such  as  TAS, NCB and SBA, other  agencies  are  also\r\n\r\ninvolved.  For example, EDB promotes IT investments just  as  it\r\n\r\npromotes investments in manufacturing and other high value-added\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some rationalisation is necessary, but we need to decide exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  will  go into the combined entity, and which  Ministry  it\r\n\r\nshould  come under.  There are also a few grey areas  that  need\r\n\r\nfurther  study.   We hope to make a decision  on  these  matters\r\n\r\nwithin a month or two.  Creating a new ministry to supervise  IT\r\n\r\nand  telecommunications is a longer-term possibility, but to  do\r\n\r\nso in the near future would be premature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen has suggested that GLCs should not be\r\n\r\ncompeting  aggressively in the local market to  give  our  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  more breathing space.  Whether or not  a  GLC  should\r\n\r\ncompete  with businesses in the local market or venture overseas\r\n\r\nis  a  commercial decision which the GLC and not the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  make.  Also, many of our GLCs are publicly  listed,  and\r\n\r\nare accountable to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir   shareholders  for  their  corporate   decisions.    More\r\n\r\nfundamentally, with the increasingly global business competition\r\n\r\ntoday  and  Singapore's relative free and open  economy,  it  is\r\n\r\nwishful  thinking that we can give our local companies breathing\r\n\r\nspace  simply  by removing GLCs from the playing field,  as  new\r\n\r\ncompetitors will always be there.  Where Government can help  in\r\n\r\na  meaningful  way, as has also been suggested  by  Mr  Zulkifli\r\n\r\nBaharudin, is to facilitate our companies, whether GLCs, SMEs or\r\n\r\nPLEs,   to  compete  successfully  overseas,  for  example,   by\r\n\r\nencouraging our local companies to form clusters or  to  tie  up\r\n\r\nwith  GLCs under a Singapore Inc approach to maximise collective\r\n\r\nleverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau and Dr Wang Kai Yuen have talked about\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax grouping for property developers.   For  property\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  which are required to be set  up  because  of  the\r\n\r\nprudential requirements in Government land tenders, they will be\r\n\r\nwound  up  after the specific project for the tendered  site  is\r\n\r\ncompleted.   Unlike other companies, these property subsidiaries\r\n\r\nare  therefore  unable  to carry forward  their  losses  on  the\r\n\r\nproject.   Mr  Lew  may wish to know that  REDAS  and  IRAS  are\r\n\r\nalready  in  discussion on how to resolve  this  tax  constraint\r\n\r\narising  from  the  prudential requirement  of  Government  land\r\n\r\nsales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Kenneth Chen have asked whether more\r\n\r\ncould be done to assist retrenched workers and families, such as\r\n\r\nallowing  them to use their CPF savings or setting up  a  safety\r\n\r\nnet.   There have been many calls on the use of CPF savings such\r\n\r\nas  for  training  and living expenses.  However,  we  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that  CPF savings, are meant primarily for members'  old\r\n\r\nage, basic housing and for medical needs.  To help alleviate the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  these  workers face to pay their  mortgage  loans,\r\n\r\nGovernment has already allowed them to use their Special Account\r\n\r\nsavings from February 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to assist retrenched workers is to help them seek\r\n\r\nre-employment as quickly as possible.  Even before the  regional\r\n\r\neconomic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndownturn, the Ministry of Manpower had taken steps to expand its\r\n\r\nEmployment   Services  Department  (ESD)  to   help   unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  or  Permanent Residents.  When  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nworkers  were  retrenched in 1998, MOM not only  allocated  more\r\n\r\nresources  to  ESD but also introduced several new  initiatives,\r\n\r\nsuch as strengthening the partnership with NTUC, SNEF, CDCs, and\r\n\r\nself-help organisations, to extend the reach of the Government's\r\n\r\njob  assistance  services.  On Mr Simon Tay's  concern  for  the\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers  and their families in  financial  hardship,\r\n\r\nthere  are a number of assistance programmes which such  workers\r\n\r\ncan  tap  on.  These include the community assistance  programme\r\n\r\nadministered  by MCD, the CDCs, the National Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nServices, self-help groups and VWOs.  MOE also helps to pay  the\r\n\r\neducational  expenses  of the families'  school-going  children.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Health's Medifund scheme helps to ensure that no\r\n\r\none will be denied of basic health care just because they cannot\r\n\r\nafford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo and Mr Lim Swee Say have suggested more tax\r\n\r\nreliefs for those supporting their parents-in-law and dependants\r\n\r\nsuch  as jobless spouses.  The aged parents' relief, which  also\r\n\r\napplies to parents-in-law, and the wife and child relief can  be\r\n\r\nclaimed  by  those  who  are  supporting  these  two  groups  of\r\n\r\ndependants.  We have only recently raised these two reliefs with\r\n\r\neffect  from  Year  of Assessment 1998.  For the  aged  parents'\r\n\r\nrelief,  if  the  taxpayer lives with his  parent  in  the  same\r\n\r\nhousehold,  he  can enjoy an additional $1,000, on  top  of  the\r\n\r\nnormal $3,500 relief.  As for the wife and child relief, it  has\r\n\r\nbeen raised from $1,500 to $2,000.  I would like to stress again\r\n\r\nthat tax reliefs are not meant to fully defray the cost incurred\r\n\r\nfor the maintenance of dependants, but rather serve as a form of\r\n\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Lew Syn Pau's and Dr Wang Kai Yuen's\r\n\r\nquery,  I would like to say that there is no need to reduce  the\r\n\r\ntop marginal personal income tax rate from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n28% to 26%, in line with the corporate tax rate.  Our individual\r\n\r\nincome  tax rates and brackets have been reduced over the years.\r\n\r\nThe  last  change  was effected in the Year of Assessment  1997.\r\n\r\nOur  individual income tax burden is amongst the lowest  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   For  the 35% of the population who pay personal  income\r\n\r\ntax,  the effective tax rate is in fact considerably lower  than\r\n\r\n28%,  because 28% is only the marginal top rate, and  there  are\r\n\r\nvarious reliefs and rebates which reduce the effective tax rate.\r\n\r\nGovernment is mindful of the impact on our people and  has  thus\r\n\r\ngiven a 10% tax rebate on personal income tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Wang Kai Yuen's suggestion for the abolition of\r\n\r\nestate  duty, I should point out that estate duty  still  has  a\r\n\r\nrole  in  helping  to  moderate the distribution  of  wealth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  despite  the relatively small  collection  which  is\r\n\r\nmainly due to our generous exemption limits.  Countries such  as\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, the United States and UK also have estate duties  or\r\n\r\ninheritance taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has asked whether workers will have to go\r\n\r\nthrough  another round of CPF and wage cuts.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nGovernment  is fully aware and appreciates the workers'  anxiety\r\n\r\nover  further  cost-cutting measures if the  recession  worsens.\r\n\r\nGovernment hopes that such a move is not necessary.  We and  the\r\n\r\nNWC  urge companies to implement the flexible wage system, which\r\n\r\nwill  enable the companies to adjust their wage costs by varying\r\n\r\nthe  payment  of  variable components such as  the  annual  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement  or  the  13th  month  salary  and  bonuses   without\r\n\r\naffecting  the workers' basic wages.  In this way, the reduction\r\n\r\nin  CPF and basic wages can be avoided.  To date, more than  70%\r\n\r\nof  the  companies  have adopted some form of flexi-wage  scheme\r\n\r\nwith  variable wage components.  16% of total annual  wages  are\r\n\r\nmade  up  of variable components, averaging 2.3 months of  basic\r\n\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Vasoo's query of more pension for lower income\r\n\r\npensioners,  I should point out that pensions are calculated  on\r\n\r\nthe last-drawn salary at the time of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nretirement  and the length of pensionable service,  as  provided\r\n\r\nunder  the  Pensions  Act, and are thus not subject  to  change.\r\n\r\nHowever,  to  help lower income pensioners cope with  inflation,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  had  in  April  1974  introduced  an  ex-gratia\r\n\r\nallowance   called  the  Singapore  Allowance.   The   Singapore\r\n\r\nAllowance  was  last revised in August 1997.   Since  then,  the\r\n\r\nConsumer  Price Index has dropped.  Thus, there is no ground  to\r\n\r\nreview  the Singapore Allowance at this time.  Besides, to  keep\r\n\r\non  raising the Singapore Allowance of pensioners may be  unfair\r\n\r\nto  other  Government  officers who had retired  under  the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has appealed for more funds for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth.  MOH's FY99 budget has been kept at a reasonable  level,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the tight fiscal position.  MOH's FY99 operating\r\n\r\ngrant  to  voluntary welfare organisations is  $63  million,  as\r\n\r\ncompared to $44 million for FY98.  MOH has also been allocated a\r\n\r\nblock  budget  of  $200  million to cover medical  research  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment for FY97 to FY2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for disease prevention programmes and training, the budgets\r\n\r\nhave  not been reduced.  An inter-Ministry committee led by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health is looking into the financing  of  old  age\r\n\r\nmedical   needs.   The  Government  is  committed  to  preparing\r\n\r\nSingapore for an aging population and to maintain our lead as  a\r\n\r\nregional  medical  centre.  Having said all these,  some  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  Dr  Neo raised cannot be solved by more funds alone.   Dr\r\n\r\nNeo  has  spoken  on  the  need for giving  free  screening  for\r\n\r\nmammography.  However, in a recent study to establish the  cost-effectiveness  of  mammography, less  than  half  of  the  women\r\n\r\naccepted the free screening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has spoken on the funding for Medifund, CDCs\r\n\r\nand  VWOs.  The Medifund was established on 1st April 1993  with\r\n\r\nan initial contribution of $200 million.  This will be increased\r\n\r\nby  $100  million each year to reach $1 billion eventually.   To\r\n\r\ndate,  the  Government has already contributed a total  of  $600\r\n\r\nmillion to the Medifund.  No contribution is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproposed for FY98 and FY99 as we do not expect budget surplus in\r\n\r\nthese  years.   However, our assessment shows that the  expected\r\n\r\nincome   from  Medifund  will  be  more  than  enough  to   meet\r\n\r\ndisbursements for needy patients in FY99.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has suggested riding on the CDCs to implement a more\r\n\r\ntargeted  approach for helping Singaporeans in need.  Government\r\n\r\ngives  CDCs  a  resident  grant of $1  per  resident  per  year.\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  gives matching grants of $3 for  every  dollar\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  CDCs,  and $4 for every  dollar  of  residents'\r\n\r\ndonations   through  the  GIRO  system.   The  total  Government\r\n\r\nmatching grant is presently capped at $24 million per year  from\r\n\r\nFY98 onwards and will be reviewed every two years. For VWOs, the\r\n\r\ntotal Government FY99 funding is $129.9 million, as compared  to\r\n\r\n$90.38 million in FY98.  The Government has thus not cut back on\r\n\r\nits support for VWOs despite the tight revenue position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee has commented that with only 1.66% of the budget\r\n\r\nbeing  allocated to the Ministry of Community Development (MCD),\r\n\r\na   $10   million  fund  could  be  set  up  through  a  one-off\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  provide  a safety  net  to  help  families  in\r\n\r\ndifficulties  until the economy turns around.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nGovernment   believes  that  to  build  a  resilient  community,\r\n\r\nindividuals  ought to rely on family and self,  then  community,\r\n\r\nand   only   lastly   the   State  for   financial   assistance.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Government has a fairly comprehensive  safety  net\r\n\r\nto  help  those  in  genuine financial difficulty,  but  without\r\n\r\ndestroying the incentive for the individual to work hard.  MCD's\r\n\r\nbudget  alone does not adequately reflect Government's  spending\r\n\r\nin  the  social safety net.  There are schemes funded  by  other\r\n\r\nMinistries  or off-budget measures, eg, Service and  Conservancy\r\n\r\nrebates  reflected under the Ministry of National  Development's\r\n\r\nbudget; Medifund, Edusave Endowment Fund and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has asked why MCD's budget has fallen for\r\n\r\nFY99.   I  want  to  point out that development  expenditure  is\r\n\r\nsubject to fluctuations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccording  to the progress on major projects.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nMCD,  the drop of $25 million or 14% can be attributed to  major\r\n\r\nprojects  nearing completion, such as the Singapore Boys'  Home,\r\n\r\nGrassroots Recreation Clubhouse and the new sports facilities at\r\n\r\nBishan and Jurong East.  However, in terms of capital grants  to\r\n\r\nVWOs, we have in fact increased the sum from $14 million to  $16\r\n\r\nmillion.  As for operating expenditure, there was an 8% drop  in\r\n\r\nMCD's  allocation, primarily due to the 15% wage and  CPF  cuts,\r\n\r\nand  not  due to a scale-back in activities.  In fact, transfers\r\n\r\nto  various financial assistance schemes and operating grants to\r\n\r\nVWOs  and self-help groups have gone up by about $20 million  or\r\n\r\n20%  if  we  exclude  the  3-year one-off  advance  for  Mendaki\r\n\r\nTertiary Tuition Fee Scheme from the revised FY98 estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to sum up by reiterating the point\r\n\r\nmade  in  my  Budget speech that despite some initial  signs  of\r\n\r\neconomic  turnaround, there still exist many  risk  factors  and\r\n\r\nuncertainties in our external environment.  The health of the US\r\n\r\nand  Japanese economies, as well as the socio-economic political\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  our neighbouring countries, will  have  a  big\r\n\r\nimpact  on our economy.  There are other uncertainties, as  some\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House  have rightly pointed  out,  that  given\r\n\r\nChina's  strategic and economic weight, the performance  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese economy could also impact on us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with an uncertain environment, we will do well not to over-react before the signposts become clearer and at the same time,\r\n\r\nretain  the  flexibility  to allow us  to  respond  quickly  and\r\n\r\nappropriately  to  the out-turn whatever it may  be.   The  FY99\r\n\r\nBudget has therefore adopted the approach of continuing with the\r\n\r\neconomic  fundamentals that have served us  well  in  the  past,\r\n\r\ndevelop  the capabilities needed for our future growth,  and  be\r\n\r\ndexterous in dealing with change.  With this approach, I believe\r\n\r\nthat Singapore stands in good stead to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncapitalise on an upturn, and  meet the challenges that  we  will\r\n\r\nface in the year ahead.  [Applause]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission\r\n\r\nto  clarify  part of my speech which was misinterpreted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to clarify that I did not\r\n\r\nsuggest  in  my speech that the Government should  not  incur  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  in  this Budget, nor did I suggest that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  cut  back on development expenditure.  I  also  wish  to\r\n\r\nfurther clarify that there are basically two underlying messages\r\n\r\nin  my speech in my attempt to analyse FY99 budget deficit.  One\r\n\r\nis  that  the  deficit is not alarming because the  Government's\r\n\r\nrevenue  estimates  are  more  than  sufficient  to  cover   the\r\n\r\noperating  expenditure.  Secondly, the deficit is the result  of\r\n\r\ngreater  development expenditure and is not due to more  schemes\r\n\r\nor expenditures to help the people weather the economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thank him for the clarification. The\r\n\r\nimplication was that if we exclude development expenditure, then\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  surplus,  which  means  we  should  not  spend  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Is that right?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> That was not my intention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Then who pays for development? That is\r\n\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the point is that the revenue estimated\r\n\r\nby  Government is sufficient to cover the operating expenditure.\r\n\r\nSo,  the  question  is  how  much do  we  want  to  spend.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided  in  this  Budget  to  spend  more   on\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure, and that has caused the deficit of $5.1\r\n\r\nbillion.  That was the point I made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Precisely. And that is what we have said\r\n\r\nall along that we are spending heavily on development to prepare\r\n\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I do not disagree with that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That is fine.
