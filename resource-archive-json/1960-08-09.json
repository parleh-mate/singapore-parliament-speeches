Lingam (Aljunied):</b> MrSpeaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nmy  speech yesterday I have given evidence and have\r\n\r\nconcluded  that  this  is  a  Government  for   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  This is a Government for  the  Shaws\r\n\r\nand  the big compradores. This is not a true P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. I have asked, \"Why is the Lee Kuan  Yew\r\n\r\nGovernment so tied up with the Shaws?\" I have  also\r\n\r\ngiven evidence and concluded that what happened  in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  was  not real  integration  but\r\n\r\n\"Meadowisation\". The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollowers  of  Mr Meadows are now controlling  key\r\n\r\npositions in the City Council. The latest move  was\r\n\r\nto abolish the post of Administrator and replace it\r\n\r\nwith  the post of Chief Administrative Officer - only\r\n\r\na  change  of name! Mr P. C. Lim, the most  senior\r\n\r\nlocal  officer in the City Council, who had  worked\r\n\r\nin  the  City Council for more than 30  years,  was\r\n\r\ndemoted   and  the  Director  of  Social  Welfare - a\r\n\r\nrelatively  junior officer from the  Government - was\r\n\r\nasked  to  act as Chief Administrative Officer.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  not  an  insult  to the  City  Council  local\r\n\r\nofficers? What does the Director of Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nknow  about  City  Council  matters?  It  must   be\r\n\r\nremembered  that  Mr Meadows  was  also  once  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Social Welfare. In the City Council, we\r\n\r\nwill still be hearing them talk of integration  for\r\n\r\nmany years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr, Speaker, Sir, this is a Government for the\r\n\r\nShaws,  by  Meadows,  in  the  name  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last one year, the Lee Kuan Yew Government\r\n\r\nhas  done  almost  nothing for  the  people  except\r\n\r\nconsolidation,  reorganisation and  preparation  to\r\n\r\nfurther their own ends. The Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  for National Development  talked\r\n\r\nabout  Malay  welfare. Is he really  interested  in\r\n\r\nMalay  welfare? Or is he really interested in  free\r\n\r\noverseas  trips? He asked his ex-Minister to  send\r\n\r\nhim  to  Indonesia to \"study\" fishing, but the  ex-Minister refused. Several weeks later, there popped\r\n\r\nup  the  idea of sending him to Indonesia at  great\r\n\r\nexpense to the Government to \"study\" education. Out\r\n\r\nof  the  $800,000 in the 1960 Budget earmarked  for\r\n\r\nprimary  production, $200,000 had been allotted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim for Malay welfare, and the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational  Development was asked to put up  schemes.\r\n\r\nDespite repeated reminders for many months, he  had\r\n\r\nnot  even  put up one scheme. Instead he spent  his\r\n\r\ntime  planning how to get free overseas trips. When\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was first formed, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  drew  up plans to foster Malay  welfare.\r\n\r\nWithin three months, a scheme to build 100\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses  in  the  Jalan Eunos Malay  Settlement  was\r\n\r\nstarted.  A  scheme to benefit the  Malays  in  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands was started and completed.  There\r\n\r\nwere other minor projects in the Geylang Serai area\r\n\r\nto benefit the Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   National  Development  tried   to   play   on\r\n\r\ncommunalism.  Let me remind him that  whatever  the\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan  Yew  Government is, it is  a  Right-wing\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  it  is  definitely  a  Government\r\n\r\nagainst  communalism. We support the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin   his  strong  attitude  against  all  forms  of\r\n\r\ncommunalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development tried to distort the case of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Sembawang Malay Settlement. When  the\r\n\r\nLim  Yew  Hock Government was in its last days,  it\r\n\r\ntried  to win votes by gazetting several places  as\r\n\r\nproposed  Malay Settlements. Some of  these  places\r\n\r\nwere satisfactory. One of these satisfactory places\r\n\r\nis  Jalan Eunos; and when the P.A.P. Government was\r\n\r\nformed,  the  building of the houses there  started\r\n\r\nimmediately. An unsatisfactory place was a piece of\r\n\r\nland  in Sembawang for a proposed Malay Settlement.\r\n\r\nThe  land  had not been acquired and  a  very  high\r\n\r\nprice had been agreed to by the previous Government\r\n\r\nwith the British owners. This land was also full of\r\n\r\nsquatters.  The Government intended to find,  as  a\r\n\r\nsubstitute, a piece of State land where there  were\r\n\r\nno squatters. As a matter of policy, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  not  acquire  land  where  there  are  many\r\n\r\nsquatters who have to be evicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before his powers were curbed in\r\n\r\nOctober  1959, the Member for Hong Lim had launched\r\n\r\ntwo  big projects to promote Malay welfare, namely,\r\n\r\nthe   Southern   Islands  scheme  and   the   Malay\r\n\r\nSettlement  housing  scheme. These  were  completed\r\n\r\nwithin the short space of two to three months. What\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development had done was to call  up  the\r\n\r\nketuas of the Southern Islands, or occasionally  to\r\n\r\nvisit   them.  What  for?  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  he  is looking  to  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands in the 1964 general elections. He is more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterested  in  his  own welfare  and  in  his  own\r\n\r\nfuture. Bukit Timah would not be a safe ward then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard during the past\r\n\r\nsix  weeks how the Prime Minister consolidates  his\r\n\r\nposition  with the Assemblymen. The main object  is\r\n\r\nto  make them part and parcel of the status quo,  a\r\n\r\npart  of  the  existing  social  system,  and  thus\r\n\r\nresistant  to  social  changes  demanded   by   the\r\n\r\noverwhelming masses of the people. He  has  devious\r\n\r\nmethods:   brain-washing,  free  trips   (sometimes\r\n\r\ncompulsory  free  trips), control of  Assemblymen's\r\n\r\npay.  These are a few of the methods employed.  The\r\n\r\nCity  Councillor Mr Low Por Tuck  getting  $150  a\r\n\r\nmonth  is a different social being from the present\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance - he  is now getting ten times  more  income.\r\n\r\nFive   of   the   Parliamentary  Secretaries   have\r\n\r\ncompulsory  savings. By the end  of  the  five-year\r\n\r\nterm -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All these references to\r\n\r\npersonalities and personal acts of Assembly Members\r\n\r\nseem  to  me to be quite irrelevant to the question\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House.

The other accusation was  that  all\r\n\r\nthe  speeches  made during the last  14  months  by\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Assemblymen were prepared either by Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew or Mr George Thomson. But after  hearing\r\n\r\nthe speech of the Member for Aljunied yesterday and\r\n\r\ntoday,  it  is now quite clear who is reading  from\r\n\r\nwritten speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go into the details of\r\n\r\nthe  speeches made by the Member for Hong  Lim  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Aljunied, I would like to say  that\r\n\r\nthey  were of a similar nature but, of course,  the\r\n\r\nwording was different. The most important thing the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim touched on was Malayanisation.\r\n\r\nLet us go back to the activities in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational Development during the last one year. What\r\n\r\ndid  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  really  mean   by\r\n\r\nMalayanisation?  For  example,  let  us  take   the\r\n\r\nArchitects  Department.  One  fine  morning,  there\r\n\r\nappeared in the Straits Times and in all the  local\r\n\r\nnewspapers an article about Mr Ong Eng Guan's plan\r\n\r\nof  4,000 units of houses to be built in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOne  does  not  need a technician to give  a  Press\r\n\r\nstatement.

But to carry out the  plan  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  4,000 units of houses, you  must  require\r\n\r\nefficient and experienced architects. What did  the\r\n\r\nex-Minister  for  National Development  do  on  the\r\n\r\npretext   of  Malayanisation?  It  was  \"Melbourneisation\"! Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nis  a graduate from Melbourne University. He was of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion  that  one must  be  a  graduate  from\r\n\r\nMelbourne University, otherwise he could not  be  a\r\n\r\ntrue  socialist  and an anti-colonialist.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  happened  in that department.  Why  have  the\r\n\r\nlocal  architects  left the  service  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil?  It  is not because they fear  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as put forward by the S.P.A.  Members.\r\n\r\nIt  is not because they are afraid of their future.\r\n\r\nIt   is  because  they  have  not  graduated   from\r\n\r\nMelbourne  University, that they have no future  in\r\n\r\nthat department as long as that man is there as the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied talked about Lui Boon Poh\r\n\r\nin  the City Council. If I am wrong in what I  have\r\n\r\nto   say,  I  hope  the  Prime  Minister   or   his\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  will  correct   me.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, when the Prime Minister took over the\r\n\r\nCity   Council  from  the  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, the whole sewerage system was  on  the\r\n\r\nverge  of  collapse, because we had an  \"efficient\"\r\n\r\nadministrator in Lui Boon Poh. And the  ex-Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development himself admitted in  this\r\n\r\nHouse Mr Lui's qualifications and experience as an\r\n\r\nadministrator.  When the Prime Minister  took  over\r\n\r\nthe  City Council, there was only one engineer left\r\n\r\nin  the  service,  and  he also  had  tendered  his\r\n\r\nresignation. That was the State of -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, on a\r\n\r\npoint of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I think it is not necessary to\r\n\r\nclarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will not give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> And that was the state of affairs left by the so-called socialist and anti-colonialist who\r\n\r\nis  now  parted  from  the P.A.P. because  of  his\r\n\r\n\"broad\"  colonial attitude. That was  what  he  had\r\n\r\ndone for the people of Singapore. And in his speech\r\n\r\ntoday,  the  Member  for Aljunied  boasted  of  the\r\n\r\nachievements  that  he  and  the  ex-Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational Development had done - they had done so much\r\n\r\nfor  the  Malays,  they had done so  much  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islanders. Let me remind them: they  were\r\n\r\nexpelled  from  the P.A.P. only recently.  Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Hong  Lim did  was  done  in  his\r\n\r\ncapacity as Minister for National Development,  and\r\n\r\nnot as Mr Ong Eng Guan; also he did it as a P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncandidate and a P.A.P. man. So the credit does  not\r\n\r\ngo  to  Ong  Eng  Guan, but to the  P.A.P.  He  was\r\n\r\nelected  to this Assembly as a P.A.P. candidate  in\r\n\r\nHong  Lim;  he  was not elected as  an  Independent\r\n\r\ncandidate.  He  ran  his  Ministry  as   a   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  whatever good he did or  encouraged\r\n\r\nwas  not personal. Maybe he had done something bad,\r\n\r\nand that is why he is no more with the P.A.P. now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point which the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  as well as the Member for Aljunied brought  up\r\n\r\nwas  the  case of Mr Owen in the City Council.  It\r\n\r\nappears  to the people of Singapore that the  three\r\n\r\nso-called socialists went from the Government  side\r\n\r\nto  sit in the Opposition to fight Owen's case.  It\r\n\r\nseems that they are the mouthpiece of Mr Owen, and\r\n\r\nthe common man might think that they are obliged to\r\n\r\nMr Owen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I speak on the details of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, let me go through this\r\n\r\npamphlet,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  on  \"How  to  Fight\r\n\r\nColonialism\". It is a fine heading and  can  easily\r\n\r\nget  the support of the masses. Everybody wants  to\r\n\r\nfight  colonialism; not only Ong Eng  Guan  or  Mr\r\n\r\nLingam - I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the hon.\r\n\r\nMember    for   Aljunied - but   the   whole   P.A.P.\r\n\r\norganisation, the working class, the masses are all\r\n\r\ninterested in fighting colonialism. It is a 10-page\r\n\r\npamphlet of speeches delivered at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBadminton  Hall  on  12th July,  1960.  If  you  go\r\n\r\nthrough all this, what way has this so-called anti-colonialist   given   to  the   masses   to   fight\r\n\r\ncolonialism?  All  these  speeches  are  merely   a\r\n\r\npersonal  attack on Lee Kuan Yew and Dr  Goh  Keng\r\n\r\nSwee, and three expatriate officers - George Thomson,\r\n\r\nBlades  and Meadows. In other words, if you are  an\r\n\r\nanti-colonialist   or   if   you    are    fighting\r\n\r\ncolonialism,  you must first fight George  Thomson,\r\n\r\nMeadows  and Blades. And if you kick them out,  you\r\n\r\nare  really an anti-colonialist. That is the  stand\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  hon. Member for Hong  Lim  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Aljunied.  On the  last  page  of  the\r\n\r\npamphlet, the following conclusions were arrived at\r\n\r\nthe meeting on \"How to Fight Colonialism\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) That the greatest enemy of the people is\r\n\r\nstill  colonialism  and that all  sections  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  must  be united to carry on the  fight  and\r\n\r\ncomplete the revolution.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is the P.A.P.'s aim. Besides that, these  so-called  anti-colonialists could not concretely  put\r\n\r\nforward  to  the  public ideas  on  \"How  to  Fight\r\n\r\nColonialism\".  That is because the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ngradually  and bit by bit took over the departments\r\n\r\nin the Ministry of National Development and finally\r\n\r\nthe   ex-Minister  for  National  Development   had\r\n\r\nnothing in his portfolio. That is the root of  this\r\n\r\nso-called split in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the 1959 P.A.P. Election Manifesto.\r\n\r\nAt  that time the hon. Member for Aljunied and  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Hong  Lim  were  Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  members, and they were involved  in  the\r\n\r\ndrafting of the P.A.P. Manifesto. Let me read  from\r\n\r\nthis, Mr Speaker. On page 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To this purpose, the P.A.P. has recently week by\r\n\r\nweek  issued its policy statements on the work that\r\n\r\nwill  be carried out in government in the next five\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plans we have laid down in these policy\r\n\r\nstatements  are  not all ambitious ones.  They  are\r\n\r\nrealistic   plans,  based  on  existing  political,\r\n\r\nsocial  and economic conditions. In drafting  these\r\n\r\nplans,  we  recognise  that  an  internally   self-governing Singapore is not an independent Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause control of our foreign affairs and external\r\n\r\ndefence   remains  in  the  hands  of  the  British\r\n\r\nColonial Office, and so in a sense we are  a  semi-colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the severe restriction of land space,\r\n\r\na mere 220 square miles, and a present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation of 1\u00bd million, which is still going on at\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of 65,000 a year. We recognise that  our\r\n\r\nlittle island has no natural resources and that our\r\n\r\neconomy  has for the past 100 years been  dependent\r\n\r\nonly  on  the  entrepot  trade,  and  has  remained\r\n\r\nstatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the complexities of our multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety and the special problems they pose.  It  is\r\n\r\nwithin this framework that we must work, and within\r\n\r\nthese  limitations  we  must construct  our  labour\r\n\r\nbasis for a future socialist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next five years will be critical years of\r\n\r\ntesting  those people who believe, like the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat socialism can be achieved step by step through\r\n\r\npeaceful constitutional means.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is the P.A.P. Manifesto which was carried  out\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Aljunied and the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim; and they wholeheartedly supported it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Ong Eng Guan issue was first published\r\n\r\nin  the papers, there was an outburst in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  the people really did not know what it was all\r\n\r\nabout.  Maybe 30,000 or 40,000 people attended  the\r\n\r\nmass  rally, and that was the force. But that  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that the 40,000 are supporters of the so-called  anti-colonialists  and  supporters  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers for Hong Lim and Aljunied. The people  were\r\n\r\nquite enthusiastic and wanted to know what were the\r\n\r\nreal  differences in the Party and why these  Party\r\n\r\nExecutive members, elected on P.A.P. tickets,  were\r\n\r\nsuddenly expelled after one year of office.  Slowly\r\n\r\nwhen   the   explanations  were  given,  and   when\r\n\r\neverything  was over, the people began  to  realise\r\n\r\nwhat  the  real  issue is: whether the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nbecome pro-colonial or whether the so-called  anti-colonialists  who caused a split in the  Party  are\r\n\r\npro-colonialists. The people of Singapore now begin\r\n\r\nto  realise  that the split in the  Party  was  not\r\n\r\nbecause the P.A.P. deviated from its basic stand of\r\n\r\nanti-colonialism, but because of personal  grudges.\r\n\r\nIf  I  may  put it bluntly, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  have  two Prime Ministers in one  State - and\r\n\r\nthat  was  the whole trouble that happened  in  the\r\n\r\nParty.  We  can  afford  to  have  only  one  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  luckily we have an efficient,  able\r\n\r\nand honest Prime Minister to lead the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is accused of being pro-colonial\r\n\r\nbecause  it  retains  George Thomson,  Meadows  and\r\n\r\nBlades.  The  P.A.P. is also accused of  being  unsocialistic because the Shaws and millionaires  are\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask: since when did our ex-colleagues become\r\n\r\nso  anti-colonialistic? Since when did  they  learn\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. is pro-colonial? The  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nformed in Singapore in the year 1954 by the working\r\n\r\nclass. Maybe some of its founders are not in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  but  they  are  still  with  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\noutside, and it is they who began the anti-colonial\r\n\r\nmovement. It is they who supported the P.A.P. from\r\n\r\nthe  very beginning up to now and the P.A.P. still\r\n\r\nhas  the full support and confidence of the  masses\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, especially the trade union movement.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. leader, who is now the Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nattended  the  Constitutional Talks with  the  then\r\n\r\nChief Minister, and upon his return the Party  held\r\n\r\nmany meetings and explained to its members and  the\r\n\r\npeople  what was the Constitution that  was  agreed\r\n\r\nupon. At that time the Member for Hong Lim and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Aljunied were with the Party, and  they\r\n\r\ncompletely  agreed with the Party's stand  on  this\r\n\r\nConstitution.  If  they  had  not  agreed  to   the\r\n\r\nConstitution, why did they contest the elections on\r\n\r\nP.A.P. tickets?  Because the P.A.P. categorically\r\n\r\nstated  their stand on the Constitution.  This  was\r\n\r\nexplained in Petir and Party meetings - that  we  had\r\n\r\nto  work this Constitution for two or three  years,\r\n\r\nand  then  we had to go back to London  for  a  new\r\n\r\nConstitution.  And the Party as a whole  agreed  to\r\n\r\nit.  `If  the Member for Hong Lim thinks  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  Constitution  is  pro-colonial,  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  administration is pro-colonialist, and  that\r\n\r\nit  is  not a workable Constitution, then he should\r\n\r\nhave realised, at the time of the election, that he\r\n\r\nwas  going  to  contest the election  on  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nticket, that is, as a candidate of the Party  which\r\n\r\nagreed  to  the  new Constitution,  and  which  was\r\n\r\nconfident  that it would come into power.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime, it was quite apparent that this was the  only\r\n\r\nParty  which was going to get a complete  majority.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Hong Lim agreed  with  it.  After\r\n\r\nworking one year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin  the Constitution, he suddenly gets a vision\r\n\r\nthat it is not workable because Mr Lee Kuan Yew is\r\n\r\nthere and Dr Goh Keng Swee is there, and they  are\r\n\r\npro-colonialists, because they are educated in -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member must mean the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. Another\r\n\r\nattack  came from the Member for Hong Lim  and  the\r\n\r\nMember    for    Aljunied   on   trade   unions - the\r\n\r\ncancellation of the federations of trade unions.  I\r\n\r\nwill say quite frankly to my friends that the trade\r\n\r\nunion  leadership  is  quite efficient  in  looking\r\n\r\nafter  their own interest. I ask them to leave  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions to their leaders The whole membership\r\n\r\nof  the trade unions has complete confidence in its\r\n\r\npresent  leaders. So better leave the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  alone  and  do  not  interfere  with  the\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Members think that by making an unwarranted\r\n\r\nattack  on the T.U.C. and its leadership  they  can\r\n\r\ndivide  the  trade  union movement  and  get  their\r\n\r\nsupport,  then I think they are wasting their  time\r\n\r\nin  doing  this  unhealthy thing.

If  by  attacking  the  T.U.C. and   its\r\n\r\nleadership and making an unwarranted attack on them\r\n\r\nhe thinks that he can really become a revolutionary\r\n\r\nand an anti-colonialist, and he can get some of the\r\n\r\nunion support, then I think politically he is going\r\n\r\nto be a bankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since this trouble started in the P.A.P., there may be some in the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement  who  think  that  they  can  also  become\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries like the Member for Hong  Lim.  Let\r\n\r\nme  remind  them  that  the future  of  this  State\r\n\r\ndepends on industrialisation, stable government and\r\n\r\na  healthy atmosphere in the whole political arena.\r\n\r\nAnd  if the so-called adventurers and some of their\r\n\r\nleaders want to create unrest in this country under\r\n\r\nthe  pretext of anti-colonialism, then I think  the\r\n\r\nwhole trade union should be aware of this fact.  We\r\n\r\nshould be prepared to face the situation, and  show\r\n\r\nthat  we  are more responsible and more  able,  and\r\n\r\nthat  we can understand the situation more clearly,\r\n\r\neven  though  we - the  trade  union  people - are  not\r\n\r\ngraduated from the University in Melbourne. We must\r\n\r\nshow  to  the  world that industrial  and  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion can be achieved in Singapore with the co-operation and help of the trade union movement  and\r\n\r\ntheir confidence in the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied in his speech has said\r\n\r\nthat the Parliamentary Secretary to the ex-Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development was bringing up  communal\r\n\r\nissues  in  this House in regard to  the  political\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore. But  the  Member  himself\r\n\r\nindulged  in  that by bringing up  communal  issues\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said  that the only two  people  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly who are interested in the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays  are the Member for Hong Lim and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Aljunied.  Whatever  Government  did  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  for the last one year was not done  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government, but by these  two  individuals.\r\n\r\nWhere  did  they  get the money from?  It  is  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  which passed the money, and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim acted in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapacity   of  the  P.A.P.

How can they come here and  tell  the\r\n\r\npublic  that  whatever was done in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development was done by Ong Eng Guan  and\r\n\r\nnot by the P A.P. Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Member for Aljunied was\r\n\r\nattached  to  the Ministry of National Development,\r\n\r\nwe,  the  P.A.P.  Assemblymen, even  at  that  time\r\n\r\nconsidered  him, with due respect to him,  as  part\r\n\r\nand  parcel of the civil service, because, from the\r\n\r\ninformation  received from our  colleagues  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement - I stand subject to correction,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir - he used to pay periodical or daily\r\n\r\nvisits  to the departments and find fault with  the\r\n\r\ncivil servants. Yet today in his speech, he says he\r\n\r\nis  the  only  man  who  can fight  for  the  local\r\n\r\nofficers,  and  he  is the only man  who  can  give\r\n\r\nsomething to the civil servants. But he himself has\r\n\r\nforgotten that when he was attached to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   National  Development,  he  was   an   elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the  people  and  not  a  civil\r\n\r\nservant. Today, when he is away from the P.A.P. he\r\n\r\nhimself brings forward the accusation that  we  are\r\n\r\ngiving   trouble,   that  we  are   forgetting   or\r\n\r\nneglecting the local officers and civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they want to fight colonialism,\r\n\r\nthey   want  to  malayanise,  but  they   are   not\r\n\r\ninterested in the whole set-up of the civil service\r\n\r\nand  the  technical staff. What they are interested\r\n\r\nin  is  this.  As  long  as  the  three  chaps  are\r\n\r\nthere - Meadows,  Blades and Thomson - then  the  whole\r\n\r\nadministration  is  colonial. And  if  these  three\r\n\r\npeople  go out, then the Members for Hong  Lim  and\r\n\r\nAljunied   are   the  real  anti-colonialists   and\r\n\r\nsocialists in this country. But when we say that we\r\n\r\nare  anti-colonial, we categorically state that  we\r\n\r\nare not interested in fighting Europeans. We do not\r\n\r\nfight  them  because  they  are  white,  they   are\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  We  fight  them  because  of   their\r\n\r\npolitical  ideology. We must know that,  especially\r\n\r\nin dealing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  our colonial masters, we must be tactful  and\r\n\r\nuse  our brains. If the Member for Hong Lim  thinks\r\n\r\nthat,  by  getting  rid of these three  chaps,  our\r\n\r\nfight  is over, that we are completely independent,\r\n\r\nand  that we are really socialists, then we are far\r\n\r\napart. We will never be able to agree with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, it is stated that the Government is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  build  a trade union house  and  that  a\r\n\r\ncommittee will be set up to draw up plans. This was\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  supported by the  people  when  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. put  this  proposal  forward  during   the\r\n\r\nelections.  We  hope that with the co-operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  movement, the building  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted soon, so that all the unions can  utilise\r\n\r\nthe facilities and work for a better and prosperous\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is the fifth day of the debate on the address\r\n\r\nof  thanks for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.\r\n\r\nan  address  that  does not merit  such  a  lengthy\r\n\r\ndebate.  But what has brought about the lengthiness\r\n\r\nof  this debate is because the Honourable the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  moving his motion, has  to  find  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to level an attack on the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim. And he has thus opened the gate so  wide\r\n\r\nthat  this Assembly has been treated to,  shall  we\r\n\r\nsay,  the  unhappy  spectacle of comrades  and  excomrades  quarrelling  among  themselves,  and   of\r\n\r\nexposure after exposure. And that reminds me  of  a\r\n\r\nsaying,  Sir, which we all know. \"When blank  falls\r\n\r\nout,  honest men will come into their own.\" Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave not used the word \"rogues\" because I know that\r\n\r\nthese  honourable  men are not \"rogues\".  But  when\r\n\r\nsomething  falls  out, honest men  will  come  into\r\n\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is typical, Sir, of the P.A.P., not only of the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister,  not  only  of  his   Ministerial\r\n\r\ncolleagues, but also of the back-benchers, to  rave\r\n\r\nand  rant,  to attack unnecessarily the Opposition,\r\n\r\nand  to  ridicule  the Opposition even  before  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  has  opened its  mouth.  So  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his speech\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid; `What is this I see, the amendments that  are\r\n\r\nproposed  by the opposition. What a comic  relief.'\r\n\r\nSir,  what we have been sitting here for five  days\r\n\r\nlistening to has been the comic relief provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Assemblymen, Ministers and ex-comrades.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the kind of comic relief we have. Surely,\r\n\r\nSir, the Prime Minister must have felt in his heart\r\n\r\nthat  some  such comic relief would take  place  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, and that is why he used the  word.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  he has to turn it around and say, `We  are\r\n\r\nproviding the comic relief!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Members on the other side said that we\r\n\r\nhad  not  pronounced any world-shaking  events.  We\r\n\r\nhave treated the world-shaking pronouncement of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister with little concern.  Sir,  I  will\r\n\r\ntouch on that in due course. But they, Sir, in  all\r\n\r\ntheir speeches, have not even accepted in their own\r\n\r\nminds, that   there  was  such  a   world-shaking\r\n\r\nstatement  made  by the Prime Minister.  They  went\r\n\r\ninto  ridicule,  jibes, and criticisms.  They  even\r\n\r\nwent  so  far as to suggest that all the ills  that\r\n\r\nthey have perpetrated during the past 14 months are\r\n\r\nthe  ills  they inherited from the past Government.\r\n\r\nAnd  yet the Member for Hong Lim said that all  the\r\n\r\ngood  things,  all the buildings that they  claimed\r\n\r\nthey  had built, were built by the past Government.\r\n\r\nI say, Sir, in this House: let the people judge the\r\n\r\nGovernment not by what the previous Government  did\r\n\r\nor  did  not do. They will judge them by what  they\r\n\r\nthemselves did or did not do during their  time  of\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, we were treated to a famous\r\n\r\nstatement of the P.A.P. - \"We mean what we say and we\r\n\r\nsay  what  we mean.\" Let us examine their credence.\r\n\r\nSir,  when the previous Government felt that  Mayor\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan was not doing the right thing by  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, and felt that  he  had  been\r\n\r\ndoing a number of acts that were detrimental to the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore, my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing  in  the previous Government, instituted  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry into the  misdeeds  of  the\r\n\r\nMayor  and  the P.A.P. Councillors. At  that  time,\r\n\r\nwhat did the Prime Minister do? He defended  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat man and said \"What he did was right.  What\r\n\r\nhe  did  captured the imagination of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. What he did had caused fear in the minds\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. They knew they were  going  to\r\n\r\nlose.  They  knew that we were going to  win.\"  All\r\n\r\nthose things were said in the courts. And now  what\r\n\r\ndo  we hear? \"Ha, that Mayor Ong Eng Guan! Oh, that\r\n\r\nsilly boy! Naturally, if we had not protected  him,\r\n\r\nhe would have been dead long, long ago. Look at all\r\n\r\nthe  misdeeds  he  did! Look at  the  discredit  he\r\n\r\nbrought  to the P.A.P.!\" And yet, Sir, it  was  the\r\n\r\ndeeds - I  call  them misdeeds, but  they  call  them\r\n\r\ndeeds - of  Mayor  Ong Eng Guan that  won  them  that\r\n\r\nelection last year. Had they not played up Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan  as  a  god and as a hero of the people,  they\r\n\r\nwould  not  have been sitting here.  Therefore, if\r\n\r\nthey  say.  Sir, that Ong Eng Guan was wrong,  that\r\n\r\nthe deeds of Ong Eng Guan were misdeeds, then I say\r\n\r\nthis with due respect to you and to them.

Last  year, Sir, on the Budget  debate,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance let the cat out of the bag.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  said  this. It is at  col.  797  of  the\r\n\r\nHansard, volume 11, No. 13 of 25th November,  1959,\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To these people, we can say with perfect candourl\r\n\r\nthat members of the P.A.P. political leadership are\r\n\r\nnot lacking in talent, vigour or self-confidence.

I  said  that   the\r\n\r\nMinister had let the cat out of the bag. That there\r\n\r\nwere  some  Ministers in the Cabinet who  had  been\r\n\r\narrogant, who had been handling the destiny of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  with arrogance and recklessness,  and  who\r\n\r\nhad  not  been tempered with any sense of  reality.\r\n\r\nAnd  what  did  I  get, Sir? As  usual,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that the hon. Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwas  ever  fond of fishing in troubled  waters.  \"I\r\n\r\nhave  the  greatest confidence in my colleague  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development.\" His  greatest\r\n\r\nconfidence, Sir, has now matured in expulsion.

I knew,  as\r\n\r\nhis Chief Minister then, that he went there to find\r\n\r\nout how to start a cigarette factory, bringing into\r\n\r\nassociation local capital. Let us take the case  of\r\n\r\nthe  British-American Tobacco factory that has been\r\n\r\nopened  after the PAP, came into power. They wanted\r\n\r\nto  reopen their factory in Singapore. We  said  to\r\n\r\nthem,  although we did not claim, as they are  fond\r\n\r\nof  claiming, to be anti-British capital,  \"If  you\r\n\r\nwant  to restart your factory, we will welcome  it.\r\n\r\nBut you must allow 51 per cent local capital.\" They\r\n\r\naccepted  that.  But they said the  elections  were\r\n\r\ncoming,  and so they could not accept it. But  they\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to accept in principle 51  per  cent\r\n\r\nlocal capital participation. Yet, Sir, this factory\r\n\r\nstarted soon after the P.A.P. Government came  into\r\n\r\npower  with  a  100 per cent British capital.  What\r\n\r\nabout  that? No shares from the other factories?  A\r\n\r\nhundred  per cent British capital. And this Company\r\n\r\nhas, since its starting a new factory, knocked  out\r\n\r\nalmost all the other factories manufacturing  local\r\n\r\ncigarettes.  Why has it been so? It is all  because\r\n\r\nthey  have  popular brands. They are able  to  sell\r\n\r\nCapstan,  a  popular  brand,  at  a  cheaper  price\r\n\r\nbecause  they claim that the cigarettes are locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured. And to show how popular the brand is,\r\n\r\nSir,   can   be   measured  by   the   price.   The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas  even  produced a packet of Capstan cigarettes.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  wonderful is that this Government  claims\r\n\r\nthat  colonialism means the choking of the economic\r\n\r\nstructure  of  a  colony. Yet we  had  beaten  this\r\n\r\nBritish  company down to accepting a  49  per  cent\r\n\r\ncapital  participation. And the P.A.P.  Government,\r\n\r\nimmediately after coming in, has given them 100 per\r\n\r\ncent. That, Sir, must be due to the flexibility  in\r\n\r\nthe  struggle against colonialism as enunciated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. They say that the struggle has now\r\n\r\nentered  a  flexible stage where they  must  employ\r\n\r\nflexible tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister for Labour and Law claims, \"Have\r\n\r\nyou  not  read the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech?\r\n\r\nDid  we  not  say that there would be $101  million\r\n\r\ncapital  that  might be invested in this  country?\"\r\n\r\nAnd  he went on to say about the Shell Company with\r\n\r\na $54 million investment. The Shell Company started\r\n\r\nits  discussions with the previous Government.  The\r\n\r\nShell Company wanted the piece of land that has now\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to  a Japanese company.  We  were  not\r\n\r\nprepared to give it for free. We asked for the full\r\n\r\nprice.  The British said, \"No, no, do not  ask  for\r\n\r\nthe  full  price.  You  know  we  are  helping  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Give  it  to us at a cheaper  price.\"  We\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"No deal.\" We refused to give that piece  of\r\n\r\nland.  And  now  that  land has  been  given  to  a\r\n\r\nJapanese foreign company. But Shell is still  going\r\n\r\nahead with their proposal of a $54 million refinery\r\n\r\nthat was discussed during the previous Government's\r\n\r\ntime.

The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  going to build them a  trade  union\r\n\r\nhouse. Do not say no to that. Sir, any trade  union\r\n\r\nworthy  of its name and its desire to struggle  for\r\n\r\njustice  and  just rights must not accept  any  sop\r\n\r\nfrom  any Government or any political organisation,\r\n\r\nbecause then it will lose its own character and its\r\n\r\nown  integrity. But no, the plan of the  Government\r\n\r\nis  to  build  a trade union house for  the  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion Congress, because, as the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nhas  said,  they hope to capture the  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress.  And  they  have already  made  plans  to\r\n\r\ncapture the Trades Union Congress. We have heard in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly of a trade unionist who takes  pride\r\n\r\nin  accepting a sop from the Government. Does  that\r\n\r\nmean  to  suggest to the outside world and  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  throughout the world that the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are not united enough to raise  funds  to\r\n\r\nbuild  their  own trade union house?

I do not think it is necessary\r\n\r\nfor  me  to waste the time of this Assembly  or  to\r\n\r\nlower  my  dignity or the dignity of this House  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the character assassination  between\r\n\r\nex-comrades, it does not profit us. In fact, if the\r\n\r\ntruth be told, we are rather ashamed as Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly to hear the words used by honourable\r\n\r\nmen  of  this  Assembly.  But  there  were  certain\r\n\r\nallegations brought out by the Member for Hong Lim,\r\n\r\nand  these allegations have not been denied so  far\r\n\r\neither  by  the  Ministers or by the Back-benchers.\r\n\r\nWhat   did  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  say?  \"The\r\n\r\nGovernment had to use six lorries to convey members\r\n\r\nof  the  Works  Brigade,  P.A.P. community  centre\r\n\r\nleaders and others to the City Hall to line up  the\r\n\r\nstreets  from  City Hall to this  Assembly,  hoping\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  cheer  when  these  people   who\r\n\r\nrepresent the masses marched to the Assembly.\"  And\r\n\r\nit  has been told that these men did not cheer. But\r\n\r\nwhat  I  want  to bring out is this,  Sir.  Such  a\r\n\r\ncharge  has been made in this House and that charge\r\n\r\nhas  not been denied. I would not like to say  that\r\n\r\nthat  is  true,  but so long as it  is  not  denied\r\n\r\nduring this debate, then it must be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another allegation made by the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim - and  this is a very serious allegation - is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government intimidates the Press.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nchampion  of  the freedom of the Press  sitting  in\r\n\r\nthis  House as the Minister for Culture today.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim made allegations that  editors\r\n\r\nand newspaper reporters were called in and told  to\r\n\r\ntoe  the  P.A.P. line. That resulted  in  only  one\r\n\r\nlittle  denial  from the Minister for  Culture  who\r\n\r\nwas, and I hope still is, a defender of the freedom\r\n\r\nof the Press. He said. \"What about this Ong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEng  Guan  issue? No doubt, I called  them  in  and\r\n\r\ntalked  to them. But they themselves told  me  that\r\n\r\nthey did not want to play up this issue because all\r\n\r\nthe statements of Ong Eng Guan were not true.\" That\r\n\r\nmay  be  correct,  Sir, and I  would  not  want  to\r\n\r\nchallenge  that  statement. But  there  were  other\r\n\r\ninstances   of  the  Press  not  doing  the   right\r\n\r\nthing - not  maintaining the  freedom  of  their  own\r\n\r\nPress.  When the Opposition had some statements  to\r\n\r\nissue   which  were  not  to  the  credit  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or to the P.A.P., and when  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  had said a number of  things  that\r\n\r\nshould have been brought out into the light of day,\r\n\r\nthe Press did not print them. Sir, I would not like\r\n\r\nto  make  a  sweeping statement that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  intimidated the Press, but I would like to say\r\n\r\nin  this House that they have told the Press to  be\r\n\r\ncareful  of what they write and what they  publish.\r\n\r\nWhen they are accused of suppressing the Press, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture - the great  defender  of  the\r\n\r\nfreedom of the Press - stands up and smilingly  says,\r\n\r\n\"I  did not tell them anything. I only told them to\r\n\r\nbe  careful  to publish what is good  and  what  is\r\n\r\nbad.\"   [Interruption]  But,  Sir,  that  kind   of\r\n\r\nintimidation is worse than pure intimidation.  Pure\r\n\r\nintimidation   can   be  nailed,   but   suggestive\r\n\r\nintimidation  cannot be nailed.  [Interruption]  It\r\n\r\nseems,  Sir,  that there must be some truth  in  my\r\n\r\nstatement that there has been intimidation  of  the\r\n\r\nPress  because  even  the Hon, the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nlooks  hurt.  There is a Malay saying.  Sir - \"Siapa\r\n\r\nmakan  chilli rasa pedas.\" It could be  true.  They\r\n\r\neither laugh it off or they burst out in anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in respect of the two detained journalists,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim said that one of them  was\r\n\r\ndetained  15  minutes after having left  his  Press\r\n\r\nconference on his way to the office to telephone  a\r\n\r\nreport  to  the  papers in Kuala  Lumpur.  The  two\r\n\r\njournalists  were  detained and  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  was the one who stood up in this House  to\r\n\r\njustify  their detention under the Preservation  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Security Ordinance. What did  he  tell  us?\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  they are K.M.T. propagandists. They have been\r\n\r\ntrained in K.M.T. camps. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are a danger to the people of Singapore.\"  If\r\n\r\nthat  is  the way we want to go about it, then  all\r\n\r\nthose  people  who have been trained in  the  other\r\n\r\ncamp -  the Communist camp - to do this and  that  but\r\n\r\nhave not done anything yet should also be detained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They did something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What have they done, Sir? During\r\n\r\nthe  time  of my Government, the Communists  roused\r\n\r\nthe  school children to disobey even their  parents\r\n\r\nand  here  we  have a Member of the Government  who\r\n\r\nsays,  \"I  pray to God every day.\" These Communists\r\n\r\neven  told  the children, \"Thou shall  disobey  thy\r\n\r\nparents.  Thou shall forget all those things.  Come\r\n\r\nout  and fight.\" And here we have this other  group\r\n\r\nof  men who say, \"Tch, tch, do not do this. That is\r\n\r\nwrong.  We  are  fighting  Communist  tactics   and\r\n\r\nCommunist  subversion. We are not trying  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  the downfall of the Government but we  have,\r\n\r\nin  fact, tried to help the Government.\" They  are\r\n\r\ndetained  today for acts which they did some  three\r\n\r\nyears  ago. Can the Government say that  since  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came into power, these two journalists  have\r\n\r\nindulged  in  subversive activities detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of the people in order  to  overthrow\r\n\r\nthis  Government? What have these  two  journalists\r\n\r\ndone? They felt that the Ong Eng Guan issue must be\r\n\r\nbrought  to  light. They felt that  since  all  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Press would not want to publish what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim had said, they should try  and\r\n\r\ndo  something at least for the people and let  them\r\n\r\nknow  what is going on. Therefore, their activities\r\n\r\nwere  not prejudicial to the interest of the people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  nor  to  its  security,  but  their\r\n\r\nactivities were prejudicial to the continuation  in\r\n\r\npower of the Government that we have today - and that\r\n\r\nis subversive activity! I think the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nin  his speech, did define subversive activity.

In the Straits Times of 4th\r\n\r\nAugust, 1960, page 5, this is what the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister had to say about subversive activity:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"We had defined subversion before the elections\r\n\r\nand made it quite clear what we meant by that term:\r\n\r\nthat  whether it comes from the Right or  from  the\r\n\r\nLeft,  any  subordination of the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  to  outside  interests   we\r\n\r\nconsider  an  undermining  of  the  authority   and\r\n\r\nintegrity of the State,...\"'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  what had these two reporters been doing? Just\r\n\r\nto  give the Member for Hong Lim an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nhave his words read by a section of the public? Are\r\n\r\nthese  activities  prejudicial to  the  State?  Are\r\n\r\nthese  activities  undermining  the  authority  and\r\n\r\nintegrity of the State? Is this not another way  of\r\n\r\nintimidating the Press and saying, \"Boys, if you do\r\n\r\nnot behave, and do not write what pleases us, watch\r\n\r\nout!\" They said that that placing of the facts, the\r\n\r\nability of their pen to put the words of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim across to a section of the people  is\r\n\r\nsubversion  from  the Right.  And  yet,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said that there is a reorganisation of\r\n\r\nCommunist forces in Singapore. He knows it. He says\r\n\r\nit.  And  therefore he knows how  many  people,  at\r\n\r\nleast  some people who have been reorganising.  Has\r\n\r\nhe  today  told us that he has also detained  these\r\n\r\npeople under the P.P.S.O.? Oh, no, they cannot  do\r\n\r\nthat because they are a democratic government. They\r\n\r\nmust give ground play. And until they are ready  to\r\n\r\nbite,  ah,  then the big sword will be  drawn.  Yet\r\n\r\nthese  two journalists have been detained  under  a\r\n\r\nlaw  which  is  not intended to be used  for  such\r\n\r\npurposes.  The Minister for Culture,  Sir,  as  ex-President  of  the Singapore Union of  Journalists,\r\n\r\nwill  remember the occasion when he came to see  me\r\n\r\nabout  the  detention  of  a  journalist.  We   had\r\n\r\nsatisfactory evidence to detain that  man,  who  is\r\n\r\nnow  the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Minister, when he came to see me, said,\r\n\r\n\"Look, it can be misinterpreted as a destruction of\r\n\r\nthe  freedom  of the Press!\" I took the  course  of\r\n\r\nreleasing this detainee because the freedom of  the\r\n\r\nPress must be maintained   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  all  costs.  The  Singapore  Union   of\r\n\r\nJournalists  has clearly stated in the papers - I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  how it came to be written, but anyway  I\r\n\r\nread it - that the activities of these two people who\r\n\r\nare  detained  are  not subversive  but  only  \"bad\r\n\r\njournalism\".  They said so, I did not  say  it - \"bad\r\n\r\njournalism\". And yet they are still detained  under\r\n\r\nthe P.P.S.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have brought this out in some detail in\r\n\r\norder  to  strengthen my contention that there  has\r\n\r\nbeen suggestive intimidation of the Press, although\r\n\r\nI  cannot  at the present time say that  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  open intimidation. The Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nhas explained the detention of the journalists, and\r\n\r\nalso explained the stand of the Singapore Press not\r\n\r\nto give publicity to the Ong Eng Guan issue. But he\r\n\r\nhas  not explained another allegation made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim. He said that a writer in  the\r\n\r\nSunday  Mail, Huang Tze-chin, was sent for  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and interrogated for four hours. He  did\r\n\r\nnot find it necessary to deny that. But now because\r\n\r\nI   have  taken  the  opportunity  to  remind   the\r\n\r\nMinisters   that  they  have  forgotten   to   deny\r\n\r\nsomething, they suddenly wake up, \"Ah, ha, this  is\r\n\r\na  dangerous thing. It must be denied.\" And I  hope\r\n\r\nsome  chits  may be passed around  to  one  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  who will be quick enough to jump  up  to\r\n\r\nhis feet and deny in categorical terms that such  a\r\n\r\nthing  has happened. That fact has not been  denied\r\n\r\nin  this  House so far by the Minister for Culture,\r\n\r\nunder whose portfolio is propaganda, the Press  and\r\n\r\nthe radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, talking of the anti-colonial struggle\r\n\r\nby  the Government Benchers, the speeches from  the\r\n\r\nother  side brought out one factor, and one  factor\r\n\r\nalone - the  colonial struggle. Even  then  that  has\r\n\r\nalready been stated by the P.A.P. leadership,  and\r\n\r\nwhat did they say about it? It takes some time  to\r\n\r\nlook it up, Sir - the colonial struggle:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"`The present phase of colonial struggle requires\r\n\r\nmore flexible and effective tactics.\"'\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is  so  flexible and effective, Sir, that  they\r\n\r\nhave  granted 100 per cent ownership of a cigarette\r\n\r\nfactory to British capital in Singapore. It  is  so\r\n\r\nflexible  and  effective  that  they,  during   the\r\n\r\nelections, had damned the British and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwanted to throw them into the sea, had gone to  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom to say, \"Tolong-lah,  I  want  some\r\n\r\nmoney\",  and got $65 million. They say,  \"Ha!  What\r\n\r\nare the Americans? Troublesome people!\" And yet the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance is not here today. He is  over\r\n\r\nin  America, begging for money.

He knows how to make a standpipe\r\n\r\nworth  more than a school.\" Therefore, he was  sent\r\n\r\nout,  \"Go,  and fight.\" And they won, Sir,  because\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front at that time was foolish enough -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To take $500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - outside of my presence, to agree\r\n\r\nto  a  pact with them.

Yet, Sir, the Prime Minister  had\r\n\r\nthe  heart, shall we say, the peevish heart to  say\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly, \"That little man was rejected by\r\n\r\nthe  Left-wing adventurers.\" Sir, we  do  not  play\r\n\r\nthat kind of politics. We play clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, the art of denying allegations as\r\n\r\npractised by the P.A.P. Government is to deny  what\r\n\r\ncan  be  denied, and try to forget what  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndenied in the hope that the people will forget. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Mountbatten said  that  the  community\r\n\r\ncentre in Joo Chiat was declared open by a defeated\r\n\r\nP.A.P. candidate. That was not  denied.  But  what\r\n\r\nthey  tried  to  say  was, \"Oh, no.  The  community\r\n\r\ncentre  in  Mountbatten was opened by  our  beloved\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister. He was there because  he  is\r\n\r\ndressed  like we are, and the Opposition would  not\r\n\r\ndare  to  dress  as  we dress. He  mixes  with  the\r\n\r\npeople.  He  goes  around, but  certainly  not  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Mountbatten.

And we need  not\r\n\r\nhave  to say that we are the beloved of the masses.\r\n\r\nAnd  yet when they go about, there are at least two\r\n\r\nbodyguards  going round with them to see  that  the\r\n\r\nmasses  do  not turn round and fight  them.  We  go\r\n\r\nquietly.  We  go wherever we want.

When something is made\r\n\r\nabout  something else, an explanation is made about\r\n\r\nother things, so that the whole thing could be lost\r\n\r\nin a jungle of words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to speak on some important\r\n\r\nmatters  that  are  exercising  the  minds  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Sir, in this House, we are so  used  to\r\n\r\nthe   declaration  of  the  P.A.P.,   \"We   are   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  non-Communist, socialist  Government.\"\r\n\r\nThat  word \"non-Communist\" has been used so  often.\r\n\r\nThey  are  very  fond of declaring that,  at  every\r\n\r\nopportunity, whether in this House or outside. They\r\n\r\nsay, \"We are a democratic, non-Communist, socialist\r\n\r\nParty.\" Sir, I would hesitate to try and teach  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. the  meaning of the word  \"democracy\".  But\r\n\r\nsurely,   Sir,  democracy  itself   is   the   very\r\n\r\nantithesis  of Communism. You cannot be a  democrat\r\n\r\nand  a Communist at the same time. You cannot be  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  and claim to be a democrat at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime. Therefore, there is no earthly reason for the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. if they are real democrats, to say that they\r\n\r\nare non-Communists too. But as I see it, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare  two  very  important reasons which  impel  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  keep  on  repeating  this  word,  \"non-Communist\",  \"non-Communist\",  as  if  it  were   a\r\n\r\nritual.   The  first  reason,  Sir,  is   to   drum\r\n\r\nconsistently into the heads of that section of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. membership described by the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  as  Communists. They want to keep on  drumming\r\n\r\ninto   the  heads  of  this  section  of  Communist\r\n\r\nsympathisers  and activists in the Party  the  word\r\n\r\n\"non-Communist\", so that these people  will  accept\r\n\r\nit  and  keep quiet; so that this section will  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  they should try to run the  collective\r\n\r\nleadership  and  force them to do acts  which  they\r\n\r\ncould not defend. But in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  to  keep this Section quiet, something  must\r\n\r\nhave  been  done. Some concessions could have  been\r\n\r\nmade to this group of people. Therefore, they were\r\n\r\nquiet.  This  group of people in the  P.A.P.,  Sir,\r\n\r\ntogether with what they claimed to be the good work\r\n\r\nof  Mayor  Ong Eng Guan, helped them  to  win  the\r\n\r\nelections.  They are their comrades in  arms.  They\r\n\r\nhave been with them and, as the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nhas  said,  they are still with them.  They  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  that they must satisfy this group of  people,\r\n\r\nand  must satisfy the other group outside. So  they\r\n\r\nsay,  let us use the word \"non-Communist\". It  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  we are anti-Communist. But we  are  non-Communist. Do they not realise that any  action  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government of a Communist character, that  any\r\n\r\nattempt  to implement what this section would  want\r\n\r\nto  see  implemented,  would  result  in  immediate\r\n\r\nreaction  from the Federation and would  result  in\r\n\r\nthe  withdrawal of the Federation from the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council, and might result in a suspension\r\n\r\nof the Constitution?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second reason for repeating this word\r\n\r\n\"non-Communist\"  so  often, as `what  one  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid,  like  a  gramophone record,  is  to  try  to\r\n\r\nreadjust  the minds of the public, who are  already\r\n\r\nconvinced  that there is a section  in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nyesterday  and today who are Communist sympathisers\r\n\r\nand   activists.  And,  therefore,  the  collective\r\n\r\nleadership thinks that by repeating this word \"non-Communist\", \"non-Communist\", \"non-Communist\",  the\r\n\r\npublic  will believe them. The public,  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry to say, do not believe them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why do they not believe that? Why is it not\r\n\r\npossible for the public to believe that there is no\r\n\r\nsection of Communist sympathisers and activists  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.?  It is because of what came  from  the\r\n\r\nvery lips of their ex-comrade, their beloved Mayor,\r\n\r\ntheir  beloved  Minister for National  Development,\r\n\r\nand their beloved Treasurer. He made a statement to\r\n\r\nthe effect that there are Communists in the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nand  no one, not even up till today, has denied the\r\n\r\npresence of that section in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we come to a very important, and\r\n\r\nperhaps world-shaking, issue in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neyes  of  the people of Singapore - merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Sir, merger with the Federation was one\r\n\r\nof  the  important issues promised  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nduring  the last election: everyone was glad  there\r\n\r\nwas   this   realistic  approach  to  bring   about\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic stability  through  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation. But, Sir,  what  do  we  see\r\n\r\ntoday? Not one word in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nSpeech, and not one word about merger in the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's speech. It is true, Sir, that during the\r\n\r\nearly  days of the P.A.P. Government, there were  a\r\n\r\nfew  bleats of merger with the Federation.  But  we\r\n\r\nall  know  that  with every little bleat  came  the\r\n\r\nquick statement from the Federation Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\"No merger.\" And recently, Sir, the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nin  a  Press  statement,  tried  to  lay  down  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  for  the  time when  they,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, will have to admit to  the  electorate\r\n\r\nthat  no merger is possible. And what is the excuse\r\n\r\nthey  used?  The  communal  issue.  The  Federation\r\n\r\nMalays do not trust the Singapore Chinese. Sir, the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government and  the  people  know  that\r\n\r\nthere are Chinese and Chinese. They themselves have\r\n\r\ngiven  citizenship  rights to the  Chinese  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.   What   the  Federation   people   and\r\n\r\nGovernment do not trust is the group of Chinese who\r\n\r\nare  led  by or who may fall easy prey to Communist\r\n\r\nsympathisers  and  activists.  There  has  been  no\r\n\r\ndenial  that  in the P.A.P. there is a  section  of\r\n\r\nsuch evil-doers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, that in the heat of the election\r\n\r\ncampaign last year, the Prime Minister accused  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times of trying to sour relations with  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and  warned that any attempt  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection would immediately result in the detention\r\n\r\nof   the   persons  concerned,  be  they   editors,\r\n\r\nreporters  or  any kind of worker.  They  would  be\r\n\r\ndetained under the P.P.S.O. But there have been two\r\n\r\ninstances  that  have  come  to  light  since  that\r\n\r\nstatement was uttered and that warning issued.  And\r\n\r\nthese  two matters refer to Ministerial statements.\r\n\r\nSir,  when Tunku Abdul Rahman said at the  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nconference  that there was present in Singapore  at\r\n\r\nthat time a Russian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade   delegation,   the  Minister   for   Culture\r\n\r\nimmediately   issued   a  statement   denying   the\r\n\r\nstatement of the Federation Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot understand whether it is the kind\r\n\r\nof  culture that the P.A.P. Government has  that  a\r\n\r\nminor  Minister, be he the Minister for Culture  at\r\n\r\nthat,  should issue a statement denying a statement\r\n\r\nof  a  Prime Minister of the country with which  we\r\n\r\nhope  to achieve merger? And now, Sir, what  do  we\r\n\r\nhear  from the lips of the Prime Minister? In  his\r\n\r\nspeech  he said - and I quote again from the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of August 4, 1960, page 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Do they not know that even the presence of a\r\n\r\nRussian  delegation  to  an  ECAFE  conference   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on small-scale industry was viewed  with\r\n\r\nsuspicion and disfavour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they unaware from Press reports that even the\r\n\r\ngiving  of  a  residence  visa  for  more  than   a\r\n\r\ntransitory  visit  to a Russian representative  had\r\n\r\ncaused excitement and brought opposition?'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lips of the Prime Minister, Sir. It is\r\n\r\nclear  that  the statement of the Federation  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  at that time was materially correct.  And\r\n\r\nyet  the  Minister for Culture had the temerity  to\r\n\r\nissue  a statement to deny what was said, which  is\r\n\r\nnot  said  to be true. What is the impact of,  that\r\n\r\ndenial,  Sir? It almost amounts to saying that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime Minister was a  liar.  Who  then,\r\n\r\nSir,   is   trying  to  sour  relations  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation? Is the Prime Minister going to put  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture under  detention  under  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.?  Or  does his collective leadership  mean\r\n\r\nthat  they accept the collective responsibility  of\r\n\r\nsouring relations with the Federation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another instance which I would like\r\n\r\nto  mention here, because it has been said in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Sir, we read in the Press recently  that\r\n\r\nfour  federations of unions had been  deregistered,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the Internal Security Council. I  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  under the Constitution such matters  do\r\n\r\nnot come under the Internal Security Council. And I\r\n\r\ndare  say  that this de-registration did not  issue\r\n\r\nfrom  the Internal Security Council at all. Is this\r\n\r\na method used by the P.A.P. to try to hoodwink\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  Communist  sympathisers and extremists  that\r\n\r\nwhat  they  themselves  do  in  the  discharge   of\r\n\r\ninternal security is not what they themselves  want\r\n\r\nto  do but that they have been told to do? Sir, the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  this  act  rests  squarely   on   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government, and this  Government  claims\r\n\r\nthat  it is a strong and responsible Government.  I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore ask them if, they are  strong  and\r\n\r\nresponsible, to tell the truth. But here they do an\r\n\r\nact  which is not pleasing to a certain section  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. membership. Sir, is it fair to bring in\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council on a matter that does\r\n\r\nnot  affect them? And is it fair to bring  this  in\r\n\r\nespecially  when  the Federation Government  has  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  in it as a member? Would  not  that\r\n\r\nsour relations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  was  so carried  away  when  he  was\r\n\r\nreplying to the Member for Hong Lim on the question\r\n\r\nof, merger.  He said - and I must quote,  Sir,  from\r\n\r\nshorthand notes - that the P.A.P. are not out to seek\r\n\r\nhonours  and titles from the Federation  Government\r\n\r\nlike the ex-Chief Minister -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Tun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - who has been made a Tun. Sir,\r\n\r\nit is typical of them. Here is a Government anxious\r\n\r\nto  achieve merger with a country and yet  ridicule\r\n\r\nthe  orders  of that country. That is the  type  of\r\n\r\nmentality  we  have of a Government that  wants  to\r\n\r\nachieve merger in the interests of the people  they\r\n\r\ngovern  and yet ridicule that Government. \"Tun  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock!\"  These  are  the  men  who  have  been\r\n\r\nentrusted  with the duty of achieving  merger  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. Surely, they know, Sir, that I  am\r\n\r\nvery  proud today of being a Tun of the Federation,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  means,  in simple words,  that  I,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  am trusted and loved by the  people  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation.  Not like these  people  who  are\r\n\r\ndistrusted  and  could  never  be  loved   by   the\r\n\r\nFederation. And yet they want to achieve merger. It\r\n\r\nis  better for them to come out straight away  now\r\n\r\nand  say, \"Sorry, boys, no merger because we do not\r\n\r\nhave enough culture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we come to the claim of the Government\r\n\r\nin the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech,  about  the  relations  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  I  quote from col. 6 of  the  Hansard,\r\n\r\nVolume 13, No. 1 of 20th July, 1960, which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With regard to the Federation of Malaya, the\r\n\r\ndanger  then  was that the Federation might  pursue\r\n\r\npolicies  which  did  not  take  into  account  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate interests of Singapore. This danger  was\r\n\r\nhappily averted. On major matters of financial  and\r\n\r\neconomic  policy,  the two Governments  have  taken\r\n\r\npains  to  carry out mutual consultations. Examples\r\n\r\nof  these are the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill,  the\r\n\r\nnew  Currency  Agreement, fiscal proposals  over  a\r\n\r\nbroad  field  and, last but not least, the  current\r\n\r\ntalks on the Common Commodity Market.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote the two opening sentences again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With regard to the Federation of Malaya, the\r\n\r\ndanger  then  was that the Federation might  pursue\r\n\r\npolicies  which  did  not  take  into  account  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate interests of Singapore. This danger  was\r\n\r\nhappily averted.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  it  has never been averted, and it cannot  be\r\n\r\naverted  so long as this Government stick to  their\r\n\r\npolicy  of  a democratic, non-Communist,  socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya  while  at  the same time  having  in  their\r\n\r\nmembership a section of Communist sympathisers  and\r\n\r\nactivists. But then they introduce a certain  claim\r\n\r\nto  prove that the crisis has been averted. Let  us\r\n\r\nexamine  this  claim.  The Income  Tax  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nOrdinance - it  was inevitable that there  should  be\r\n\r\njoint  consultations  between the  two  Governments\r\n\r\nbecause the Income Tax law is pan-Malayan.  On  the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Agreement,  this  was  reached  by   the\r\n\r\nprevious   Government  and  not   by   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  it  is  hoped,  Sir,   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not do anything to jeopardise  the\r\n\r\ncontinuation of this Currency Agreement. In  regard\r\n\r\nto fiscal proposals over\r\n\r\na  broad field, Sir, this means nothing. It means,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  a currency agreement,  therefore\r\n\r\nthere  must  be  agreement  on  general  and  broad\r\n\r\nprinciple. Let us now see what they say  about  the\r\n\r\ncommon commodity market. Yes, talks are still going\r\n\r\non,  and we would like to know when these talks can\r\n\r\nbe  reported to this Assembly and when these  talks\r\n\r\nwill bear fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so much news has been made by the Government\r\n\r\nof the presence of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council in our Constitution  that\r\n\r\nI  feel  that,  as  leader of the  delegation  that\r\n\r\nbrought  about the new Constitution, I must present\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Council to the people in its\r\n\r\nproper perspective. Sir, paragraph 24 of the Report\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Constitutional Conference held in\r\n\r\nLondon  in  March and April 1957, Sessional  Paper,\r\n\r\nNo. Misc. 2 of 1957, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Her Majesty's Government indicated that it was\r\n\r\ntheir  intention  that the new Constitution  should\r\n\r\nconfer upon Singapore Ministers full responsibility\r\n\r\nfor   maintaining  internal  law  and   order   and\r\n\r\npreventing subversion.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, from this paragraph that\r\n\r\nSingapore  Ministers have full  responsibility  for\r\n\r\nmaintaining   law   and   order   and    preventing\r\n\r\nsubversion.  Sir,  section  65  of  the   Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, that is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Gazette  Supplement  No.  81  of   27th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1958, clearly lays down the functions  of\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Council shall have the following functions,\r\n\r\nthat is to say -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to consult together on all questions of\r\n\r\npolicy  relating  to the maintenance  of  public\r\n\r\nsafety and public order in Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to maintain the efficiency of all organs of\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Singapore which are concerned\r\n\r\nwith internal security;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to ensure equal access by the Governments of\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  and of  Singapore  to  the\r\n\r\nservices   of  the  said  organs  and   to   all\r\n\r\ninformation at the disposal of those organs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means, Sir, that the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  is a kind of referee to see that  law  and\r\n\r\norder  is  properly maintained by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment, and that effective steps are  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government to prevent subversion.  So\r\n\r\nlong as the Government is strong and discharges its\r\n\r\nduties  and responsibilities vis-a-vis the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council in the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  everything is rosy,  and  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council sits back happy  and  contented.\r\n\r\nWhat  gave  birth to the Internal Security  Council\r\n\r\nwere two factors that had to be resolved during the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  in  London.  What  if  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  turned out to be a weak Government  and\r\n\r\nvacillated in its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull responsibility for internal security? What  if\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government turned out to  be  a  bad\r\n\r\nGovernment   refusing   to  discharge   the   full\r\n\r\nresponsibility for internal security to protect the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people of Singapore? So,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  either of these two eventualities,  it\r\n\r\nwas   agreed  that  section  66  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)  Order in Council. 1958, would  be\r\n\r\nbrought into play. I will just quote paragraph (1),\r\n\r\nbecause  the  whole  section  is  so  detailed  and\r\n\r\nparagraph (1) will give the meaning that I want  to\r\n\r\nput across to this Assembly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"66.-(1) It shall be competent to the Council to\r\n\r\nmake  decisions for the maintenance of the internal\r\n\r\nsecurity of Singapore or for the due performance of\r\n\r\nthe  functions  conferred on it  by  the  preceding\r\n\r\nsection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, this section will only come into force when we\r\n\r\nhave  a  weak  Government or when  we  have  a  bad\r\n\r\nGovernment. But the P.A.P. proudly boasts that  it\r\n\r\nis  a strong and responsible Government. Therefore,\r\n\r\nif  they  are  indeed strong and responsible,  then\r\n\r\nthey  must accept full responsibility for  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  They must accept, without qualification,\r\n\r\nthe  continued  detention of all those  that  were\r\n\r\ndetained  by  the  previous  Government  under  the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance, and  all\r\n\r\nfuture detentions under the P.P.S.O. are their full\r\n\r\nresponsibility if they claim that they are a strong\r\n\r\nand  responsible Government. Why then, Sir, if they\r\n\r\nare  a strong and responsible Government, bring  in\r\n\r\nthe  Internal  Security Council to explain  away  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of things that are confusing the  minds  of\r\n\r\nthe people? Why then bring in the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil to explain away the continued detention  of\r\n\r\nCommunist  sympathisers  and  activists  under  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.? They are always claiming, as I have said,\r\n\r\nSir,  that they do not lack courage and they  never\r\n\r\nlack  courage. Then I would ask them, Sir, to pluck\r\n\r\nup  sufficient courage to declare that they  accept\r\n\r\nfull responsibility for the continued detention  of\r\n\r\nthose  people  who  are  comrades-in-arms  of  that\r\n\r\nsection  of the P.A.P. described by the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  as  Communist. Perhaps,  Sir,  there  is\r\n\r\nanother reason why the Government makes use of  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council. Is the collective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleadership  playing  a game with  that  section  of\r\n\r\nCommunist sympathisers and activists in the P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nAnd  is  the collective leadership playing, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  another game with the  British?  This\r\n\r\nlooks to me, Sir, like a double game: one game here\r\n\r\nand  one  game there. We know, Sir, that  a  double\r\n\r\ngame generally ends in a double cross. Sir, how is\r\n\r\nthis double game played?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Poker!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is a very simple matter, Sir.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  require  much  intelligence  but  it\r\n\r\nrequires  a  lot of agility. Tell that  section  of\r\n\r\nCommunist sympathisers and activists in the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\n\"Boys,  this  Constitution  does  not  give   full\r\n\r\npowers.  The  Internal Security  Council  is  still\r\n\r\nhere.  The great colonial master is still here.  If\r\n\r\nyou  behave and be quiet and if you have belief and\r\n\r\ntrust  in the collective leadership, then  we  will\r\n\r\nsee  to it that your comrades are returned to your\r\n\r\nloving arms.\" And to the British, \"Oh, British,  we\r\n\r\nthe collective leadership are playing this game for\r\n\r\nkeeps.  Please, it is a dangerous game. We  believe\r\n\r\nthat  these  Communist sympathisers  and  activists\r\n\r\nmust  be detained. If they are released, there will\r\n\r\nbe  a  conflagration. But you know that  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  comrades of ours to whom at least  we  owe  a\r\n\r\ndebt  of  gratitude  for helping  us  to  win  the'\r\n\r\nelections and we must keep them quiet.\" \"Can I say,\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Council,  boleh-kah?\"  And  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is, \"Go ahead.\" And therefore the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council is brought in to explain  away  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility that should be fully discharged by a\r\n\r\nGovernment   that   claims   to   be   strong   and\r\n\r\nresponsible. They say. Sir, \"On one side,  we  have\r\n\r\nthe Communists -\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

They\r\n\r\nwill not duck but they will be dead ducks. The game\r\n\r\nof the Internal Security Council is puzzling us all\r\n\r\nhere.  I  have a worried feeling for the collective\r\n\r\nleadership, because it may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot be improbable, Sir, that the final words of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture may turn out to be true. In an\r\n\r\nattack on the Member for Hong Lim, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture   ended  by  saying,  \"May  his   Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers have mercy on his soul when they decide\r\n\r\nthat  they have had enough of him.\" Sir, if I could\r\n\r\nhave the permission of the Minister for Culture  to\r\n\r\nsubstitute  some words, I would like to  say,  \"May\r\n\r\nthe  Communist section in the P.A.P. have mercy  on\r\n\r\nthe  souls  of the collective leadership  when  the\r\n\r\nCommunist section decide that they have had  enough\r\n\r\nof that collective leadership.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is an open secret that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment is pursuing a policy vis-a-vis Communist\r\n\r\nsympathisers and activists of trying  to  win  them\r\n\r\nover  to the cause of democracy. They say that  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the previous Government was wrong;  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  taking the war into the Communist  camp\r\n\r\nwas  wrong and did not pay dividends, and that this\r\n\r\naction  resulted in the downfall of the Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what is most necessary is to try to  win\r\n\r\nthem    over   to   the   democratic - hence,    non-Communist - socialist way of life. And they say  that\r\n\r\nbecause  the  previous  Government  had  taken  the\r\n\r\naction of mass arrests under the P.P.S.O. they  had\r\n\r\nbrought  out antagonism in the hearts and minds  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. Sir, what was the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do at the height of the  riots  and\r\n\r\ncivil  commotion? To surrender, or to play a  game?\r\n\r\nThis,  the  previous Government was not capable  of\r\n\r\ndoing.  So  the P.A.P. Government has,  during  the\r\n\r\nlast  14  months, to try this policy out. But  from\r\n\r\none.  Sir, who knows the game and its consequences,\r\n\r\nI  say  that  their policy of trying  to  win  over\r\n\r\nCommunist sympathisers and activists to their cause\r\n\r\nis  a  foolish policy, for the Communists are  past\r\n\r\nmasters  in  the  art  of  making  use  of  people.\r\n\r\nparticularly  people who are  fond  of  power,  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own ends, while at the same time giving  the\r\n\r\nfalse  notion to the people they use that they  are\r\n\r\nbeing  used by such people. They have had 14 months\r\n\r\nof trying it out, and the statement of the Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly  a  few  days  ago  is  an  open\r\n\r\nadmission that that line did not pay dividends.  He\r\n\r\nhas  now warned the country that Communist elements\r\n\r\nare  reorganising and are trying to  recapture  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement. Sir,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's Speech did not give an indication of  this\r\n\r\npotential  danger, but the Prime  Minister  had  to\r\n\r\ndisclose  it. It could be, Sir, that when the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara's Speech was being prepared,  it\r\n\r\nhad  been  hoped that the Ong Eng Guan issue  might\r\n\r\nnot  have  reached  such a magnitude  as  to  cause\r\n\r\ndismay to the Government and force them to tell the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  to make such a statement.  He  has\r\n\r\nmade it. It came as a bombshell to many of us,  but\r\n\r\nit did not come as a bombshell to me because I knew\r\n\r\nsomething  like  this was going to happen.  It  has\r\n\r\nhappened.  But  in that statement on the  Communist\r\n\r\nthreat,  the  Prime Minister had, in my submission,\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  statement which is not  correct.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that Communist forces had \"scattered and gone\r\n\r\nundercover before the last elections.\" I  disagree,\r\n\r\nSir. I  cannot  accept  that statement.  Communist\r\n\r\nsympathisers  and activists had not  scattered  and\r\n\r\nhad  not  gone undercover. They were  out  in  full\r\n\r\nforce  working against the Government, and  helping\r\n\r\nin  a  big way to bring victory to this Government;\r\n\r\nthis so-called democratic, non-Communist, socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I further touch on the statement of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister on the danger ahead.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike - the  Minister is staring at me in the  face - to\r\n\r\nsay a little bit that is not connected with what  I\r\n\r\nhave  been saying. The Minister for Labour and Law,\r\n\r\nI think it was, charged the Member for Hong Lim, in\r\n\r\nhis  capacity as Minister for National Development,\r\n\r\nfor giving a Press interview, which reads like this\r\n\r\nin  the  Straits  Times  of 19th  September,  1959,\r\n\r\nheadlined,  `$415 million to be spent in  the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years.  Beaming Minister Ong said,  \"We  have\r\n\r\nworked  hard  on  this plan.\"  And  now,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Law says,  \"We  have  not\r\n\r\nauthorised that statement, and when we charged  our\r\n\r\ncolleague, he said it was a leak\". But let us  look\r\n\r\nat this paper,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, front page news and back page news - they corner\r\n\r\nthe  market as far as front and back page news  are\r\n\r\nconcerned. Back page - who is this man? Ah, ha, he is\r\n\r\nthe  Premier. \"Big Housing Scheme\" to  cover  1,160\r\n\r\nacres  of Government land. Is this not a Government\r\n\r\nstatement?  What  is all this? The Prime  Minister:\r\n\r\n\"Yes,  my picture must be in also.\" All right,  his\r\n\r\npicture was in. And now he says, \"No, no, we  never\r\n\r\ndid  it. It was Ong Eng Guan. We never said such  a\r\n\r\nthing.\" I do not know what is the truth, but  there\r\n\r\nis the Straits Times\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to them a colonial paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the world-shaking pronouncement\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister. For the first time, we  are\r\n\r\ntold  in  this  House  of the  impending  Communist\r\n\r\nthreat - there has been a Communist build-up over the\r\n\r\nlast  14 months. As I have said, there has been  no\r\n\r\nsuch  pronouncement in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nSpeech. The day the speech became public, everybody\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Wonderful.  Everything is  fine.\"  But  now\r\n\r\nafter  the bombshell has been dropped, everyone  is\r\n\r\nlooking around and saying, \"My God! I have promised\r\n\r\nto bring in money here. I had better take it out. I\r\n\r\nam  not  going  to  stay here anymore.  Trouble  is\r\n\r\ncoming.\" Sir, the fact that the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\ninformed   this  House  and  the  public   of   the\r\n\r\nseriousness of this threat is a credit  to  him,  a\r\n\r\ngreat credit to him in this regard - that he wants to\r\n\r\nfight  them.  He  means  to fight  those  Communist\r\n\r\nsympathisers  and activists, and in this  fight  we\r\n\r\nare  with him. But why did he keep quiet until now?\r\n\r\nWhy  did he wait for 14 months to come out and say,\r\n\r\n\"There has been a Communist build-up\"? Sir, in this\r\n\r\nfight against Communist underground activity, every\r\n\r\none  who loves his country must join in, and we  in\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition pledge our full support. But  there\r\n\r\nare  a  few  matters which we would like  to  place\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Government for serious consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Government has done certain foolish things, and\r\n\r\nthese  they  have admitted. They have done  certain\r\n\r\nfoolish things -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mistakes, not foolish things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - wittingly or unwittingly,\r\n\r\nthereby  strengthening the other side. It is  quite\r\n\r\nhuman,  Sir,  to make mistakes, and the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  declared that it will rectify those  mistakes.\r\n\r\nAnd  therefore  the sincerity of the Government  in\r\n\r\nthis  rectification programme will be  put  to  the\r\n\r\ntest before the real issue comes up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say in this House that it was a grave\r\n\r\nmistake   to   create   the  posts   of   Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  and  to  give  jobs  those  detainees\r\n\r\nreleased  by  the Government before taking  office.\r\n\r\nWhat  did  the Government hope to achieve by  this?\r\n\r\nOffer  them  $1,100-jobs so that  they  would  keep\r\n\r\nquiet  and  not open their mouths? Or,  offer  them\r\n\r\nthese  jobs  and if they accept they  would  become\r\n\r\ndiscredited in the eyes of their comrades by  their\r\n\r\nacceptance of this personal advantage at the  price\r\n\r\nof  silence?  Does the Minister for  Finance,  that\r\n\r\nvery  able  man, require a Political  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nadvise  him?  He  knows, and it is  known  to  many\r\n\r\npeople too, that there is no love lost between  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance and his Political  Secretary,\r\n\r\nand  that the Political Secretary is seldom in  his\r\n\r\noffice.  And yet there is a Political Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance! It is not only a foolish\r\n\r\nmistake,  but a grave mistake. Again, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law has a Political Commissar in his\r\n\r\noffice  overseeing his work. Sir, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for  Labour  and  Law,\r\n\r\nbefore  taking office, took an oath of secrecy  and\r\n\r\nyet   sits   outside  the  office.  The   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary,  who does not have to take  an  oath  of\r\n\r\nsecrecy,  sits in the same room with  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour and Law. Is the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw  put  on  good behaviour? And is the  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary given all eyes and ears to see  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister does behave?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not visited the other Ministries, and\r\n\r\nso I cannot say what is going on there. But I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  this:  that these detainees - I  would\r\n\r\nclarify by saying that some of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetainees  are  not  qualified for  appointment  as\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries who, in our view, are nothing\r\n\r\nbut  Political Commissars. A grave mistake. If they\r\n\r\nreally  mean to fight the Communist threat that  is\r\n\r\nmounting  up  in  strength, I say, \"They  have  the\r\n\r\nenemy  inside.\"  Can they fight it?  Is  there  any\r\n\r\nsincerity when they declare they will fight it when\r\n\r\nthe  enemy  is  tolerated in their  camp?  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  ask the Government to make  their  fight\r\n\r\neasier - and  they  will  fight,  I  know  they  will\r\n\r\nfight - by  removing all those Political  Secretaries\r\n\r\nwho have shown by their actions during the past  14\r\n\r\nmonths to be unworthy and disloyal to the Party and\r\n\r\nto the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would ask Government to ponder, and to\r\n\r\nponder  well  before  they  reintroduce  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Bill. Certain major amendments will have  to\r\n\r\nhe   made,  if  they  do  not  want  to  create   a\r\n\r\nFrankenstein that will destroy them at the critical\r\n\r\nhour.   Sir,  there  must  be  a  reason  for   His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  withholding\r\n\r\nhis  assent to this Bill. There is nothing  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  that  gives power  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to withhold assent to a Bill of this\r\n\r\ncharacter. It could have been on the advice of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  that  they  wanted  time  for  more\r\n\r\nthought. It is good. I would ask them to spend  not\r\n\r\nonly  more thought, but still more thought, on  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement. They claim and say that  the\r\n\r\nCommunist underground movement is working up in the\r\n\r\ntrade  union field. But they claim that  they  have\r\n\r\ngot  the movement under non-Communist control. Sir,\r\n\r\nas   a   trade   unionist,  I  have  this   unhappy\r\n\r\nfeeling - the Government is losing out in  its  fight\r\n\r\nwith  the  Communists  in the  trade  union  field.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since the Bill has not been assented to.\r\n\r\nand  since a new Bill has to be introduced, I would\r\n\r\nask  the Government to reassess the position,  make\r\n\r\nmajor  amendments to the Bill, and to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere is no danger of the Communists capturing this\r\n\r\nmassive organisation, the workers' organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we come to the Work Brigade.

I  say in all sincerity that the Opposition\r\n\r\nwill   join   in   this  fight  against   Communist\r\n\r\nsubversion.  But I have pointed out that  the  only\r\n\r\nway to get the Opposition and the people behind the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to  see  that  they  make   certain\r\n\r\nrectifications in the Government and in the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking about the Work Brigade before the\r\n\r\ntea  break.  The  Work  Brigade,  Sir,  is  another\r\n\r\npossible  source of danger. If the allegation  made\r\n\r\nby the Member for Hong Lim is true, that members of\r\n\r\nthe  Work Brigade were used by the P.A.P. to  cheer\r\n\r\ntheir  Ministers and Assemblymen during the opening\r\n\r\nof  this  second session of the Assembly, and  that\r\n\r\nthey had not responded as anticipated, then, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsay another Frankenstein has been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the deliberate creation of a P.A.P. force of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre leaders may be another source  of\r\n\r\ndanger. The loyalty of these leaders may not be  to\r\n\r\nthe  collective leadership when put  to  the  test,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  fight comes out into the open. They  may\r\n\r\nnot  be a force that the Government anticipate that\r\n\r\nthis  P.A.P. group  of leaders  in  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most important point is that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmust cleanse itself. I know how difficult it is for\r\n\r\nany organisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  that  matter  to  rid  itself  of  undesirable\r\n\r\npeople,  especially when a debt is  owing  to  such\r\n\r\npeople.  But the interest of the country should  be\r\n\r\nplaced  above  all things, above  Party  and  above\r\n\r\nGovernment.  And  if the P.A.P. leaders  have  the\r\n\r\nwill, the desire, the integrity and the honesty - and\r\n\r\nI know they have - then purge the P.A.P. from within.\r\n\r\nDo  not  allow this group of Communist sympathisers\r\n\r\nand  activists remaining in the Party to  become  a\r\n\r\nsore  and a danger to the Party, to become a  focus\r\n\r\nof  attention of those who are not for the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nbecause  the threat is genuine, as has been uttered\r\n\r\nby the Prime Minister. We on this side of the House\r\n\r\nwould like to see the P.A.P. strengthen itself  and\r\n\r\nget  rid of that group of people which is a  source\r\n\r\nof danger to them in the fight that is to come. Get\r\n\r\nrid  of  them. They will then have the  respect  of\r\n\r\neverybody in Singapore, including the admiration of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing I would ask the P.A.P. not to\r\n\r\nkeep on doing. Do not continue to be arrogant,  and\r\n\r\nthink  that they are the ones entrusted by God,  by\r\n\r\nthe  people  of this country, to guide the  destiny\r\n\r\nand  the interest of the people of Singapore. There\r\n\r\nis  greatness in humility, there never is greatness\r\n\r\nin  greatness itself. Learn how to be humble. Learn\r\n\r\nhow to appreciate, in this big fight that faces the\r\n\r\nGovernment today, that the effort of each and every\r\n\r\none - man,  woman and child, P.A.P. and non-P.A.P. - is\r\n\r\nnecessary to wipe out this threat. I repeat  again.\r\n\r\nI  pledge  the resources of the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nin this fight ahead. But I would ask the Government\r\n\r\nto come clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had thought of pointing out a few more\r\n\r\nstatements  in the speeches made by the Members  on\r\n\r\nthe  other side. But because of the seriousness  of\r\n\r\nthis threat of Communist subversion, I feel that  I\r\n\r\nshould  end my speech on this serious tone. Let  us\r\n\r\nall get together, genuine democrats and socialists.\r\n\r\nDo  not  call ourselves non-Communist. If  you  are\r\n\r\ndemocrats,  you are not Communists.  Democrats  and\r\n\r\nsocialists fight against this Communist subversion,\r\n\r\nwhich, if not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchecked, will soon not only swallow the P.A.P. but\r\n\r\nalso this side of the House. It may mean the end of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. So if we want to preserve what  we all love, let us forget this non-Communist\r\n\r\ndeclaration.  Let us come out together  and  fight,\r\n\r\nbut fight with a clean Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion  in\r\n\r\nthe name of the Prime Minister to thank the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  Government at the opening  of  the\r\n\r\npresent session of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is always a subject of controversy in\r\n\r\nany country even where it has to deal with one race\r\n\r\nand  one  language.  The problem  of  education  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,    therefore,    is    rendered     more\r\n\r\ncontroversial    because   of   the   multi-racial\r\n\r\ncharacter of our people and the acceptance  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  equal treatment for the  four  language\r\n\r\nstreams of education which are at different  stages\r\n\r\nof development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first year of the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nGovernment, the difficult task of re-organising the\r\n\r\nlegacy  of  a  colonial system of  education  to  a\r\n\r\nnational  system of education had to be undertaken.\r\n\r\nAlmost  every  aspect of education,  from  Primary,\r\n\r\nSecondary, University, Teachers' Training College,\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and Adult Education, was ca1led upon to\r\n\r\nface  the new situation arising out of our  changed\r\n\r\npolitical   status.  For  with  responsible   self-government  in our hands, we cannot pass  the  buck\r\n\r\nwhen  errors are committed. We must have the  moral\r\n\r\ncourage  to face issues boldly, not run  away  from\r\n\r\nthem  like  the  Member for Hong Lim,  who  is  not\r\n\r\npresent, and in its place shout empty slogans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a sad and sorry exhibition to' see the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim carry under his arm volumes  of\r\n\r\nHansard,  quoting from them, in extenso, statements\r\n\r\nmade  by the Prime Minister' when he was the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar in the last Assembly. The manner\r\n\r\nin which the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nread  excerpts and extracts made us feel as  if  he\r\n\r\nwas  responsible for those brave words in the fight\r\n\r\nagainst  colonialism. What is sad is  that  he  was\r\n\r\nunable  to appreciate what one says as a Member  of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition, and what one is expected to do  as\r\n\r\na  Member  of  the Government. In the case  of  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution,  the  People's  Action  Party\r\n\r\nGovernment decided that they would act the role  of\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition  to  expose  and  bring  about   a\r\n\r\nbreakdown of the Rendel Constitution. But when  the\r\n\r\nnew  Constitution  came into  being,  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party decided that they would have a  five-year policy programme, and that they would tight in\r\n\r\norder  to  win  and  to work the constitution,  The\r\n\r\nMember   for   Hong  Lim  was  given  a   wonderful\r\n\r\nopportunity   to   see  how   he   would   perform.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  he  failed  miserably,   and   just\r\n\r\nshouting slogans will get nobody anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably, in the past, he carried on a\r\n\r\nwhispering  campaign, which were verbal  statements\r\n\r\npassed privately. It is just as well that now  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  a  Member  of the Opposition,  he  will  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to freedom of expression in the  Assembly\r\n\r\nto   make  statements  which  would  be  challenged\r\n\r\nbecause   they   were   based   on   terminological\r\n\r\ninexactitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it go on record, Sir, that every statement\r\n\r\nmade which has not the backing of evidence will  be\r\n\r\nrecorded to be untrue. It is all very well to  read\r\n\r\nromantic histories like the Three Kingdoms or  even\r\n\r\nthe  Rake's  Progress,  but people  who  read  such\r\n\r\nstories  or such legendary histories should realise\r\n\r\nthat  they are reading them and should not  attempt\r\n\r\nto  emulate  the heroes who are mentioned  in  such\r\n\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage of his speech, the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  had  the temerity to suggest that  an  article\r\n\r\nappearing  under  the  name  of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  was  not  written by him but  by  somebody\r\n\r\nelse.  Surely this is a thing which members of  the\r\n\r\nworld's Press would laugh at because, although  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture is a very modest man,  he  has\r\n\r\ngreat attainments. Perhaps the Member for Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nis not sufficiently well read to realise that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  of  the short stories written by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture, when he was a journalist, is included\r\n\r\nin  the volume known as the World's Best 100  Short\r\n\r\nStories.  I  challenge the Member for Hong  Lim  to\r\n\r\nwrite  something  which is worthy of  inclusion  in\r\n\r\nprint. He wondered why the local papers would  only\r\n\r\nprint  500  words of what he had to say  at  public\r\n\r\nmeetings.  He should know the reason  that  it  was\r\n\r\nbecause editors felt that the majority of his words\r\n\r\nwere only fit for the wastepaper basket. Members of\r\n\r\nthe  public  have  for quite some  time  considered\r\n\r\npolitics  a dirty game. I suggest that the  tactics\r\n\r\nadopted by the Member for Hong Lim will make  such\r\n\r\nsuggestion seem true, but Members on this  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House are trying their best to tell the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that politics can be a clean game  if\r\n\r\nyou  have  integrity  both  in  principles  and  in\r\n\r\nbehaviour. Since the Member for Aljunied is in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and  he  has  made his  maiden  speech  last\r\n\r\nevening,  it  is,  I  think, necessary  for  me  to\r\n\r\ndisabuse  what he has said - that he was  making  his\r\n\r\nmaiden speech as a Member of the Opposition because\r\n\r\nhe  had had no freedom of speech when he was on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bench.  This is typical  of  the  wild\r\n\r\nstatements which the expelled members of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  been  guilty  of  for  some  time.  We  pride\r\n\r\nourselves on being a disciplined Party.  If  during\r\n\r\nthe  period  that  the Member for  Aljunied  was  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the People's Action Party he failed  for\r\n\r\nsome  reason or other to attend meetings  at  which\r\n\r\nthe Backbenchers were called upon to do their share\r\n\r\nof  speaking, then we cannot be blamed nor can  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister or the Leader of the House be blamed\r\n\r\nthat  he  had not been given a chance. It  is  more\r\n\r\ncorrect   to   say   that   he   had   evaded   his\r\n\r\nresponsibility. In fact, it perhaps shows his  true\r\n\r\ncolours,  that  he was not prepared to  accept  the\r\n\r\ncollective leadership of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I will miss out the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  by  commenting  about  him  too.  He  made\r\n\r\ncertain  statements  at the  Badminton  Hall  rally\r\n\r\nreferring to what I had done. Here again,  if  only\r\n\r\nhe had got his facts right. I would have nothing to\r\n\r\nsay. But I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like him to keep making statements  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  have  them  on  record,  and  we   shall\r\n\r\nchallenge them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the Member for Aljunied was\r\n\r\nindeed   pathetic.   Every  time   there   was   an\r\n\r\ninterruption,  it was just like the playing  of  an\r\n\r\nold  gramophone record - not the modern one - where you\r\n\r\nhad  to  lift up the needle and if you put it  back\r\n\r\ntoo  far  in  front, then you had  the  same  thing\r\n\r\nplayed back a second or third or fourth time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say that the three expelled members\r\n\r\nof  the People's Action Party could be regarded  as\r\n\r\ncancerous  limbs  which  have  been  amputated  and\r\n\r\nthrown  across to the Opposition for better or  for\r\n\r\nworse.  The  People's  Action  Party  is  healthier\r\n\r\nwithout these three cancerous fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Tanglin, I say that every\r\n\r\nsection of the Ministry of Education is active, not\r\n\r\njust the Complaints Section. As the principal of  a\r\n\r\nschool  he  has the responsibility of administering\r\n\r\ncorporal punishment on naughty boys with a rod, but\r\n\r\nif  he  chooses to maintain discipline  by  quoting\r\n\r\nchapter and verse from the Bible and the boys still\r\n\r\nremain  naughty, then evidently he has  not  prayed\r\n\r\nhard  enough.  Only two aspects of  education  have\r\n\r\nbeen left somewhat alone during the last year, i.e.\r\n\r\nkindergartens and private schools, which only cater\r\n\r\nfor   a   small   minority  of   the   school-going\r\n\r\npopulation,   being  13,000  in   all   (6,000   in\r\n\r\nkindergartens  and  7,000 in  private  schools)  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with the large mass of 340,000 pupils  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  Government-aided schools.  We  do,\r\n\r\nhowever,  look  into  complaints  when  lodged   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of kindergartens and private schools,  and\r\n\r\nwe  shall reorganise these too, in good time,  when\r\n\r\nthe larger issues on education have been resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan raised the\r\n\r\nquestion of religious education in Malay schools. I\r\n\r\nwish  to  say that whatever religious education  is\r\n\r\nbeing conducted in Malay schools it is going on  as\r\n\r\nbefore: but the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis having this subject under serious study and I am\r\n\r\nnot in a position yet to make a statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only natural that during a period of\r\n\r\nreorganisation,  a  certain amount  of  unhappiness\r\n\r\nwill arise, especially from those accustomed to the\r\n\r\ncolonial  way of life and privileges, and who,  sad\r\n\r\nto  say, are still living with \"blinkers\" on,  like\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin. The return to the five-day\r\n\r\nweek,  the  return of the variable allowances,  the\r\n\r\nreturn  to the good old days of colonialism.  Fancy\r\n\r\nthe   suggestion  that  the  six-day  week  is  not\r\n\r\ncompatible with local climatic conditions!  Is  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin suggesting that  in  the  hot,\r\n\r\ntorrid climate of Singapore there should be just  a\r\n\r\none-day  week  so that teachers and principals  can\r\n\r\nrest  for  the  next  six  days,  and  Sundays  for\r\n\r\nprayers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I have never said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> No, I am saying that the Member\r\n\r\nmight suggest it would be a wonderful Utopia.  Does\r\n\r\nhe  realise that in Japan, where the literacy  rate\r\n\r\nis  almost 95 to 99 per cent, teachers have to  put\r\n\r\nin  44 hours a week? To such people, the burden  of\r\n\r\nnation-building, which would involve some  personal\r\n\r\nsacrifice  on  their  part, must  appear  not  only\r\n\r\nirritable  but  must be resisted with:  less  work.\r\n\r\nSome have gone to the extent of resignation, but  a\r\n\r\nnumber have since withdrawn their hasty letters  of\r\n\r\nresignation  and gone back to their desks.  On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  we  are  glad to see that the  majority  of\r\n\r\nteachers  have come out well during this  difficult\r\n\r\nyear  of adjustment, and the outlook for the future\r\n\r\nshould  be good. If I may make an analogy, what  we\r\n\r\nhave  been able to achieve in education during  the\r\n\r\npast  year was like changing the course of a  river\r\n\r\nby  diverting  the waters through land,  previously\r\n\r\nuntouched by water, so as to irrigate it for useful\r\n\r\npurpose and to find its proper outlet to sea  at  a\r\n\r\nspot  we want it. In this process, those accustomed\r\n\r\nto  drawing  their water from the old river  course\r\n\r\nwould  naturally grumble over their loss of supply,\r\n\r\nwhilst  others would resist and grumble over having\r\n\r\nto give up their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland  and  property which will now be under  water,\r\n\r\nbeing  in the path of the new course of the  river.\r\n\r\nIt  is an accomplished fact that the course of  the\r\n\r\nriver of education has been changed and the scenery\r\n\r\nis  different  as you course down  the  river.  The\r\n\r\nfoundations of the new educational policy have been\r\n\r\nfirmly  laid  and,  in  the  words  of  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, hereafter, even in education, it will  be\r\n\r\none of construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with the principle of equality for\r\n\r\nthe 4 streams of education, we have endeavoured  to\r\n\r\nachieve uniformity so that ultimately we may evolve\r\n\r\na  single integrated system of education which will\r\n\r\nretain  the  best  features to be found  in  the  4\r\n\r\nstreams of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniformity in structure has been initiated. For\r\n\r\nthe  first time, registration for the admission  of\r\n\r\nan  estimated 52,000 children in all 4  streams  of\r\n\r\neducation is going on for 1961 Primary I admission.\r\n\r\nPrimary  education is now 6 years for all  streams.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  took office it was 7 years for the  Malay\r\n\r\nand  Tamil  streams. At the end of this  year,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Primary School Leaving examination in all  4\r\n\r\nlanguage  streams  will be held  for  an  estimated\r\n\r\n32,000   children.  The  Primary   School   Leaving\r\n\r\nexamination  replaces  the  Government  examination\r\n\r\npreviously   known   as  the   Secondary   Entrance\r\n\r\nExamination in the English stream, it will be noted\r\n\r\nthat  5,000  of  those  who  failed  the  Secondary\r\n\r\nEntrance  Examination last year have been  admitted\r\n\r\nto  special  post-primary schools  since  they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to go into the ordinary secondary  schools.\r\n\r\nIt is the Government's aim to ensure that those who\r\n\r\nare  not  inclined  towards  academic  studies   in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools would be given a two-year  post-primary education with a vocational bias. Until the\r\n\r\nproposed  Commission of Inquiry on  vocational  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  education is set up which would  produce\r\n\r\nthe  plan of vocational training to be followed for\r\n\r\nthe  time  being, the course of education in  post-primary  classes  will be one of further  education\r\n\r\nbased  on  strengthening the knowledge of languages\r\n\r\nand  learning the more practical aspects of  normal\r\n\r\nschool subjects. I wish to assure the many anxious  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents, therefore, that those who fail  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  School Leaving Examination at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year  will  have a place in our  post-primary\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary education is now a uniform four-year\r\n\r\nperiod.  The Chinese stream, previously  on  a  3-3\r\n\r\nyear  structure, will be running the six  and  four\r\n\r\nyear basis during the transitory period until 1962.\r\n\r\nFor  the  first time in the educational history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  secondary education in the  Malay  and\r\n\r\nTamil   streams   came  into  being   this   year.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the enrolment in our secondary schools\r\n\r\ndramatically  increased by 30 per Cent  over  1959,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  twice the average normal rate obtainable\r\n\r\nin  past  years.  The Government has  in  mind  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  greater opportunities for  secondary\r\n\r\neducation  and more diversification into  technical\r\n\r\nand commercial secondary education as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Government conducts the secondary\r\n\r\nschool  leaving examination for the Chinese  stream\r\n\r\nonly,  known  as the Government Senior  Middle  III\r\n\r\nexamination  (that  is, after a six-year  secondary\r\n\r\ncourse). With the establishment, of a uniform four-year  secondary  education, it  will  be  necessary\r\n\r\nbefore  long,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conduct   a\r\n\r\nsecondary  school leaving examination in  all  four\r\n\r\nstreams,  and  with this in mind,  an  Examinations\r\n\r\nSyndicate  will  be  established  to  control   and\r\n\r\nsupervise   examinations  for  both   primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, I appointed the Educational\r\n\r\nAdvisory Council and I am pleased to say to Members\r\n\r\nof   the   House   that   numerous   teachers   and\r\n\r\neducationists have put in considerable work  during\r\n\r\nthe  last  eight  months to  produce  eight  common\r\n\r\nsyllabuses which have since received my approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>They are: -\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n           1.

We  have\r\n\r\nmade  a  start  at  integration  in  two  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  Bukit Panjang and Serangoon  Garden  High\r\n\r\nSchools,  with the English and Chinese media.  Next\r\n\r\nyear,  we  will have no less than eight  integrated\r\n\r\nprimary  schools,  four with  English  and  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedia,  and  another four with  English  and  Malay\r\n\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of sports, we have been able to\r\n\r\nachieve encouraging results by the creation of  two\r\n\r\nJoint  Athletic  Sports Councils, one  for  primary\r\n\r\nschools   and  the  other  for  secondary  schools,\r\n\r\nwhereby  schools  of  the four language  media  are\r\n\r\nbeing grouped into districts and activities held at\r\n\r\ndistrict and inter-district levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the special position of Malays, we\r\n\r\nhave   since  decided  on  the  policy  of  free\r\n\r\neducation  for Malays up to University level  which\r\n\r\nwill  in  the  long run ensure that their  economic\r\n\r\nstatus  will  be  raised  to  the  level  of  other\r\n\r\ncommunities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teachers' Training College is continuing to\r\n\r\nplay its vigorous role in providing the training of\r\n\r\nthousands of qualified teachers to qualify  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  language, that is, Malay, and  the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation   Board   is  also   making   its   great\r\n\r\ncontribution in the provision of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar  facilities  for the  adult  population  at\r\n\r\nnight  literacy classes. As and when more  teachers\r\n\r\nare  qualified to teach the national language, more\r\n\r\nperiods   would  be  set  aside  in,   the   school\r\n\r\ncurriculum for its study. In the meantime, priority\r\n\r\nwill be given to those studying at secondary school\r\n\r\nor upper primary school level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have estimated that for the next four years,\r\n\r\n1961 to 1964, we would require something like 4,300\r\n\r\nteachers or a little over 1,100 teachers each year.\r\n\r\nOf  these,  about  ten per cent would  have  to  be\r\n\r\ngraduates  for  the increased number  of  secondary\r\n\r\nschools to be created hereafter. That is why it has\r\n\r\nbeen   necessary  to  rationalise   the   Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College and to introduce  a  single,  in-service  system of training to provide a three-year\r\n\r\ncourse   for  primary  school  teachers  in   three\r\n\r\nlanguage media and a one-year course for University\r\n\r\ngraduates  in  two language media. One  interesting\r\n\r\ninnovation in the training of our teachers  at  the\r\n\r\nT.T.C. is  the  inclusion of  a  political  study\r\n\r\ncourse.  I  might mention at this  stage  that  150\r\n\r\nprincipals of schools have gone through this course\r\n\r\nof  whom  30 were from the Chinese middle  schools,\r\n\r\nanother 30 from the English primary schools, and 90\r\n\r\nfrom the Chinese primary schools. More courses will\r\n\r\nbe  held during the course of the year and there is\r\n\r\nno  question  of doubt that the principals  of  our\r\n\r\nschools are beginning to appreciate the problems of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry and will be giving their full-hearted\r\n\r\nsupport  in  its difficult task. An Advisory  Board\r\n\r\nhas been formed and the T.T.C. is expected to make\r\n\r\nits  maximum contribution in the important task  of\r\n\r\nteacher-training. It is worthy  of  note  that  the\r\n\r\nSchool of Education of the University of Malaya  is\r\n\r\ngiving its fullest support and co-operation in  the\r\n\r\nwork of the T.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polytechnic, which was reorganised soon after\r\n\r\nthe  new  Government took office, is  making  great\r\n\r\nprogress  and steps are being taken to ensure  that\r\n\r\nits  diplomas  will  be  recognised,  not  only  by\r\n\r\nSingapore but by adjoining territories as well.  We\r\n\r\nshall  plan our vocational and technical  education\r\n\r\nto   produce  the  thousands  of  semi-skilled  and\r\n\r\nskilled workers who will be required to sustain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe industrialisation programme which we intend  to\r\n\r\nembark upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent announcement that the Singapore\r\n\r\nDivision of the University .of Malaya would  become\r\n\r\nthe University of Singapore by 1962, we now see the\r\n\r\nhealthy  development whereby a  genuine  effort  is\r\n\r\nbeing  made to absorb those who come from the  non-English   secondary  streams   of   education.   We\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the 78 who are being  admitted  to\r\n\r\nthe  pre-University  course  this  year  are  being\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  a  \"token\" intake by  the  academic\r\n\r\nauthorities  of the University, and that  long-term\r\n\r\nplans  are being considered for much larger intakes\r\n\r\nfrom  1961  onwards. Only when  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore seriously absorbs the best products  from\r\n\r\nthe  secondary  streams  of education  existing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore can it legitimately claim to be  a  truly\r\n\r\nnational institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned the important part played\r\n\r\nby  the  Adult  Education Board (that  is,  Lembaga\r\n\r\nGerakan Pelajaran Dewasa) in the popularisation  of\r\n\r\nMalay  as  the national language amongst the  adult\r\n\r\npopulation. The vigorous manner in which the  Board\r\n\r\nis   conducting  its  activities,  especially  its\r\n\r\nrecent further education classes on the history  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  allied subjects, has created  a  great\r\n\r\nimpression.   To  the  many  thousands   who   have\r\n\r\nvolunteered  in the work of this great venture,  we\r\n\r\nexpress  our deepest gratitude and look forward  to\r\n\r\nthe early eradication of illiteracy from our midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten - who unfortunately is\r\n\r\nnot  in  the House - has tried to belittle the school\r\n\r\nbuilding programme of the new Government.  She  did\r\n\r\nso  because  she  failed to understand  the  answer\r\n\r\ngiven  by my Parliamentary Secretary for which  she\r\n\r\nhad  to depend on the translation facilities of the\r\n\r\nHouse. For 1959, the school building programme  was\r\n\r\nlargely  frozen; the freeze for the first  half  of\r\n\r\nthe  year was the work of the last Government,  and\r\n\r\nthe  second  half of the year resulted  in  a  deep\r\n\r\nfreeze by the new Government in order to study  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  position of the State. As  indicated  in\r\n\r\nthe speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, a careful\r\n\r\nestimate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas been made of our requirements for the next five\r\n\r\nyears   which   will  be  made   known   when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's Five-Year Development Plan  is  tabled\r\n\r\nin  this  House in the near future. We  envisage  a\r\n\r\nschool building programme of 19 schools each  year,\r\n\r\n5  secondary  and 14 primary. The  Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands mentioned about building a  school\r\n\r\nin  Blakang Mati. I should like to say that for the\r\n\r\npresent most of the school children at Blakang Mati\r\n\r\nare  either attending school at Pulau Brani  or  on\r\n\r\nthe  mainland. However, a team of officials visited\r\n\r\nBlakang  Mati  on  the 20th  July  to  see  to  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  erecting  a  school  which   would\r\n\r\nprovide  education  to  nearly  300  children;  100\r\n\r\nMalays, 187 Chinese and 18 Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1960, $14.2 million has been earmarked for\r\n\r\nbuilding  new  schools.  Because  of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nutilise  all  available sites,  which  are  scarce,\r\n\r\nplanning  work  is in progress for a new  standard-type  4-storeyed school. It is intended  also  that\r\n\r\nschool  halls  to be erected in our  new  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  will have a ceiling height of 35  feet  to\r\n\r\naccommodate three badminton courts to  be  used  at\r\n\r\none  time,  so  that our pupils can  improve  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of badminton with the ultimate hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Thomas  Cup will return to Malaya as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible. There will also be a 6-storeyed school at\r\n\r\nSilat  Road, and a 10-storeyed one at Selegie  Road\r\n\r\nwhich  will probably be the tallest school building\r\n\r\nin  Asia. We are planning this 10-storeyed building\r\n\r\nto be ready for 1962 Primary I admission to take in\r\n\r\nno less than 3,000 pupils on a two-session basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. Government does things, its impact\r\n\r\nwill  be  felt by the masses whose welfare  we  are\r\n\r\nhere  to  serve.  We do not expect  to  retire  and\r\n\r\nbecome owners of iron mines, like a former Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Anything that is done to weaken\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. is  also  calculated  to  weaken  the\r\n\r\nprogressive  forces in our society. As a  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the P.A.P. has always  maintained  and\r\n\r\nupheld   the  basic  rights  of  the  workers.   No\r\n\r\nsocialist  government worthy of  the  name  can  do\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim, who has lately discovered\r\n\r\nall  kinds  of  faults with the Party which  nursed\r\n\r\nhim,  has  seen fit to cast doubt on  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nbona fides with regard to the trade union movement.\r\n\r\nI  would merely point out that the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim has never been one who has been associated with\r\n\r\nthe  trade union movement. Indeed, there is not one\r\n\r\nsingle  trade union issue that the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  has  taken  up as a member of the  Party.  His\r\n\r\ninterest in \"enlightened trade unionists\" has  only\r\n\r\nbeen of recent origin and for obvious reasons.  The\r\n\r\nworkers of Singapore will not forget that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  whom the Member for Hong  Lim  so  much\r\n\r\nmaligns today, has a far more distinguished record\r\n\r\nof  service with the trade unions than anyone  else\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P. He was adviser to 51  trade  unions\r\n\r\nbefore he took office as Prime Minister. Unlike the\r\n\r\nrelationship of the Prime Minister with  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  which was on an entirely ideological  and\r\n\r\nnon-professional basis, the Member for Hong Lim. I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  has  audited  the  accounts  of  several\r\n\r\nunions for a consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The socialist movement is a mass movement.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it can only be successful on  the  basis\r\n\r\nof  the heroism and sacrifice of the masses, not on\r\n\r\nthe basis of individuals. Collective leadership  is\r\n\r\none of the most essential requisites of success for\r\n\r\na  socialist  movement. Individuals of  overweening\r\n\r\nambition and pride can only do harm to the cause of\r\n\r\nsocialism.  The Member for Hong Lim pretends  today\r\n\r\nthat, with his 16 resolutions, he can cure all  the\r\n\r\nills  of our society. But he is not the doctor  who\r\n\r\nwill cure our ills. He is, in fact, the disease.

Can the Member for  Hong  Lim  now\r\n\r\npoint  to one single trade union leader of note  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  would choose to  join  him  on  any\r\n\r\npublic platform? Indeed he cannot. And he knows the\r\n\r\nreason why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open democratic society the trade unions\r\n\r\ncannot  be  expected to see eye  to  eye  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in all its tactics and priorities.  The\r\n\r\ntrade  unions are involved with the welfare of  one\r\n\r\nsection  of the community. They are concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  problems of wages and conditions of employment\r\n\r\nof  the  workers, whereas the Government  has  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for all sections of the  community,\r\n\r\nbe  they  workers  or not. There are  bound  to  be\r\n\r\ndifferences  of emphasis between the  approach  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  to a problem  and  that  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This is natural and to  be  expected.\r\n\r\nEven  in  the  best  of families,  differences  do\r\n\r\narise,   but   the  families  are  not  permanently\r\n\r\nseparated.  This sort of differences  over  tactics\r\n\r\nand   emphasis  must  not  be  mistaken  as   being\r\n\r\ndifferences  over  fundamentals.  There can  be  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  at the bottom there is  a  feeling  of\r\n\r\naffinity and sympathy between the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nand the trade unions. It must be clearly understood\r\n\r\nthat  the trade union movement is not part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but  organisations  with   their   own\r\n\r\nfunctions and priorities. The charge that the trade\r\n\r\nunions are part of the Government is often made  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition, as they fail  to  grasp\r\n\r\nthe   reasons  for  the  comradeship  that   exists\r\n\r\nbetween  the  P.A.P.  Government  and  the   trade\r\n\r\nunions.  The comradeship that was forged  over  the\r\n\r\nyears  between the P.A.P. and the broad  sections\r\n\r\nof the working class in the common struggle against\r\n\r\ncolonialism, makes certain of this close  affinity.\r\n\r\nThe  socialist party that makes the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions are but two wings of  the  same\r\n\r\nprogressive  movement. The working class  can  only\r\n\r\nachieve its aims and aspirations in cooperation and\r\n\r\nin conjunction with a left wing government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny  action, therefore, which is aimed at  dividing\r\n\r\nthe  Left-wing  government  from  the  workers   is\r\n\r\ncalculated  to  weaken the strength  of  the  whole\r\n\r\nmovement. And any person who is guilty of an action\r\n\r\nthat  will  weaken the power of the  working  class\r\n\r\nought  to  be condemned as an enemy of the  working\r\n\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage it may be useful to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of  Members of this  House  to  a  Press\r\n\r\nstatement that the Singapore Trades Union  Congress\r\n\r\nissued  on behalf of the trade unions in Singapore,\r\n\r\npublicly registering their vigorous protest against\r\n\r\nthe  Government's action to de-register four  trade\r\n\r\nunion   organisations.  Sir,  I  repeat  that   the\r\n\r\ndifferences between a socialist government and  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions will only be on tactics and not  over\r\n\r\nfundamentals  or  objectives. The Member  for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim,   who  did  not  understand  the  ideals   and\r\n\r\nobjectives  that  bind  the trade  unions  and  the\r\n\r\nprogressive  government into one force,  sought  to\r\n\r\nexploit  this little misunderstanding. By including\r\n\r\nthe  re-registration  of  the  de-registered  trade\r\n\r\nunion   organisations,  he  hoped  to  become   the\r\n\r\nchampion of the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Congress, Sir, issued a statement\r\n\r\non  the  unwarranted  championing  of  trade  union\r\n\r\ninterests  by  the  Member for  Hong  Lim.  It  was\r\n\r\npublished  in the Sunday Times of 10th July,  1960,\r\n\r\nunder  the  heading \"TUC criticises Ong Eng  Guan.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  with  your permission, I would like  to  read\r\n\r\nextracts from this statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"We feel that in the present situation it is\r\n\r\nincumbent  on  us to maintain left-wing  unity  and\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between  progressive  and  opportunist\r\n\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to state that we consider the present\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government a left-wing government.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The consolidation and safeguarding of the unity  of\r\n\r\nthe   socialist   movement  against   individualist\r\n\r\naberrations was only possible if the political  and\r\n\r\ntrade  union  wings worked in harmony.  It  is  the\r\n\r\njoint responsibility in the Singapore situation for\r\n\r\nboth  wings  of the same movement  to  combat  any\r\n\r\nmanifestation   of  disruptive  individualism   and\r\n\r\nopportunism. The Secretariat said that the  workers\r\n\r\nwere   capable  of  distinguishing  between  issues\r\n\r\nraised by Mr Ong and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOng himself. As such, they \"will not be confused by\r\n\r\nthe  opportunist tactics of Mr Ong.\"  It  declared\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` the TUC and leadership of the unions were\r\n\r\ncompetent to safeguard the interests of the working\r\n\r\nclass    \"without    outside    interference     or\r\n\r\nchampionship.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the general elections the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. were never tired of telling the  people  of\r\n\r\nthe  terrible  things  that  would  happen  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  field  should  the  P.A.P. form   the\r\n\r\ngovernment. This was their view of things  and  was\r\n\r\nno  doubt created by their own experience while  in\r\n\r\ngovernment.  But  the analysis was  wrong  and  was\r\n\r\nproved wrong. While the previous Government  was  a\r\n\r\nright-wing Government, because of its own  policies\r\n\r\nand   the  demand  of  its  supporters,  i.e.,  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists  and the capitalists,  it  could  only\r\n\r\nhope  to  maintain  peace by naked  suppression  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions. The trade unions were left  with  no\r\n\r\nother  alternative  and had  to  resort  to  brutal\r\n\r\nforce.  The P.A.P. was then in a different position\r\n\r\nentirely. It was the spearhead of the working class\r\n\r\nmovement,  and as such it enjoyed the  wholehearted\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  support of the workers  and  their\r\n\r\nunions. The workers, when they voted in the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\napproved of the P.A.P. policy of industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice,  and  believed that  only  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment could ensure that justice was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the past year of office of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  show even to the  most  sceptical\r\n\r\nperson  that the workers' faith in this  Government\r\n\r\nhas  not been misplaced. Industrial peace has  been\r\n\r\nmaintained and it has been maintained with justice.\r\n\r\nThe  emphasis has been on justice. True, there have\r\n\r\nbeen strikes, and there `will be strikes as long as\r\n\r\nour country is under a democratic government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting up of the present T.U.C., Sir, a\r\n\r\nunited  front  of all sections of  the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore has been achieved for the first  time  in\r\n\r\nthe   history  of  the  trade  union  movement   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This  unity  of  all  sections  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers - industrial, clerical and technical, Malays,\r\n\r\nChinese,  and Indians - has been achieved after  very\r\n\r\nmany years of struggle, and this achievement was in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno   small  measure  made  possible  by  a   P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngovernment.  This  unity is only  possible  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  adherence to the principles  and  ideals\r\n\r\nwhich both the trade unions and the P.A.P. share in\r\n\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the trade union movements in the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries. In those countries we  find\r\n\r\nthe  trade union movements divided on the basis  of\r\n\r\nrace,  religion  and  political affiliations.  This\r\n\r\nmust  never  be allowed to be introduced  into  our\r\n\r\nmovement. Political alignments on the basis of pro-P.A.P., non-P.A.P. and anti-P.A.P. should never  be\r\n\r\nintroduced into our movement, for that will destroy\r\n\r\nthe united front of all workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I wish to emphasise that if\r\n\r\nany  section of the trade union leadership attempts\r\n\r\nto  take measures which will only benefit the  pro-Communists  but  which will be detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  socialist movement,  then  that\r\n\r\nsection  must  bear  full  responsibility  for  the\r\n\r\nharmful consequences to the workers of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  support  the  Prime Minister's  motion  of\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for  the\r\n\r\npolicy  speech which he delivered on July  20th  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara pointed out in his\r\n\r\nspeech  that the P.A.P. Government in the past  one\r\n\r\nyear  placed emphasis on the work of reorganisation\r\n\r\nof Government departments, the consolidation of the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the people and the Government,\r\n\r\nand the preparatory work to implement the Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's policy\r\n\r\nspeech was not a proclamation of revolution and did\r\n\r\nnot  provide much \"flavour\" for those drunk in  the\r\n\r\nstormy revolutionary type of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech dealt, in\r\n\r\nsimple  and calm term, with the objective  reality\r\n\r\nof the small island in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   we   live - its   financial   and   economic\r\n\r\nconditions, schools, port, housing, communications,\r\n\r\nhealth,  social  welfare establishments,  etc.  The\r\n\r\nspeech  contained  neither empty and  boastful  nor\r\n\r\ncold  and  fierce language. But is  there  anything\r\n\r\nwrong with this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people handed us the responsibility of\r\n\r\ngovernment  not  with  the  wish  that   we   would\r\n\r\ncontinuously   create  instability  and   stimulate\r\n\r\nrevolutions, but that we might find ways of opening\r\n\r\nfactories  to enable the unemployed to  find  work,\r\n\r\nthat  we  might  build  more houses,  schools,  and\r\n\r\nhospitals  for  the poor in order to  better  their\r\n\r\nlot,   and  that  we  might  provide  a  means   of\r\n\r\nlivelihood  for the island's 1\u00bd million population.\r\n\r\nThe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech reflected  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  actual  effort  towards  a  just  and\r\n\r\nrational  society.  Is there  anything  wrong  with\r\n\r\nthis?  What reason is there for alleging  that  the\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the number of anti-colonial  slogans\r\n\r\nconstitutes collaboration with the colonial  forces\r\n\r\nin doping the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on 3rd August, when the Prime Minister proposed a motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his speech, he made a very\r\n\r\naccurate  and  profound  analysis  of  the  present\r\n\r\npolitical  situation in the State of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nmy opinion, everyone who supports the P.A.P. should\r\n\r\nstudy   carefully  and  deeply  his  speech   which\r\n\r\nexplains the political stand of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said by the Prime Minister about the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party and the Left-wing  adventurers.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  make  some supplementary statements  here\r\n\r\nbased  on what I personally have understood from  a\r\n\r\nstudy of the Prime Minister's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, according to what I personally understand, the various points on the Communist\r\n\r\nParty  and Left-wing adventurers found in the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech are nothing but a  statement  to\r\n\r\nthe   world  that  the  P.A.P. is  an  independent\r\n\r\npolitical force which does not depend on others for\r\n\r\nits existence and which does not lend itself to  be\r\n\r\nconveniently  controlled by the political  opinions\r\n\r\nof other people. It has its own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanalysis  and understanding of the movement  for  a\r\n\r\nmerger  between  Singapore and the Federation,  and\r\n\r\nfor  a  breakaway from colonial rule, of the  fight\r\n\r\nfor  the  ultimate victory of Socialism in  Malaya,\r\n\r\nand  of the problem of racial unity in Malaya, etc.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past, owing to the fact that the political\r\n\r\nforce   represented  by  the  P.A.P. was  one   of\r\n\r\npatriotism,  socialism  and anti-colonialism,  many\r\n\r\npeople  regarded it as a companion to or a  pioneer\r\n\r\nof the Communist Party; this is entirely wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether people like it or not, as an independent\r\n\r\npolitical  force, the P.A.P., on all  matters,  has\r\n\r\nits  own initiative and views which result  from  a\r\n\r\ncool analysis of the present political, economical,\r\n\r\nsocial, racial and other conditions in Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. not  only refuses to follow other  people's\r\n\r\nslogans, but it also has complete faith in sticking\r\n\r\nto   its   own  course,  i.e.,  a  non-Communistic,\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  socialistic course, so as to  shoulder\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of leading a social revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people thought that there was discrepancy in\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.'s stand before and after its coming into\r\n\r\npower.  I  think  this  is a wrong  concept.  These\r\n\r\npeople  erred either in not understanding the  non-Communistic,  democratic socialism, or  in  wrongly\r\n\r\nregarding  individual talks in the  P.A.P. as  the\r\n\r\ninitiative and stand of the P.A.P. as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, everyone who pays attention to the situation in Asia knows that, as a non-Communistic,\r\n\r\ndemocratic, socialist force, the P.A.P. now  faces\r\n\r\nin  Singapore a complicated situation which is  not\r\n\r\neasy  to  deal with. But the facts of the past  few\r\n\r\nyears  have  shown that, compared with  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries  in Asia, Singapore is most prominent  in\r\n\r\nits  performance.  Democratic socialist  forces  in\r\n\r\nmany Asian countries are, being crushed by cold and\r\n\r\nhard  reality. But no matter what the situation  in\r\n\r\nother countries is, according to my observation and\r\n\r\nunderstanding,   the  effort  of   non-Communistic,\r\n\r\ndemocratic   socialists  in  Singapore   has   very\r\n\r\nimportant significance and effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, besides our Malay countrymen, there are the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated and Chinese-educated classes. This\r\n\r\narose from the long colonial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the English-educated class, the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the non-Communistic,  democratic,\r\n\r\nsocialistic force lies in awakening them and urging\r\n\r\nthem  not to be enamoured of the colonial  era,  in\r\n\r\neducating  them  to understand and sympathise  with\r\n\r\nthe  suppressed  class, and not to regard  all  the\r\n\r\nspontaneous struggles of the suppressed class as  a\r\n\r\ndesire  of the Communist Party to engulf them.  The\r\n\r\nnon-Communistic, democratic socialists must  assure\r\n\r\nthem  that the State power shall not fall into  the\r\n\r\nhands  of members of the Communist Party.  It  must\r\n\r\nalso  educate them to adapt themselves  voluntarily\r\n\r\nto  the  colossal  social change, which  has  swept\r\n\r\nacross  the  whole  of Asia and Africa,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nconvert   themselves  into  upright   people   with\r\n\r\nnational pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Chinese-educated class, the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the non-Communistic,  democratic\r\n\r\nsocialistic force is that of enlightening  them  on\r\n\r\nthe  objective reality of Malaya, so that they  may\r\n\r\nappreciate  that heated slogans from foreign  books\r\n\r\nof  revolution are not only unable to triumph  over\r\n\r\nthe  military suppression by the colonial rule, but\r\n\r\nalso  unable  to achieve the aim of  uniting  other\r\n\r\ncommunal  groups.  The non-Communistic,  democratic\r\n\r\nsocialists want to convince them of the possibility\r\n\r\nof  democratic constitutional struggle and to point\r\n\r\nout  that  the method which is liable to result  in\r\n\r\nlong  social economic regression is not  one  which\r\n\r\ncan be used for social reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, some revolutionaries view the English-educated class as undesirable and think that they\r\n\r\nshould   all  be  cleared  out  of  the  government\r\n\r\ndepartments.  But  the P.A.P.'s view  is  not  like\r\n\r\nthis;  we want to patiently educate them. We refuse\r\n\r\nto discard or punish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the eyes of some hysterical anti- Communists, all Chinese-educated non-Right-wing\r\n\r\nsocial active elements should be gaoled. But again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  view is not like this;  we  want  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish among them those who are not Communists\r\n\r\nand  to channel their energy for the service  of  a\r\n\r\nsociety capable of fostering racial harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-communistic, democratic socialism is a course\r\n\r\nnot  welcome to the colonialists and members of the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party.  But  we  think  that,   in   the\r\n\r\nrealistic  environment of the present stage,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  political  course  that  is  clearer,  more\r\n\r\nrational and ultimately more acceptable to all  the\r\n\r\nraces in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. did not come out to govern without prior observation of the difficulties under\r\n\r\nthis new Constitution. Our Government under the new\r\n\r\nConstitution differs greatly from the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment under the Rendel Constitution.  The  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock  Government under the Rendel Constitution\r\n\r\ncollaborated  with  the  British  Imperialists   in\r\n\r\ndeceiving  the people. The P.A.P. Government  under\r\n\r\nthe new self-rule Constitution wants to take a step\r\n\r\nfurther   in   awakening  the  people's   political\r\n\r\nconsciousness and interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's General Election has entrusted to us\r\n\r\nthe   fate   and  livelihood  of  the  1\u00bd   million\r\n\r\npopulation  for the next 5 years. This  is  not  an\r\n\r\neasy  job.  If it were an easy matter to solve  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of employment, housing, schools etc. the\r\n\r\nBritish  would not have felt it necessary to  grant\r\n\r\nus self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the new Constitution is not an ideal one. Everybody knows this. However, since we have\r\n\r\ndecided  that  this is the right and forward  stage\r\n\r\nand  that,  in this stage, we democratic socialists\r\n\r\ncan  effect  positive  and  progressive  historical\r\n\r\nreaction,  we  really  have no  reason  to  arouse,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  fixed  date  for  resumption  of   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks, a political storm which  will\r\n\r\nnot bring us favourable results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is not ignorant of our\r\n\r\nelection promises to the electorate. It is  a  pity\r\n\r\nthat he took up political work for the sole purpose\r\n\r\nof  becoming  a  hero.  He has  not  the  slightest\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the history and significance \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the democratic, socialistic movement. He\r\n\r\nmay  be an outstanding conspirator; but I dare  say\r\n\r\nthat he will never become a helmsman of a political\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last one or two months the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  has  never  let  an opportunity  slip  without\r\n\r\ndescribing  himself as an anti-colonial  democratic\r\n\r\nvanguard.  He  may really hate the colonial  force;\r\n\r\nbut  I  think  a  person as lacking  in  the  group\r\n\r\nconcept  and as disobedient to the group discipline\r\n\r\nas   he   is,  will  never  be  able  to  overthrow\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  In  spite of the  numerous  important\r\n\r\nbasic   differences  between  we   non-Communistic,\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialists and members of the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty,  there  is  one  point  on  which  we   non-Communistic democratic socialists should follow the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Communist Party, i.e.,  the  group\r\n\r\nconcept and determination which enables the members\r\n\r\nof  the  Communist Party to evolve  as  a  die-hard\r\n\r\nfighting  force. If we do not, it will be difficult\r\n\r\nfor us to overcome the obstacles on the road ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before concluding my speech, let me say a word or two on the question of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity mentioned by the Member for Hong Lim  in\r\n\r\nhis speech made in this House last week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his disciplinary judgment by the party, in\r\n\r\norder to win over the people's sympathy and support\r\n\r\nfor  himself,  he  has degraded  himself  by  using\r\n\r\nindiscriminate means. His picking up  the  question\r\n\r\nof  Nanyang University for talking is, in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nfurther   instance   which   reveals   his    usual\r\n\r\nunprincipled behaviour. If the so-called  16  Party\r\n\r\nand   country  saving  proposals  could  not   save\r\n\r\nhimself, it is futile now for him to catch hold  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  or other  questions  as  life-saving potions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that the question of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  not  a  simple  educational  issue.\r\n\r\nBesides the question of expenditure, administrative\r\n\r\nre-organisation   and   staff   relationships,   it\r\n\r\ninvolves  the people's cultural concept and  inter-racial feelings. With the addition of the political\r\n\r\nseparation between Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   the   Federation,  the  question  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  has  become  even  more  complex.   The\r\n\r\nsolution  of  this  question depends  on  the  cool\r\n\r\ndeliberations  and discussions of those  concerned.\r\n\r\nThe  government  has reiterated its  stand  on  and\r\n\r\nattitude  to  the  question of Nanyang  University,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  it  will first and foremost look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the Nanyang University students;  it\r\n\r\nwill  adopt  the same attitude of equality  towards\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, as it has adopted towards  the\r\n\r\nvarious  racial streams of education, and it  hopes\r\n\r\nto  see in the Nanyang University a university  for\r\n\r\nMalayans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Upper Serangoon electorate let me support the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nmotion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for\r\n\r\nhis  policy speech delivered on July 20th  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche M.

What impresses\r\n\r\nme  most about the speech is that it shows that the\r\n\r\nfirst year of the P.A.P. Government has been a year\r\n\r\nof   administration.  It  is  up  to   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment to strengthen the economic stability  of\r\n\r\nthe  State. However, the People's Action  Party  is\r\n\r\nwell  known  for its boldness in carrying  out  the\r\n\r\ntasks  and responsibilities that have been left  to\r\n\r\nit  by the previous Government. Mr Speaker, we all\r\n\r\nknow  that Christmas Island has been sold. However,\r\n\r\nduring  the past 14 months since the P.A.P. assumed\r\n\r\noffice,   the   economy  of  Singapore   has   been\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  But the Opposition views  this  with\r\n\r\njealousy.   This  is  because  the  Government   is\r\n\r\n\"berwang\",  meaning, \"the Government has  money  at\r\n\r\nits  disposal\". But the word \"beruang\" which has  a\r\n\r\nsimilar phonetic sound, means \"a bear\" in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Government, I say that at the\r\n\r\nmoment  the  Government is doing its best  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  amendment  to  the  original   motion\r\n\r\nrelating to the restoration of the pay cuts, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  defeated yesterday, was moved just to confuse\r\n\r\nthe   people.   This  is  because   the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  was in the past frightened into  hating\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  But  the answer to this  is  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  well able to retaliate with the  \"bear\"\r\n\r\nwhich  I have mentioned just now to the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. mixes freely with the masses and has its\r\n\r\nroots firmly embedded in them. The Opposition,  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  living in luxury, will quite  naturally\r\n\r\nenvy us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara relates\r\n\r\nto  the second year of Government which will  be  a\r\n\r\nyear of \"reconstruction\". The scope of this term is\r\n\r\nwide.  But  we, on the Government side,  comprehend\r\n\r\nthe term \"reconstruction\" as meaning that we should\r\n\r\nwork harder to safeguard and protect the State  and\r\n\r\nits  people.  This  is  the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main theme of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech  is  to  get  the  people  to  realise   the\r\n\r\nawakening  that has taken place in Singapore  where\r\n\r\neven  small  children are proud  to  sing  \"Majulah\r\n\r\nSingapura\".   We   are  awaiting   the   day   when\r\n\r\nindependence will dawn on us. With trust and  faith\r\n\r\nin  each  other,  Singapore  will  positively  gain\r\n\r\nindependence through merger with the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  All this could be achieved by the  efforts\r\n\r\nof the masses who must owe undivided loyalty to the\r\n\r\nState,  but not by the efforts of those who try  to\r\n\r\nsplit  the  people, and who would like to  see  the\r\n\r\nexhortation  \"Majulah  Singapura\"  (let   Singapore\r\n\r\nFlourish)   degenerate  into one  of  \"Mundor-lah\r\n\r\nSingapore\" (Let Singapore decline).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we, on the Government side, call\r\n\r\non  the  people,  irrespective of class,  creed  or\r\n\r\ncolour  to  strive  together  to  attain  a  common\r\n\r\nMalayan outlook. We know this is not an easy  task,\r\n\r\nbut  with  earnestness and confidence,  it  is  yet\r\n\r\npossible  to achieve that goal. For the  past  five\r\n\r\nyears,    we   in   the   P.A.P. have   practised\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and tolerance in our movement  which\r\n\r\nis  supported by people of various races. And it is\r\n\r\nby  virtue of this that we have been successful and\r\n\r\nwe are now holding the reins of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intention is good, it is sure to be well\r\n\r\nrewarded,  but if the aim is to destroy,  then  God\r\n\r\nwill not give it His blessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitler's might was destroyed; and so was the might\r\n\r\nof   the  Japanese  who  once  occupied  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause their aims incurred the wrath of God.  From\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  said,  would you  say  that  we  are\r\n\r\nCommunists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our struggle is that of the people, and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill  try to achieve what it has set out to achieve\r\n\r\nwithin  five  years, not in one day.  It  is  quite\r\n\r\nconfident  of  its ability to do so.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nfail to understand what purpose is achieved by  the\r\n\r\nmere shouting of slogans now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are living in a modern age\r\n\r\nand  the masses too are modern in outlook. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  they are wide-awake. They cannot  be  hood-winked. Ideally, the Government and the Opposition,\r\n\r\nfrom whatever parties we come, should work together\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit  of the people as  a  whole.  But\r\n\r\ninstead  the  Opposition merely  sing  praises  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own Parties and have nothing worth while  to\r\n\r\nshow  to  the  people. Since the day the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  delivered his  speech,  they,  who\r\n\r\nclaim  to  be  the  leaders and, according  to  our\r\n\r\nIndonesian  term,  \"fathers\" of  the  people,  have\r\n\r\nmerely  indulged in confusing the people.  We  are,\r\n\r\neveryone of us, endowed with a brain, but  some  of\r\n\r\nus have used the brain only to confuse the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, each member of the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nself-confidence, but we also place full  confidence\r\n\r\nin  our collective leadership, unlike our erstwhile\r\n\r\ncolleague  who,  I regret, is now  sitting  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side of the House, because, as a leader,  he\r\n\r\nis  lacking in discipline. Our Party fully realises\r\n\r\nthat  our  collective  leadership  comes  from  the\r\n\r\npeople, and it works for the people. It is well  to\r\n\r\nbear in mind that we have a term of five years.  As\r\n\r\nelected  representatives of the people, whether  we\r\n\r\nare on the government side or on the Opposition, we\r\n\r\nshould  work  hard  in mutual cooperation  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit   of   the   people   in   our   respective\r\n\r\nconstituencies in all matters, from the smallest to\r\n\r\nthe  largest.  But  it is strange  to  see  certain\r\n\r\nMembers of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposition use all sorts of pretext to make appeals\r\n\r\nhere  in  the Assembly, whereas the matters  raised\r\n\r\ncould  satisfactorily be dealt with by the  various\r\n\r\ngovernment    departments    concerned.    If    no\r\n\r\nsatisfaction is obtained, they could be brought  up\r\n\r\nto  ministerial  level. Only if  this  step  proves\r\n\r\nineffective should they then be brought here before\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. It is true this Assembly is a public\r\n\r\nforum  for  the people, but it is not a  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment.  Once again I would say,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that we, as elected representatives  of  tile\r\n\r\npeople, should each show our ability to the people.\r\n\r\nBut  the  words  we utter should be reasonable.  My\r\n\r\nformer  colleague, the Member for Hong Lim,  stated\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. now is not the same as the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  former days. This is obvious even to  a  child.\r\n\r\nFor  formerly the hon. Member sat on the Government\r\n\r\nside,  but now he and two others - what I would  call\r\n\r\n\"The Three Musketeers\" - sit on the Opposite side  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  who  are now in the Opposition  are  there\r\n\r\nbecause our Party has no place for people who  have\r\n\r\nno  discipline.  That  is why  the  three  are  now\r\n\r\nsitting  yonder, on the other side. There  must  be\r\n\r\ndiscipline in any household. To be strong, a  union\r\n\r\nmust  have  discipline. In a disciplined  political\r\n\r\nset-up,   it   is   collective   leadership    that\r\n\r\nstrengthens the Party, welding it into  a  body  as\r\n\r\nstrong   as  steel  and  which  cannot  be   easily\r\n\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the two Members who have spoken\r\n\r\nhave  criticised the Prime Minister,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance and the Minister for Labour  and  Law.\r\n\r\nThis,  I say, is futile. For whatever is hurled  at\r\n\r\none  is  also hurled at all collectively. We cannot\r\n\r\ngo  forward together to achieve our aims so long as\r\n\r\nthere are elements who serve to confuse the people.\r\n\r\nWe all know that our former colleagues were loud in\r\n\r\ntheir  criticisms  of the Lim Yew Hock  Government,\r\n\r\nbut  now  they are loud in their praise of the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock Government. And what is more, the praises\r\n\r\nare  welcomed by the Member for Cairnhill,  for  he\r\n\r\nset  his necktie right, turned round and smiled  in\r\n\r\nacknowledgment. This is very significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know the aspiration of the Member for Hong Lim. \"The desire of the heart is to\r\n\r\nembrace  the mountain, but unfortunately  the  arms\r\n\r\nare  not  long enough.\" In fact, not only  was  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Cairnhill  praised,  but   even   you\r\n\r\nyourself,  Mr  Speaker, were complimented  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I had better remind the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  that we are on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech, and the Standing Order says distinctly that\r\n\r\nthe  debate thereon - that is, on the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech - shall be confined to the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe Government. I do not know whether the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  embracing  the  mountain,  but\r\n\r\nperhaps the hon. Member could talk about the policy\r\n\r\nof the Government from now on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ismail Rahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I apologise, Sir. I\r\n\r\nwas touching on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech\r\n\r\non  the  matter of reconstruction. We human  beings\r\n\r\nare  not  infallible. We should have  understanding\r\n\r\nand,  as responsible people, we should not  try  to\r\n\r\nshow  how  good we are and how bad others are.  The\r\n\r\nOpposition Members may themselves feel competent to\r\n\r\ntalk  about external affairs, but I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntalk   about  matters  concerning  the  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I was a postman for 22 years,  and  for\r\n\r\nten  years  I  delivered letters to Government  and\r\n\r\nCity  Council  offices. I came  into  contact  with\r\n\r\npeople  of  low and high status. All  these  people\r\n\r\npraise the P.A.P. for the wise action it has  taken\r\n\r\nto  expel the three Members of the P.A.P. who  are\r\n\r\nnow  sitting  on the opposite side. They  wish  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. well. The three Members opposite  tried  to\r\n\r\nteach us how to fight colonialism, but all we heard\r\n\r\nwere the names of G. G. Thomson, Meadows, Owen  and\r\n\r\nanother mentioned over and over again. Is it not  a\r\n\r\nfact that we are the employers and pay the salaries\r\n\r\nof those individuals? If they do anything improper,\r\n\r\nwe  would  certainly take appropriate action.  They\r\n\r\nare  people  who  are competent  in  their  various\r\n\r\nspheres of duties important to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  would  like to bully Meadows. The  Member  was\r\n\r\nthen  Minister for National Development, and I  was\r\n\r\nattached to that Ministry, and therefore I know. On\r\n\r\none occasion, Meadows and a number of us went to an\r\n\r\nisland.  He carried wood and did manual  work  with\r\n\r\nothers  and  his clothes were torn. Were  we  doing\r\n\r\nprison labour? No, we were doing voluntary work. So\r\n\r\nby  such  bullying tactics, perhaps the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  hoped  that  Mr  Meadows  would  resign\r\n\r\nwithout  getting  any  benefits  whatever.  It  was\r\n\r\nbecause of this that Mr Meadows was transferred to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister's Ministry. Is this the way  to\r\n\r\nfight  colonialism which the Member  for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nbragged about when bringing up his 16 resolutions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Aljunied talked about the increase of tax on petrol. If we wish to merge\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation, where the  price  of  petrol\r\n\r\ncosts  $2.00  a  gallon, it is not right  that  our\r\n\r\nprice here should remain at $1.50. So if we wish to\r\n\r\nbe  of  equal status, let the taxes be at the  same\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter raised concerns cigarettes, about\r\n\r\nwhich  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  also had something to say.  I  myself\r\n\r\nsmoke \"Pigeon\" brand cigarettes, three packets  per\r\n\r\nday. I pay tax to the Government when I smoke them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering whether it\r\n\r\nwould   be   correct  for  the  Speaker  to   allow\r\n\r\nadvertisements!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ismail Rahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I apologise again,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  for  I  am still  at  the  stage  of\r\n\r\nlearning. On the question of evading tax,  I  think\r\n\r\nformerly I talked for 5 minutes but now I am taking\r\n\r\na  longer time, to evade tax is easy. I myself have\r\n\r\nwith  me now leaf-cigarettes not in order to  evade\r\n\r\npaying  tax but in order to economise. But  if  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member opposite wishes to avoid paying any tax\r\n\r\nat all, I would advise him to take to chewing betel\r\n\r\nleaf instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, I on this side of the House share\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  the  Government. There  is  another\r\n\r\nthing, Mr Speaker, Sir, which I would like to  say\r\n\r\nbefore  I  end my speech. Although I  look  at  you\r\n\r\nwhile I am speaking, actually I am reading what  is\r\n\r\nbefore  me.  But I say this - this is my  own  speech\r\n\r\nwhich I wrote myself. I noticed that the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied  too  read  his  speech,  page  by   page,\r\n\r\nprepared  by the Member for Hong Lim, when  dealing\r\n\r\nwith the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is a well-known fact that one  can\r\n\r\nrecord brainwaves, and what is curious is that  the\r\n\r\nbrainwave  pattern  of a beetle is  identical  with\r\n\r\nthat   of   a  human  brain-wave.  But  there   the\r\n\r\nsimilarity  ends.  A beetle on a table  cloth  sees\r\n\r\nonly  the threads, but it does not see the  pattern\r\n\r\nor  the picture that is woven into the table cloth.\r\n\r\nA  beetle that walks on a ceiling wonders why it is\r\n\r\nthe only creature right side up and the rest of the\r\n\r\nworld  is  upside down. And there are people  whose\r\n\r\nminds  are  like  that  of  the  beetle - narrow  and\r\n\r\ncircumscribed. So it is, after listening to Members\r\n\r\nsitting  on the Opposition Benches, that  I  cannot\r\n\r\nhelp but feel that there are beetles in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the Leader of\r\n\r\nthe  House is anticipating that he would be  pulled\r\n\r\nup,  because  to  liken Members to  beetles  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  perhaps unparliamentary. And as  Leader  of\r\n\r\nthe House, he ought to give some lead as to what is\r\n\r\nparliamentary or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if you deem that\r\n\r\nis  unparliamentary, well, I  do  withdraw.  May  I\r\n\r\nsubstitute then that there are - may I repeat? - people\r\n\r\nwho are beetle-minded?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite rightly, Sir, the task of the Opposition is\r\n\r\nthat  of criticism, but during this debate  on  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech, we have witnessed\r\n\r\nthe Members sitting on the opposite side going on a\r\n\r\nrampage  of  destruction. There are two  sides  to\r\n\r\nevery person - the God in him and the devil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  him,  the ego and the id, the positive and  the\r\n\r\nnegative,  the  constructive and  the  destructive.\r\n\r\nRogue  elephants are known to invade  kampongs  and\r\n\r\ndestroy  what man has built and cultivated.  Tigers\r\n\r\nbecome man-eating when they reach the age of decay.\r\n\r\nSir, it is very easy to destroy, but it takes years\r\n\r\nof sacrifice, suffering and sweat to build even the\r\n\r\nlittle that we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day that this Assembly House turns into a\r\n\r\nplace  where  representatives of the people,  using\r\n\r\nthe  privilege  of  free speech  in  the  Assembly,\r\n\r\nuninhibitedly  give  free rein to  the  destructive\r\n\r\nside  of  their nature, then on that very day,  the\r\n\r\nrespect  which the people themselves give  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly will turn to ridicule and contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All leaders, especially leaders in the political\r\n\r\nfield, have a responsibility not only to themselves\r\n\r\nbut  also to the community and the society in which\r\n\r\nthey live. If political leaders were to take action\r\n\r\nonly  on impulse and not calculate the consequences\r\n\r\nof   their  actions  then  there  can  result  only\r\n\r\nconfusion and chaotic disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an animal which lives within the\r\n\r\nArctic  Circle. This species is called the lemming.\r\n\r\nIts   zoological  name  is  Lemmus-lemmus.  It   is\r\n\r\ndescribed  as a small mouse-like rodent about  five\r\n\r\ninches  long. It is a peculiar creature because  it\r\n\r\nis  dominated always by an impulse to  get  moving.\r\n\r\nYou  find the lemmings, in their thousands,  always\r\n\r\nmove downhill towards the sea. The lemmings advance\r\n\r\nregardless  of  all  obstacles, answering  only  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own  impulse, swimming streams and meanwhile\r\n\r\ncommitting  considerable devastation in their  line\r\n\r\nof  march.  Finally, the lemmings reach the  cliffs\r\n\r\nwith the sea below. The leading lemmings jump  off\r\n\r\nthe cliffs onto the rocks or into the sea. Hundreds\r\n\r\nof  other  lemmings follow; they plunge  themselves\r\n\r\ninto  the  sea and so a generation of  lemmings  is\r\n\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irresponsible political leadership is like the\r\n\r\nlemming. It would not matter so much if the impulse\r\n\r\nfor  self-destruction  were  confined  only  to   a\r\n\r\nperson, but usually a political leader does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndestroy  only himself. He also drags down with  him\r\n\r\nto   destruction  others  as  well.   When   Hitler\r\n\r\ncommitted suicide, he did not just destroy himself.\r\n\r\nHe  also,  in the process, destroyed the  lives  of\r\n\r\nmillions of unknown soldiers and civilians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish, Mr Speaker, to dwell upon the\r\n\r\nnegative  aspects of this debate. It  is  fruitless\r\n\r\nand a waste of nervous energy which can be deployed\r\n\r\ninto more useful and creative purposes. But let all\r\n\r\nthose who aspire to be demigods, remember:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n 'The  evil that men do, lives after them, \r\n\r\n The good is oft interred with their bones.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, let me pass on. It has been said that the  sublime is related to the ridiculous, and  the\r\n\r\nridiculous   is   related  to  the   sublime.   The\r\n\r\nridiculous is only one shade above the sublime, and\r\n\r\nthe sublime is one shade above the ridiculous. I am\r\n\r\nquite sure, Mr Speaker, that in your many years of\r\n\r\nenough in this Chamber to bear that statement  out.\r\n\r\nAnd  over  the  past few days,  we  have  seen  the\r\n\r\nridiculous and the sublime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two main tasks of government.\r\n\r\nSometime  last year in the debate on the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech, I had occasion  to  say,\r\n\r\nwhich is reported in Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 3,  col.\r\n\r\n120, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are two basic general problems which we\r\n\r\nface. First is one of nation building. Second,  the\r\n\r\nconversion  of  our existing economy  from  a  non-productive one to productive one.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Those  two  tasks were the tasks of the  Government\r\n\r\nlast  year.  They are still the tasks of Government\r\n\r\nthis  year,  and they will still be  the  tasks  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the next ten years.  The  task  of\r\n\r\nnation   building  goes  hand  in  hand  with   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment    of    political    consciousness - the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  consciousness or of  duty  and  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility   to   a   Malayan   society.    The\r\n\r\nconsciousness of belonging to a Malayan society  is\r\n\r\nrelatively new. It was barely evident, a few  years\r\n\r\nago. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, one-third  of  the  people  living  in  Singapore   are\r\n\r\nimmigrants.  Secondly, the variety  of  educational\r\n\r\nand cultural backgrounds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere then do we start the task of nation building?\r\n\r\nThe  base  upon which we have to build  the  nation\r\n\r\nmust lie on the young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore for this reason that the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade was established to absorb our young  people\r\n\r\nto impart to them the consciousness of belonging to\r\n\r\nour  Malayan  society, and to impart  to  them  the\r\n\r\nconsciousness of building and creating. It would be\r\n\r\na   mistake  if  we  were  to  neglect  the   older\r\n\r\ngeneration, and therefore the community centre  was\r\n\r\nreorganised.  The  organisation  of  the  community\r\n\r\ncentre was so directed that the older generation as\r\n\r\nwell as the young could be drawn to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe activities at a community centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill today sees only a\r\n\r\nFrankenstein in every organisation - the T.U.C.,  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade, and the community centres. He should\r\n\r\ninclude the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides  in  his\r\n\r\nplace.  It  is a pity that he sees his surroundings\r\n\r\nonly in monochrome and not in technicolour. And the\r\n\r\none-coloured vision is not only dull, but incapable\r\n\r\nof fine resolution of details. I have said that the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade and the community centres are devoted\r\n\r\nto the task of nation building. And any group which\r\n\r\nseeks to abuse that purpose will be severely rapped\r\n\r\non the knuckles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has dwelt at length on\r\n\r\nfighting   the   Communists.  In  a   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocratic system, we have to accept the fact  that\r\n\r\ncompetition   between  different  ideologies   will\r\n\r\nalways  exist  and must be allowed to exist - between\r\n\r\nConservatives, Liberals, Democrats, Socialists  and\r\n\r\nCommunists.   But  there  is  one   rule   of   the\r\n\r\ncompetition which must be observed. If our  society\r\n\r\nis   based   on  the  acceptance  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, then the rules of the game, as  observed\r\n\r\nin  the Constitution, must be adhered to. We cannot\r\n\r\nhave  in  the  boxing  ring one  boxer  who  adopts\r\n\r\nQueensberry  rules - he is told that he cannot  punch\r\n\r\nhis  opponent  below the belt - and the  other  boxer\r\n\r\nusing  the tactics of Siamese boxing, who not  only\r\n\r\nuses his fists but his legs as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  the  boxer  who adopts Queens-berry  rules  of\r\n\r\nboxing is punched, and in next to no time he is hit\r\n\r\nnot  only  on  the jaw but he gets a  kick  in  the\r\n\r\nbottom as well!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago when the Labour Front Government\r\n\r\ntook  office  the reserves were $322  million.  But\r\n\r\nfive  years  later, in 1959 - the first year  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government - these reserves had gone down  to\r\n\r\nonly $87 million. And on top of this discovery  was\r\n\r\nthe other discovery that in 1959 the Government was\r\n\r\nheading for a deficit of $14 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were ample funds for the last Government to\r\n\r\ndeploy  for  development. In fact, they  used  over\r\n\r\n$235  million  of the reserves. We do not  question\r\n\r\nthat  the last Government has not carried  out  any\r\n\r\ndevelopment, but what we ask is how much have  they\r\n\r\ngot  to  show  for  the amount of money  spent?  We\r\n\r\nmaintain  that, given the same flourishing economic\r\n\r\nconditions  which  the  post-Korean  War  boom  had\r\n\r\nendowed the rubber industry in particular and trade\r\n\r\nin  general, the P.A.P. Government can achieve much\r\n\r\nmore than what previous Governments have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten went to great lengths\r\n\r\nto  repeat  that  in 1955, the first  year  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious    Government,   6,734   dwellings    were\r\n\r\ncompleted. Mr Speaker, I have no doubts about  the\r\n\r\npersonal charm of the Member for Mountbatten, but I\r\n\r\nwould  like to warn the House not to be deluded  by\r\n\r\nher   figure.  The  figure  of  6,734  was  housing\r\n\r\nprovided  from three sources, namely, the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust,  private enterprise  and  those\r\n\r\npublic  authorities which built quarters for  their\r\n\r\nstaff.  Half of these buildings completed  in  1955\r\n\r\ncame from the private sector which was enjoying the\r\n\r\npost-Korean  War  boom.  The  contribution  of  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. was only 2,907 units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Hansard\r\n\r\nwill show that what I said was 6,734 built under\r\n\r\nthe previous Government, and 2,907 built by\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Members of the Opposition have\r\n\r\nbeen   critical  of  the  fact  that   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, in its first year of office,  has  done\r\n\r\nlittle in the way of housing development. Since the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Aljunied yesterday  claimed  that  the\r\n\r\nbuildings  put  up by the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  today are due to the Malayanisation  efforts\r\n\r\nof the former Minister for National Development,  I\r\n\r\nam   obliged,   on  behalf  of  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, to place certain  facts  before\r\n\r\nthis House. During the six months term of office of\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Hong  Lim  as  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust, work commenced on only\r\n\r\n821 units. In the six months since he ceased to  be\r\n\r\nChairman,  the  Housing and Development  Board  was\r\n\r\nformed, and under its direction, work was commenced\r\n\r\non   2,729   units.  The  slowness - admittedly   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was slow in getting housing development\r\n\r\nto  start - was  due  to the depletion  of  technical\r\n\r\nstaff and the haywire changes in building plans.  A\r\n\r\ntotal of 79 monthly-rated staff left the service of\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. They were dismissed, or they  resigned,\r\n\r\nor  they  retired. And of these 79, 22 were  senior\r\n\r\nofficers, five being heads of departments and  five\r\n\r\nwere heads of sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders for two phases for the Tiong Bahru fire\r\n\r\nsite  development  were  submitted  to  the  former\r\n\r\nMinister for consideration in June 1959. These were\r\n\r\nturned down, and instructions were issued for fresh\r\n\r\nplans  to be drawn up to substitute communal  units\r\n\r\nfor  self-contained flats. On this new instruction,\r\n\r\na revised lay-out was produced, but again there was\r\n\r\na change of mind. Plans had to be drawn up all over\r\n\r\nagain, and eventually only 280 communal units  were\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the  development.  Because  of   this\r\n\r\nindecision and frequent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchanges  of mind of the former Minister, these  two\r\n\r\ncontracts were not officially approved for  letting\r\n\r\nuntil  November 1959 and January 1960, a  delay  of\r\n\r\nover five months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the Member for Hong Lim was a member of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, we, the Government, had  to  admit\r\n\r\nliability  for  his mistakes. And as  a  collective\r\n\r\nbody  we have to accept responsibility for the fact\r\n\r\nthat our housing development programme has not  got\r\n\r\noff to a fine start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board was constituted in February 1960\r\n\r\nand  one of the first things it did was to  make  a\r\n\r\nthorough study of the housing problem in Singapore,\r\n\r\nit was estimated that to solve the existing housing\r\n\r\nproblem,  at least 14,000 dwelling units  per  year\r\n\r\nshould be built for the next 10 years. For the last\r\n\r\n12  years,  from  1948 to 1959, a total  of  46,918\r\n\r\npermanent dwelling units were completed,  of  which\r\n\r\n43  per cent were built by the former S.I.T., while\r\n\r\n38 per cent were constructed by private enterprise,\r\n\r\nand  the  remainder 18 per cent by  Government  and\r\n\r\nother  public  authorities.  The  former  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust built on the average 1.700  units\r\n\r\nper  year,  and  during its best year  in  1958  it\r\n\r\nconstructed  3,841 units. To overcome  the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem a big leap must be made from the average of\r\n\r\n1,700  units per year to at least 10,000 units  per\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has drawn up a Five-Year building\r\n\r\nprogramme to provide some 52,842 units costing $230\r\n\r\nmillion  within  the  next five  years.  When  this\r\n\r\nprogramme is completed, it is anticipated that  the\r\n\r\ncritical  housing shortage will be  greatly  eased.\r\n\r\nThe programme is in implementation of the policy of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to bring housing within  the  means  of\r\n\r\nthose  in lower-income groups least able to  afford\r\n\r\nsuitable living accommodation and whose needs  will\r\n\r\nnot be catered for by private enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Five-Year building programme concentrates\r\n\r\nbuilding  mainly in the City limits, in Queenstown,\r\n\r\nMacPherson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad,  Kampong  Tiong  Bahru, Alexandra  Road,  St.\r\n\r\nMichael's  Road,  Kallang, Toa  Payoh  and  certain\r\n\r\ncentral urban districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present 4,720 units are under construction, of\r\n\r\nwhich  1,800 units will be completed at the end  of\r\n\r\nthis year, while 7,000 or more will be completed at\r\n\r\nthe end of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with our policy of observing the\r\n\r\nspecial rights of the Malays, I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  special  preference is being given  to  Malay\r\n\r\napplicants  who  apply  for housing  built  by  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. Two extra points are\r\n\r\ngiven  to  each Malay applicant under  the  present\r\n\r\npoints system of allocation. At present, there  are\r\n\r\naltogether  3,928 Malay families living  either  on\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board estate or in Government quarters.537 Malay applicants\r\n\r\nare now on the waiting list of\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board, and we can give\r\n\r\nan  assurance to them that their applications  will\r\n\r\nbe treated with due consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increasing development of built-up areas,\r\n\r\nthe   flood  problems  in  Singapore  have   become\r\n\r\nincreasingly  serious year by  year.  Briefly,  the\r\n\r\nproblems   of  flood  alleviation  deal  with   the\r\n\r\ndrainage of the following catchment areas:-\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                 Sungei Bedok and Ketapang;\r\n\r\n                 Geylang River Catchment;\r\n\r\n                 Singapore River and Sungei Ulu Pandan;\r\n\r\n                 Bukit Timah and Stamford Canal;\r\n\r\n                 Jurong River;\r\n\r\n                 Sungei Whampoa, Sungei Kallang and Sungei Seletar;\r\n\r\n                 Sungei Api Api and Tampines.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>Of  these  seven  schemes, only  the  Sungei  Bedok\r\n\r\nscheme has been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Geylang flood prevention scheme is now two-thirds completed. Final stages will consist of the\r\n\r\nconstruction of two main drainage channels  running\r\n\r\nthrough Geylang Serai and Kampong Ubi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore River and Sungei Ulu Pandan scheme\r\n\r\nis also under construction. This scheme is designed\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  flooding in the  catchment  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  River with particular reference  to  the\r\n\r\nAlexandra area from Delta Circus up to Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research will be made on the diversion of flood\r\n\r\nwaters from the Bukit Timah canal. One proposal  is\r\n\r\nto  divert  the water from the canal  near  Holland\r\n\r\nRoad   southwards  through  tunnels   into   Sungei\r\n\r\nBangkong. This plan has certain merits in that land\r\n\r\nacquisition  will not entail taking  much  valuable\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sungei Api Api is now being widened by the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade for 2\u00bd miles, and a tidal gate will be\r\n\r\nconstructed at the outlet of the river to keep  out\r\n\r\nthe  tide,  which  at present inundates  the  whole\r\n\r\ndownstream  area  at  every high  tide.  When  this\r\n\r\nscheme  is completed in the next six months,  1,800\r\n\r\nacres  of  the  Tampines area will be  relieved  of\r\n\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are a number of other schemes\r\n\r\nbeing  prepared,  to be carried  out  by  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.  These include two schemes in  the  Jurong\r\n\r\narea,  one in the Malay Settlement off Jalan  Eunos\r\n\r\nand  another for the main drain running North  from\r\n\r\nBukit Panjang into Sungei Pang Sua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the City area, work has been going on in Nelson\r\n\r\nRoad  and in Orchard Road for the last year.  These\r\n\r\ntwo  schemes will be completed this year.  In  this\r\n\r\nyear's  budget we have funds for schemes  at  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang, the area between Bartley Road and Playfair\r\n\r\nRoad. All these will be completed in 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with housing development and the\r\n\r\ncreation of industrial estates, more roads have  to\r\n\r\nbe  built. The expenditure on road works each  year\r\n\r\nis  of  the  order of $10 million. At  the  present\r\n\r\ntime,   the  Roads  Section  is  engaged   on   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of new Link Roads:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Between Jurong Road and Chua Chu Kang;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Between West Coast Road and Jurong Road;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Between Braddell Road and Serangoon Garden\r\n\r\nEstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure on agricultural track\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  kampong road  construction  will\r\n\r\namount to half a million dollars this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further big programme for the erection of over\r\n\r\n100 bus shelters throughout the Island has recently\r\n\r\nbeen approved, and up to $200,000 will be spent  on\r\n\r\nthis work this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 30,200 people engaged in farming\r\n\r\nand  fishing in Singapore. Although the  number  is\r\n\r\nsmall, their production is considerable. This group\r\n\r\nof   workers   annually   produce   750,000   pigs,\r\n\r\n204,000,000   eggs,  18,500,000  fowls,   480,000\r\n\r\ngallons  of milk, 34,000 tons of vegetables,  1,800\r\n\r\ntons of fruit, 340 tons of tobacco and 11,300 tons\r\n\r\nof fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are interesting figures and they show\r\n\r\nthat,   given  the  opportunity, facilities,   the\r\n\r\ncorrect  environment, our people can  devote  their\r\n\r\nenergies to productive work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25,000 farmers in Singapore now occupy about\r\n\r\n16,500  acres  of  land  for  the  cultivation   of\r\n\r\nvegetables  and  the rearing of livestock.  Another\r\n\r\n19,000   acres  is  used  for  rubber  and  coconut\r\n\r\nplantations.  Expansion  in  farming,  however,  is\r\n\r\nlimited  because  of  the  shortage  of  land;  and\r\n\r\nfurther  settlement on land is curtailed since  the\r\n\r\nuse  of marginal land for agriculture must give way\r\n\r\nto  more economically productive uses such  as  for\r\n\r\nindustry  and  housing.  Any  further  advance  and\r\n\r\nprogress  in  agriculture, animal  husbandry,  etc.\r\n\r\nmust therefore be qualitative. It is the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to assist farmers, and this  policy\r\n\r\nmust  be  based on teaching new techniques  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers   so   that  their  output   will   improve\r\n\r\nquantitatively as well as qualitatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation to give farmers better\r\n\r\nsecurity  of tenure means that in those areas  best\r\n\r\nsuited   for   agriculture  and  animal  husbandry,\r\n\r\nfarmers should be given long leases and so have the\r\n\r\nassurance   that  they  will  not  be  evicted   or\r\n\r\ndisturbed  for the period of the lease.  The  areas\r\n\r\nare mainly those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarked   in  the  Master  Plan  as  suitable   for\r\n\r\nagriculture as well as other isolated pockets. The\r\n\r\nultimate use of marginal lands, i.e., those  which\r\n\r\nhave   poorer   soil   and   which   have   lesser\r\n\r\nagricultural  economic  value,  must  be   weighed\r\n\r\nultimately  between the needs of  agriculture  and\r\n\r\nother  more productive uses, such as industry  and\r\n\r\nhousing.   Eventually, however,  in  \"land-hungry\r\n\r\nSingapore\" only good land can be reserved for long\r\n\r\nleases. On such suitable land, long leases will be\r\n\r\nof benefit to farmers and would provide inducement\r\n\r\nfor  more  improved farming techniques.  In  those\r\n\r\nareas  which  have to give place  to  industry  or\r\n\r\nhousing, provision of compensation along the lines\r\n\r\nof  the present Government scheme is to be written\r\n\r\ninto  the  new legislation. This legislation  will\r\n\r\ncome  before the Assembly in due course. It is  in\r\n\r\nthis  manner that this Government will ensure that\r\n\r\nthe interests of the farmers are protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will assist vegetable gardeners by\r\n\r\nusing  tractors to help them plough  the  land  in\r\n\r\npreparation for planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme to assist the fishermen is now being\r\n\r\nstudied  and  it  is intended to hire  at  nominal\r\n\r\ncharge   outboard  diesel  motors.   A   fisheries\r\n\r\ntraining scheme for boys living in the rural areas\r\n\r\nwill  also be conducted. In order to assist  Malay\r\n\r\nfishermen  living  in  the  Southern  Islands   to\r\n\r\nsupplement   their  income,  the   Government   is\r\n\r\nconsidering a scheme to distribute female goats to\r\n\r\nthem for rearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come to eggs and egg laying. It is a\r\n\r\npity  that the Member for Joo Chiat is not present\r\n\r\nthis  evening. It is presumed that he is having  a\r\n\r\nbusy  time with his hens. Sir, the Member for  Jon\r\n\r\nChiat  is no chicken in the political field. After\r\n\r\nall,  he  was  one of the founder Members  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front. The Member for Cairnhill will  bear\r\n\r\nme out. We are glad that after a year's silence he\r\n\r\nhas made his maiden speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All farmers know that when a hen has laid an\r\n\r\negg,   it   announces  the  event  with  quite   a\r\n\r\ntremendous  amount  of  fluttering  of  wings  and\r\n\r\nclucking,  a sort of maiden speech in the  poultry\r\n\r\nworld. It is true\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat some white Leghorns do lay more than 200 eggs\r\n\r\nper  year,  but these are champion  birds.  The\r\n\r\naverage white Leghorn lays 180 eggs per year,  but\r\n\r\nafter some time of residence like expatriates in a\r\n\r\ntropical   climate,  their  egg-laying  propensity\r\n\r\ndiminishes,  because they cannot get acclimatised.\r\n\r\nNo  doubt the chicken is not as good as the mother\r\n\r\nhen, and it is no use, Sir, laying eggs which  are\r\n\r\nnot  in popular demand. White Leghorn eggs do  not\r\n\r\nsell  readily in the local market for some  reason\r\n\r\nor other. Because they cannot sell their eggs, the\r\n\r\nfarmers  themselves show no enthusiasm  for  white\r\n\r\nLeghorn   egg-layers.   The  Government   research\r\n\r\nstation at Sembawang has succeeded in producing  a\r\n\r\ncrossbreed that will lay 180 eggs per year. It  is\r\n\r\ntwice  the  output of the local fowl.  These  eggs\r\n\r\nfulfill  the  local demand for colour and  flavour\r\n\r\nand, therefore, find a ready market. Moreover, the\r\n\r\nnew  strain  is  smaller than the Leghorn  or  the\r\n\r\nHampshire. It costs less to rear them and, at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, they are productive for their size. But\r\n\r\negg-laying, Mr Speaker, is not only a science. It\r\n\r\nis  also  an  art. The Member for Joo  Chiat  will\r\n\r\nconfirm  this.  The pullets of  hens  have  to  be\r\n\r\npersuaded to increase the production of eggs.  One\r\n\r\nway  of  coaxing the hens to lay more eggs  is  to\r\n\r\nkeep  them in artificial daylight, sort of  making\r\n\r\nthem  work overtime. But there are some hens which\r\n\r\nwill  just not lay at all, unless there  are  male\r\n\r\nbirds or cockerels around to coax them. Even  hens\r\n\r\nhave their vanity. The Member for Jon Chiat claims\r\n\r\nto  produce  280  eggs  per  year.  Sir,  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething   to   cluck  about.  He   is   in   the\r\n\r\nchampionship class. We do not know how he  manages\r\n\r\nit,   but  the  Government  research  station   at\r\n\r\nSembawang  would very much welcome  his  services,\r\n\r\nand experimental hens at the station will no doubt\r\n\r\nlook  forward to a demonstration from  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Joo Chiat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I  wish to draw  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Member for the Southern Islands, who\r\n\r\nhas   said  that  he  views  with  suspicion   the\r\n\r\nGovernment led by the People's Action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty. Mr Speaker, he says the reason is that  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party, which holds  the  reins  of\r\n\r\nGovernment,  is  not  positive  in  its  stand   on\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and  its action against  Communism  is\r\n\r\nnegative.  What does that mean? Is the  Member  for\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands suggesting that we be positive\r\n\r\nto  the extent that we could use aeroplanes to drop\r\n\r\nbombs,   rifles  and  other  weapons?  It  is   not\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to wait until the Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern   Islands   has  faith   in   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the past, the Member for the Southern Islands has often mentioned the Malays, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  would hate the P.A.P. But  this  method\r\n\r\nwhich  he  has adopted in the past was  a  failure.\r\n\r\nThis  time,  by using a new tactic to besmirch  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party, which holds  the  reins  of\r\n\r\nGovernment,   by  using  a  phraseology   such   as\r\n\r\n\"suspicion  and not positive in its action  towards\r\n\r\nCommunism\", he hopes it will mislead the Malays and\r\n\r\nthe people of Islam so that they will be influenced\r\n\r\nby  him.  However, this time, the Malays, including\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Islam and other  races,  will  not\r\n\r\nbelieve him, because the P.A.P. has made efforts in\r\n\r\nthe  religious  field and in matters affecting  the\r\n\r\nMalays, whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  be  in  the Southern Islands or not.  Efforts\r\n\r\nhave also been made to provide them with houses, as\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister. I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  and the Muslim people will not  follow\r\n\r\nthe  advice  or  take the attitude  that  has  been\r\n\r\nadopted  by  the  Member for the Southern  Islands,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  we  do so, the Malays and  the  Muslim\r\n\r\npeople themselves will stand to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in addition, I would like to touch a little on matters which have become heated over the\r\n\r\npast months. They concern the 16 resolutions put up\r\n\r\nby the Hong Lim Branch of the P.A.P. and which were\r\n\r\nraised here by the Member for Hong Lim, Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan.
