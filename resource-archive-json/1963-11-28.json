It is characteristic of\r\n\r\nour  bustling and dynamic City State that  each  of\r\n\r\nthese  budgets  appeared under  markedly  different\r\n\r\ncircumstances from its predecessor. Once again this\r\n\r\nholds  true this year for the present Budget  which\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  is  considering.  This  Budget   is\r\n\r\nconsidered  when  Singapore  is  now  a   part   of\r\n\r\nindependent Malaysia. Being the first Budget  under\r\n\r\nthe  new Federation of Malaysia, the Estimates show\r\n\r\nin detail the operations of the financial agreement\r\n\r\nof   merger,  that  is  to  say,  the  division  of\r\n\r\ndepartments  and responsibilities  as  between  the\r\n\r\nState  and the Centre and the division of  revenues\r\n\r\nbetween the State and the Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, this would in itself be\r\n\r\na memorable occasion. However, the establishment of\r\n\r\nMalaysia   has  brought  about  the  severance   of\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  relations between Malaysia and  two  of\r\n\r\nour  neighbours, the Philippines anti Indonesia  as\r\n\r\nwell as the suspension\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  trade  between  Malaysia and  Indonesia.  Since\r\n\r\nSingapore  is the most important trading centre  in\r\n\r\nthis  region  and since we depend to a considerable\r\n\r\nextent  on the entrepot trade, it follows that  the\r\n\r\ntrade  severance  will  have  important  and   far-reaching  effects.  I propose  to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\nsubject in some detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I wish to undertake a brief review of\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions in 1963. After the  Referendum\r\n\r\nin September, 1962, much of the uncertainties which\r\n\r\nthen prevailed in Singapore were dispelled and with\r\n\r\na  new  upsurge of confidence, there was a  decided\r\n\r\nimprovement in trade as well as private  investment\r\n\r\nand   public  investment.  The  State's  Four  Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan gathered momentum in all fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indications are that for the first nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  1963 Singapore was having a substantial\r\n\r\nrate of economic expansion. Bank deposits increased\r\n\r\nfrom  an average of $984 million in 1962 to  $1,090\r\n\r\nmillion  by  the end of September this  year.  Bank\r\n\r\nloans and advances show an increase of 18 per  cent\r\n\r\nfrom  $707  million  in 1962  to  $786  million  by\r\n\r\nSeptember  this year. All the other  indicators  of\r\n\r\ntrade, shipping, building and construction point to\r\n\r\na  picture of a thriving economy. For instance, the\r\n\r\nvalue  of our imports which average $336 million  a\r\n\r\nmonth  in  1962  increased by 8 per  cent  to  $364\r\n\r\nmillion per month over the first three quarters  of\r\n\r\nthis  year.  A similar increase of 8 per  cent  was\r\n\r\nexperienced  in the value of our exports.  Shipping\r\n\r\nfigures  also  show corresponding increases,  cargo\r\n\r\nloaded increasing from 639 thousand tons per  month\r\n\r\nin  1961  to  716 thousand per month in  1963.  For\r\n\r\ncargo  discharged the figures were  1,117  thousand\r\n\r\ntons per month for 1962 and 1,206 thousand tons for\r\n\r\n1963.  There  was  a 15 per cent  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  new motor-cars,  a  16  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease in the registration of new trucks, and  45\r\n\r\nper  cent  increase in the registration  of  motor-cycles and scooters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can quote many other figures, but I think\r\n\r\nI  have established the point - which will not be in\r\n\r\nserious dispute - that up to Malaysia Day Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeared to be heading for an unprecedented rate of\r\n\r\neconomic  expansion.  While Malaysia  gave  us  our\r\n\r\nindependence,  it  also brought in  its  train  the\r\n\r\nhostility   of  our  neighbour,  the  Republic   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   After  the  severance  of   diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations  between  the  two  countries,  Indonesia\r\n\r\ndecided to suspend trade relations as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Indonesian Confrontation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Indonesian Government to\r\n\r\nsuspend trade relations with Malaysia was motivated\r\n\r\nby   political  considerations  arising  from   her\r\n\r\nhostility  towards the establishment  of  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThis  policy  stems from a fear that a  progressive\r\n\r\nand prosperous Malaysia may have, from her point of\r\n\r\nview, an undesirable impact on some islands of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to understand the full implications of\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  confrontation,  it  is  necessary   to\r\n\r\nexamine the traditional Indonesian attitude towards\r\n\r\ntrade  with  Malaysia, particularly her trade  with\r\n\r\nSingapore which forms the bulk of this trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian Government had for more than a\r\n\r\ndecade looked with suspicion and resentment at  the\r\n\r\nvolume  of  Indonesian  goods  which  were  handled\r\n\r\nthrough the port of Singapore on their way  to  the\r\n\r\nmarkets  of  the world. The imports  concerned  are\r\n\r\nprincipally tropical produce such as rubber, copra,\r\n\r\ncoffee,  rattan, pepper, timber and other  products\r\n\r\ngrown  or cultivated in the islands of Sumatra  and\r\n\r\nin  South  Kalimantan. These products are grown  in\r\n\r\nthe  hinterland of these two territories  and  they\r\n\r\nfind their way to the river ports, from whence they\r\n\r\nare   transported  in  small  coastal  vessels   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logistics of the situation make these\r\n\r\nIndonesian territories dependent on external  lines\r\n\r\nof  sea  communications for the movement  of  these\r\n\r\nproducts.   Singapore,  because  of   its   central\r\n\r\nposition,  serves as the central market  for  these\r\n\r\nproducts.  Further, there is not only the  question\r\n\r\nof  physical  transportation but also the  need  to\r\n\r\nprocess and grade these products to conform to  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the world market. And,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  course,  a substantial and complex  network  of\r\n\r\nbusiness and financial relations grew up to support\r\n\r\nand  sustain  the  trade.  The  trade  is  of  long\r\n\r\nstanding,  its origin going back virtually  to  the\r\n\r\nfounding of Singapore in 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that with the foundation of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic of Indonesia in 1949, a review of her\r\n\r\ntraditional marketing pattern must take place.  New\r\n\r\nNationalist  Governments, for good or bad  reasons,\r\n\r\nstrive  to be self-sufficient in economic  matters.\r\n\r\nIt is not unexpected that the Indonesian Government\r\n\r\nwould  take  a  series of measures by which  direct\r\n\r\ntrading  contacts will be made between the Republic\r\n\r\nand   the  rest  of  the  world  thereby  bypassing\r\n\r\nSingapore. For example, the best grades  of  rubber\r\n\r\nsuch  as R.s.s. 1 and R.s.s. 2 were not allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe  exported direct to Singapore. Only  the  poorer\r\n\r\ngrades  were  permitted. Similarly, the Indonesians\r\n\r\nimposed  a ban on the export of copra from Sulawesi\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  We  could only  obtain  copra  from\r\n\r\nSumatra  and the neighbouring islands on  a  barter\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian Government continued the agreement\r\n\r\nof 1947 concluded between the Dutch and the British\r\n\r\nGovernments  whereby the proceeds of  exports  from\r\n\r\nIndonesia through Singapore could be made available\r\n\r\nto   the  Indonesian  Government  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nconvertible U.S. dollars. In the immediate post-war\r\n\r\nyears when sterling was a soft currency and subject\r\n\r\nto rigid exchange control, this was of considerable\r\n\r\nadvantage  to  Indonesia. So  long  as  the  rupiah\r\n\r\nremained  a  stable  currency  there  would  be  no\r\n\r\nparticular  difficulty for Indonesia to obtain  her\r\n\r\nfull  proceeds of foreign exchange earnings.  When,\r\n\r\nhowever,   the  financial  position  in   Indonesia\r\n\r\ndeteriorated as a result of inflationary  practices\r\n\r\nadopted by the Government, the rupiah weakened  and\r\n\r\ninducement  to  export  capital  through  non-legal\r\n\r\nchannels became increasingly greater. One method by\r\n\r\nwhich  capital can be exported without the  consent\r\n\r\nof  the authorities is through the foreign trade by\r\n\r\nover-invoicing and under-invoicing of  imports  and\r\n\r\nexports   respectively.  So   a   growing   concern\r\n\r\ndeveloped in Indonesia over her foreign trade with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya  and with Singapore in particular in  regard\r\n\r\nto  foreign exchange losses. Matters came to a head\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  PRRI revolt in  Sumatra  and  other\r\n\r\nislands  of  Indonesia in 1958. The rebel  movement\r\n\r\nexported  large  quantities  of  rubber  and  copra\r\n\r\nthrough  Malaysian  ports  for  which  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment received no payment in foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Indonesian Trade Agreement, 1961</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. Government assumed office in\r\n\r\n1959,   it   was  obvious  that  the  question   of\r\n\r\nnormalising trade relations with Indonesia  had  to\r\n\r\nbe accepted as being of great urgency. Accordingly,\r\n\r\none  of  the  first acts of the Government  was  to\r\n\r\napproach  the Indonesian Government for discussions\r\n\r\non  normalisation  of trade relations.  Previously,\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial administration had taken the attitude\r\n\r\nthat   the  safeguarding  of  Indonesia's   foreign\r\n\r\nexchange was entirely a matter for the Republic and\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  could not be held responsible  for\r\n\r\nbreaches    of   customs   and   foreign   exchange\r\n\r\nregulations through activities originating  at  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government adopted a more realistic\r\n\r\nand  more  sympathetic approach to the problem.  We\r\n\r\ntook   cognizance  of  the  fact  that  substantial\r\n\r\nleakages  occurred and that we should do everything\r\n\r\nthat  lay  within our power to reduce or  eliminate\r\n\r\nthese  leakages. The Indonesian Government had  all\r\n\r\nalong pressed for strict control measures and their\r\n\r\nattitude was made clear as far back as 1955 when  a\r\n\r\nSingapore trade mission visited Jakarta.  The  same\r\n\r\ndemands were made in 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain difficulties, however, stood in the way\r\n\r\nof  accepting the full proposals of the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment.  First,  if Singapore  were  to  impose\r\n\r\ncomplete control over her entrepot trade this would\r\n\r\nnot  be  of  value to Indonesia if it  led  to  the\r\n\r\ndiversion  of the entrepot trade from Singapore  to\r\n\r\nother  ports  of  Asia.  Control  measures  of  the\r\n\r\nstringency that the Indonesians had in mind  to  be\r\n\r\neffective   had   to   be   mounted   through    an\r\n\r\ninternational agreement with several governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian officials proposed an extensive\r\n\r\nregime  of control including joint customs patrols,\r\n\r\ncomplete  examination  of  cargoes,  licensing   of\r\n\r\ntraders  and so forth. It was pointed out  to  them\r\n\r\nthat  the customs administration in Singapore  does\r\n\r\nnot  have  the capacity to mount the controls  that\r\n\r\nwere  sought. Further, such controls may  have  the\r\n\r\neffect of completely paralysing Singapore's trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put forward a counter proposal which, if\r\n\r\naccepted,   would  go  a  long   way   to   solving\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  problem of foreign exchange  leakages.\r\n\r\nBriefly,  the  basic object of our  scheme  was  to\r\n\r\neliminate   any  advantage  which  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nexporter   would  have  to  contravene  Indonesia's\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  regulations,  and  to  give  the\r\n\r\nexporter  adequate incentive to accept  payment  in\r\n\r\nrupiahs  in  Indonesia while delivering the  export\r\n\r\nproceeds   of  hard  currency  to  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nexchange  control. This was to be  done  under  our\r\n\r\nscheme by the issue to the Indonesian exporter of a\r\n\r\ncounter-import certificate to the value of  60  per\r\n\r\ncent of the products exported. These counter-import\r\n\r\ncertificates  could be used to import  freely  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  the consumer goods which were  in  short\r\n\r\nsupply in Indonesia. These would fetch a high price\r\n\r\nin  the free market and the exporter would then  be\r\n\r\nable   to  make  substantial  profits  either  from\r\n\r\nimporting  these  commodities  themselves   or   by\r\n\r\nselling  the counter-import certificates  to  other\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  in  Indonesia.  The  prices  of  these\r\n\r\ncertificates   would  then  be   related   to   the\r\n\r\nprofitability of imports and this, in  turn,  would\r\n\r\nreflect   the  relative  scarcities  of  goods   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our proposed scheme, the Indonesian\r\n\r\nexporter  would be reimbursed with 40 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  value of Indonesian exports to Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  60  per  cent will  be  held  back  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  banks and this will be used to  pay  for\r\n\r\npurchases  made from Singapore. In return Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  mount  the necessary controls to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere are no leakages. Regrettably, the scheme that\r\n\r\nwe   outlined   to   the  Indonesians   was   found\r\n\r\nunacceptable  on the grounds that the  question  of\r\n\r\nincentives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  their  exporters was a matter  solely  for  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government to decide. As  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ninterest,   in  late  1962,  when  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment  introduced measures  to  stabilise  the\r\n\r\nrupiah  they  adopted  a scheme  of  counter-import\r\n\r\ncertificates not dissimilar to the one that we have\r\n\r\nproposed  to  them.  However, these  measures  were\r\n\r\nrelated to Indonesian exports in general and  there\r\n\r\nwas   no  particular  tie  up  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nexchange control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our inability to accept the\r\n\r\ncontrol  measures proposed by the  Indonesians  and\r\n\r\nthe  inability  of the Indonesians  to  accept  our\r\n\r\ncounter-proposals,  the trade agreement  which  was\r\n\r\nsigned  between the two governments  in  1961  left\r\n\r\nthese  matters  open. The agreement  sets  out  the\r\n\r\ngeneral objectives to be pursued in trade relations\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two  countries and  both  Governments\r\n\r\nagreed  to endeavour, within the limits of its  own\r\n\r\nlaws,  to assist in putting the trade on a  healthy\r\n\r\nbasis.  On  Singapore's part,  we  urged  upon  our\r\n\r\nmerchants  the  necessity for correct  transactions\r\n\r\nand,  in  certain  cases, assisted  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nexchange control in prosecuting certain cases where\r\n\r\nviolations  of  Singapore's laws  had  concurrently\r\n\r\ntaken place. The trade agreement was the best  that\r\n\r\ncould  be  reached  at  that  time  and  under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  then prevailing.  It  led  to  rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth  of trade between the two countries both  in\r\n\r\nregard to import and export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, our imports of rubber, by far the\r\n\r\nmost important commodity, showed an increase : -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre> \r\n\r\n                1960               285,000 tons\r\n\r\n                1961               332,000 tons\r\n\r\n                1962               375,000 tons\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our exports, consisting of rice and foodstuffs,\r\n\r\ntextiles, building materials and other consumer\r\n\r\ngoods also increased. In money terms they were: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                1960              $ 121 million\r\n\r\n                1961              $ 194 million\r\n\r\n                1962              $ 293 million\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1962, i.e. last year, the earnings of our\r\n\r\nimport and export trade with Indonesia had been  of\r\n\r\ngreat value to us. The earnings on trade alone  are\r\n\r\nestimated at $184 million in 1962, while\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  ships earn another $25 million, making a total\r\n\r\nof  $209  million. This represents 8.7 per cent  of\r\n\r\nour national income of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July this year, in view of worsening relations\r\n\r\nbetween  the Governments of Indonesia and Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe  Government undertook a study of  the  possible\r\n\r\nimpacts of the suspension of trade between the  two\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies are still continuing to assess the\r\n\r\neffects of economic confrontation, Apart from  loss\r\n\r\nof earnings and a net reduction of national income,\r\n\r\nthe  employment  situation is also  affected.  Some\r\n\r\n8,200  workers directly affected by cutting off  of\r\n\r\nsupplies of rubber and other produce and the laying\r\n\r\nup of ships may eventually lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest available figures show that 901\r\n\r\nworkers   and   seamen  are  on  the   Government's\r\n\r\nemergency  scheme whereby employers and  Government\r\n\r\neach pay one-third of the worker's normal wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Indonesia cannot escape the economic\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  her  own  policy.   Her   foreign\r\n\r\nexchange earnings which are already in a precarious\r\n\r\nstate  will  be  further reduced by  suspension  of\r\n\r\nexports  to Singapore. The withdrawal of Singapore-based  \r\n\r\nships  from Indonesian waters has  caused  a\r\n\r\nsevere dislocation in the Indonesian transportation\r\n\r\nsystem. This has resulted in an accumulation of raw\r\n\r\nmaterials at Indonesian ports and an acute shortage\r\n\r\nof  rice and other imported consumer goods.  It  is\r\n\r\ncommon  knowledge  that  the  immediate  impact  of\r\n\r\neconomic  confrontation has brought  about  greater\r\n\r\ndisarray  on  the  Indonesians themselves  than  on\r\n\r\ntheir  adversaries.  Food prices  have  doubled  or\r\n\r\nmore,  prices of their export goods have  declined,\r\n\r\nand in the free market the price of rupiah weakened\r\n\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as our own position is concerned, the\r\n\r\nseverance  of trade between Indonesia and ourselves\r\n\r\nhas  brought  about  an adverse  situation.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant that we see this position in its  correct\r\n\r\nperspective. The loss of income at the rate of $209\r\n\r\nmillion  a  year  or 8.7 per cent of  the  national\r\n\r\nincome represents a severe blow to our economy  and\r\n\r\nit is no use for anyone to pretend that this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a trivial matter. Having said this, I also want\r\n\r\nto make it clear beyond all doubt that severance of\r\n\r\ntrade  with  Indonesia  will  not  bring  about  an\r\n\r\neconomic collapse in Singapore or anything remotely\r\n\r\napproaching it. Severe though its effects are,  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Singapore is in a sufficiently  robust\r\n\r\nstate to ride confrontation. I shall deal with this\r\n\r\naspect in more detail after I have made a review of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic growth in the last few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Defence</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to turn now to the more immediate and\r\n\r\npressing  problems  created by  this  severance  of\r\n\r\ntrade.  The  Singapore Government had decided  upon\r\n\r\ncertain  measures once the confrontation policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian Government has been assessed by  us\r\n\r\nas being likely to be of long duration. The earlier\r\n\r\nstudies  made  in July indicated the need  to  take\r\n\r\npositive  counter-measures, particularly to  combat\r\n\r\nunemployment.  The  first  step  was  therefore  to\r\n\r\nensure that those who are more severely hit by  the\r\n\r\ntrade suspension and who are most vulnerable to its\r\n\r\neffects  should  be given a measure of  protection.\r\n\r\nThese are the seamen on ships on the Indonesian run\r\n\r\nand workers who are directly employed in industries\r\n\r\nwhich  process  the  raw  materials  imported  from\r\n\r\nIndonesia and whose supplies are now cut off. These\r\n\r\nare  the  rubber mills, rubber packing and  grading\r\n\r\nestablishments, coconut oil mills, sago  factories,\r\n\r\nprocessing  of  coffee, rattan. In all  121  firms,\r\n\r\nincluding  shipping firms, are  affected  and  they\r\n\r\ngive  a total employment of 10,800. As I have  said\r\n\r\nbefore, some 8,200 will eventually be laid  off  as\r\n\r\nstocks of raw materials get exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this afternoon, I introduced two Bills to\r\n\r\ngive  legal authority for the measures to be  taken\r\n\r\nto   protect   workers  affected   by   the   trade\r\n\r\nsuspension. At the Second Reading of these Bills  I\r\n\r\nshall  go  into greater detail into their contents.\r\n\r\nHere  I  shall  confine  myself  to  their  general\r\n\r\nnature. The first Bill, the Economic Defence  Bill,\r\n\r\nallows a worker laid off as a result of closure  of\r\n\r\nhis factory to receive 6 months' income at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  his  normal earnings.  This  scheme  is\r\n\r\nalready in operation on a voluntary basis with  the\r\n\r\nfull  co-operation  of  employers  and  responsible\r\n\r\ntrade union leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payments made by the Department of Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  to workers are intended to tide them  over\r\n\r\nfor a period of time during which, if confrontation\r\n\r\nis  not  called off, it would be necessary to  find\r\n\r\nthese  workers  some other suitable employment.  To\r\n\r\nachieve this with the minimum amount of dislocation\r\n\r\nto  business and the minimum delay to the  workers,\r\n\r\nit  is necessary for the Government to have certain\r\n\r\npowers  to  direct  employment.  These  powers  are\r\n\r\nsought  in  the  Economic  Defence  (Direction   of\r\n\r\nEmployment) Bill, the second Bill to be  introduced\r\n\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of employment is a novelty in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Government is aware of the  dangers\r\n\r\nof   misuse  of  authority  in  the  direction   of\r\n\r\nemployment.  I wish to assure the public  that  the\r\n\r\nutmost  care  will  be  taken in  implementing  the\r\n\r\nprovisions   of  the  Bill  to  ensure   that   the\r\n\r\nindustries absorbing the workers laid off will  not\r\n\r\nbe  injured  or rendered inefficient by  having  to\r\n\r\nemploy  an  unsuitable  working  force.  There  are\r\n\r\nsufficient safeguards in the Bill for the rights of\r\n\r\nboth  employers  and employees. But  basically  the\r\n\r\noperation   will  succeed  only  by  sensible   co-operation  \r\n\r\nbetween  all parties concerned,  labour,\r\n\r\nemployers  and the Government, with the  object  of\r\n\r\nworking the scheme successfully. I shall deal  with\r\n\r\nthese  matters in more detail at the Second Reading\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ancillary to these emergency measures, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   intends   to   expand   the   training\r\n\r\nfacilities  now  available in the State.  For  some\r\n\r\ntime,  this  subject has been under  consideration,\r\n\r\nbut  it has been made all the more urgent under the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  confrontation  when  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nworkers   may  have  to  be  re-deployed   to   new\r\n\r\nemployment  for  which they must be given  adequate\r\n\r\ntraining.  Apart from this, the expansion  of  some\r\n\r\nindustries has already been retarded by the lack of\r\n\r\nadequate  numbers  of suitable  grades  of  skilled\r\n\r\nlabour. The shipbreaking industry in Singapore, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstance,  is  unable  to  expand  because  of  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  certain  grades  of  workers  and   a\r\n\r\ntraining programme has now commenced to train these\r\n\r\ngrades of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance to Businessmen</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two measures I described will be sufficient,\r\n\r\nfor  the  time  being at any rate, to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterest   of   the   workers.  The   interest   of\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  must  also  be  considered.   I   have\r\n\r\ndiscussed  a  plan with officers  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board whereby special arrangements will\r\n\r\nbe  made  to make it easy for owners and management\r\n\r\nof  establishments affected by the confrontation to\r\n\r\ngain  an  entry  into the new industries  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing planned for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme has three aspects. The first covers\r\n\r\nequity   participation  in  some  large  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises which have been planned by the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  and are in  various  stages  of\r\n\r\nimplementation.  The  industries  include  a  sugar\r\n\r\nrefinery,  a fertiliser plant, a solvent extraction\r\n\r\nplant,   an   iron   ore   loading   terminal   and\r\n\r\nbenefication  plant,  a grain silo  operation,  the\r\n\r\nJurong shipyard and others. The total share capital\r\n\r\nin  these projects exceeds $65 million. It will  be\r\n\r\npossible to reserve a portion of the share  capital\r\n\r\nfor   subscription  by  owners  of   establishments\r\n\r\naffected  by  the  trade suspension.  The  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board  itself  will   be   a   direct\r\n\r\nparticipant in most of these enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a number of small promising\r\n\r\nindustries which have been carefully studied by the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board. These include a bicycle\r\n\r\nassembly  and  manufacturing plant, a  fruit  juice\r\n\r\ncannery,  meat processing, manufacture of preserved\r\n\r\nginger,  mosquito  coils, building  hardware,  fire\r\n\r\ncrackers,   plastics,  automobile  components   and\r\n\r\nothers.  In  most  cases,  the  capital  investment\r\n\r\nranges  from  $100,000  to $500,000.  The  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board  will  provide  technical   and\r\n\r\nmanagerial   assistance   in   establishing   these\r\n\r\nindustries.  However, the businessmen who  wish  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in these enterprises should be prepared\r\n\r\nto  give  their full attention to both the planning\r\n\r\nand operation of these enterprises. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould   contribute  not  only   money   but   also\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, some of the businessmen affected may\r\n\r\nwish  to pool their resources together and form  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  investment company to undertake  equity\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  industrial  enterprises  and  to\r\n\r\npromote  new  industries. The Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  is  prepared to provide technical assistance\r\n\r\nin the organisation of such a new project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all the firms affected by confrontation\r\n\r\nare  local businessmen. Their establishments  range\r\n\r\nfrom  small-sized grading and processing plants  to\r\n\r\nsubstantial  industrial  undertakings.  We   should\r\n\r\nremember  that just over twelve years ago  Hongkong\r\n\r\nexperienced  a  similar need  to  re-orientate  her\r\n\r\neconomy from a purely trading port to an industrial\r\n\r\neconomy.  The  success which Hongkong  achieved  in\r\n\r\neffecting  this  change has been a spectacular  one\r\n\r\nand  there  is no reason why we in Singapore,  with\r\n\r\nthe  advantage  of  a  protected  Malaysian  common\r\n\r\nmarket, cannot do even better. The businessmen  now\r\n\r\naffected  by confrontation are in a better position\r\n\r\nthan their Hongkong counterparts were a decade ago.\r\n\r\nThey  have  the  advantage of  positive  Government\r\n\r\nassistance   and  the  services  of  an   effective\r\n\r\nindustrial  promotion agency. I  shall  be  holding\r\n\r\nmeetings  with  them  shortly to  discuss  in  more\r\n\r\ndetailed  and concrete terms the general  proposals\r\n\r\nwhich I have outlined to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interests of our local shipping companies\r\n\r\nalso deserve protection. Various possible ways  are\r\n\r\nbeing investigated with a view to ensuring that the\r\n\r\nships  which used to ply in Indonesia are not  laid\r\n\r\nup too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the measures of economic defence which\r\n\r\nthe  Government is taking in the face of Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  What  the  Indonesians  have   done\r\n\r\namounts to waging economic war on Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot watch passively any action that is\r\n\r\nbeing  or will be undertaken by any foreign country\r\n\r\nwhich  assists Indonesia in pursuing her policy  of\r\n\r\neconomic confrontation to our detriment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a free and open market  to  all  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries  in  the  world.  The   large\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries  have  an  export  market  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  of $300 million a year or more.  Even  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country  like Holland has an  export  market\r\n\r\nhere of $70 million a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian market is more than twice this. Any\r\n\r\nprofit  which  the businessmen of  these  countries\r\n\r\nhope  to  obtain by assisting Indonesia  either  by\r\n\r\nsupplying  ships or by direct purchases  of  rubber\r\n\r\nand  other  tropical produce for re-export  and  by\r\n\r\nmanagerial  and  technical  assistance  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthese  ends  can only be marginal. It would  derive\r\n\r\nfrom  the margin between low prices of produce  now\r\n\r\naccumulating  in  Indonesian ports  and  the  world\r\n\r\nprices for these products. These countries will  do\r\n\r\nwell to balance the possible profits from hazarding\r\n\r\ninto Indonesia against the earnings which they  now\r\n\r\nenjoy  from  their  established  export  market  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

The goods  will  be  placed\r\n\r\nunder  a  system of specific licensing and  may  be\r\n\r\nbanned.  The interest of our own local traders  who\r\n\r\nhave  links with that country will be protected  by\r\n\r\nallowing  them  the  quota of imports  of  licensed\r\n\r\ncommodities, provided these goods are imported from\r\n\r\nany other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial Position, 1963</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to a review of the financial position\r\n\r\nin  1963.  There  arc  two  special  points  to  be\r\n\r\nmentioned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Expenditure for the first half of this year\r\n\r\nwas met from a vote on account: and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the apportionment of certain revenues and\r\n\r\nexpenditure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Central  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nState after Malaysia Day on 16th September.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure by a vote on account, there is\r\n\r\nnothing  much  to comment, except that  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nmention   that   no   special   difficulties   were\r\n\r\nencountered.  All  Ministries by judicious  control\r\n\r\nover  expenditure managed to keep within the limits\r\n\r\nallowed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Malaysia Day, the Central Government is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  expenditure  of  Departments\r\n\r\ndealing  with Federal matters. Certain revenues  on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand are apportioned between the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the State on the basis  of  40  per\r\n\r\ncent  and 60 per cent. As an interim measure  until\r\n\r\nthe end of the year, the State continues to pay for\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure  of  the  Federal  Departments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore on behalf of the Federal Government, from\r\n\r\nthe  portion  of  revenues that is payable  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Malaysia Arrangements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements for the collection of National\r\n\r\nRevenue   in  Singapore  since  Malaysia   Day   in\r\n\r\naccordance   with  agreed  Financial   Arrangements\r\n\r\nrecorded  in Annex J to the Malaysia Act have  been\r\n\r\nproceeding   smoothly.  By  that   Agreement,   all\r\n\r\nNational  Revenues  collected  in  Singapore,  with\r\n\r\ncertain exceptions, were to be paid into a separate\r\n\r\nfund  in  a  branch  of  the  Central  Bank  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished in Singapore. This fund would  then  be\r\n\r\ndivided  in the proportion of 60 per cent  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government and 40 per cent to the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Unfortunately,   owing   to   various\r\n\r\nfactors,  these arrangements could not  be  brought\r\n\r\ninto  operation this year. However, by means of  an\r\n\r\nagreed  Federal Revenues (Singapore)  Order,  1963,\r\n\r\nmade by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong under Article 112\r\n\r\nE  of  the  Federal Constitution, National Revenues\r\n\r\nwere  collected  by the Singapore  Government.  The\r\n\r\nState   Government  then  paid   to   the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  difference between the  Federation\r\n\r\nshare  of  the revenue collected, which is  40  per\r\n\r\ncent,   and  the  actual  expenditure  on   Federal\r\n\r\nDepartments in Singapore. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifference is remitted to the Federal Government at\r\n\r\nthe end of each month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated expenditure on Federal Departments\r\n\r\nin  Singapore has been of the order of $5.5 million\r\n\r\nper month since Malaysia Day. The average estimated\r\n\r\nmonthly  share of revenue accruing to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been about $8 million. The  average\r\n\r\nbalance   of  about  $2.5  million  per  month   is\r\n\r\ntherefore due to the Federal Government since  16th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1963. By the end of this year, a sum  of\r\n\r\n$9.25  million  would  have  been  payable  to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Government  as  a  consequence  of   these\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Revenue and Expenditure Estimates for 1963\r\n\r\nwere  prepared  without  taking  into  account  the\r\n\r\napportionment    with   the   Central    Government\r\n\r\nconsequent  on  Malaysia,  I  shall  for  ease   of\r\n\r\ncomparison  deal with the expenditure  and  revenue\r\n\r\nfor 1963 as though no change had occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key-note for 1963 as far as possible was to\r\n\r\nmaintain  services as they were in anticipation  of\r\n\r\nmerger  arrangements.  Revenue  has,  nevertheless,\r\n\r\nexceeded  the  estimates by $44.5  million.  $454.2\r\n\r\nmillion  of  both  State and National  Revenue  was\r\n\r\nactually  collected  when  we  expected  to  obtain\r\n\r\n$409.7 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from an un-anticipated sum of $25 million\r\n\r\ntransferred  to revenue on account of City  Council\r\n\r\nassets  which  came to Government as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nintegration,  a  further $10 million  was  received\r\n\r\nfrom  the British Government in respect of holdings\r\n\r\nof  State Land by the U.K. Government in Singapore.\r\n\r\nGenerally  good  economic  conditions  account  for\r\n\r\nincreases  in revenue, which reflect the growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy rather than the results of any  change\r\n\r\nin taxation policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection of Income Tax exceeded\r\n\r\nexpectations  by  $4 million. Property  Tax,  Stamp\r\n\r\nDuty  and  Estate Duty taken together yielded  $5.2\r\n\r\nmillion in excess of estimates, Duties collected by\r\n\r\nthe  Customs Department exceeded estimates by  $4.3\r\n\r\nmillion. There was a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmodest increase of $600,000 in Entertainment Duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other notable increases are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) services rendered by the Government - $2.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Interest on Investment - $3.6 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1963 Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure for the year is expected to come to\r\n\r\n$611  million.  This  includes  transfers  to   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund of $230 million  and  $9  million\r\n\r\nbeing  the balance mentioned above which is payable\r\n\r\nto  the  Central Government. By deducting the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil surplus and the $10 million U.K. grant from\r\n\r\nrevenue and capital transfers from expenditure, the\r\n\r\nrevenue for the year will stand at $419 million and\r\n\r\nexpenditure  at $381 million, giving a  surplus  of\r\n\r\n$38  million  to the State. Together  with  the  $9\r\n\r\nmillion  payable  to  the Central  Government,  the\r\n\r\nsurplus of current revenue over current expenditure\r\n\r\namounts  to $47 million, as compared with a surplus\r\n\r\nof  $97.1  million  last year.  This  fall  in  the\r\n\r\nsurplus  of $50 million, in spite of the fact  that\r\n\r\nrevenue  has increased by roughly $11 million  over\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year, reflects  the  steep  rise  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure of $60 million. This rise is partly due\r\n\r\nto  the  expansion  of services especially  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  Education, Police and Defence,  and  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  Television.  Excluding   capital\r\n\r\ntransfers  the total expenditure for  the  year  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  fall short of the original  estimated\r\n\r\nsum of $381.7 million by about $9 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short fall in expenditure of $9 million is\r\n\r\nvery  much smaller than in previous years. This  is\r\n\r\npartly  due to more careful estimating. Expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  most  of  the Heads is expected to  come  very\r\n\r\nclose to the amounts estimated. The only Heads that\r\n\r\nshow  substantial savings are Head 13 - Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, Head 18 - Hospitals Division,\r\n\r\nand  Head  34  - Ministry of  Culture.  The  savings\r\n\r\noccurring  in the Ministry of National  Development\r\n\r\nare   mainly  due  to  under-expenditure  on  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  projects.  The savings  of  the  Hospitals\r\n\r\nDivision and the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Culture are due to the usual reasons,  which  I\r\n\r\nhave explained in previous years, partly because of\r\n\r\nover  estimation and partly because  certain  posts\r\n\r\nwere not filled for the whole year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heads where expenditure is expected to exceed\r\n\r\nthe  original  Estimates are Head 21  - Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance,  Head 22 - Charge on Account of the  Public\r\n\r\nDebt, and Head 39 - Social Welfare. The increase  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure under Ministry of Finance is due to the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  an additional $200 million  from  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated  Fund to the Development  Fund  and  a\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  an expected sum of $9 million,  being\r\n\r\nbalance   of   revenue  payable  to   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. The increase under Charge on Account of\r\n\r\nthe   Public  Debt  is  because  of  sinking   fund\r\n\r\ncontributions and interest on new loans floated  in\r\n\r\n1963.  The  rise  in Social Welfare expenditure  is\r\n\r\ncaused  by  an  increase in public  assistance  and\r\n\r\nexpansion in Community Associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1964 Estimates of Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964 the number of Heads of Expenditure is\r\n\r\nreduced  from  57  in  1963 to 40  because  certain\r\n\r\ndepartments     which    fall     under     Federal\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  in Malaysia no longer  appear  in\r\n\r\nthe    State   estimates.   The   estimated   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure for these 40 Heads including a  capital\r\n\r\ntransfer of $16 million to the Development Fund  is\r\n\r\n$326.4 million. Excluding the capital transfer  the\r\n\r\nestimates of expenditure amount to $310.4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say a few words on the general lay-out of\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates of Expenditure now before the House.\r\n\r\nAt  the cover page, I have introduced an innovation\r\n\r\nin   classifying   expenditure   under   the   main\r\n\r\nfunctional  heads. A classification of  revenue  is\r\n\r\nalso  attempted. Members will at once  notice  that\r\n\r\nthe  bulk  of our expenditure is now on the  Social\r\n\r\nServices.  Two-thirds of the  $300-odd  million  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  spending next year will be on the  Social\r\n\r\nServices. Our function is to see that our  children\r\n\r\nget  the best possible education, that our citizens\r\n\r\nare usefully employed on good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconditions,  that the sick are adequately  treated,\r\n\r\nand  that the families of our citizens are decently\r\n\r\nhoused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1963 Estimates for these 40 Heads of\r\n\r\nExpenditure less capital transfer amount to  $306.5\r\n\r\nmillion.  The total likely to be spent in  1963  is\r\n\r\n$299.6  million.  The increase in  1964  over  1963\r\n\r\nestimates  is  small, although  compared  with  the\r\n\r\namount  likely  to  be spent in 1963  there  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease of approximately $11 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small difference between 1963 and 1964\r\n\r\nestimates is due to an attempt in 1964 to determine\r\n\r\nonly  what will be actually required and to provide\r\n\r\nfor this only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the estimates have been trimmed of all\r\n\r\nmargins,  it  is  likely  that  certain  Heads   of\r\n\r\nExpenditure may require supplementary provisions in\r\n\r\nthe  course  of  the  year if unforeseen  items  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  should occur. The Head of  Expenditure\r\n\r\nthat  will  almost  definitely  require  additional\r\n\r\nfunds   in  1964  is  the  Ministry  of  Education,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  has  the lion's share  of  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the year. The sum of $94.85 million\r\n\r\nprovided under this Head is almost one-third of the\r\n\r\ntotal  estimates of expenditure. Included  in  this\r\n\r\nsum  is  a vote of $8.5 million as contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  University  of Singapore.  This  vote  may  he\r\n\r\nincreased  depending on the outcome of  discussions\r\n\r\nthat will take place between the University and the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Nothing   has   been    entered    as\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the Nanyang University.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  certain related matters  have  yet  to  be\r\n\r\nsettled.  Once  the  difficulties  are  cleared,  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial   sum   will  have  to   be   provided.\r\n\r\nSupplementary provisions are therefore likely to be\r\n\r\nrequired in 1964 in respect of these two items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 40 Heads of Expenditure, the estimates of 17\r\n\r\nHeads are smaller than their 1963 provisions. Of\r\n\r\nthe rest, whose estimates show a rise, only Head 22\r\n\r\n- Charge  on  Account of the Public  Debt,  Head  24\r\n\r\n- Contributions and Charitable Allowances, and  Head 19 - Public   Health  Division,  \r\n\r\nshow   substantial\r\n\r\nincreases. The increases of the rest are small  and\r\n\r\nare due to normal expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1964 Revenue</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to 1964 Revenue. The revenue estimates\r\n\r\nfor  1964  have  been prepared separately  for  the\r\n\r\nState shown on pages 17 to 36 of the 1964 Estimates\r\n\r\nand  for National Revenue shown as Appendices A and\r\n\r\nB on pages 331 to 341 of the 1964 Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimates for 1964 are based on\r\n\r\nactual  revenue realised provisionally in  1963  on\r\n\r\nthe assumption that the general economic conditions\r\n\r\nexisting  in  the State in 1963 will continue.  The\r\n\r\npattern  of  distribution of  revenue  between  the\r\n\r\ndifferent taxes in the 1964 estimates is  the  same\r\n\r\nas for 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  total State Revenue for 1964 amounts to $326.7\r\n\r\nmillion  including  the  State  share  of  national\r\n\r\nrevenue  which  is  60  per cent  of  all  National\r\n\r\nRevenue collected in Singapore. This is expected to\r\n\r\namount   to  $175.6  million.  The  total  National\r\n\r\nRevenue  for  1964 will probably amount  to  $292.7\r\n\r\nmillion. Of this, 60 per cent by agreement will  be\r\n\r\npaid to the State, leaving an estimated balance  of\r\n\r\n$117  million to be paid to the Federal  Government\r\n\r\nfor  1964.  The total combined State  and  National\r\n\r\nRevenue  for  1964  amounts to $443.8  million.  As\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the  Estimated  Revenue  for   1963\r\n\r\namounting  to $409.7 million, the 1964  revenue  is\r\n\r\nincreased by $34.1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increases in the State revenue will be\r\n\r\nobtained  from the following sources: Property  Tax\r\n\r\n$8.2 million, Other Services $3.21 million, Arrears\r\n\r\nof   Contribution  by  the  Federal  Government  on\r\n\r\naccount   of  expenditure  on  the  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore $8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increases in respect of National Revenue\r\n\r\nare with Income Tax $6 million, Selective Sales Tax\r\n\r\n$2.1  million,  Import Duties $6.8  million,  Motor\r\n\r\nVehicle  Road  Tax $1.2 million, Property  Transfer\r\n\r\nTax $2 million, Other Services $1.4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1964 Revenue Proposals</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now deal with the 1964 Revenue proposals. The\r\n\r\nmain change in the revenue pattern next year over\r\n\r\nthis year is an increase of 10 cents per gallon in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  customs duty on motor and aviation spirit  and\r\n\r\nother petroleum having a flash point of below 73\ufffdF.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore the full rates and excise  rates  are\r\n\r\n$1.20  per  gallon. In the Federation the  rate  is\r\n\r\n$1.30.  As  a  first step to the  harmonization  of\r\n\r\nduties with Malaysia, which is to be carried out in\r\n\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Agreement  on\r\n\r\nCommon Market and Financial Arrangements in Annex J\r\n\r\nto the Malaysia Act, the concurrence of the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment,   which  is  responsible  for   customs\r\n\r\nduties,  has been obtained to amend these rates  in\r\n\r\nthe  Customs (Duties) Order, 1962. This will  yield\r\n\r\nan  additional total of $3.2 million by next  year.\r\n\r\nOf  this  amount, $1.9 million or 60 per cent  will\r\n\r\naccrue to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government will make two\r\n\r\nconcessions in the new year. Despite our efforts to\r\n\r\nprovide  large  numbers  of  low-cost  housing   as\r\n\r\nquickly   as  possible,  many  people  for  various\r\n\r\nreasons  are  still living in attap  dwellings.  In\r\n\r\nJanuary  1963  the  property tax on  owner-occupied\r\n\r\nhouses  in the 36 per cent rating area was  reduced\r\n\r\nto  27  per  cent  as an initial  concession.  With\r\n\r\neffect  from 1st January, 1964, the tax  burden  on\r\n\r\nowner-occupied  attap  dwellings  will  be  further\r\n\r\nreduced  to  a concessionary flat rate  of  $6  per\r\n\r\nowner-occupied house per annum. This  will  mean  a\r\n\r\nfall  in the State revenue for this item but, as  I\r\n\r\nstressed  in  my  Budget speech  last  year,  these\r\n\r\nproperties  do not enjoy the benefits  like  roads,\r\n\r\nlighting,   water,  electricity,   that   permanent\r\n\r\ndwellings invariably do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for some time professional boxing in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been in the doldrums. Promotions  of\r\n\r\ngood  fights  have been few and far between.  Those\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the sport claim that  entertainment\r\n\r\nduty  on professional boxing has been far too high.\r\n\r\nIt  is  33\ufffd  per cent of ticket money collected  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, while the duty up-country is half of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  rate.  To  give  the  sport  a   fillip,\r\n\r\nentertainment duty on professional boxing  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced to 15 per cent with effect from next  year.\r\n\r\nSo  that  as  many people as possible may  see  and\r\n\r\nenjoy  this sport, arrangements will be  made  with\r\n\r\nthe  boxing  promoters for Television Singapura  to\r\n\r\nobtain rights to film\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout  charge  the fights for re-broadcasting  on\r\n\r\nT.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Review of State Development Plan, 1961-63</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I deal with the Development plans for\r\n\r\n1964,  I  wish to present to the Assembly a general\r\n\r\nreview  of  progress achieved in the State's  Four-Year  \r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan. The end of this  year  will\r\n\r\nmark  the  three-quarter stage  of  this  Plan  and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  this Assembly as well as the  general\r\n\r\npublic  will undoubtedly be interested in a  review\r\n\r\nof progress so far achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed in detail, I should perhaps\r\n\r\nexplain  that the Four-Year Plan relates to capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure in the public sector. That is  to  say,\r\n\r\nit  covers  the development projects of  the  State\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  Statutory  Boards,  namely,   the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board,  the  Public Utilities  Board,  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board  and  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.   It   does   not   include    private\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure as, in an open economy like\r\n\r\nours,  it is unrealistic to set targets for private\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to\r\n\r\ncirculate  to Members a set of tables* standing in my \r\n\r\nname which  give details   of   the  performance  of   \r\n\r\nthe   State's Development  Plan.  They  will  assist  Members  to\r\n\r\nfollow my explanation with greater ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Appendix I\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19631128/19631128-HA-0220109.pdf\"\">Annual Budget Statement(Cols 0109-0112)</a><br>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the public sector, a total capital outlay\r\n\r\nof  $871  million was envisaged in the plan  period\r\n\r\n1961/64 [Table I]. For the period 1961/63, that  is\r\n\r\nthe  period  under  review, the  plan  estimate  of\r\n\r\npublic sector capital expenditure was $651 million.\r\n\r\nThe  actual  expenditure that  is  expected  to  be\r\n\r\nincurred  during this period is $516 million.  This\r\n\r\nmeans an achievement of the plan of 79 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe target figure. However, if we take into account\r\n\r\nthat some of the projects originally entered in the\r\n\r\nplan have been abandoned or severely modified,  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  implementation  is  about  84  per  cent.\r\n\r\nBearing  in mind that some time must elapse  before\r\n\r\nthe machinery of implementation gets into top gear,\r\n\r\nthe   rate   of   performance  can  be   considered\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the performance rate of 79 per cent was\r\n\r\nachieved  for  the  plan as a whole,  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nprogress  varied in the principal  sectors  of  the\r\n\r\nplan.   These  are  Economic  Development,   Social\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Public Administration. The projects\r\n\r\ngrouped  under  Economic Development  achieved  the\r\n\r\nhighest rate of performance, namely, 80.9 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis  means an actual expenditure of $306.4 million\r\n\r\nas  against $378.7 million envisaged in  the  plan.\r\n\r\nSocial Development registered a performance rate of\r\n\r\n76.7  per cent; the actual expenditure being $200.4\r\n\r\nmillion  as against a plan total of $261.4 million.\r\n\r\nPublic  Administration, a small  sector,  shows  an\r\n\r\nactual  expenditure of $8.7 million  as  against  a\r\n\r\nplan outlay of $11 million, which gives a figure of\r\n\r\n79.4 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to deal with each of the sectors in\r\n\r\nsome  detail. In the field of Economic  Development\r\n\r\n[Table II], projects can be conveniently classified\r\n\r\nunder   three  main  headings:  namely,  Land   and\r\n\r\nAgricultural  Development; Commerce  and  Industry;\r\n\r\nand   Transport   and   Telecommunications.   These\r\n\r\nprojects  are designed to strengthen the sinews  of\r\n\r\nour  economy, to increase our earning power and  to\r\n\r\nincrease  employment opportunities. As  such,  they\r\n\r\nwere  accorded high priority both for the provision\r\n\r\nof personnel resources and of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Land and Agricultural Development [Table III], the performance was well below the average\r\n\r\nfor  the  economic  development  sector.  The  main\r\n\r\nprojects  consist  of  Flood  Alleviation  Schemes,\r\n\r\nRural Development Schemes, Purchase of Land, Animal\r\n\r\nHusbandry  and  Station, and equipment  for  public\r\n\r\nworks.   General  Rural  Development  Schemes   are\r\n\r\nprogressing on schedule, $1.6 million to  be  spent\r\n\r\nas  against  $1.64  million in the  plan  estimate.\r\n\r\nThese  schemes  have provided more than  250  rural\r\n\r\nstreets  and kampongs with lights and extension  of\r\n\r\nelectric   supply.   239  stand-pipes   have   been\r\n\r\ninstalled for rural dwellers. Farmers and fishermen\r\n\r\nhave  received  extension services in agricultural,\r\n\r\nfishing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  other veterinary services from seven  centres.\r\n\r\nFertilisers,  technical advice and  other  services\r\n\r\nare  also given to farmers and fishermen at  little\r\n\r\nor  no  cost  to increase their farming or  fishing\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  lower the  cost  of  production,\r\n\r\nthereby increasing their incomes. Purchase of  land\r\n\r\nexceeds  the plan estimates, being $10  million  as\r\n\r\nagainst  $8.8 million. As against these  successes,\r\n\r\nthe  swamp reclamation schemes hardly got  off  the\r\n\r\nground,  $0.24 million being spent as against  $2.7\r\n\r\nmillion   ear-marked  for  these   schemes.   Flood\r\n\r\nAlleviation  is  also  well behind  schedule,  $1.7\r\n\r\nmillion being spent as against the plan estimate of\r\n\r\n$9.0  million. This lack of progress is mainly  due\r\n\r\nto   the   obstruction  by  squatters   which   was\r\n\r\nengineered  and encouraged by pro-Communist  groups\r\n\r\nas  part  of  their deliberate policy to  frustrate\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects under Commerce and Industry detailed\r\n\r\nin Table IV*, show a satisfactory rate of progress, \r\n\r\nnamely  92.7 per cent. Actual expenditure  incurred\r\n\r\namounted  to  $228.8  million  as  against   $246.7\r\n\r\nmillion  in  the plan. All projects except  two  in\r\n\r\nthis  sub-division went according  to  schedule  or\r\n\r\neven  ahead of it. The two projects behind schedule\r\n\r\nare the Kallang project, that is, the filling up of\r\n\r\nthe  Kallang swamp and utilising reclaimed land for\r\n\r\nhousing  and industry. Some 380 acres of land  were\r\n\r\nplanned  to  be  reclaimed. Up to the  present,  40\r\n\r\nacres  have been filled. Progress has been retarded\r\n\r\nbecause  of a major change in policy as to how  the\r\n\r\nswamps   should   be  filled.  The  original   plan\r\n\r\nenvisaged the fill to come from one of two sources:\r\n\r\nfirst,  earth  from Paya Lebar and  Changi,  to  be\r\n\r\ntransported by a miniature railway to Kallang;  or,\r\n\r\nsecond,  the use of sea and river mud to be  pumped\r\n\r\ninto  the  swamp and held together by a  system  of\r\n\r\npolders. Both these methods were rejected in favour\r\n\r\nof  fill from the Toa Payoh district. This  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing done by the Housing and Development Board and\r\n\r\nthe work is progressing satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Appendix I.\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19631128/19631128-HA-0220109.pdf\"\">Annual Budget Statement(Cols 0109-0112)</a><br>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other project which falls behind the plan\r\n\r\nestimate  is  water development. The original  plan\r\n\r\nestimate is $54.2 million for the period 1961/64 or\r\n\r\n$40  million for the period 1961/63. In fact,  only\r\n\r\n$21.9  million  is  expected to be  spent  in  this\r\n\r\nperiod, representing a performance rate of 54.5 per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Scudai River Water Project is now\r\n\r\nunder implementation. Progress is being made in the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of the Scudai water works.  Pipelines\r\n\r\nmeasuring  more than four miles have  already  been\r\n\r\nlaid  to link the source of the water works at  the\r\n\r\nScudai  River in Johore, to distribution  pipes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The project should be completed by  June\r\n\r\nnext  year  with  a supply capacity  of  15  to  30\r\n\r\nmillion gallons of water per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, preliminary work and designs for the\r\n\r\nbigger  Johore  River Project have been  completed.\r\n\r\nActual  construction work would  begin  early  next\r\n\r\nyear.  The  project  should be  completed  in  four\r\n\r\nyears'  time  with  an initial capacity  to  supply\r\n\r\nabout  40  million gallons of water  per  day.  250\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons  a  day is claimed  by  the  Water\r\n\r\nEngineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the other projects in the sector went on\r\n\r\nschedule  or  exceeded  the targets.  The  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board is now in full swing. The  Jurong\r\n\r\nproject  is going ahead of schedule. $35.4  million\r\n\r\nwill  be  spent by the end of this year as  against\r\n\r\nthe plan estimate of $30 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Jurong industrial Estate</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,040 acres of the Jurong Industrial Estate have\r\n\r\nbeen  levelled and prepared for occupation.  Forty-seven   \r\n\r\nindustrialists  have  been  allotted  sites\r\n\r\ncovering  380  acres. Another  35  applicants  have\r\n\r\nreceived  tentative allocations of  sites  covering\r\n\r\nanother 329 acres. Of the remaining 300 odd  acres,\r\n\r\n199  acres  are  reserved for public  housing.  220\r\n\r\nflats and houses have already been constructed  and\r\n\r\nanother  3,000 will go up by the end of  1964.  The\r\n\r\nremaining  areas are reserved for  or  occupied  by\r\n\r\nroads, wharves and drainage canals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port facilities for Jurong are also being\r\n\r\ndeveloped.

In  1960,\r\n\r\nthe  peak  demand was 113.5 Mw.; in  1961,  it  was\r\n\r\n128.5  Mw.;  in 1962, it was 139 Mw. and  in  1963,\r\n\r\nthis year, it was 150 Mw. It is envisaged that  the\r\n\r\npeak  demand for electricity would be much  greater\r\n\r\nin  the  next  year  and  the  following  5  years,\r\n\r\nparticularly  due  to the rapid  expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nindustrial sector.

Even\r\n\r\nwith  these  additions there is  still  a  pressing\r\n\r\ndemand for further wharf facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years, the tonnage of vessels\r\n\r\nanchored  at the wharves of Singapore has  shown  a\r\n\r\nsteady  increase; 13.2 million tons in 1960, rising\r\n\r\nto 14.2 million tons in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to construct another 4 new deep\r\n\r\nwater  berths measuring over 2,900 ft, at the  East\r\n\r\nLagoon   with   complete  harbour  facilities   and\r\n\r\nequipments  to  handle  all  types  of  cargo.  The\r\n\r\nproject would cost about $44 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Aviation is progressing according to plan\r\n\r\n[Table  V].  The  extension  to  the  runways,  the\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   the  new   passenger   terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding,  and improvement in electronic  equipment\r\n\r\nare  progressing  satisfactorily;  they  will  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  one  of  the best equipped  airports  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completed extension of the runway from 8,000\r\n\r\nto  9,000  feet  has  made it one  of  the  biggest\r\n\r\nrunways  in Asia, capable of meeting the  needs  of\r\n\r\nall  types  of aircraft including the latest  high-speed  jets.  The  new Passenger Terminal  Building\r\n\r\nwould be ready for use in April 1964. It would have\r\n\r\na  floor  area  of over 122,000 sq, ft.  The  Main\r\n\r\nConcourse,  Transit  Lounge  and  reception  rooms,\r\n\r\ncovering an area of more than 29,000 sq, ft., would\r\n\r\nbe  air-conditioned. The Terminal Building would be\r\n\r\nultra modern with three murals in various parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  building, portraying the cultures of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Water  Front,  and  the  races  and\r\n\r\nreligions of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of our telephone system is\r\n\r\nprogressing  at  a faster rate than  was  expected.\r\n\r\n$16.4 million is to be spent in the years 1961  /63\r\n\r\nas  against a plan target of $14.1 million.  During\r\n\r\nthe  three  years under review the  number  of  new\r\n\r\nsubscribers  increased  by  10,378.  This   is   an\r\n\r\nincrease from 37,383 lines and subscribers in  1961\r\n\r\nto  47,741 subscribers and lines in 1963. Three new\r\n\r\ntelephone  exchanges were installed  at  Nee  Soon,\r\n\r\nChangi and Jurong. They are all in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the success stories. As against these,\r\n\r\nhowever, construction of roads, drains and  bridges\r\n\r\nis  well behind schedule. Only one-half the  roads,\r\n\r\none-third  the  drains and one-fourth  the  bridges\r\n\r\nthat  were expected to be constructed have in  fact\r\n\r\nbeen  constructed. The reasons are partly shortages\r\n\r\nof   technical   personnel  in  the  Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment.  A more important reason has  been  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties   encountered  in   the   removal   of\r\n\r\nsquatters. In all $22.3 million was spent on roads,\r\n\r\ndrains  and  bridges as against a plan estimate  of\r\n\r\n$51.7 million. The Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nis  now  making  a  determined  effort  to  improve\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunications like Posts, and Civil Aviation\r\n\r\nare  now  Federal departments. Development  in  the\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   telecommunications  services   was\r\n\r\nretarded    pending    a   merger    between    the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department and Cable & Wireless.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Government had completed an agreement\r\n\r\nwith  Cable  &  Wireless for such  a  merger.  With\r\n\r\nMalaysia  on  the  horizon the  Federal  Government\r\n\r\ndecided  against  proceeding with the  merger;  and\r\n\r\nhence  final  decision on development projects  was\r\n\r\nwithheld.   Essential   services,   however,   were\r\n\r\nproceeded  with  and there was no deterioration  of\r\n\r\nefficiency  in  the  services  provided.  In   this\r\n\r\nconnection  I  wish to mention that the  Round  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Commonwealth Cable scheme was agreed  to  by\r\n\r\nall  participating countries and  this  cable  will\r\n\r\nhave its terminal in Singapore. Work is in progress\r\n\r\nin the construction of this terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new project introduced in this sector is the\r\n\r\nMulti-storey  Car Park, now under  construction  in\r\n\r\nCecil  Street. It will be completed  in  June  next\r\n\r\nyear. It will be a six-storey building with parking\r\n\r\nbays for 700 cars and also bays for motorcycles and\r\n\r\nscooters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social Development [Table VI]</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social development we are\r\n\r\nconcerned  with public housing and the  development\r\n\r\nschemes  of  the Ministries of Culture, Health  and\r\n\r\nEducation. As I have said earlier, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactual  performance  has  been  76.7  per  cent  of\r\n\r\nplanned expenditure, i.e. $200.4 million as against\r\n\r\na plan estimate of $261.4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of public housing, the performance\r\n\r\nof   the   Housing   and   Development   Board   is\r\n\r\nacknowledged by everyone to be outstanding. No less\r\n\r\nthan  $130.3  million had been spent in  the  three\r\n\r\nyears  as  against  an estimated amount  of  $109.1\r\n\r\nmillion  [Table  VI].  In  terms  of  houses   this\r\n\r\nrepresents completion of 29,550 homes as against  a\r\n\r\nplan total of 26,521.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has embarked on an\r\n\r\nexpansion  programme,  the  main  items  being  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of T.V. services and the installation\r\n\r\nof  more  powerful sound transmitters. $6.6 million\r\n\r\nwas spent in the three years as against a plan cost\r\n\r\nof $10.7 million. The television service has proved\r\n\r\nto be very popular and the technical quality of its\r\n\r\ntransmission high. By August this year,  more  than\r\n\r\n20,000  T.V. licences have been taken out  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of sets actually in houses is estimated  at\r\n\r\n25,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the Health expansion schemes\r\n\r\nfell  way behind the plan as set out in 1961.  $6.8\r\n\r\nmillion was spent on capital expenditure as against\r\n\r\na  plan  total  of $24 million. The explanation  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  original plan of the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nwas unrealistic both in relation to staff resources\r\n\r\nand  to  the needs of the population, a  number  of\r\n\r\nprojects had to be abandoned or deferred, including\r\n\r\nthe    second   District   Hospital.   Nevertheless\r\n\r\nexpenditure of $6.8 million on new health  projects\r\n\r\nresulted  in  valuable  additions  to  the   Health\r\n\r\nservices  which the citizens of Singapore  can  now\r\n\r\nenjoy,  particularly  those  in  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroups.  No  less than eleven Polyclinics,  outdoor\r\n\r\ndispensaries and Maternal Health Clinics were built\r\n\r\nduring   1961/63   and  another  five   are   under\r\n\r\nconstruction.   In  addition  to  this,   extension\r\n\r\nprojects were commenced at the General and  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad  Hospitals.  The expansion in outdoor  medical\r\n\r\nservice  brought  about  a  severe  strain  on  the\r\n\r\navailable medical staff, and nurses and doctors had\r\n\r\nto work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong  and  punishing hours to maintain the enlarged\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1961/63 the Ministry of Education built 23\r\n\r\nPrimary schools, nine Grammar/Technical schools and\r\n\r\nfour  Vocational Commercial schools - or a new school\r\n\r\nevery  month. Another twenty-six schools are  under\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  which 18 will be  completed  next\r\n\r\nyear,  or  one  new school every three  weeks.  The\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of new schools together with\r\n\r\nthe enlarged output of trained teachers has enabled\r\n\r\nthe  State to keep pace with population growth.  We\r\n\r\nhave  now  reached  a stage where  every  child  of\r\n\r\nschool-going   age   can   receive   free   primary\r\n\r\neducation, and nearly all of them are, in fact,  so\r\n\r\nreceiving. The cost of schools constructed  in  the\r\n\r\nthree  years amounted to $32.5 million  as  against\r\n\r\n$73.2  million envisaged in the plan. It  is  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the targets set out in the plan were much  in\r\n\r\nexcess of needs and this will be taken into account\r\n\r\nwhen the plan for the next five years, 1965-69,  is\r\n\r\ndrawn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1964 Development Estimates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the 1964 Development Estimates.\r\n\r\nThis  will be the last year of the Four Year  Plan.\r\n\r\nThe  Development Estimates for 1964  is  mainly  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  continuation  or  completion  of\r\n\r\nprojects  which I have already described.  As  such\r\n\r\nthey do not call for further comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three matters of note. First is the\r\n\r\ndeletion  of  a number of projects entered  in  the\r\n\r\noriginal  plan.  The  two  Heads  under   which   a\r\n\r\nsignificant number of projects have been deleted or\r\n\r\ndeferred  are Head D18 Hospital Services  and  Head\r\n\r\nD37  Fire Brigade. The second District Hospital has\r\n\r\nbeen deleted from the present plan as also has been\r\n\r\nthe  second  Maternity Home and  the  Chronic  Sick\r\n\r\nHospital. Similarly all proposed clinics  for  1964\r\n\r\nhave been deleted. The second District Hospital and\r\n\r\nthe  Chronic Sick Hospital have never got  off  the\r\n\r\nground. These are matters which may be raised again\r\n\r\nin  the  second Five Year Plan or some  other  Five\r\n\r\nYear   Plan.  The  Orthopaedic  Hospital  and   the\r\n\r\nRadiography   unit,  for  which   there   is   more\r\n\r\njustification than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other  projects, may be reconsidered;  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  Five  Year Plan. It will  be  necessary  to\r\n\r\nassess the availability of doctors when these major\r\n\r\nprojects are reassessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassessment of the needs of the Fire Brigade\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be made, and a criterion established\r\n\r\nto  determine  the  number of  new  stations,  fire\r\n\r\nfighting  equipment  and  personnel  in  the   Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade.  It  appears that the  original  expansion\r\n\r\nplans of the Fire Brigade were excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of new projects that have been\r\n\r\nincluded in the 1964 Estimates. Customs and Excise,\r\n\r\nHead  D26, will need to build new bonded warehouses\r\n\r\nto  ensure adequate warehouse space for the storage\r\n\r\nof  goods  that  will  be made dutiable  under  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian common market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Printer will acquire new line\r\n\r\ncomposing  machines to enable a more speedy  output\r\n\r\nof  work.  Some  of the machines of the  Government\r\n\r\nPrinting Office are now more than 20 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head D39 Social Welfare, a sum of $1\r\n\r\nmillion  has been allotted for the construction  of\r\n\r\nthe Youth Leadership Training Centre. The Centre is\r\n\r\nsited  in a former large Community Centre in  Buona\r\n\r\nVista Road. Additional buildings will be needed  to\r\n\r\nserve  as dormitories for trainees, a dining  hail,\r\n\r\nstaff quarters, lecture rooms and other amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head D42 we have included estimates of the\r\n\r\ncost of development projects of Federal departments\r\n\r\nsuch  as telecommunications and prisons. Under  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the financial arrangements for Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  meet  the  full  cost   of   these\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects.  These  departments  perform\r\n\r\nimportant services in Singapore and their continued\r\n\r\nefficient  operation is vital if we want to  retain\r\n\r\nour  status as a well organised and efficient  port\r\n\r\nand  training centre in South-East Asia.  The  sums\r\n\r\nincluded in the 1964 Estimates are mainly based  on\r\n\r\nthe  original  plans for these departments.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible that there will be variations or changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  these items if and when the Federal departments\r\n\r\nundertake a re-appraisal of their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development will\r\n\r\ncommence  the work of rebuilding the city in  1964.\r\n\r\nMany  houses  in the central areas are decrepit  in\r\n\r\nthe  extreme and an effort must be made  to  remove\r\n\r\nthese. City re-development will require some  basic\r\n\r\nand  far-reaching changes in Government policy  and\r\n\r\nthese matters are under urgent consideration. A sum\r\n\r\nof  $10  million has been allotted  for  urban  re-development but as the operation proceeds,  we  are\r\n\r\nlikely   to  require  substantially  larger   sums.\r\n\r\nAnother  new project of the Ministry is  the  Bedok\r\n\r\nReclamation.  Work has already commenced  and  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion  is allotted in the estimates for  1964.  A\r\n\r\nrecord  sum  of $76.8 million has been allotted  to\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board next year. In addition  to  the\r\n\r\nnormal  development projects,  there  is  need  - to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have referred - to build flats and  houses\r\n\r\nfor  workers  who  will  be  employed  in  the  new\r\n\r\nindustries rising in Jurong. $15 million  has  been\r\n\r\nprovided for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head D21, Ministry of Finance, two new\r\n\r\nitems  appear.  They are the $30 million  loan  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  assistance to  Sarawak  and  Sabah  in\r\n\r\naccordance   with   the  terms  of   the   Malaysia\r\n\r\nagreement. There is also provided $25 million being\r\n\r\nthe loan which we expect the Public Utilities Board\r\n\r\nwill  require  in  1964 to finance their  expansion\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been the impact of the State's\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan on the growth of the economy?  The\r\n\r\nexpenditure of $500 million over three  years  must\r\n\r\nhave  an impact on the economic growth. There  are,\r\n\r\nof  course,  the visible signs such as new  houses,\r\n\r\nroads, street lighting, industrial estates, wharves\r\n\r\nand   other   physical  manifestations  of   actual\r\n\r\nconstruction.  Undoubtedly over the  last  four  or\r\n\r\nfive  years,  there has been a marked  increase  in\r\n\r\neconomic activity and in the standard of living and\r\n\r\nin  general prosperity. In every budget  address  I\r\n\r\nhave   quoted  in  extenso  figures  of  increased\r\n\r\nconsumer spending\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccurring  each  year. But  these  do  not  give  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive measure of progress, being  selective\r\n\r\nor subjective or both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best single indicator of economic growth is\r\n\r\nprovided  in the national income statistics  [Table\r\n\r\nVII]*. National income covers the whole  range  of \r\n\r\neconomic activities undertaken within the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Appendix II.\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19631128/19631128-HA-0220109.pdf\"\">Annual Budget Statement(Cols 0109-0112)</a><br>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several entities going by the name of\r\n\r\nnational  income  and  the  one  which  we  use  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is known as the gross domestic  product.\r\n\r\nIn  non-technical terms, this is the value  of  all\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services produced within the  territory\r\n\r\nduring  the  given  period.  These  estimates   are\r\n\r\ncompiled  each year by the Department of Statistics\r\n\r\nand they are reported each year to the Colombo Plan\r\n\r\nConference which assesses progress, or lack of  it,\r\n\r\nin the developing countries of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, our national income was $1,934 million;\r\n\r\nin  1960,  $2,020 million; in 1961, $2,307  million\r\n\r\nand  in 1962, $2,437 million. Therefore in the four\r\n\r\nyears,  there  has  been  a substantial  growth  of\r\n\r\nnational  income  by  26 per cent  and  this  is  a\r\n\r\nremarkable achievement by any standard. Most of the\r\n\r\ngrowth  occurred in the years 1962 and  1961  since\r\n\r\nthe implementation of the State's Development Plan.\r\n\r\nIt  will be inaccurate, however, to claim that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  this  growth has been due  to  the  Plan\r\n\r\nitself. Undoubtedly, the general prosperity brought\r\n\r\nabout  by  good prices of rubber in the years  1960\r\n\r\nand  1961  contributed substantially to our  recent\r\n\r\nprosperity.  But without a well conceived  plan  to\r\n\r\nchannel resources into the desired sectors  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  it  could  well be  that  the  prosperity\r\n\r\ngenerated  by  good rubber prices  in  those  years\r\n\r\nwould  he  frittered away. This, however,  did  not\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the atmosphere of confidence\r\n\r\ngenerated  by  the  sound  financial  and  economic\r\n\r\npolicies of the Government was also responsible for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbringing   about   a  larger  volume   of   private\r\n\r\ninvestment and a general increase in trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that not only was there an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the absolute level of national  income\r\n\r\nbetween  1959  and  1962,  but  there  was  also  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial rise in the per capita national income.\r\n\r\nOur  population grew from 1.58 million in  1959  to\r\n\r\n1.73  million in 1962, but the growth  of  national\r\n\r\nincome   outstripped   population   growth   by   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial margin so that the per capita  national\r\n\r\nincome in 1962 was 14.9 per cent higher than it was\r\n\r\nthree  years ago. This is a performance  which  has\r\n\r\nvery  few  equals in under-developed  countries  of\r\n\r\nAsia and Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say a few words about estimates of\r\n\r\ngross domestic capital formation during the period.\r\n\r\nGross  domestic capital formation is the  value  of\r\n\r\ntotal  investment taking place in the economy  both\r\n\r\nfor  replacement of used capital assets as well  us\r\n\r\nthe  construction  or acquisition  of  new  capital\r\n\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first two years 1959 - 1960, the level\r\n\r\nof capital formation was dismally low, being $146.5\r\n\r\nmillion  and $138.5 million. Those were  the  years\r\n\r\nwhen the P.A.P. had just been returned to power  in\r\n\r\nthe    State's   first   general   elections.   The\r\n\r\nuncertainties  of the pre-election period  and  the\r\n\r\nnervousness following the election and the  economy\r\n\r\nmeasures  enforced then explain  the  low  rate  of\r\n\r\ncapital investment. Business confidence was then at\r\n\r\na  low ebb and the State's Development Plan was  in\r\n\r\nthe  process of preparation. The year  1961  saw  a\r\n\r\nturn   of   events  when  gross  domestic   capital\r\n\r\nformation  saw a substantial increase  from  $138.5\r\n\r\nmillion  to $226.4 million, an increase of  97  per\r\n\r\ncent. The rate was further accelerated in 1962 when\r\n\r\ntotal  investments  in  both  the  Government   and\r\n\r\nprivate sector totalled $247.6 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of percentage of national income, the\r\n\r\nrate of gross capital formation in Singapore saw an\r\n\r\nincrease from 7.6 per cent in 1959 to 10.2 per cent\r\n\r\nin 1962. Although this increase is welcome,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is still very low for a country with Singapore's\r\n\r\nper  capita national income. The paramount need  is\r\n\r\nto increase the rate of gross capital formation. In\r\n\r\nan  economy which wants to expand its basic  wealth\r\n\r\nat  a  fast rate, a target like 20 per cent or more\r\n\r\nshould  be  aimed at as the rate of  gross  capital\r\n\r\nformation.  Nations  which have  recently  achieved\r\n\r\nspectacular  expansion rates,  such  as  Japan  and\r\n\r\nAustralia,   have  attained  a  rate   of   capital\r\n\r\nformation of more than 20 per cent of the  national\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national income figures and capital formation\r\n\r\nfigures  for 1963 are of course not available,  the\r\n\r\nyear not having ended. All the indications are that\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  capital formation in  1963  will  be\r\n\r\nconsiderably  larger  than  it  was  in  1962.  The\r\n\r\nstatistics  on  output  and  imports  of   building\r\n\r\nmaterials  in 1963 show very substantial  increases\r\n\r\nover  the  figures for the preceding  year.  It  is\r\n\r\nlikely  that  the  total investment  in  1963  will\r\n\r\nexceed $280 million this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against the background of economic growth\r\n\r\nin  the  last  four years that we must  assess  the\r\n\r\nimpact  if  Indonesia's economic  confrontation,  a\r\n\r\nsubject  to which I referred earlier. The  loss  at\r\n\r\nthe rate of $200 million national income a year  is\r\n\r\na  serious  blow to our economy. If unchecked,  the\r\n\r\nultimate  decline  in our National  Income  may  be\r\n\r\nlarger  than  this as secondary repercussions  make\r\n\r\ntheir  impact.  We can limit the  extent  of  these\r\n\r\nsecondary  repercussions by accelerating growth  in\r\n\r\nother  sectors. In the immediate future,  there  is\r\n\r\nneed  to increase Government expenditure on  public\r\n\r\nwork  projects by stepping up the programme of road\r\n\r\nand  drainage construction. Similarly the  building\r\n\r\nof  houses  both by private developers and  by  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board,  now already at a  high  tempo,  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to reach new heights of activity  when  the\r\n\r\nUrban Renewal Scheme of the Government gets on  the\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, however, are the short-term measures. The\r\n\r\npermanent and basic remedy lies in the creation  of\r\n\r\nnew sources of wealth which would generate a steady\r\n\r\nstream  of  incomes over future years.  Fortunately\r\n\r\nfor us, the basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroundwork of our industrialisation programme is in\r\n\r\nan advanced stage of completion and in the next few\r\n\r\nyears  we  are going to see the growth of many  new\r\n\r\nindustries.  The  Common  Market  arrangements  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to come into force next year and this  will\r\n\r\ngive an additional impetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board estimates that the\r\n\r\nnew  industries which are now being established  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will generate by 1965 an additional  $90\r\n\r\nto  $100 million National Income a year. The normal\r\n\r\ngrowth  of existing industries may add another  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  by 1965. The industrial sector, therefore,\r\n\r\nalone  could fill up more than half the gap  caused\r\n\r\nby confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must not forget our own potential for\r\n\r\neconomic growth in other sectors. In the last three\r\n\r\nyears,  the National Income has increased  by  $500\r\n\r\nmillion  and  the  $200  million  direct  loss   of\r\n\r\nNational  Income caused by Indonesian confrontation\r\n\r\nmeans  that  if  we  could sustain,  in  the  other\r\n\r\nsectors of the economy, the rate of growth  of  the\r\n\r\nlast  three  years, we could make good  the  losses\r\n\r\ncaused by confrontation in something like two years\r\n\r\nor  less.  Of course, if in the meantime  trade  is\r\n\r\nrestored, then all the better. My view is that some\r\n\r\ndecline  in the economy is unavoidable in the  next\r\n\r\nfew  months, but by 1965 we should have  completely\r\n\r\nrecovered if no other major economic setbacks occur\r\n\r\nin   the  meantime.  In  other  words,  Indonesia's\r\n\r\nconfrontation sets back our time-table of  progress\r\n\r\nby two years. This is a severe blow but it does not\r\n\r\nadd up to a crippling blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back to the years 1958-59 when political\r\n\r\nebullience  threatened to overwhelm the State,  few\r\n\r\nwould  have  dared to predict the  robust  rate  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment that was actually achieved. No  one  in\r\n\r\nhis  senses in 1959 could have prophesied that four\r\n\r\nyears   later  merger  with  Malaya  would  be   an\r\n\r\naccomplished fact. And not many could have foreseen\r\n\r\nthe  spectacular  decline in the  fortunes  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists and their open front organisations.  Yet\r\n\r\nin  the  space  of a bare four years, these  things\r\n\r\nwere accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in Malaysia and our fortunes are\r\n\r\nirrevocably  tied  with the rest  of  Malaysia.
