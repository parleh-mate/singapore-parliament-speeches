I am concerned about the direction the CDCs  should\r\n\r\ngo  in order to be relevant and perceived as relevant to  our\r\n\r\ncitizens.   I would like to suggest that the CDCs  should  be\r\n\r\nproactive in areas that affect a majority of residents and on\r\n\r\nprogrammes that benefit more residents in the constituencies.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the CDC can be a form of \"local government\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the CDC also venture into\r\n\r\nthree  areas  that  I  am  familiar with;  areas  where  most\r\n\r\nfamilies  will benefit from and can appreciate from long-term\r\n\r\noutcome.  These areas are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Healthcare is generally an important issue to most\r\n\r\npeople and, frequently, it is a political one too.  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  no  exception.  It is, hence, an area worthy of the CDCs'\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A programme that can benefit all the households of our\r\n\r\nresidents and also something that will improve the health  of\r\n\r\nall  the residents would hold the CDCs in good stead.   I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the CDCs sponsor everyone above 50  years  of\r\n\r\nage  for  health  screening tests on a  regular  basis.   The\r\n\r\nMinister for Health announced yesterday on the launching of a\r\n\r\ncommunity health screening programme.  The CDCs could perhaps\r\n\r\nco-sponsor this scheme for residents on the amount payable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby them, especially those less well off residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has the benefit of making sure that preventive\r\n\r\ncare  is  extended to everyone, especially to the poorer  and\r\n\r\nless  informed.  This will ensure that Singaporeans will have\r\n\r\nbetter  health  and  happier lives.  It  will  thus  help  in\r\n\r\ncontaining the cost of healthcare in the future as well as in\r\n\r\nenhancing   the   economic  contributions  of   a   healthier\r\n\r\ncitizenry.  The tangible benefit for a lot of households,  as\r\n\r\nmany households have at least one person above 50 years, will\r\n\r\nbe  good for our nation too.  The CDCs are the best to  carry\r\n\r\nout  this  programme  because it has  the  machinery  of  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  workers  to  ensure  comprehensive  coverage   of\r\n\r\nresidents  in  the  constituencies.  The Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nshall  lend  the  medical  resources  and  the  follow-up  of\r\n\r\npatients that require them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sir, the second area that I would like CDCs to\r\n\r\nconsider is the complete take over of MediFund and the future\r\n\r\nElderCare Fund.  CDCs should be the decision-making  body  in\r\n\r\nthe disbursement of these Funds because, as \"local councils\",\r\n\r\nthey  will  know the residents' needs better.  The grassroots\r\n\r\nalso have better rapport with the residents in assessing  the\r\n\r\neligibility  of the applicants.  This is better than  letting\r\n\r\nsocial  workers of the hospitals to do the job.   Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  can  be  the advisors and perhaps  hand  out  the\r\n\r\nawards to the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sir, as we are facing a fast-increasing aging\r\n\r\npopulation  in  Singapore,  I would  like  to  urge  CDCs  to\r\n\r\nredouble its attention in these potential problems that  come\r\n\r\nwith   it.   The  CDCs  should  consider  setting    up   and\r\n\r\nsubsidising  Centres  of  Activity for  Retired  and  Elderly\r\n\r\n(CARE) island-wide.  These centres are to make sure that  the\r\n\r\nincreasing numbers of elderly have places to go to every  day\r\n\r\nwhere  they  can have beneficial physical, mental and  social\r\n\r\ncare.   The purpose is to maintain them to be as healthy  and\r\n\r\nactive for as long as possible.  The elderly who attend these\r\n\r\ncentres  will appreciate the effects and their children  will\r\n\r\nhave  peace of mind knowing that they are catered  for  while\r\n\r\nthey are there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Community Development would\r\n\r\nconsider my suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to speak on two points.

Since then, the  CDCs  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  500  over projects, found jobs for many  residents\r\n\r\nand  served  almost  like  a \"local government\"  for  300,000\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly welcome the strategic move to take over some\r\n\r\nof  the  responsibilities so far carried out by MCD.  I  have\r\n\r\nlong  argued  for the need to work small, stay  targeted  and\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  smaller population bases, which have  different\r\n\r\ndemographic   characteristics  and  distinct   socio-economic\r\n\r\nneeds.   The Mayors and the MPs in each ward would know  best\r\n\r\nwhat  the people want, how they wish their environment to  be\r\n\r\norganised  and whom they can mobilise to kick-start community\r\n\r\nprojects.   There  is  no better way to  create  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nownership and responsibility among residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the CDC defines itself as a bridge between\r\n\r\nthe people and the public sector, it must then see itself  as\r\n\r\na  capacity-building agency within the people sector, and not\r\n\r\nas a Government instrument designed for exerting more control\r\n\r\nover  the  community.  Is CDC prepared to accept the  active,\r\n\r\negalitarian participation of citizens who are free to debate,\r\n\r\ncontest  and  challenge issues that affect them?   Or  is  it\r\n\r\nprepared  to  only encourage individuals and groups  to  rise\r\n\r\nfrom  the grassroots to undertake self-help projects  already\r\n\r\ndefined  by  the  CDC management?  The distinction  community\r\n\r\nleaders  made between the role of an activist within a  civil\r\n\r\nsociety  movement  and that of an agent in creating  a  civic\r\n\r\nsociety  will impact in numerous fashions the way we organise\r\n\r\nprojects, communicate and share responsibility.  Undoubtedly,\r\n\r\nit  is  going to be a very complex decoupling and re-emerging\r\n\r\nprocess where the promises of civil society and that of civic\r\n\r\nsociety can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomewhat  be negotiated.  It will take time, and it  takes  a\r\n\r\nlot of trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiences on the ground so far have yielded a\r\n\r\nmixed  satisfaction level and mixed successes.  Although  the\r\n\r\nperceptions   have  improved  since  1997,  a  thorny   issue\r\n\r\npersists,   among  others,  in  the  relational  aspects   of\r\n\r\ncooperation between the older grassroots leaders and  younger\r\n\r\nprofessional  social  service  operators,  between  the   CDC\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  the  community  agencies.   The  groups  are\r\n\r\ndivided  by  age, social class, experiences,  differences  in\r\n\r\nskills,  attitudes and interests.  If these  differences  are\r\n\r\nnot managed, people's agencies will just shut themselves out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult enough to accept CDCs as non-Government,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are led by politicians, but  it  can  be  less\r\n\r\n\"bureaucratic\" or jeng-hu or \"government\", so  to  speak,  by\r\n\r\nadopting  flexible, open, fair and accountable inter-personal\r\n\r\nskills   to  interact  with  a  more  demanding,  questioning\r\n\r\ncitizenry, one which seeks more information and is not likely\r\n\r\nto merely follow instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that the National Community Leadership\r\n\r\nTraining  Institute  (NCLTI)  take  the  lead  in  organising\r\n\r\nworkshops  for the grassroots organisations within each  CDC.\r\n\r\nIt  would be useful to include key partners in other  sectors\r\n\r\nas   well,   like   the  Police,  social  service   agencies,\r\n\r\npolyclinics, residents' committees and so on.  We would  need\r\n\r\nvery  good  facilitators to get this going.  I  believe  that\r\n\r\nwhen  people  work and learn together, the  greater  are  the\r\n\r\nchances of building rapport with one another and making sense\r\n\r\nof  the  meaning  of  \"community\".   An  even  more  concrete\r\n\r\nsuggestion is to regularise an on-going workgroup for  people\r\n\r\nto  meet and discuss community concerns and solutions.   Such\r\n\r\nregular  face-to-face  interactions  are  more  effective  in\r\n\r\ngenerating   the   social  capital  that   encourages   civic\r\n\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDCs can serve as strong bridges, but without effective\r\n\r\nnetworkers, they cannot become effective community  builders.\r\n\r\nWithout  professionalising the personnel  by  equipping  them\r\n\r\nwith a range of skills in building\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity, the goals of S21 which CDCs are tasked to  execute\r\n\r\nat the community level will be harder to realise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this weekend's gathering on the 19th for the nine\r\n\r\nCDC  leaders will identify the kind of leadership  attributes\r\n\r\nneeded for CDCs.  The clarion call made by Mr Eddie Teo could\r\n\r\nserve  as a lead for more discussions.  His call was  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants  to  open  up,  share  information,   be\r\n\r\nresponsible   to   constructive   ideas   and   tolerant   of\r\n\r\ndifferences.   This  same  message must  be  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  sector as well as by community leaders and  social\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about making CDCs a \"virtual\r\n\r\nneighbourhood\".   We could kick off a pilot project  by  CDCs\r\n\r\nsponsoring   old   computers  for   a   limited   number   of\r\n\r\nparticipating households in one constituency.  We can request\r\n\r\nthe  help  of  polytechnic students to design an  easy-to-use\r\n\r\nInternet training programme to promote Internet literacy.  It\r\n\r\nis   my  wish  to  see  simple  computers  and  even  simpler\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that older persons could learn to use  to  create\r\n\r\nthis virtual neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, an on-line service connected to the CDC will\r\n\r\nserve  as  the  coordinating centre to  answer  all  queries,\r\n\r\nrespond to assistance calls and make the necessary referrals.\r\n\r\nThis  is where volunteers and students could be mobilised  to\r\n\r\nmanage this on-line service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In London, at Islington, where such a networking\r\n\r\nexperiment  was  tried, participants were  able  to  exchange\r\n\r\ninformation as mundane as gardening tips, recommend a plumber\r\n\r\nor electrician, find a baby-sitter or exchange notes on shops\r\n\r\nand  restaurants.   These bits and pieces  of  everyday  life\r\n\r\ncreated  the vibrancy of a shared and a caring community  and\r\n\r\nallowed  more communication among residents which  could  not\r\n\r\nhave  happened otherwise.  The company, Microsoft Corp, which\r\n\r\nsponsored   this   experiment   called   this   their   first\r\n\r\n\"cyberstreet community\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproject\".   Maybe this is something CDCs could  spearhead  to\r\n\r\nhelp make Singaporeans, young and old, Internet literate  and\r\n\r\nconnected.   I  believe technology must be  made  simple  and\r\n\r\nbroadly applied to promote some level of social cohesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Recently,\r\n\r\nthe  results  of  a  survey conducted by the  National  Youth\r\n\r\nCouncil  revealed that  out of the 100 youths surveyed,  only\r\n\r\none  was  interested in social work, while 55% of  them  were\r\n\r\nmore    interested   in   outdoor   activities   and   public\r\n\r\nentertainment.  Such surveys have aroused my  interest.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Community Development has also conducted a survey\r\n\r\non  some 25,000 grassroots leaders.  According to the survey,\r\n\r\n60%  of  the grassroots leaders were over the age of 60,  and\r\n\r\n25%  between the ages of 30 and 40.  These two surveys showed\r\n\r\nthat our young people are disinterested in social work.  Such\r\n\r\nsurvey results merit our attention.  It is a problem that  we\r\n\r\nwill have to solve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that we are able to enjoy peace and racial  harmony\r\n\r\nis  due to the fact that all of us work towards the same goal\r\n\r\nto  build a better home for Singapore.  The important  factor\r\n\r\nfor   such  an  achievement  is  that  we  have  very  strong\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations.  They help  to  build  our  social\r\n\r\ncohesiveness.   They act as a bridge between  the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the people. They convey messages from the Government and\r\n\r\nalso  receive  feedback  from the people.   Such  hardworking\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders  merit our admiration.   I  know  certain\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders  have been working in the  constituencies\r\n\r\nfor  long  periods of time. They sacrificed  their  time  and\r\n\r\ndonated  their money.  They worked very hard for the society.\r\n\r\nMany   grassroots leaders worked for more than 30  years  and\r\n\r\nhave  devoted  their  life to society.  Such   dedication  is\r\n\r\nexemplary.   Our young people should emulate them.   Most  of\r\n\r\nthese people are quite elderly and when they leave the scene,\r\n\r\nwe  would  have no young people to take over from them.    We\r\n\r\nhave  to  do something about this.  We have to work out  some\r\n\r\nplans  to  encourage  our  young people  to  be  involved  in\r\n\r\ncommunity work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is not here.

Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The Muslim\r\n\r\nresidents  in the Jurong area are grateful to the  Government\r\n\r\nbecause,  for many years, the Government has allowed  Muslims\r\n\r\nto  use  the land in Jurong to build a mosque, which  is  the\r\n\r\nJalan  Majapahit Mosque.  Unfortunately, at the end of  1999,\r\n\r\nthe  Mosque could not function any more because the site  has\r\n\r\nbeen  acquired.  Therefore, the Muslim residents  in  Jurong,\r\n\r\nJurong West, Gaik Poh, Nanyang, Old Jurong Road, Boon Lay and\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the Tuas industrial area and its surroundings\r\n\r\nalso do not now have a place to go and observe congregational\r\n\r\nprayers and attend religious classes. So the residents  there\r\n\r\nare  appealing  to the Government, through  the  Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  Muslim Affairs, for a mosque to be built  in  the\r\n\r\nJurong  West  area because there are now  65,000  residential\r\n\r\nunits  in the area.  According to the Development Guide Plan,\r\n\r\neach  area  with 20,000 units of residential units  ought  to\r\n\r\nhave  one place of worship for each religion.  I believe that\r\n\r\nwith  this density of population in Jurong, it is timely  for\r\n\r\nJurong West to have a mosque.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann is not speaking. Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire Chiang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, we have about 12,400\r\n\r\npeople with disabilities who are currently receiving services\r\n\r\nfrom  the  VWOs.  One main concern that this group  faces  is\r\n\r\nthat  of  employment opportunity.  It is within our  national\r\n\r\ninterests  that  we  build an environment  for  persons  with\r\n\r\ndisabilities to optimally function as independents.  For  me,\r\n\r\nemployment is the key pillar in empowerment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a centralised employment centre, Bizlink that\r\n\r\nprovides    vocational   assessment,   placement,   training,\r\n\r\ncounselling/follow up for disabled people.  In 1996, only 272\r\n\r\nplacements   were  made,  but  since  then,  the   employment\r\n\r\nsituation  became  increasingly difficult  for  the  disabled\r\n\r\ncommunity due to the economic crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government does not enforce employment legislation\r\n\r\nfor the disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,   various  incentives  are  provided  to   encourage\r\n\r\norganisations to hire people with disability.   Allow  me  to\r\n\r\nraise  two promotional schemes because I feel they  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  publicised enough.  First, the Inland Revenue Authority\r\n\r\nof Singapore permits employers to claim a tax deduction of up\r\n\r\nto  $100,000 when they modify their business and premises  to\r\n\r\nhelp  their disabled workers.  Second, the Singapore  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  Foundation reimburses the salaries of each  disabled\r\n\r\nworker  employed by the private sector for the first one  and\r\n\r\nthe  half months.  It provides a transport and meal allowance\r\n\r\nof   $5  a  day  for  the  first  two  weeks  of  employment,\r\n\r\nchannelling  the  money  through the  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could we ask the Government to be generous and\r\n\r\ncomplement  the role of the Chinese Chamber by  matching  the\r\n\r\nreimbursement  amount  to  the  disabled  community  and  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  employ  them  on  the  basis  of  co-sharing\r\n\r\nprinciple?  This initiative may well succeed in incentivising\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  offer jobs and individuals with disability  to\r\n\r\nseek jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the employment issue. Could Bizlink\r\n\r\nserve  as a labour contractor responsible for placing  groups\r\n\r\nof  workers in a work context and be responsible for ferrying\r\n\r\nthem  to  and from work and helping them adjust to  the  work\r\n\r\nenvironment?  The advantage of placing more than  one  worker\r\n\r\nis  self-evident.  The disabled person feels  supported.   Or\r\n\r\ncould the role of contracting employment for the disabled  in\r\n\r\ngroups  be left to individual organisations so that they  can\r\n\r\nfind  the  appropriate employment placement for  those  under\r\n\r\ntheir  charge?   Because they would know what  their  clients\r\n\r\ncould  do  and tasked with this job they will find  the  work\r\n\r\ncontracts that are suitable to the work and skills levels  of\r\n\r\ntheir  clients and they could conduct orientation and support\r\n\r\nprogrammes  at work to give employers their fair  return  and\r\n\r\nhelp workers feel useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, the Labour Department actually adopts an\r\n\r\nintegration model by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsetting  a  quota  of  1.8%  of employment  of  persons  with\r\n\r\ndisabilities  for  companies  with  more  than  300   regular\r\n\r\nemployees.   If such companies failed to comply,  a  levy  of\r\n\r\n50,000  yen is imposed on the companies.  On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nemployers who recruit more, above the quota, will be  paid  a\r\n\r\ngrant  of  25,000 yen per person per month for the number  of\r\n\r\ndisabled persons employed in excess of the quota.  This is  a\r\n\r\nvery enlightened labour policy, as it encourages companies to\r\n\r\nopen up more jobs for people who are disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Japanese integration and rehabilitation model\r\n\r\nhas  a lot to teach us.  Not only is their disabled community\r\n\r\nbeing  encouraged  to  function in  the  open  market,  large\r\n\r\nventures  are encouraged to contract them to be part  of  the\r\n\r\nproduction  teams.   One  example is  the  operation  of  big\r\n\r\nprinting presses.  The persons with disabilities do the  less\r\n\r\nphysical  demanding jobs of desktop publishing, mailing,  and\r\n\r\nso  on,  while  the  able  workers  do  the  physically  more\r\n\r\ndemanding ones.  This way the workshop can provide  the  full\r\n\r\nrange of service to the customers from desktop publishing  to\r\n\r\nprinting and mailing service, like in any commercial printing\r\n\r\ncompany.  Through training and close supervision, out of work\r\n\r\nand  during  work, the flourishing of commercial ventures  in\r\n\r\nJapan  involving  persons with disabilities  has  proven  one\r\n\r\nvital  point: that the disabled are not unable and  they  are\r\n\r\neconomically  productive  if they  are  given  a  chance  and\r\n\r\nadequate  support.  We need employers to open  up  more  jobs\r\n\r\nwith some levels of incentives from Government.  We need  MOM\r\n\r\nto   provide  an  employment  bulletin  for  jobs  posted  by\r\n\r\nemployers who are really willing to recruit the disabled.  We\r\n\r\nneed to strengthen the assessment and referral procedures  of\r\n\r\nBizlink and other VWOs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Jennifer Lee is not speaking.

Notwithstanding the embarrassment  of\r\n\r\nbeing a bore to my colleagues, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseek  their  indulgence on this topic one more time.   Please\r\n\r\nallow me to reiterate an important issue concerning ageing of\r\n\r\nthe  population. I refer to the financing of  healthcare  for\r\n\r\nsenior citizens in the future.  I am raising this issue under\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of  Community Development because it is the lead\r\n\r\nagency   to  implement  the  recommendations  of  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Ageing Population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned in this House before, there is an\r\n\r\ninadequacy  in our present healthcare financing in  spite  of\r\n\r\nour  Medisave,  MediShield and Medifund  schemes.   This  was\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  the  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation  and  is referred to as \"Expanding Step-down  Care\r\n\r\nFinancing\".   It is recommended that the Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nand  the  Central Provident Fund Board establish, as  I  have\r\n\r\nadvocated in this House as well, an insurance scheme  against\r\n\r\nsevere  disabilities.   It  is  also  recommended  that   the\r\n\r\npremiums  be  made less burdensome by making it payable  with\r\n\r\nMedisave.  Sir, my main contention on this issue is  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  make  sure this insurance scheme addresses the  problem\r\n\r\nwell and its execution is well planned, lest we find it still\r\n\r\nlacking after implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure success, this insurance scheme must\r\n\r\ncater for all aspects of \"step-down care\" and contrary to the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on  Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation, must include medical expenses.  Yes, coverage  of\r\n\r\nmedical expenses is an important part of \"step-down care\" and\r\n\r\nmust  be  included.   Many  \"step-down  care\"  patients  need\r\n\r\ncontinued medical care and long term medications after  their\r\n\r\ndischarge  from the hospitals.  If the medical  expenses  are\r\n\r\nexclusive  of  the  \"step-down care\" and  are  excluded  from\r\n\r\nfinancing,  this financing scheme will only fail.   Sir,  our\r\n\r\nfuture cases of chronic-disease sufferers will heavily burden\r\n\r\nour  tertiary  medical institutions, raising  the  healthcare\r\n\r\ncosts  unnecessarily  when they  can  be  cared  for  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  facilities or in their own homes.  But  they  will\r\n\r\nopt not to because they can only use Medisave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  MediShield  in  the  tertiary institutions  and  not  at\r\n\r\ncommunity facilities or when they stay at home.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not let this serious mistake take place, or  we  will\r\n\r\nhave a perpetual flaw in our system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Community Development can steer\r\n\r\nthe implementation of this issue with favourable outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, with good\r\n\r\nmedical care, senior citizens are now living to an older age,\r\n\r\naveraging about 77 years.  Currently, there are already cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the  old, about 60, are looking after  the  yet  older\r\n\r\nparents  who  are in the 80s.  This type of elderly  care  is\r\n\r\nobviously  not  efficient.  Although the full impact  of  the\r\n\r\nageing  population will not be seen until  15  to  20  years'\r\n\r\ntime,  I am glad that the Government had taken the initiative\r\n\r\nwith a high-level Inter-Ministerial Committee to make an  in-depth  study  on  this  issue.  While  the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nreport  on  the  aged is a total approach  to  the  issue,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  Ministry  of Community Development  and  Sports\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  lead  Ministry to take  care  of  the  total\r\n\r\nsolution.   Based  on  the  current budget  allocation,  this\r\n\r\namount  will  not be sufficient to take care  of  the  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation.   The  Ministry  should  work  closely  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance for higher budget allocation which  could\r\n\r\nbe related to the population of the aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, young mothers are allowed to take leave\r\n\r\nto take care of sick children below the age of six.  With the\r\n\r\nageing  population,  I would like to ask for  elderly  parent\r\n\r\ncare leave which will allow workers similarly to take care of\r\n\r\naged parents of 60 years and above.  This will encourage more\r\n\r\npeople to take an active part in the care of ageing parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fertility rate has dropped from 1.82 in 1980 to 1.48\r\n\r\nin  1999.  If this trend  continues, there will not be enough\r\n\r\nsiblings to take care of their parents.  Loneliness  will  be\r\n\r\nthe biggest problem which the aged will have to learn to cope\r\n\r\nwith.  Teaching the senior citizens how to cope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  ageing will be a major task.  The Ministry should  work\r\n\r\nout comprehensive plans to help senior citizens adjust to the\r\n\r\nproblem of ageing, especially in the mindset.  Preparing  for\r\n\r\nretirement  with  sufficient  money  is  only  one  important\r\n\r\naspect.   There  are many other variables  to  take  care  in\r\n\r\nageing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has over the years spawned a whole new\r\n\r\nindustry  in  childcare  centres.   These  childcare  centres\r\n\r\nprovide  good  care for children with working  parents.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  should  now  draw up guidelines  and  provide  good\r\n\r\nincentives  for the private sector and VWOs to  set  up  more\r\n\r\nsenior citizens care centres, where workers could place their\r\n\r\nelderly  parents, and professionally trained  geriatric  care\r\n\r\nstaff  can  take good care of senior citizens  at  affordable\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the moment,\r\n\r\nthere  are  about 280,000 people aged 60 and above.   By  the\r\n\r\nyear  2030,  there will be about 400,000 such people.   Later\r\n\r\non,  there  may be about one million such senior citizens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So we must have a comprehensive plan  to  tackle\r\n\r\nthe problems of an ageing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three suggestions to make. On the family,\r\n\r\nMinister  Mah  Bow  Tan has mentioned that  there  are  about\r\n\r\n800,000  families in Singapore, and the number is  likely  to\r\n\r\nrise to one million. On the average, there will be one senior\r\n\r\ncitizen  in every family.  So, at home, we have to  start  to\r\n\r\neducate  our young to respect the old and take care of  them.\r\n\r\nWe  must  also  ensure that there is good care  for  the  old\r\n\r\npeople.  As it is said  in Chinese, \"Look after your own  old\r\n\r\npeople  and extend it to look after other people's old people\r\n\r\ntoo.\"   We must be caring to all the old people around us, so\r\n\r\nthat we have a compassionate and caring society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent a lot of time talking about setting up more\r\n\r\nchildcare centres because of the need for them.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  ageing  population, we must also seriously  think  about\r\n\r\nestablishing more elderly-care centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the MCDS should consider setting up day care\r\n\r\ncentres for the elderly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  our  community clubs or community centres.  Now that  the\r\n\r\ntrend in our society is to have small families, couples  have\r\n\r\nto  work  in the day time, while the old people are  left  at\r\n\r\nhome.   They  may feel very lonely. So if you have  day  care\r\n\r\ncentres  in  the  community centres and the community  clubs,\r\n\r\nthen  such  senior  citizens can go to the  centres  to  read\r\n\r\nnewspapers, watch TV, sing karaoke songs, or do some physical\r\n\r\nexercises.   These  day care activities will  certainly  make\r\n\r\nlife happier and more wholesome for such old people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is said, the four essential things in life are:\r\n\r\nclothing,  food,  housing, and transportation.   To  our  old\r\n\r\npeople,  clothing is not much of a problem.  As for  housing,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of National Development has already  announced\r\n\r\nvarious measures to make the HDB flats more user-friendly for\r\n\r\nthe elderly, such as having lift landing on every level, etc.\r\n\r\nMinister  Mah  Bow Tan has already actively  considered  this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that we must have regular health\r\n\r\nscreening for senior citizens.  Minister Lim Hng Kiang has\r\n\r\nalready accepted my proposal.  I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third one is transportation problem. I mentioned\r\n\r\nthis in the debate on the President's Address.  Generally, we\r\n\r\nhave  a  good and safe public transport system in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  have  taxis, buses, MRT and LRT, and so on.  But although\r\n\r\nthe  senior citizens are granted concessions for the  use  of\r\n\r\npublic transport, these concessions are restricted to certain\r\n\r\nperiods  of  the  time.  I would like to  ask  if  this  time\r\n\r\nrestriction  can  be removed.  I understand that  the  Inter-Ministerial   Committee  has  accepted   this   proposal   in\r\n\r\nprinciple.   Now  it  is for SBS and TIBS to  implement  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation.  Hitherto, I have not heard any good news  on\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two approaches to tackle this problem. One is\r\n\r\nwhen  you  want  to  do something, you  take  the   proactive\r\n\r\napproach  and   actively look for ways and means  to  achieve\r\n\r\nwhat you have targeted to achieve, so that your plans may be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarried  out   smoothly.  On the other hand, if  you  take  a\r\n\r\nnegative  approach, and have no intention  to  work  hard  to\r\n\r\nresolve  the  problem, then you will think of  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nreasons  and excuses for not doing it. So I hope the  parties\r\n\r\nconcerned  would be very active in considering my  proposals.\r\n\r\nWe  must know that the senior citizens had made contributions\r\n\r\nto  nation-building  when  they were  young.   Without  their\r\n\r\ndedication  and contribution, we would not have a  prosperous\r\n\r\nSingapore  today.  So we must give them due  recognition  and\r\n\r\nreward.   I  think  they  deserve  our  concern.   It  is   a\r\n\r\nconcession.   It is not completely free.  So  this  will  not\r\n\r\nseriously  eat  into the profit of the companies.   A  Zaobao\r\n\r\nsurvey  said  that  more  than 90% of those  people  surveyed\r\n\r\nsupported  this proposal.  I hope the parties concerned  will\r\n\r\nconsider this favourably and bring another good piece of news\r\n\r\nto the 280,000 old people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, currently, there is\r\n\r\nan  Elderly  Development  Division,  under  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development.

Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the number of\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens aged 65 years and above stood at 235,000  as\r\n\r\nat  1999 and there will be 529,000 of them in the year  2020.\r\n\r\nThe  rapidly ageing population will mean that there  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased  demand  for  elderly care services  at  the  local\r\n\r\nlevel.   It  has been commented for sometime that  there  are\r\n\r\ninsufficient facilities at the local level for the elderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one particular area of concern among VWOs serving\r\n\r\nthe  elderly is the lack of coordinated effort to look at the\r\n\r\nsocial needs of the community at the planning stage.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot common for services to be needed in a particular locality\r\n\r\nbut one is not able to site the service centre there due to a\r\n\r\nlack  of  a proper site.  Matters are compounded in  the  new\r\n\r\nhousing estates where void decks are becoming short in supply\r\n\r\nand there are competing uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has become critical that the various planning\r\n\r\nagencies  get together and provide for many of these services\r\n\r\nand  facilities at the planning stage.  The Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on the Ageing Population made a recommendation  in\r\n\r\nits  report  last  year,  calling  for  MCDS  to  become  the\r\n\r\ncoordinating  agency  to coordinate with  various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  involved in the town planning stage, that is,  when\r\n\r\nthe   blueprint  is  being  drawn  up,  MCDS  should  be  the\r\n\r\ncoordinating agency to identify the demands and needs of  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   Sir,  it also made the recommendation  that  CDCs,\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations and VWOs be consulted on  the  local\r\n\r\nneeds  as far as the elderly were concerned so that the needs\r\n\r\nand facilities that they require can be taken into account in\r\n\r\nplanning and when implementing programmes for the aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what steps the\r\n\r\nMinistry has taken to become the coordinating agency in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Ageing Population has many good recommendations on how we\r\n\r\ncan prepare Singapore for an ageing population.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  urge  the  Minister for Community Development  to  hasten\r\n\r\nimplementation of some of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecommendations   and   to   ensure   attainment   of   those\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise the issue of community-based\r\n\r\nservices  for  our senior citizens.  Here, I  strongly  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population\r\n\r\non  one of its key desired outcomes for senior citizens,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is,  to  ensure  sufficient opportunities  for  healthy\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens to remain socially, physically and  mentally\r\n\r\nactive.   Indeed,  I  have  been  advocating  this  and  have\r\n\r\nmentioned this in this House on several occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up \"multi-service centres\" and integrating\r\n\r\nhealth,  social and other services under one roof for  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens   has  been  recommended.   Two  models  have   been\r\n\r\nsuggested: (1) co-location of services targeted at  different\r\n\r\nclientele  groups  such  as  senior  citizens,  children  and\r\n\r\ndisabled, and (2) co-location of eldercare services  such  as\r\n\r\nday care, day rehabilitation and home care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that for this scheme to give\r\n\r\nthe  best  results  in the future, we must first  have  basic\r\n\r\ncentres  preferably throughout the island  that  promote  the\r\n\r\nsocial,  physical  and mental well-being of  the  independent\r\n\r\nelderly.  The aim of the centres is to enable the elderly  to\r\n\r\nlead a healthier, happier and independent life for as long as\r\n\r\npossible and to contribute to society for as long as possible\r\n\r\nwithout burdening themselves and others.  Sir, the very basis\r\n\r\nof preventive care for the aged shall depend on a scheme like\r\n\r\nthis.  It is better to strive for excellence in this area  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  do not need to cater excessively to look after  the\r\n\r\nsick and disabled elderly.  I urge the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment to first prioritise setting-up such basic centres\r\n\r\nwhich  are  easier  and cheaper to run.  Once  we  have  such\r\n\r\ncentres   in   place,  other  relevant  services,   including\r\n\r\nchildcare, can be developed from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development should not be\r\n\r\nover-zealous in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngetting  co-location of other services  too  quickly  in  the\r\n\r\n\"multi-service  centres\".  Let there  be  well-founded  basic\r\n\r\ncentres  in  the beginning and expand to have other  services\r\n\r\nfrom  these centres later.  The expansion for other  services\r\n\r\nis  best tailored to the requirements of each centre  or  the\r\n\r\ntask  may be overwhelming and prone to failure.  It is to  be\r\n\r\nnoted  that a constituency that needs eldercare may,  indeed,\r\n\r\nnot need childcare services, and vice versa, depending on the\r\n\r\nage distribution of the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These basic centres will be good platforms to offer help\r\n\r\non various aspects, such as health, finance or job issues, to\r\n\r\nan  ageing  population.  They can also be  further  developed\r\n\r\ninto  day rehabilitation or day care venues and some  of  the\r\n\r\nhealthy  elderly there can even be co-opted to help and  care\r\n\r\nfor the dependent elderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as recommended by the Inter-Ministerial Committee,\r\n\r\nit  is best to set up the \"multi-service centres\" through the\r\n\r\ncollaboration  of the Ministry of Community Development,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health, the Community Development Council and the\r\n\r\ngrassroots and voluntary organisations.  We should  make  use\r\n\r\nof  available infrastructure like the community centres  that\r\n\r\nare   often  under-utilised  in  the  day  as  the   centres.\r\n\r\nGovernmental  financial  subsidy,  of  course,  has   to   be\r\n\r\nforthcoming as the elderly usually have no disposable  income\r\n\r\nto pay for these services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Community Development will take\r\n\r\ninto  account  all the points raised when implementing  these\r\n\r\n\"multi-service centres\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, years ago,\r\n\r\nwhen  Mr  Howe  Yoon Chong presented the White Paper  on  the\r\n\r\nproblems  that  we could face in our ageing population,  many\r\n\r\nwere   sceptical,  but  it  became  obvious  now   that   our\r\n\r\ndemographic  profile is changing faster than expected.   With\r\n\r\nthe  ageing  problem plus the less than satisfied  population\r\n\r\ngrowth,  an  ageing  population has  become  a  very  serious\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raising of CPF withdrawal age, the emphasis on\r\n\r\ntraining  of  our older workers, the promotion of  healthcare\r\n\r\nand the various schemes by the Government to encourage senior\r\n\r\ncitizens to be more active, all help to emphasise the need to\r\n\r\ndeal  with the rapid increase in our ageing population.   But\r\n\r\none  of  the  most  important steps to take to  address  this\r\n\r\nproblem  is  to change the mindset of our population  towards\r\n\r\nold age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 30 to 40 years ago, when we mentioned a person who\r\n\r\nis  50  years and above, an image of an old man came to mind.\r\n\r\nHowever,  through  these years, because of  better  diet  and\r\n\r\nmedical advancements, life expectancy has increased for male,\r\n\r\nmaybe,  up  to  76  and  female, 78.   Therefore,  this  will\r\n\r\nstraightaway  mean  that  those in  the  50s  should  now  be\r\n\r\nconsidered as middle aged and only those who are above 65, or\r\n\r\nso, can be defined as senior citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important for the Ministry to make greater\r\n\r\nefforts  in  promoting  the change  in  the  mindset  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  so  that we have a whole new concept  of  ageing.\r\n\r\nThis  will  not  only change the profile of  the  demographic\r\n\r\npyramid, it also helps to physically and mentally change  the\r\n\r\nnumber of the so-called senior citizens we have now.  And  if\r\n\r\nwe  are able to change the definition of senior citizen  from\r\n\r\nwhat  is now being pursued as around 50-65 to, say, about  65\r\n\r\nto  even  70,  it  would  then reflect  more  truly  our  age\r\n\r\nclassification at this present moment.  I therefore call  for\r\n\r\na number of measures to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Retirement to be raised further;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Define the age when one can be considered senior\r\n\r\ncitizens,  for  example,  increase  the  age  limit   to   be\r\n\r\nconsidered for MRT, bus fares, or any other such concessions;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All senior citizens' clubs' or associations'\r\n\r\nqualifying age should be increased;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Redefine the classification of age for senior\r\n\r\ncitizens in senior sporting events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran is not here.

I  am also pleased that the Government is extending\r\n\r\nthe  CPF's top-up scheme to include the grandparents as well.\r\n\r\nThe  above measures will encourage more young people to  live\r\n\r\nwith  and  take  care of their aged parents,  promote  inter-generational  ties and strengthen family bonding  and  filial\r\n\r\npiety among the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's population is ageing rapidly. It is a\r\n\r\nmatter  regarded as very serious among all  our  people.   In\r\n\r\n1998,  the  Government formed the Inter-Ministerial Committee\r\n\r\non  the  Ageing  Population to lead  a  coordinated  national\r\n\r\nresponse  to  address  the challenges of Singapore's  rapidly\r\n\r\nageing  population.   The  Inter-Ministerial  Committee   has\r\n\r\nfinalised its recommendations and has submitted its report to\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Perhaps, the Government could enlighten  us\r\n\r\non  whether there is any timeframe for the implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  various  recommendations of the report, as many  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  who spoke before me have also expressed interest  in\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government provides childcare subsidies for working\r\n\r\nmothers to send their children to childcare centres of  their\r\n\r\nchoice.   Of  course, the children are the future masters  of\r\n\r\nour  nation.   There  is  nothing wrong  with  such  subsidy.\r\n\r\nHowever, for our elderly, who had worked hard and contributed\r\n\r\nto  our  nation during their younger days, we should consider\r\n\r\ngiving  similar  subsidy for working couples  to  send  their\r\n\r\nelderly  in  the  family  to some elderly  day-care  centres,\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether they are run by the voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations, or by private operators, or cooperatives.   If\r\n\r\nthe  Government  could grant the subsidy, it  will  encourage\r\n\r\nmore private operators and cooperatives to play a larger role\r\n\r\nin  providing  affordable services to  those  who  need  such\r\n\r\nservices.  Hopefully, more day care centres would be  set  up\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of our senior citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has introduced the studio apartments for\r\n\r\nour  elderly  to have more choices in their housing  options.\r\n\r\nThis is something which is very good. HDB has also promised a\r\n\r\n\"complete  living environment\" so that the  elderly  will  be\r\n\r\nable to live near their children and other elderly people  in\r\n\r\nan   estate  with  easily  accessible  amenities.   Can   the\r\n\r\nGovernment inform us on the types of facilities and  services\r\n\r\nwhich will be provided for residents of the studio apartment?\r\n\r\nWill  the  service  providers be confined  to  the  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations?  Can private operators also be  given\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to provide such services?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> First, let\r\n\r\nme  thank  Members who have spoken.  I must admit that  I  am\r\n\r\nreally  impressed  by  the  passion  and  the  commitment  of\r\n\r\nMembers,  especially on the institution of  the  family,  and\r\n\r\nindeed  this bodes well for the community.  We, at MCD,  have\r\n\r\nput the family at the top of our agenda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, come 1st April 2000, MCD will become the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Community Development and Sports (or MCDS).  This signals\r\n\r\nmore  than a mere change of name.  I would like to take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to lay out the new policy directions and emphases\r\n\r\nthat  my Ministry will pursue to strengthen our social fabric\r\n\r\nand the role of sports in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS' mission is to build a cohesive and resilient\r\n\r\nsociety,   supported  by  four  pillars:  that  is,  socially\r\n\r\nresponsible  individuals,  strong  and  stable  families,   a\r\n\r\nsporting  people,  as well as a caring and active  community.\r\n\r\nAnd  all Singaporeans must share these responsibilities.  But\r\n\r\nMCDS  has  a special role in nurturing individuals,  families\r\n\r\nand  the  community and in charting out the policy directions\r\n\r\nfor the future of sports and social services in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this mission, Sir, MCDS will adopt the\r\n\r\nfollowing approaches and emphasis.  First, where feasible, we\r\n\r\nshould  take  an  integrated Government  approach  to  social\r\n\r\nissues.  Whether it is preparing for an ageing population  or\r\n\r\naddressing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe issues of family ties, values, marriage and procreation - these  are  highly  complex  issues  which  cut  across  many\r\n\r\nagencies  and  sectors of the community.  We therefore  agree\r\n\r\nwith Dr Vasoo, Dr Jennifer Lee, Mdm Claire Chiang and others,\r\n\r\nwho  have highlighted the benefits and effectiveness of  such\r\n\r\nan integrated approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need the spirit of active citizenship in the\r\n\r\npublic  and  private as well as people sectors.   The  social\r\n\r\nissues we face today can no longer be addressed by Government\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to make the social safety net more effective, we\r\n\r\nwill increasingly work upstream to identify and deal with the\r\n\r\nroot  causes before they grow into social problems.  MCDS  is\r\n\r\nstudying  the problem of youths and families in  distress  to\r\n\r\nidentify  the predictors and the risks.  And based  on  these\r\n\r\nstudies,  we  will  strengthen preventive  and  developmental\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pillar: we want socially responsible\r\n\r\nindividuals.   We want citizens who are active to  serve  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  At the very least, we want Singaporeans  to  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their own lives.  But there will always be\r\n\r\nthose  who  need  help.   And social welfare  will  therefore\r\n\r\ncontinue to be a major responsibility of my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we will strengthen our rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogrammes for juvenile offenders.  As family involvement  is\r\n\r\ncritical  for  the effective rehabilitation of offenders,  we\r\n\r\nwill  increasingly seek the involvement of  parents  in  this\r\n\r\nprocess.   And  I am happy to inform the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  Dr  Vasoo,  that  we  will  propose  making  parental\r\n\r\ninvolvement  and  counselling mandatory  when  we  amend  the\r\n\r\nChildren and Young Persons Act before the end of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move to our second pillar, which is the family.\r\n\r\nThe  family,  as  we  know,  is  the  single  most  important\r\n\r\nstabilising  pillar  of society.  And MCDS  will  deepen  its\r\n\r\ncommitment to building strong and stable families.   However,\r\n\r\nfamily  values are under pressure due to changing  lifestyles\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrising  expectations.   Our young are delaying  marriage  and\r\n\r\npostponing   having  children.   Both  men  and   women   are\r\n\r\nstruggling to balance their work and family responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore  in the national interest  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  a pro-family environment.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure  Dr Jennifer Lee, Mdm Claire Chiang and other  Members\r\n\r\nthat as lead Ministry for the family, MCDS will work with our\r\n\r\nvarious  partners  to  put  in  place  an  integrated  policy\r\n\r\nframework  on  the  family.  We will  promote  practices  and\r\n\r\nservices which create a family-friendly environment which  is\r\n\r\nconducive  to  marriage  and procreation  and  which  support\r\n\r\nfamilies in their parenting and care-giving roles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a key concern, as has been alluded to by several\r\n\r\nMembers,   is  marriage and procreation.  The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nraised  this  issue  during  the debate  on  the  President's\r\n\r\nAddress  last  October.  Although the  proportion  of  single\r\n\r\ngraduates  has  remained stable somewhat, there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ndramatic  increase in the proportion of single non-graduates.\r\n\r\nAnd  as a group, there are far more non-graduate singles than\r\n\r\ngraduates.   For  example,  the  singlehood  rate  for   non-graduates between the ages of 40 and 44 years has risen  from\r\n\r\n9.2% in 1990 to 13.8% in 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for those who choose to marry and have children,\r\n\r\nthe  median age of mothers at birth of their first child  has\r\n\r\nincreased  from 27.5 years in 1990 and eight years later,  in\r\n\r\n1998,  to  28.5  years,  a  one year  increment.   The  total\r\n\r\nfertility  rate  has fallen, as mentioned by  other  Members,\r\n\r\nfrom the Dragon year high of 1.96 in 1988 to 1.48 in 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Singaporeans are not replacing themselves. The\r\n\r\nfewer  babies  we  have, the more we will  have  to  rely  on\r\n\r\nimmigrants to make up the numbers. This may have an impact on\r\n\r\nour  social  structure  and values. Our  population  is  also\r\n\r\nageing  rapidly partly because of this fall in the  fertility\r\n\r\nrate.  With increased singlehood and smaller families, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamily as the primary source of care and support may also  be\r\n\r\neroded.   But  Singapore is not alone  in  this  regard.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  Italy and Spain saw their fertility rates  decrease\r\n\r\nsteadily from replacement levels in early 1980s to about 1.17\r\n\r\nin 1995. Japan also reported fertility levels of only 1.42 in\r\n\r\n1995. Japan has implemented a set of comprehensive pro-family\r\n\r\npolicies,  the so-called \"Angel Plan\", mentioned by  Dr  Wang\r\n\r\nyesterday,  which increased childcare benefits, nursery  care\r\n\r\nservices, reinforced maternity and child healthcare  systems,\r\n\r\nand provided help in childcare costs, besides other measures.\r\n\r\nYet, Japan has yet to see a turnaround in their TFR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to arrest declining fertility rates, our\r\n\r\nprocreation  policies must be targeted at the broad  base  of\r\n\r\nthe population and not just at graduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subject is a very complex one which requires a\r\n\r\nmulti-agency  and  a  multi-sectoral approach.  For  Members'\r\n\r\ninformation,  there  is  currently an Inter-Ministry  working\r\n\r\ncommittee looking into the issues of marriage and procreation\r\n\r\nin  detail.   And I would like to thank Dr Vasoo,  Prof.  Low\r\n\r\nSeow  Chay and the Member for Bukit Timah, Dr Wang Kai  Yuen,\r\n\r\nfor  their  suggestions  and  comments  on  this  subject  of\r\n\r\nnational  concern  and certainly their  suggestions  will  be\r\n\r\nconveyed to the Inter-Ministry committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to mention that in its effort to\r\n\r\naddress the problem of singlehood and under procreation, this\r\n\r\nworking  committee  will  be looking  into  the  plethora  of\r\n\r\nreasons   and   attitudes   that  discourage   marriage   and\r\n\r\nprocreation and what we can do to encourage family  formation\r\n\r\nand to provide family support.  I agree with Dr Jennifer Lee,\r\n\r\nDr Vasoo and Mdm Claire Chiang that an integrated approach is\r\n\r\nnecessary  in tackling wider family issues.  But  given  that\r\n\r\nthe  Inter-Ministry working committee is still  deliberating,\r\n\r\nit  would  be  premature  for me  to  comment  on  whether  a\r\n\r\nstructure,  similar to the high-profile IMC  for  the  Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation  or  a  series of committees focused  on  specific\r\n\r\nissues, as mentioned by Mdm Claire Chiang yesterday, would be\r\n\r\nthe most effective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  take  family issues forward.   Nonetheless,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to assure the House that my Ministry will work  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the Singapore family is given high priority  on\r\n\r\nthe national agenda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the ageing population. The IMC on the\r\n\r\nAgeing Population has been cited by Members as a good example\r\n\r\nof a multi-agency initiative and approach. The Government has\r\n\r\naccepted the Committee's recommendations in principle  and  I\r\n\r\nam  glad to report that implementation of the recommendations\r\n\r\nis on schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some recommendations have already been implemented, for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Ministry of Health's recent revisions  to  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies  for VWO-run nursing homes, while others are  being\r\n\r\nimplemented,  such  as  the Supplementary  Retirement  Scheme\r\n\r\n(SRS)   announced  by  Dr  Richard  Hu.  The  rest   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  such  as the development  of  multi-service\r\n\r\ncentres  and  an elder-friendly built environment,  would  be\r\n\r\npart of a longer term programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leading agency on the ageing issues and\r\n\r\nsecretariat to the Committee, my Ministry is working with the\r\n\r\nvarious agencies to ensure the effective implementation of as\r\n\r\nmany  recommendations  as  possible,  bearing  in  mind  that\r\n\r\nsolutions   have  to  be  feasible,  sustainable  and   cost-effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to youth development. Our youths are\r\n\r\nour   future.   Agencies,  such  as  the  NYC,  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  the  Ministry  of Education,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  including the Ministry of Home Affairs  and  various\r\n\r\nnon-governmental organisations have been doing  an  excellent\r\n\r\njob in running youth programmes in line with their respective\r\n\r\norganisational concerns. However, we agree with calls that it\r\n\r\nis  timely  for us to take a more coordinated approach.  MCDS\r\n\r\nwill  henceforth  play  a more active  coordinating  role  to\r\n\r\nensure  a  more  integrated approach to youth development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  My Ministry will also give increased emphasis  on\r\n\r\nyouth matters by incorporating such matters into a new Sports\r\n\r\nand Youth Division in MCDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next pillar is a caring and active community. MCDS\r\n\r\nhas  been  reviewing  how community services  can  be  better\r\n\r\ndelivered and made more responsive to local needs.   We  also\r\n\r\nwant  to  empower the community to do more  for  itself.   We\r\n\r\nintend  to  delegate certain functions to CDCs, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  take  on  the  role  of planning and  delivering  social\r\n\r\nservices  at  the  local level. Apart  from  planning  social\r\n\r\nservices,  the CDCs will serve as the first-stop  for  social\r\n\r\nassistance  in  the  community,  thus  making  services  more\r\n\r\naccessible to those who need help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs will also be the local focal point for\r\n\r\nvolunteerism and community involvement.  Getting more  people\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  community services and activities will  promote\r\n\r\ncommunity bonding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this delegation of functions to CDCs, the role of\r\n\r\nMCDS  will  be  less in direct services, but more  in  policy\r\n\r\nformulation,  national planning, as well as  in  setting  and\r\n\r\nregulating standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the services to be delegated to the CDCs is the\r\n\r\nadministration of Public Assistance (PA) and other short-term\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance schemes. The CDCs will also take  charge\r\n\r\nof  planning  and siting community-based services,  beginning\r\n\r\nwith childcare, student care and also family service centres.\r\n\r\nWe expect to delegate these functions in phases over the next\r\n\r\nfew  years.  In  fact, two CDCs, the Marine  Parade  and  the\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar CDCs, will be involved in the first phase  with\r\n\r\nthe other CDCs coming on board later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to sports. Dr Vasoo has asked for an\r\n\r\nelaboration  of  our  policy on sports.  To  provide  greater\r\n\r\npolicy  focus  on sports, MCDS will, as I mentioned  earlier,\r\n\r\nform a new Sports and Youth Division from 1st April 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since my announcement of MCD becoming MCDS, I sense\r\n\r\nrising  expectation  on what should be done  for  sports,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  resources,  manpower  and  financial  support  and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  Members' speeches during the past two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndays mirror this expectation.  I empathise with this.  But  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  also emphasise that the sports fraternity  and  the\r\n\r\nvarious  stakeholders should also accompany this  expectation\r\n\r\nwith effort, commitment and changes in mindset, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the Singapore Sports Council, my Ministry\r\n\r\nintends  to  consult  various  stakeholders  in  the   sports\r\n\r\nfraternity on a new vision for sports in Singapore,  as  well\r\n\r\nas  strategies  to  realise this  vision.   We  have  already\r\n\r\nstarted this process in February and we hope to announce  our\r\n\r\nnew sports vision before the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much of the desired outcomes of sports policy include\r\n\r\nincreased  focus on national pride and community bonding,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise that sports excellence or winning medals remains  a\r\n\r\nkey  driving force.  Hence, the critical element  is  greater\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  and  accountability of the  National  Sports\r\n\r\nAssociations or NSAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, we have identified three strategies to\r\n\r\nachieve  this.  The  first  is  for  the  SSC  to  develop  a\r\n\r\nsystematic   programme  of  training  for  NSAs   in   sports\r\n\r\nmanagement and board governance. We will start with  NSAs  in\r\n\r\nthe core and merit sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative is to encourage the \"twinning\" of\r\n\r\nkey  NSAs  with  GLCs or MNCs.  Corporate  sponsors  will  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to adopt NSAs so that the latter can benefit  from\r\n\r\nthe  financial support and guidance on corporate  governance.\r\n\r\nAsia  Pacific Breweries (APB), for example, not only sponsors\r\n\r\nthe FAS' S-League but provides management expertise as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third strategy is greater accountability in the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of resources. To optimise resources  and  promote\r\n\r\nbetter  accountability, we will coordinate  funding  by  SSC,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Pools and other major funders and tie  funding  to\r\n\r\nplans,  targets and results mutually agreed upon between  the\r\n\r\nsponsors and the NSAs. Leadership effectiveness will also  be\r\n\r\ntaken into account as plans will remain as plans unless  they\r\n\r\nare  properly executed.  My Ministry and SSC will  work  with\r\n\r\nthe NSAs towards this objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Ris, Mr Ong Kian Min, and Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai  Yuen  have  raised the idea of a  Sports  School.   This\r\n\r\nsubject was also broached at the SSC@21 Sports Conference  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  this  year.  I am glad to inform Members  that  MCDS\r\n\r\nwill be working with the Ministry of Education to see how  we\r\n\r\ncan best make the idea of a Sports School a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is prepared to consider funding such a school to a\r\n\r\nsimilar  extent as it funds other secondary schools, provided\r\n\r\nthere   are   competent  organisations  willing  to   provide\r\n\r\nadditional  funding and see to the running and management  of\r\n\r\nsuch a school.  MCDS will work closely with MOE on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also just announced a scheme whereby autonomous\r\n\r\nschools  can  develop  different niche areas  of  excellence,\r\n\r\nincluding  sports.   This  is one  way  to  establish  sports\r\n\r\nexcellence  in  schools.   In fact, some  of  our  mainstream\r\n\r\nschools  already  make special provisions for  athletes.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  at  Anglican High School, I was  told  that  sports\r\n\r\npersons  from different sports attend classes together  where\r\n\r\ntheir  time-tables are scheduled to enable them to train  and\r\n\r\nattend inter-school competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of sports for community bonding, I am\r\n\r\npleased  to announce a new initiative mooted by the East-West\r\n\r\nCultural  Development  Centre, a non-profit  organisation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Under  the overall rubric of \"Building  Community\r\n\r\nthrough Sports\", the proposed programmes seek to involve  the\r\n\r\ncommunity   in  sporting  events  as  much  as  possible   as\r\n\r\nparticipants, spectators and also as sponsors.  One  proposal\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  studying is a series of inter-community  youth\r\n\r\ngames  between  the CDCs.  The games will have  a  youth  and\r\n\r\nfamily focus and spectator involvement will be encouraged, by\r\n\r\nplacing  emphasis  on cheer leading teams, for  example.  The\r\n\r\nsupport of local business community will be sought to further\r\n\r\nthe idea that corporations have an important role to play  in\r\n\r\nsports development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these plans and priorities which I have outlined, I\r\n\r\nam confident that MCDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  on  the  right road to building a cohesive and  resilient\r\n\r\nsociety.  But to achieve our desired outcomes, MCDS will need\r\n\r\nthe  cooperation of many agencies and sectors. We  need  also\r\n\r\nactive  citizens  who are prepared to do their  part.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  MCDS  and  Singapore  will  rise   to   this\r\n\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the other questions raised by\r\n\r\nMembers.   Dr  Vasoo, Dr Lily Neo, Mdm Claire Chiang  and  Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer  Lee have been very passionate in their support  for\r\n\r\nthe  family.   I  agree  totally with them  that  the  family\r\n\r\nremains the single most important stabilising pillar  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety. It is an institution which is very important to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many Members have pointed out, our families are\r\n\r\nchanging.  They are facing stress and strains brought  on  by\r\n\r\nchanging  lifestyles and many of the social problems  we  now\r\n\r\nface are more complex. Dual-income families, as mentioned  by\r\n\r\nDr Lily Neo, are now quite common in Singapore, especially as\r\n\r\nour  women become better educated. For women aged  25  to  34\r\n\r\nyears,  the  group  most likely to have young  children,  the\r\n\r\nmarried  female workforce participation rate has  risen  from\r\n\r\n32.7% in 1979 to 52.1% in 1989, and again to 66.7% last year.\r\n\r\nTrends  in  developed  countries are similar.   So,  to  help\r\n\r\nfamilies   cope  with  the  changing  social   and   economic\r\n\r\nenvironment,  my  Ministry promotes both the  \"hardware\"  and\r\n\r\n\"software\" programmes for families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on \"software\". My Ministry works with\r\n\r\nsocial  service agencies and self-help groups in many  public\r\n\r\neducation  programmes.  We will continue doing this  in  more\r\n\r\neffective  ways with a view to reaching out to as many  types\r\n\r\nof  audiences as possible.   And our key strategy  in  family\r\n\r\nlife  education  is for MCDS to provide a  resource  bank  of\r\n\r\nmessages, materials, trainers and to facilitate groups in the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and private sector to reach out to as many  people\r\n\r\nas possible, particularly the so-called unconverted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for \"hardware\", my Ministry promotes care centres for\r\n\r\nchildren,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  and the elderly, family service centres  and  other\r\n\r\nservices to create an environment which supports but does not\r\n\r\nsupplant  the family's nurturing and care-giving roles.   And\r\n\r\nwe  agree  that schools are good locations for  student  care\r\n\r\ncentres, as mentioned earlier by either Mdm Claire Chiang  or\r\n\r\nDr  Jennifer  Lee.  And based on the survey conducted  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  indeed,  about 50% of parents using  student  care\r\n\r\ncentres share this view.  There are currently 22 student care\r\n\r\ncentres  in schools, and we are working with MOE to encourage\r\n\r\nmore  schools  to  set  up  student  care  centres  in  their\r\n\r\npremises.   And  there is a fee subsidy scheme  for  children\r\n\r\nfrom low income families who go to such centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has suggested that we co-locate childcare\r\n\r\nservices with social day care centres (SDCs) for the elderly.\r\n\r\nIndeed,   my  Ministry  plans  to  co-locate  family  service\r\n\r\ncentres, childcare centres, student care centres and  elderly\r\n\r\ncare   centres  together  in  multi-service  centres  (MSCs).\r\n\r\nFamilies would find these MSCs more convenient, as they  will\r\n\r\nallow   the   various  service  providers  to   network   and\r\n\r\ncollaborate,  thus  bringing  about  synergies   in   service\r\n\r\nprovision.   Dr Neo's suggestion of \"borrow a granny\"  scheme\r\n\r\nis  indeed  one innovation which can take place at  the  MSC.\r\n\r\nThe  Tampines East PCF, I am told, has tried out this concept\r\n\r\nin   their   three-in-one  family  centre  with  considerable\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On maid sharing, the Ministry of Manpower has considered\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scheme but found that it could create complications,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the question of responsibility for looking  after\r\n\r\nthe welfare and housing of these foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many dual income families have maids, they need\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily be the only care providers.  The full  range\r\n\r\nof  options  should be considered first. Given the importance\r\n\r\nof  the early years in a child's development and in nurturing\r\n\r\nof   strong  parent-child  bonds,  families  should  consider\r\n\r\nwhether or not both parents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  work full-time during these critical years.  And,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this  will  entail  some  material  sacrifices,  but\r\n\r\nfamilies  should re-examine their own priorities and consider\r\n\r\nthe  merits  of  having one or one and a half  income  during\r\n\r\nthese important years in their children's development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, dual income families could consider\r\n\r\ninvolving the extended family, ie, parents, aunties,  uncles,\r\n\r\nin  the  care of their children while the couple is at  work.\r\n\r\nAnd  there  is also the option of the childcare  and  student\r\n\r\ncare centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCD agrees that having flexible work arrangement is\r\n\r\nyet  another avenue to help parents balance work  and  family\r\n\r\ncommitments.   So  both  my  Ministry  and  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower   support   the   adoption   of   flexible   working\r\n\r\narrangements.   It is inappropriate, however, for  Government\r\n\r\nto  compel  companies  to  adopt prescribed  measures.   Work\r\n\r\nprocesses  and worker profile vary across organisations,  and\r\n\r\nemployers must be given the flexibility to choose, and  being\r\n\r\nprescriptive  will  give  rise to rigidities  in  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  and  add  to the financial burden  of  the  companies\r\n\r\nwithout necessarily meeting the needs of the employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a better approach would be to promote awareness and\r\n\r\nrecognition.   MCD  has  introduced a Family  Friendly  Award\r\n\r\n(FFA)  in 1998 in collaboration with MOM, SNEF and the  NTUC.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  are now conducting a survey on public attitudes  and\r\n\r\npreferences  as  well  as producing publicity  and  education\r\n\r\nmaterials on family-friendly practices, among other plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also urged that we change the mindset of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans on the role of men in the family.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  draw  Members'  attention to the study on  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nfamily  released  last year.  The study  found  that  78%  of\r\n\r\nmarried  respondents agreed that \"although  the  husband  may\r\n\r\nhelp out, the wife is responsible for the housework.\"  And it\r\n\r\nis  notable that more women than men held this view (85%  and\r\n\r\n60%).   This  suggests that there are many  couples  who  are\r\n\r\nquite comfortable with the traditional division\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  roles in the family.  However, the same study also  found\r\n\r\nthat  younger couples are more likely to share household  and\r\n\r\nparenting  duties.  We can encourage and educate  couples  to\r\n\r\nshare  household responsibilities, but I do not think  it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate for the Government to insist on a change of roles\r\n\r\nif the individuals are comfortable with them.  What roles the\r\n\r\nhusband  and wife would play must be left for them to decide.\r\n\r\nWe can only encourage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Dr Ho Tat Kin and Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee have also asked about infant and child care.  My\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary Secretary, Mrs Yu-Foo, will answer  all\r\n\r\nthese questions on my behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to family life education. Both Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire  Chiang  and  Dr  Jennifer Lee  had  called  for  more\r\n\r\ntargeted  and extensive parenting and family life  programmes\r\n\r\nto  strengthen families and parents as carers.   My  Ministry\r\n\r\nagrees   that   families  today,  especially  parents,   need\r\n\r\nstrengthening and support, both as nurturers of the young and\r\n\r\ncarers  of  the elderly.  Sir, this is no mean task  in  this\r\n\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We work with VWOs and various civic organisations to\r\n\r\nhelp  parents  at  different stages of their  parenting  life\r\n\r\ncycle  in  their  nurturing  and  caring  functions,  eg,  by\r\n\r\norganising   parenting   talks  and  distribution   of   age-appropriate resource materials, and producing video tapes and\r\n\r\npamphlets  for carers of the elderly.  We also encourage  and\r\n\r\npromote support groups for parents and carers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD also adopts a multi-prong and multi-channel approach\r\n\r\nbased on the following four strategies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Spearheading family life education and parenting\r\n\r\nmessages based on studies on family and parenting needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Coordinating and extending outreach by partnering\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  the  private sector in  the  production  and\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  family  life  and  parenting  messages  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   This  enlarges the network and  customises  the\r\n\r\nmessages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  different target groups and brings the programmes closer\r\n\r\nto the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Developing and sponsoring resource materials and\r\n\r\ntraining  of  family life educators.  The resource  materials\r\n\r\nfor  parents are differentiated according to significant  age\r\n\r\ngroups  of  children,  eg,  pre-school,  primary  school  and\r\n\r\nteenagers.  And we sponsor a graduate certificate  course  in\r\n\r\nparent education conducted jointly by Swinburn University  of\r\n\r\nTechnology,  Australia, and the Family Resource and  Training\r\n\r\nCentre here.  The number of graduates for 1998 and 1999  were\r\n\r\n26 and 18 respectively.  Another class, I am told, will start\r\n\r\nnext   month.   The  Ministry  also  sponsors  training   and\r\n\r\nmanagement of parent support groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The fourth strategy is media activities organised\r\n\r\nto  generate awareness and mass outreach.  We also  publicise\r\n\r\nfamily  life  programmes in the press, radio, magazines,   at\r\n\r\nbus stops and MRT stations and through our web site.  We also\r\n\r\nhave  new  initiatives  in the pipeline  which  includes  the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  a  guide for family life educators,  and  the\r\n\r\ntitle of the book is Learning About Parenting Young Children.\r\n\r\nIt  will  help  social work professionals and volunteers  who\r\n\r\nconduct parenting programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also established a Central Repository of\r\n\r\ntraining and resource materials, and we also organise regular\r\n\r\nsharing  of  best practices among experts in the  field.   We\r\n\r\nhave   formalised  a  structured  comprehensive  family  life\r\n\r\neducation   delivery   system  by  appointing   family   life\r\n\r\nambassadors from all walks of life.  This was announced by my\r\n\r\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary earlier in the week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also producing a Malay video tape to equip\r\n\r\ndivorcing   parents  with  effecting  parenting  skills   for\r\n\r\nchildren affected by divorce called Anak Amanah Kita Bersama.\r\n\r\nIt  will be launched on 25th March and it will be screened at\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah Court and social service agencies.  My  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill be working on other language versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, we will feature case studies and family\r\n\r\nissues on TV along the lines of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  popular series Extraordinary People, and supporting  the\r\n\r\nYoung  Parents  of the Year Award.  We will continue  to  pay\r\n\r\nspecial  attention  to at-risk groups and we  partner  social\r\n\r\nservice agencies in this effort.  In this connection, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  commend Dr Lee for initiating the programme Healthy\r\n\r\nStyle  for couples and families which her hospital identified\r\n\r\nas  needing  special and closer help from social agencies  in\r\n\r\ntheir parenting and family responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang would also be pleased to know that the\r\n\r\ncommittee  on  the family has a work group on  parenting  and\r\n\r\nanother  on  stresses  on  the  family.   They  are  actively\r\n\r\nreviewing  what  more can be done to strengthen  and  support\r\n\r\nfamilies and parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with both Dr Jennifer Lee and Mdm Chiang that\r\n\r\nmuch  more can and should be done to create awareness and  to\r\n\r\neducate  our  people on the importance of the family  as  the\r\n\r\nbasic building block of our society.  Given the wide spectrum\r\n\r\nof  issues to be covered under family life education and  the\r\n\r\ndiverse groups of people we want to reach to, MCDS cannot  do\r\n\r\nthis on our own.  We must continue to engage and partner  the\r\n\r\npublic,  private  and  people sectors  in  our  efforts  and,\r\n\r\nindeed,  we welcome feedback and suggestions on what and  how\r\n\r\nwe can best bring this message to our families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin asked about abandoned babies. Sir, the\r\n\r\ntruth  is  that  we do not know who the parents  are  in  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of cases of abandoned babies.  In the few instances\r\n\r\nwhere  the parents are identified, they are not always  young\r\n\r\npeople,  as  commonly  perceived.  The  number  of  abandoned\r\n\r\nbabies  is actually small, ranging from 3-7 a year  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  five years.  Of these, the mothers of only seven babies\r\n\r\nwere traced, and only one of them was a teenager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ho that public education on responsible\r\n\r\nparenting is critical, and that is why my Ministry emphasises\r\n\r\ncontinuous  family  life  public education  programmes  which\r\n\r\ncover a variety of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntopics  including  marriage  preparation,  parenting,  family\r\n\r\nenrichment  as  well as effective parent-child communication,\r\n\r\nespecially  on  sensitive issues such as  teenage  sexuality.\r\n\r\nFor  the  young  people,  we need to tackle  the  problem  at\r\n\r\nsource,  ie,  parents must take the responsibility  to  spend\r\n\r\ntime with and instill the right values in their children, and\r\n\r\nto  supervise and guide them wherever they can.  Some of  our\r\n\r\nprogrammes  help parents to spot tell-tale signs  of  teenage\r\n\r\npregnancies  and  to  point  them  to  the  support  services\r\n\r\navailable in the event their children get into trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, abandoning babies is against the law. That must be\r\n\r\nestablished.  But while we do not want to encourage  children\r\n\r\nborn  out of wedlock, we also recognise the trauma that unwed\r\n\r\nmothers  and their child face and their need for  support  in\r\n\r\ntheir  plight.   This  is  why  we  provide  services  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's  Child  Protection  and  Welfare  Service,  social\r\n\r\nservice agencies, or medical social workers at any Government\r\n\r\nrestructured hospital which the unwed mothers could  turn  to\r\n\r\nfor  help.  Arrangements can be made for the mothers to  stay\r\n\r\nin  a  temporary  shelter pending delivery, if  she  requires\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation.  Should the mother want to give up\r\n\r\nher  baby,  the  Ministry will assist in adoption  placement.\r\n\r\nWhere the unwed mother is a teenager, the Ministry and social\r\n\r\nservice  agencies will generally work with the girl's parents\r\n\r\nto provide the support and guidance needed by the girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho asked if my Ministry could consider a baby deposit\r\n\r\nscheme   like  the  one  in  Hamburg,  which  the  newspapers\r\n\r\nhighlighted recently.  Sir, it must be clear that this option\r\n\r\nis  akin  to  abandonment, albeit of a different nature.   We\r\n\r\nnote  the  different views among the Germans and  even  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who read about this, and the views are  divided.\r\n\r\nI would like to advocate a careful and closer study into this\r\n\r\nbefore  we  adopt similar methods in Singapore.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nneed   to   look  holistically  at  the  social   issues   of\r\n\r\nabandonment, the needs of the mother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  child, and the wider societal values  and  legality\r\n\r\ninvolved.  I believe our current approach balances  the  need\r\n\r\nto  preserve our traditional family values and the welfare of\r\n\r\nboth  the  unwed mother and child.   But we will continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor the Hamburg scheme and we will keep our minds open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay and Dr Wang raised the issue of\r\n\r\nmarriage  and procreation and on the setting up of an  Inter-Ministry Committee.  I think I have already responded to this\r\n\r\npoint  in  my earlier speech, but I would like to  thank  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah, Dr Wang,  for his two suggestions  to\r\n\r\nboost  fertility, ie, to consider additional  tax  incentives\r\n\r\nfor the third and fourth child and to teach our girls the joy\r\n\r\nof  larger families.  I will pass on this suggestion  to  the\r\n\r\nworking committee to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for family support services which Prof. Low has asked\r\n\r\nabout,  I  had earlier mentioned a number of them,  including\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres,  student  care  centres,  family  service\r\n\r\ncentres, and promoting family-friendly work places and family\r\n\r\nlife  programmes, such as parenting courses for  the  various\r\n\r\nage groups.  My Ministry is committed to regularly review and\r\n\r\nimprove  these programmes and services to support individuals\r\n\r\nand  families  in  making  life  decisions  such  as  getting\r\n\r\nmarried, having children and the care and upbringing  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on sports now. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had given\r\n\r\nseveral  suggestions  on how we can make  Singapore  a  great\r\n\r\nsporting  nation.   I  would like to thank  Mr  Yeo  for  his\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and my Ministry will certainly  take  his  views\r\n\r\ninto   consideration,  as  we  work  with  all  the  relevant\r\n\r\nstakeholders  in the sports fraternity.  The  Sports  Council\r\n\r\nalso supports the idea of providing housing schemes for these\r\n\r\nvarious  NSAs,  of both recreational and competitive  sports.\r\n\r\nThat is why we have given much support to provide a home  for\r\n\r\neach  of  the  core and merit sports.  We have also  provided\r\n\r\nsome  accommodation for some active NSAs,  ie,  non-core  and\r\n\r\nmerit sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Council also provides office space at\r\n\r\nsubsidised rental rates to NSAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  with the limited land and space that  we  have,  we\r\n\r\nneed to be realistic as well as pragmatic in our distribution\r\n\r\nand  provision  of  such  resources.  Nevertheless,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  see  how  best we can  provide  NSAs  with  the\r\n\r\nrequisite facilities as our resources and manpower allow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin asked about careers in sports. Sir, one\r\n\r\nof our strategies in making Singapore a sporting nation is to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we  have viable career options for  people  who\r\n\r\nchoose  to continue their interest in sports.  But  it  is  a\r\n\r\nfact of life in Singapore that most parents and children give\r\n\r\ntheir  priority  to education and to career  over  full  time\r\n\r\ncommitment to sports.  This is inevitable and understandable,\r\n\r\ngiven the highly competitive environment we are in.  However,\r\n\r\nwe are encouraged that there is an increasing number of young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are prepared to put  their  education  and\r\n\r\ncareer on hold to achieve sports excellence and glory for the\r\n\r\ncountry.   The  SSC  will nurture them and  provide  all  the\r\n\r\nencouragement   and  support  to  help  them  achieve   their\r\n\r\naspirations,  including scholarships,  financial  and  future\r\n\r\ncareer options and assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Council will help retiring athletes get\r\n\r\ncertification as coaches if they wish to, and  if  they  meet\r\n\r\nthe  standards.   For example, we have sent  Sheik  Allaudin,\r\n\r\nthrough  a  scheme for national athletes, to attend  coaching\r\n\r\ncourses   under   the  National  Coaching  and  Accreditation\r\n\r\nProgramme  (NCAP).   He  has  earned  his  qualification  and\r\n\r\nassumed  the  national coach's position.   As  Members  know,\r\n\r\nfootballers, Fandi Ahmad and Malek Awab, have also benefitted\r\n\r\nfrom  this scheme.  SSC also provides career counselling  and\r\n\r\nguidance.  But more can be done to develop a sports  industry\r\n\r\nwhich  offers a career in sports and its related  fields.  We\r\n\r\nwill   continue to study and promote the development of  this\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked for more grants to NSAs.\r\n\r\nSir,  although  SPEX  21 is targetted at  sports  with  medal\r\n\r\nprospects  at  the  international  and  regional  games,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports Council also funds other types  of  sports,\r\n\r\nsuch as volley ball\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand other team sports. The Sports Associations of non-SPEX 21\r\n\r\nsports   receive  between  $8,000  and  $120,000  per  annum,\r\n\r\ndepending on their annual programmes.  As Members know, funds\r\n\r\nfor  sports  promotion  are limited.   The  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil has to be judicious in its allocation and will not be\r\n\r\nable to meet the financial needs of all NSAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be difficult to work on a ratio of 2:1 or\r\n\r\n3:1 funding formula, as suggested by Mr Ang, because even the\r\n\r\ncore and merit sports under SPEX 21 only receive between one-third  and  two-thirds of their funding from SSCs,  and  they\r\n\r\nwould  have to source the remainder from corporate and  other\r\n\r\nsponsors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min wanted to promote figure ice skating in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He has made two suggestions to promote figure ice\r\n\r\nskating  both as a sport which we could excel  in  and  as  a\r\n\r\ncareer  path for Singaporeans.  He has suggested  building  a\r\n\r\nworld  class ice skating rink for the promotion of the sport.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  we have two ice skating rinks.  In providing  for\r\n\r\nworld class facilities for promoting sports excellence and in\r\n\r\nland  scarce  Singapore we have to be  mindful  of  the  many\r\n\r\ncompeting  sporting  needs of our population.  Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be selective and promote certain  sports  for\r\n\r\nexcellence based on a set of criteria and put them under SPEX\r\n\r\n21 programme.  At the moment, there are no strong reasons, to\r\n\r\nmy  mind,  to include figure ice skating as a sport we  could\r\n\r\nexcel in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second suggestion is for the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nto  encourage  students  to take up  ice  skating  as  a  co-curricular  activity. Again, MOE has no  immediate  plans  to\r\n\r\nmake  figure  ice skating a CCA in schools.  However,  pupils\r\n\r\nwho  take up the sport with an approved organisation can  get\r\n\r\nCCA  bonus  points  as  provided  for  under  MOE's  recently\r\n\r\nannounced  scheme  to recognise approved  activities  outside\r\n\r\nschools.   SSC  will  continue to work with  the  Figure  Ice\r\n\r\nSkating  Association to develop and promote the  sport.   The\r\n\r\nsupport for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsport  will  increase  correspondingly with  the  demand  and\r\n\r\npopularity of the sport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo and Mdm Claire Chiang have spoken about the\r\n\r\nneed  to  give more help to the VWOs and for my  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nreview  the  funding  formula.  Under the  Government's  Many\r\n\r\nHelping Hands approach to social services, my Ministry  works\r\n\r\nvery  closely with the VWOs, the National Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nService, which is the umbrella organisation of our VWOs,  and\r\n\r\nincreasingly now, with the CDCs, together as stakeholders  in\r\n\r\nthis  social  sector.   We complement each  other's  work  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we  provide a responsive  and  seamless  social\r\n\r\nservice  delivery  system, and my Ministry  coordinates  this\r\n\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VWOs have been receiving and will continue to receive\r\n\r\nGovernment  funding  for capital and recurrent  funding.   We\r\n\r\nare,  in  fact, reviewing our current funding policies.   The\r\n\r\nreview  will  also  consider how we can widen  the  range  of\r\n\r\nservices beyond meeting the basic needs so that those who are\r\n\r\nprepared to pay for more services could have access to  them.\r\n\r\nAnd  to  ensure that an increase in the funding will lead  to\r\n\r\nbetter  standard and effectiveness of services,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nlooking into linking funding to outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like the VWOs to take responsibility for\r\n\r\nmaintaining  good  and  effective  service.    This  can   be\r\n\r\nachieved  through training of VWO staff and board members  to\r\n\r\nequip  them with better governance and management  skills  to\r\n\r\ndeliver a better standard of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS, in fact, has been planning and organising such\r\n\r\ntraining  courses. Today, it has put together a  workshop  on\r\n\r\nboard  governance  which  provides  training  for  VWO  board\r\n\r\nmembers  on good governnance skills and has also developed  a\r\n\r\nSenior   Management  Development  Programme  which  will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented in due course.  The Executive Directors'  Network\r\n\r\nhas  also been set up to enable EDs to learn through  sharing\r\n\r\nfrom  others  in  the  network.  NCSS is also  exploring  the\r\n\r\npossibility of starting a Diploma Course in Non-Profit Sector\r\n\r\nManagement  with one of the local polytechnics as  well.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry has also helped fund and saw to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of the National Volunteers Centre (NVC).  The\r\n\r\nNVC will strengthen the work of VWOs by linking volunteers to\r\n\r\nVWOs and also training them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also actively involved in the effort to\r\n\r\nenhance the role of CDCs when they take on the role of  local\r\n\r\nadministrator for community-based services.  By strengthening\r\n\r\nthe  links between VWOs and CDCs, they can capitalise on  the\r\n\r\noutreach  capabilities that both parties have and there  will\r\n\r\nalso  be greater synergies in the use of scarce resources  in\r\n\r\nthe social sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has also asked how much is enough and\r\n\r\nwho  is  funded to do what.   Last year, we spent $58,736,210\r\n\r\non  non-health related social services, such as services  for\r\n\r\nthe  aged, disabled, the families and children.  I think  the\r\n\r\nissue  is less on whether funding from Government is  enough,\r\n\r\nbut  rather whether we have a system in place that  tries  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  no  one who should be helped  is  left  totally\r\n\r\nneglected,  whether  by  the Government  or  by  the  various\r\n\r\npartners  in society.  The social service sector is  not  the\r\n\r\nsole  responsibility of the Government and each of us  has  a\r\n\r\npart  to play in ensuring that we indeed live up to our ideal\r\n\r\nto be a caring and gracious society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang also quoted yesterday a case study of the\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho Swee Social Service Centre.  I would like to  point\r\n\r\nout that the Centre did not approach my Ministry to develop a\r\n\r\nsecond  FSC.   What  happened was it  was  working  with  the\r\n\r\ncentral CDC to develop a youth centre, and when that did  not\r\n\r\nmaterialise, it planned to relocate its social service centre\r\n\r\nto  another site, so that the existing site can be  used  for\r\n\r\nthe proposed youth centre instead.  My Ministry, as you know,\r\n\r\nfunds  new FSCs, but not the relocation of existing  centres,\r\n\r\nespecially where we feel the existing locations are  good  or\r\n\r\nideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng moaned the fact that the young are not\r\n\r\ncoming up to volunteer and only the old volunteers remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not surprising that there are more elderly\r\n\r\npeople  involved in volunteer activity than the young people,\r\n\r\nbecause those above 60 years of age are likely to be retirees\r\n\r\nwho  may  have  more  time  and less competing  demands  than\r\n\r\nyounger  people.  However, this does not mean that we  should\r\n\r\nnot  encourage more young people to be active volunteers.   I\r\n\r\nagree with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the NCSS had worked out jointly to set\r\n\r\nup,  which I mentioned earlier, the National Volunteer Centre\r\n\r\n(NVC)   in  December  last  year,  and  this  is  to  promote\r\n\r\nvolunteerism  as a way of life among Singaporeans.   The  NVC\r\n\r\nwill  try  to match volunteers of all ages with the voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  that meet their interests.  In  addition,  the\r\n\r\ncentre  would train volunteer leaders and volunteers so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  better equipped to carry out  their  voluntary\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also believe in exposing our people to volunteer\r\n\r\nactivity from young, to inculcate in them an instinct  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for and to contribute to the community they  live\r\n\r\nin.  One good example is the Community Involvement Programme,\r\n\r\nor  CIP,  which involves every primary, secondary and  junior\r\n\r\ncollege  student,  and  the centralised  institute  students,\r\n\r\nlaunched  in  October  1997  by the  Ministry  of  Education.\r\n\r\nCertainly, MCDS will continue to explore ways to attract even\r\n\r\nmore younger people to volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Harun Ghani asked whether there could be another\r\n\r\nmosque  in Jurong West.  Under the Mosque Building Programme,\r\n\r\none  mosque  is built in one new HDB new town.  He  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier  the  DGP criterion of 20,000 dwelling  units.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is already a mosque, which is the Al-Mukminin  Mosque,\r\n\r\nin  Jurong East and the Assyakirin Mosque in the Jurong  West\r\n\r\nNew Town.  There is therefore no plan to build another mosque\r\n\r\nunder the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the increasing demand, the Assyakirin\r\n\r\nMosque   in  Jurong  West  will  be  redeveloped,   and   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment  project will begin from the third  quarter  of\r\n\r\nthis  year,  and is expected to complete in year 2002.   Once\r\n\r\ncompleted, the new mosque will have a larger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapacity  from  the  existing 2,600 square  metres  to  4,500\r\n\r\nsquare  metres.   If  there is a need, MUIS  will  conduct  a\r\n\r\nreview of the Mosque Building Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang spoke at length about empowering\r\n\r\npeople  with disabilities, and she mentioned BizLink.  People\r\n\r\nwith disabilities can approach BizLink for jobs.  The centre,\r\n\r\nwhich was set up in 1986, acts as a central body for the  job\r\n\r\nplacement of people with disabilities.  The centre is jointly\r\n\r\nfunded  by  my  Ministry and the National Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nService  and  currently  it has a  job  bank  of  over  1,700\r\n\r\nemployers.   It  not only looks out for new job opportunities\r\n\r\nbut  also  provides follow-up services and support  to  those\r\n\r\nplaced in employment to help them remain employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from BizLink, there are also other avenues which\r\n\r\nexist for people with disabilities, for example, several VWOs\r\n\r\nhelp  their  clients find jobs.  And people with disabilities\r\n\r\ncan  also register with the Ministry of Manpower's Deployment\r\n\r\nDepartment  or  online with MOM's Internet  job  system.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  and the NCSS are reviewing the employment placement\r\n\r\nsystem  for  people with disabilities to see how  it  can  be\r\n\r\nfurther  improved, including whether there is scope for  more\r\n\r\ndedicated VWOs to complement what BizLink is doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BizLink is already engaged in raising public awareness\r\n\r\nof  the employment potential of people with disabilities.  It\r\n\r\ntelemarkets, for example, to potential employers and their HR\r\n\r\ndepartments   for  available  jobs,  and  visits  prospective\r\n\r\nemployers  to  present what BizLink and its clients  have  to\r\n\r\noffer  them.   It  also  taps  existing  employers  from  its\r\n\r\ndatabase  to  see if they have new openings and  avenues  for\r\n\r\nBizLink's  clients.   BizLink also  provides  free  technical\r\n\r\nadvice  to employers on workplace modifications, if they  are\r\n\r\nneeded,   to  accommodate  the  disabled,  and  monitor   the\r\n\r\nadaptation  of  clients  in  their  workplace.   Apart   from\r\n\r\nfeedback, BizLink also visits the workplace to find  out  how\r\n\r\nclients are coping in their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank Mdm Claire Chiang for her\r\n\r\nsuggestion on encouraging more employers to open up more jobs\r\n\r\nand for an employment bulletin to publicise work openings for\r\n\r\npeople with disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM, in fact, is currently helping to urge employers to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  some  people with  disabilities  can  be  as\r\n\r\ncapable  as any worker.  My Ministry and NCSS will study  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  put forward by the NMP earlier in the  review  of\r\n\r\nthe  employment placement system, and will discuss  with  MOM\r\n\r\nwhere there are synergies to be got from working together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the issue of ageing. Dr Lily Neo and\r\n\r\nMr  Ang  Mong Seng both talked about co-location of eldercare\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is preparing an Eldercare Services Masterplan for\r\n\r\nthe  next  five  years  until 2005.   A  key  focus  of  this\r\n\r\nMasterplan is the setting up of Multi-Service Centres  (MSCs)\r\n\r\nto  cater for all age groups at the local level.  This is  to\r\n\r\nallow  Community  Development Councils (CDCs)  to  administer\r\n\r\ncommunity-based social services, and where possible, the MSCs\r\n\r\nwill  be co-located at Community Clubs to make better use  of\r\n\r\nland and other common resources.  MCDS would also work out  a\r\n\r\nregional  masterplan of services for the next five  years  to\r\n\r\nguide  the  CDCs  in  the  provision of  eldercare  services,\r\n\r\ntailored to local needs.  A network of Activity Centres  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  set  up  around  these MSCs  as  focal  points  for\r\n\r\nvolunteerism  in the community and where the elderly  can  be\r\n\r\nengaged  to help other elderly in need.  The Activity Centres\r\n\r\nare  modelled after our existing Senior Activity Centres  for\r\n\r\nthe  low-income elderly.  However, the Activity Centres would\r\n\r\ncater to the needs of the elderly in the wider community, and\r\n\r\nnot just the low-income.  Thus, my Ministry's plan is similar\r\n\r\nto what Dr Neo described and had in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to caution against overly\r\n\r\nunrealistic  expectations.  Our pace  of  ageing  would  only\r\n\r\nincrease from 2010 onwards.  Therefore building Multi-Service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentres  immediately for every constituency  might  be  over-providing   infrastructure  and  straining   our   resources.\r\n\r\nInstead, we will embark on a programme to build Multi-Service\r\n\r\nCentres for the long term whilst continuing to facilitate the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of eldercare services where there  are  specific\r\n\r\ndemands and needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has asked about subsidies to be given to\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  for  elderly day care centres  operated  by\r\n\r\nprivate companies or cooperatives, and services in the studio\r\n\r\napartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the Masterplan for Eldercare Services,\r\n\r\nwe  are  also determining how we can incentivise the  private\r\n\r\nsector and cooperatives to provide eldercare services for our\r\n\r\ncitizens.    We   will   take  Mr   Ong's   suggestion   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  in  drawing up our framework.   Such  Activity\r\n\r\nCentres will indeed be set up in studio apartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen talked about the uniform age for\r\n\r\ndefining  \"senior citizen\" for benefits.  Mr  Ang  Mong  Seng\r\n\r\nalso spoke about full day concessionary bus fares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is now no common age to determine when one is\r\n\r\nor  is  not  a  \"senior  citizen\", in order  to  qualify  for\r\n\r\nbenefits, as various organisations are free to determine  how\r\n\r\ngenerous  or restrictive they are willing to be.  Also,  some\r\n\r\nof the operations that stipulate a certain age to qualify for\r\n\r\nbenefits  as  a senior citizen, such as bus concessions,  are\r\n\r\nprivate commercial concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our life expectancy increases, what would be\r\n\r\nconsidered \"senior\" now could also creep upwards in  time  to\r\n\r\ncome.   We would rather prefer to leave the cut-off  age  for\r\n\r\ndispensation  of  benefits  to the respective  organisations.\r\n\r\nFor  the purpose of compiling statistics and policy planning,\r\n\r\nhowever,  we  have used 60 years and above  in  the  past  to\r\n\r\ndefine   \"senior   citizens\".   We  have  now   adopted   the\r\n\r\ninternational  norm  of defining \"senior citizens\"  as  those\r\n\r\naged  65  years  and  above, so that we  can  compare  across\r\n\r\ncountries  for  policy analysis and planning,  and  also  for\r\n\r\ncomparison of situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMC on the Ageing Population has supported the call\r\n\r\non  bus  operators to consider extending concessionary travel\r\n\r\nrates  for senior citizens for the whole day.  However,  this\r\n\r\nis  a proposal for bus operators to consider, and bearing  in\r\n\r\nmind  that  being  public  listed companies,  they  are  also\r\n\r\naccountable to their shareholders.  So it would  have  to  be\r\n\r\ntheir decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of elder-friendly features raised by Mr Ang\r\n\r\nMong  Seng, the IMC has recommended \"ageing-in-place\" as  the\r\n\r\nguiding  policy for our environment.  This means that  elder-friendly  features should be included in our housing  estates\r\n\r\nand  the  transport  system as part  of  the  infrastructure,\r\n\r\nincluding  elder-friendly lifts, ramps and other features  to\r\n\r\nmake  our environment \"barrier-free\" for our senior citizens.\r\n\r\nThese features will be gradually put in place as we build our\r\n\r\nnew estates, and upgrade the older ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin spoke about eldercare leave and programmes\r\n\r\nto help change mindsets as well as to prepare the elderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, eldercare leave was one of the suggestions proposed\r\n\r\nduring  the feedback sessions in the deliberations  with  the\r\n\r\nIMC.   However, this is a proposal for companies to  consider\r\n\r\nas  part of the benefits package that they provide for  their\r\n\r\nemployees.  I agree that changing of mindset is essential not\r\n\r\nonly  for the population, for the younger ones, but also  for\r\n\r\nthe senior citizens themselves.  But this requires collective\r\n\r\neffort  and  my Ministry is working with VWOs to  draw  up  a\r\n\r\npublic  education  programme or plan to  address  this.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  some  VWOs  conduct  seminars  to  help  the  young\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  communicate  with  their  aged  parents  and\r\n\r\ngrandparents.   This  will allow the young  and  the  old  to\r\n\r\nbetter understand and communicate with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers from various VWOs also regularly visit the\r\n\r\nelderly who are living alone.  For those elderly who wish  to\r\n\r\nequip  themselves with relevant skills, the Senior  Citizen's\r\n\r\nDivision   in   People's  Association  organizes   continuing\r\n\r\neducation  classes on a variety of topics  in  the  community\r\n\r\nclubs.  To help our younger people to prepare themselves  for\r\n\r\nold age, my Ministry is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking   with  the  Civil  Service  College  on  a  training\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  civil servants.  We hope to  share  with  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector employers a similar programme, perhaps  at  a\r\n\r\nlater stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are now 17 day care rehabilitation centres\r\n\r\nand 14 social day centres.  We have plans to set up more such\r\n\r\ncentres  over  the next few years, as part of  our  Eldercare\r\n\r\nServices  Masterplan.  There are already guidelines on  these\r\n\r\ncentres and the guidelines will be progressively enhanced  to\r\n\r\nensure good service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Lily Neo spoke on financing for step-down\r\n\r\ncare.   Arising from the IMC's recommendations, I am informed\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Health is studying a Severe Disability\r\n\r\nInsurance,  or SDI, scheme to protect against the high  costs\r\n\r\nof  care required by those with serious disabilities and  are\r\n\r\nunable  to perform normal activities of daily living  without\r\n\r\nconsiderable help from other people.  So it is being  studied\r\n\r\nand MOH will have to decide on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked that the SDI scheme covers\r\n\r\nmedical  expenses  of  a  chronic  nature  incurred  in   the\r\n\r\noutpatient  setting.   I  am  not  too  sure  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nmeaningful to cover such expenses because the treatments  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  affordable  and are not  low  probability  events.\r\n\r\nTreatment  for  chronic  illnesses,  such  as  diabetes   and\r\n\r\nhypertension, is heavily subsidised at Government polyclinics\r\n\r\nand  public  hospitals.  And Singapore citizens aged  55  and\r\n\r\nabove  already  enjoy a 50% fee concession at the  Government\r\n\r\npolyclinics.  They are thus generally already affordable.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, these chronic illnesses are more  prevalent,\r\n\r\nmaking  the  premiums  for  such insurance  cover  very  much\r\n\r\nhigher.   So,  in the end, the elderly might  be  better  off\r\n\r\nsaving the money from the premiums to pay for the treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I share Dr Neo's concern that inappropriate use of\r\n\r\nmedical facilities will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlead  to  unnecessary  healthcare cost  increases.   However,\r\n\r\nwhether  a  patient  ought  to  be  cared  for  in  hospital,\r\n\r\ncommunity facility, or in his own family, should depend  only\r\n\r\non his medical condition.  The decision has to be made by the\r\n\r\ndoctor  and  not  by  the patient.  Those  who  face  genuine\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  paying for their outpatient medical  expenses\r\n\r\ncould  apply  for  their  fees to  be  waived  at  Government\r\n\r\npolyclinics.   And  needy  Singaporeans  who  attend   public\r\n\r\nhospital's  specialist  outpatient  clinics  may  apply   for\r\n\r\nMedifund  assistance  and  no  Singaporean  will  be   denied\r\n\r\nessential  healthcare services because of their inability  to\r\n\r\npay.   Hence,  Dr  Neo's fear of patients  abusing  inpatient\r\n\r\nfacilities for the sake of using Medisave or MediShield  does\r\n\r\nnot arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the Ministry of Health has\r\n\r\ngot the ECU (Elderly Care Unit), whereas my Ministry runs the\r\n\r\nEDD  or  the  Elderly Development Division,  and  as  he  has\r\n\r\nrightly pointed out, they run different services.  People are\r\n\r\nconfused.  MCD runs social day care centres, for example,  we\r\n\r\nrun social activities and MOH runs other centres which have a\r\n\r\nhigher  health  care content.  I agree with the  Member  that\r\n\r\nsometimes the public are also confused about where to go, and\r\n\r\nsometimes  they  run  from one type  of  centre  to  another,\r\n\r\ndepending on the status and condition of their health.  We at\r\n\r\nMCD  are also concerned about this overlap and confusion  and\r\n\r\nseparation  of roles which are not really clear  for  certain\r\n\r\ncases.  We certainly agree with the IMC's recommendations and\r\n\r\nwe  are  looking  into  it to see how  this  problem  can  be\r\n\r\nresolved between MOH and ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A.

MCD  promotes  childcare  services\r\n\r\nthrough  a three-pronged strategy - ensuring availability  of\r\n\r\nchildcare  places,  promoting quality  care  and  maintaining\r\n\r\naffordability.   I  would  therefore  take   some   time   in\r\n\r\nresponding  to the hon. Members' questions on the  supply  of\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres, childcare standards and  their  continued\r\n\r\naffordability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had asked about the\r\n\r\nsupply of childcare centres.  My Ministry has come a long way\r\n\r\nin  meeting  the demand for this very important service.   In\r\n\r\n1980, there were only 25 childcare centres in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nnumber has increased 20-fold to 535 today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has first encouraged voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations and subsequently commercial operators to set up\r\n\r\nchildcare   centres.  The  Ministry  has   ceased   operating\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres  way back in 1979.  Today,  about  60%  of\r\n\r\nchildcare places are provided by commercial operators.   They\r\n\r\nare  able  to  set  up freely as long as  they  meet  minimum\r\n\r\nstandards.  We are therefore able to harness market forces to\r\n\r\nguide supply towards demand.  MCD facilitates the process but\r\n\r\nchildcare industry is primarily market-driven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pure market mechanism is unable to operate\r\n\r\neffectively  at  HDB estates, due to a shortage  of  suitable\r\n\r\ncommercial  property space for childcare centres,  Government\r\n\r\nallows  the  use of void decks for use as childcare  centres.\r\n\r\nIn new HDB estates, MCD plans ahead of demand through regular\r\n\r\nmeetings  with  HDB.  This allows childcare  premises  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  together  with  the housing  blocks.   For  other  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  MCD increases the number of centres in high  demand\r\n\r\nareas  that we identify through waiting lists, feedback  from\r\n\r\nthe ground, including MPs' feedback, and other data.  We also\r\n\r\nmonitor closely the number of children born each year so that\r\n\r\nwe  can  plan  ahead.   Our development  plans  include  both\r\n\r\ncommercial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  non-profit operators.  Non-profit operators can approach\r\n\r\nus  to  propose sites and MCD would work with them to set  up\r\n\r\ntheir centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 2000, MCD expects nearly 49 new childcare\r\n\r\ncentres, increasing childcare places by about 3,300 or 8%  in\r\n\r\nthis financial year.  Over the next three years, this rate of\r\n\r\ndevelopment will mean an increase in capacity of about 20%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang was also concerned about the childcare\r\n\r\ndevelopment at Sengkang and Punggol.  Included in these plans\r\n\r\nare  Sengkang and Punggol.  Today, Sengkang has six childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.   Over the next three years, around 30 new childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  will  be set up.  Punggol is a new  estate  that  is\r\n\r\nstill   under  development.   We  have  already  planned   10\r\n\r\nchildcare centres over the next two years in line with  HDB's\r\n\r\nbuilding programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee has suggested that childcare centres\r\n\r\nalso  take in children under 18 months.  Any childcare centre\r\n\r\ncan  do so as long as they comply with our minimum standards.\r\n\r\nThe  same  childcare  subsidy  is  extended.  Most  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  however  prefer not to take  in  children  under  18\r\n\r\nmonths  as  they require much more care and attention.   Many\r\n\r\nchild  experts agree that the first few years  of  a  child's\r\n\r\nlife  are  important for parent-child bonding  and  are  best\r\n\r\ncared  for  at home.  There is also the concern that  centre-based  care  may expose the young infant to cross-infections.\r\n\r\nGranting  higher subsidies for children under 18 months  will\r\n\r\nsend  the  wrong signal that parents should put the child  in\r\n\r\ncentres at such a tender age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo observed that some centres have long waiting\r\n\r\nlists.   But  double  counting is common  in  waiting  lists,\r\n\r\ncausing  the lists to be inflated by about 30%. For  example,\r\n\r\nsome  parents  place  a  child on the waiting  list  of  many\r\n\r\ncentres.   Today,  we have about 45,000 childcare  places  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. There are, in fact, more vacancies than demand  at\r\n\r\nthe national level. Even so, a waiting list exists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause   some  parents  are  choosy  and  due  to  localised\r\n\r\nshortages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate better matching of supply and demand, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  will be delegating the local planning of  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  to Community Development Councils (CDCs) later  this\r\n\r\nyear, starting with the Marine Parade and Tanjong Pagar CDCs.\r\n\r\nCDCs, being closer to community, are better able to gauge and\r\n\r\nrespond to local demand.  MCD will continue to project demand\r\n\r\nfor  and  plan  the  supply  of child-care  services  at  the\r\n\r\nnational  level,  and  focus  on  licensing  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nacceptable standards are met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo had asked about childcare centres in the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  I am pleased to inform Dr Neo that  besides\r\n\r\npromoting  the  setting up of childcare  centres  at  private\r\n\r\nresidential  areas,  we also encourage childcare  centres  in\r\n\r\ncondominiums.    URA  levies  development  charges   at   the\r\n\r\nresidential  rate, instead of commercial rate, for  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres in condominiums.  In addition, URA lately also lifted\r\n\r\nrestrictions requiring such centres to serve residents  only.\r\n\r\nThat  means, they are also open to outsiders. These  measures\r\n\r\nwill  reduce  the cost of setting up and running  child  care\r\n\r\ncentres in condominiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Dr Ho Tat Kin and Dr Jennifer Lee for their\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  steps my Ministry  has  taken  to  require\r\n\r\ndiploma  training for childcare supervisors.  As  Dr  Ho  has\r\n\r\nrightly  pointed out, there is increasing evidence indicating\r\n\r\nthe  importance of a child's early years. To  quote  a  World\r\n\r\nBank publication, \"It is well established scientifically that\r\n\r\nthe   early   years   are  critical  in  the   formation   of\r\n\r\nintelligence, personality and social behaviour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD has licensed childcare centres for more than 10\r\n\r\nyears.  MCD  has also an established training system  whereby\r\n\r\nchildcare workers can upgrade from a Basic level certificate,\r\n\r\nthrough   the  Intermediate  level,  to  an  Advanced   level\r\n\r\ncertificate.  This  system has served us  well.  Today,  most\r\n\r\nstaff in our childcare centres are trained. About 80% of  our\r\n\r\nchildcare  centre  supervisors  have  already  attained   the\r\n\r\nadvanced level of training or higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with 60% of each cohort of our students being\r\n\r\ntertiary-educated, tapping on the certificate level group  of\r\n\r\neach  cohort  is  not  enough given the importance  of  early\r\n\r\nchildhood  education.  Hence, MCD will require all  childcare\r\n\r\nsupervisors  to be diploma trained in five years'  time.   In\r\n\r\naddition, we are also targeting for each centre to  have  one\r\n\r\nteacher   trained   at  the  diploma  level.   This   diploma\r\n\r\nrequirement has not been introduced in isolation.  Many other\r\n\r\ncomplementary steps have also been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD issues a set of guidelines last year so that only\r\n\r\ndiplomas awarded by training agencies that meet our standards\r\n\r\nwill  be  recognised. We have worked with training  agencies,\r\n\r\nsuch as Ngee Ann Polytechnic and the training arm of the NTUC\r\n\r\nChildcare,  to  provide  a range of  diploma  programmes  for\r\n\r\ndifferent target groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary school-leavers were able, for the first time\r\n\r\nlast  year,  to  take a Diploma in Early Childhood  Care  and\r\n\r\nEducation offered jointly by Ngee Ann Polytechnic and  NTUC's\r\n\r\ntraining  arm.   There  are also specially  designed  diploma\r\n\r\ncourses   which  allow  in-service  childcare  personnel   to\r\n\r\nupgrade.    Even  diploma  and  degree  holders  from   other\r\n\r\ndisciplines will soon have a post-graduate diploma course  to\r\n\r\nhelp them switch to the early childhood field.   In addition,\r\n\r\nwe have arranged for funding from the Skills Development Fund\r\n\r\n(SDF),  as  well as the NTUC's Skills Redevelopment Programme\r\n\r\n(SRP) to help to defray these training costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, childcare teachers must have an intermediate\r\n\r\ncertificate level of training in early childhood. We have  no\r\n\r\nplans  to  raise  this requirement in the  immediate  future.\r\n\r\nHowever,  teachers  and supervisors alike are  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  continually in a spirit of life-long  learning.  MCD\r\n\r\nhas  been  working  with the Association of  Early  Childhood\r\n\r\nEducators,  Singapore  (AECES) to raise  professionalism  and\r\n\r\nexpertise in the early childhood field. From time to time, we\r\n\r\njointly  organise  seminars  and  workshops  to  share   best\r\n\r\npractices across the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho also mentioned about normalising standards. Sir,\r\n\r\nnormalising standards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans   requiring  all  childcare  centres  to  have  similar\r\n\r\nstandards  and level of service. We prefer to set  a  minimum\r\n\r\nstandard  for all centres. Centres wishing to upgrade  beyond\r\n\r\nminimum  standards  are encouraged to do so  and  many  have.\r\n\r\nThis  approach  gives  parents  flexibility  and  variety  of\r\n\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements are also in store for MCD's licensing\r\n\r\nsystem. My Ministry has developed a more effective system  to\r\n\r\nevaluate  the  quality of childcare centres  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nunacceptable care practices are detected and corrected early.\r\n\r\nThis system will be implemented in the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also be introducing a new web-based\r\n\r\ncomputer  system that will link up all childcare  centres  to\r\n\r\nMCD  electronically.   This will improve  efficiency  and  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's  ability  to track standards in  centres.  Parents\r\n\r\nwill  also be able to search for centres nearest their homes,\r\n\r\nto  register  with any childcare centre on-line,  and  access\r\n\r\nbasic  information of childcare centres, like  opening  hours\r\n\r\nand fees.  MCD will announce more details of this system at a\r\n\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to affordability, Dr Jennifer Lee was concerned\r\n\r\nthat childcare fees might rise if centres have to pay more to\r\n\r\nattract  better qualified staff.  Based on data  gathered  in\r\n\r\n1998,   the  average  salary  of  diploma  trained  childcare\r\n\r\nsupervisors   was  about  $2,300  and  that  for  non-diploma\r\n\r\nsupervisors was $1,700.  In comparison, the average  starting\r\n\r\npay of a polytechnic graduate, that is, across all fields  of\r\n\r\nstudy,  is about $1,400. The average pay of all workers  with\r\n\r\npost-secondary education, including polytechnic graduates and\r\n\r\nthose from JCs, is about $2,400. As you can see, the pay that\r\n\r\nchildcare supervisors are getting today is already similar to\r\n\r\nthat of diploma holders elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry had examined the impact of its higher\r\n\r\ndiploma  requirements on fees and found that the increase  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  be significant.  Currently, about  40%  of  our\r\n\r\ncentres  already  have  at least one  staff  trained  at  the\r\n\r\ndiploma level.  A centre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout a diploma-trained supervisor is expected to pay about\r\n\r\n$600  more  to  attract a diploma-trained supervisor.  For  a\r\n\r\ntypical centre with 75 children, this translates to about $8,\r\n\r\n2% more per child per month. The timeframe for implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  diploma requirement is five years. This rise  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, be spread over a five-year period. The  impact  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  minimal  and is a small price to  pay  for  higher\r\n\r\nstandards.   MCD  monitors  the  affordability  of  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres closely. Dr Lily Neo would be glad to know that we do\r\n\r\nnot control fees.  Rather, we employ a range of strategies to\r\n\r\nmaintain affordability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD's plans to increase the supply of childcare centres\r\n\r\nis  an  important factor in fanning competition  which  keeps\r\n\r\nchildcare  fees in check.  The childcare subsidy for  working\r\n\r\nmothers  at  $150  per  month for full-day  also  helps  make\r\n\r\nchildcare affordable for many families. Each year, about  $60\r\n\r\nmillion is given out. Low-income families may also apply  for\r\n\r\nadditional  financial assistance which are means-tested.  The\r\n\r\nschemes  help low-income families pay both the monthly  fees,\r\n\r\nas  well as initial start-up costs, such as uniforms and  fee\r\n\r\ndeposit.   MCD also allows an extension of childcare  subsidy\r\n\r\nof up to 9 months to mothers who are affected by retrenchment\r\n\r\nand  single  fathers  who are in financial  hardships.   Some\r\n\r\ncentres provide additional subsidies to low-income families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this wide range of fee assistance schemes, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  does not feel that it is necessary to increase  the\r\n\r\nchildcare  subsidy at this stage. My Ministry, however,  does\r\n\r\nagree  with  Dr  Jennifer  Lee  that  these  fees  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes,  like all such schemes under MCD, must  be  reviewed\r\n\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my colleague, Mr Sin Boon Ann, who talked\r\n\r\nabout  marriage to foreigners.  I would like to thank Mr  Sin\r\n\r\nfor  raising  this  issue.  With globalisation,  there  would\r\n\r\ncertainly   be  more  marriages  involving  foreigners.   The\r\n\r\nmajority  of such marriages are successful and happy.   There\r\n\r\nwill,  of course, be instances of unscrupulous foreign grooms\r\n\r\nand brides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  marriage is a very personal decision and  it  is  up  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to think wisely and choose their partners  with\r\n\r\ntheir eyes open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know, in reality, love is sometimes blind.\r\n\r\nThe  greatest prevention against a bad marriage  is  marriage\r\n\r\npreparation.  That is why my Ministry encourages  couples  to\r\n\r\nattend  marriage preparation classes.  MCD works with  Family\r\n\r\nService  Centres  and social service agencies  to  run  these\r\n\r\nclasses.  These classes help couples share more deeply  about\r\n\r\nthemselves, discuss their expectations of each other and deal\r\n\r\nwith  differences and potential conflict before the marriage.\r\n\r\nGrassroots  organisations can work with MCD to organise  such\r\n\r\ncourses  for their residents. For example, the Sembawang-Hong\r\n\r\nKah  CDC  organised a marriage preparation programme for  its\r\n\r\nresidents last month.  If Singaporean overseas clubs are also\r\n\r\ninterested  in  organising marriage preparation  courses  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  stationed overseas, they can approach  MCD  for\r\n\r\nadvice.  Couples  encountering problems during  marriage  are\r\n\r\nalso  encouraged to consult social work professionals in  the\r\n\r\nFamily Service Centres and social service agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin said that there are some cases where\r\n\r\nSingaporean  men are cheated by their foreign wives  who  use\r\n\r\nmarriage as a means to get rich.  They may abuse the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter for this purpose.  However, the Women's Charter  also\r\n\r\nprotects men when their matrimonial assets are divided  in  a\r\n\r\ndivorce.   If the wife is not taking their marriage seriously\r\n\r\nand  contributes little to their marriage and family, she  is\r\n\r\nnot  likely  to  get  away  with a large  proportion  of  the\r\n\r\nhusband's assets easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary Secretary for her  answer.

As you have  heard,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  as well as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  have\r\n\r\nboth  announced that CDCs will indeed do more, starting  from\r\n\r\nMarine Parade as well as Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to recapitulate what CDC is all about in response\r\n\r\nto  Mdm Claire Chiang's point.  CDC is, in fact, a Government\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  facilitate the development  of  heartware,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  enhance  social  cohesion  as  well  as  community\r\n\r\nbonding.   This  is  done  by empowering  the  community,  by\r\n\r\nencouraging  more  community  self-help  effort  as  well  as\r\n\r\nthrough  greater  community involvement.  In  doing  so,  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  feels more stake in CDC's work.  And by organising\r\n\r\nthemselves  to help themselves, the community  will  be  more\r\n\r\nenergised and more active.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, the implication is that there will be more\r\n\r\nconsultation,  and more discussion amongst the community,  to\r\n\r\nsolve community issues.  There will be less and less cases of\r\n\r\nimposition  from  management of  the  CDC,  because  the  CDC\r\n\r\nmanagement is really under the influence and control  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, I agree with Mdm Claire Chiang that officials\r\n\r\nwill  need  to be more people orientated, behaving less  like\r\n\r\nbureaucrats.   There  should  be  more  service   orientation\r\n\r\ntowards the community, as PS21 says.  I have indeed talked to\r\n\r\na  few Administrative Officers who have been seconded to  the\r\n\r\nCDC  as  general managers.  All told me that it was  a  very,\r\n\r\nvery good experience.  They have learned a lot, but they  are\r\n\r\nstill  learning.  If the general managers, as  administrative\r\n\r\nofficers, are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill  learning,  then  the rest of  the  officers  are  also\r\n\r\nlearning.   Let us not forget that the CDC is still  new.   I\r\n\r\nwill  acknowledge that there is still a lot  to  learn.   But\r\n\r\ngive us a little bit more time.   Give us more work.  We will\r\n\r\nlearn. We will improve.  Things will be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also acknowledge that there is a need to do more\r\n\r\nto  enable  the  grassroots  organisations  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations and the CDC to  communicate  better.\r\n\r\nThis is a never-ending task, because these set-ups are all so\r\n\r\ndifferent.   Their  working style and  their  approaches  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.   But is that not the point?  That  when  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout team work, we are talking about getting people who  are\r\n\r\nvery different to work towards a common goal?  And because of\r\n\r\nthe  differences,  all contribute their strength  and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult, we achieve synergy.  And through synergy, we do more.\r\n\r\nGrassroots  organisations have very  good  reach.   They  can\r\n\r\nreach the community.  But they are relatively less skilled in\r\n\r\nhandling,    for   example,   social   problems.    Voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations, on the other hand, have a lot of enthusiasm, a\r\n\r\nlot of expertise, but they do not have good grassroots reach.\r\n\r\nBut  getting  both to work together, we will have  expertise,\r\n\r\nenthusiasm as well as grassroots reach.  We acknowledge  that\r\n\r\nwe  need time to get to know each other better. However, I am\r\n\r\nnot  so  sure  the  correct approach is to ask  the  National\r\n\r\nCommunity   Leadership   Training   Institute   to   organise\r\n\r\nconferences involving many.  I think it would help  to  start\r\n\r\nwith.   However, in the longer run, it is more important  for\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisations, the grassroots organisations and the\r\n\r\nCDC  to  arrange  on their own to talk to each  other.   They\r\n\r\nshould recognise that they have to work together.  They  have\r\n\r\na  common  objective of serving the residents.   They  should\r\n\r\njust get on with working with each other.  In the process  of\r\n\r\nworking with each other, they would communicate more and they\r\n\r\nwould be able to do better as a team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mdm Claire Chiang and Dr Lily Neo have made\r\n\r\nsuggestions on what CDCs should do.  For example, Dr Lily Neo\r\n\r\nmentioned that CDC should pick up the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntab for medical screening for everybody, especially the poor,\r\n\r\nand  that  the CDCs should subsidise Centres of Activity  for\r\n\r\nRetired and Elderly (CARE).  Mdm Claire Chiang suggested that\r\n\r\nthe   CDCs  should  look  into  the  setting  up  of  virtual\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods  for senior citizens.  Since  I  said  earlier\r\n\r\nthat the style of CDCs was consultation, the Ministry and the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association could not impose all these on the  CDCs.\r\n\r\nHence  I  will  pass  the suggestions  on  to  the  CDCs  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.   But  let  me  also  give  some   preliminary\r\n\r\ncomments.  On virtual neighbourhood, I do not understand  why\r\n\r\nwe  want  the old people to talk to each other over the  Net.\r\n\r\nIs  it  not  better to encourage them to come out, meet  each\r\n\r\nother  face to face and talk?  So I think we should  continue\r\n\r\nto  work on our senior citizens' activity programmes, instead\r\n\r\nof  just encouraging more virtual neighbourhoods.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  very healthy for the senior citizens  if  they\r\n\r\nspend all their time on the Net.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards picking up the tab for the health screening\r\n\r\nof  the  poor, let me also say that the Minister  for  Health\r\n\r\nyesterday announced that the screening costs only $5 to  each\r\n\r\nresident  -  above 55.  $5 nowadays can only buy a  ballpoint\r\n\r\nrefill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is for a Mont Blanc refill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I understand Parker refill is about\r\n\r\n$5.  Mont Blanc refill is $7.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the small fee is a reminder that all of us have\r\n\r\na  stake in our health.  I do not think we should just expect\r\n\r\nsomebody  to  pick up the tab for our health  screening.   We\r\n\r\nmust be responsible for our health.  So we must pay something\r\n\r\ntowards health screening.  But I would accept that for  those\r\n\r\nwho  cannot  even afford $5, perhaps the CDC  could  consider\r\n\r\npicking up the tab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if the CDCs were set up for\r\n\r\ncohesion and bonding of residents, why must the head of a CDC\r\n\r\nbe  a Mayor?  It is such an awesome position.  I think it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult for people to be close together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I think we did say that we wanted to\r\n\r\ndevelop the CDC into a local\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadministration.  We need somebody to be accountable for CDC's\r\n\r\nactivities and programmes.  Since Government money  is  going\r\n\r\nto  be  channelled  towards the CDCs to run  local  services,\r\n\r\nsomebody  ought  to be accountable for how public  money  was\r\n\r\nspent.  Therefore, there should be somebody who is called the\r\n\r\nMayor  to be accountable for all these.  Having said that,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we have also talked about CDC's working style and  the\r\n\r\nMayor's working style.  I do not think the working style is a\r\n\r\nvery  awesome one.  In fact, our two Mayors spend  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntime  meeting  people, encouraging residents to  support  and\r\n\r\ncome  for community self-help activities.  We read all  these\r\n\r\nin  the  press.   I  must say I have not heard anyone  saying\r\n\r\nthat our Mayors are awesome characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Vasoo, there is no bonus time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

There are\r\n\r\ntoo  many captains playing in the family field, each  playing\r\n\r\ntheir own game, to some extent.  But I think there is a  need\r\n\r\nto have a recess, so that we can get them to come together to\r\n\r\nreview   family  policies  and  to  come  up  with   a   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive plan to help families to be stronger.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Minister would have to persuade them and maybe they need\r\n\r\na  directive from the Prime Minister to really look at it.  I\r\n\r\nam   very  serious  because  family  policies  need   to   be\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  Various players are playing, like the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Manpower, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health.  A\r\n\r\nlot  of  the  Ministries are involved.  We need  to  look  at\r\n\r\nfamily  policies  very critically, and I would  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a need for us to revisit these areas in order  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  find fresh strategies to deal with the problem.   We\r\n\r\nare  a  compassionate GPC, because we have to spare time  for\r\n\r\nGPC education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a rather long speech just to\r\n\r\nwithdraw your amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Ravindran is not\r\n\r\nspeaking.

With the amendments to  the\r\n\r\nAdministration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) in 1999, the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt has been conferred additional powers that will make  it\r\n\r\nmore  efficient  and  effective in administering  justice  to\r\n\r\nMuslims  in family matters.  After more than a year, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister whether he could give us an  update\r\n\r\non the performance of the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the sittings of the Select Committee on the AMLA\r\n\r\namendments, there were reservations on the amendments. One of\r\n\r\nthem is that they are afraid that more Muslims would turn  to\r\n\r\ncivil  courts when they should be going to the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\nThe  other is that the civil law applied by the civil  courts\r\n\r\nmay  contradict  Syariah law.  I wish  to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether these reservations are valid.  Specifically,  I  wish\r\n\r\nto  ask how many Muslim couples have gone to the civil  court\r\n\r\nto settle their matrimonial problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, the Administration of Muslim\r\n\r\nLaw  Act  and  the attendant Muslim Divorce Rules  came  into\r\n\r\nforce  on  1st  August  last year.  Since  then,  significant\r\n\r\nimprovements to the court system and its work procedures have\r\n\r\ntaken  place.  For example, four ad hoc Presidents have  been\r\n\r\nappointed, two of whom are experienced syariah law trained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudges, and two are civil law trained judges, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  incumbent Senior President and President of the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt.  With their depth of experience, they will add to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the Islamic law jurisprudence  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  night court sessions have also been introduced  to\r\n\r\nbetter serve the public so that more cases could be cleared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Registrar, as you know, has been appointed to\r\n\r\nconduct  pre-trial conferences (PTC) of cases daily, and  the\r\n\r\nPTCs  have  been  effective  in  instilling  discipline   and\r\n\r\nexpeditious disposal of cases and enable the court to dictate\r\n\r\nthe pace and progress of these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the court which has been significantly\r\n\r\nimproved is the introduction of the proxy power of the court,\r\n\r\nwhich  empowers  it  to enforce its orders  relating  to  the\r\n\r\ndivision  of  matrimonial property.  In other words,  if  the\r\n\r\nhusband refuses to transfer the flat or property to the wife,\r\n\r\nbecause  he did not sign the transfer papers, the court  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to exercise that power and transfer the property  to\r\n\r\nthe wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these appointments and procedures, the court has\r\n\r\nmade  significant  progress  towards  maturing  into  a  more\r\n\r\nefficient judicial organisation without compromising justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the waiting time for a case to be heard is\r\n\r\nabout two to four weeks after the pre-trial conference.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of backlog cases had been very much reduced from  421\r\n\r\nto 175 at the beginning of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court has also gained the confidence of the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  its  ability to dispense justice  efficiently,\r\n\r\nspeedily and fairly.  Thus far, there is no application  made\r\n\r\nby parties to have their ancillary matters heard in the civil\r\n\r\ncourt.

This  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause most adult Singaporeans below the age of 45 have gone\r\n\r\nthrough  the Singapore education system and know  the  system\r\n\r\nwell.   Furthermore, for those of us with children,  we  have\r\n\r\nendured  the  triumphs and tribulations  as  they  progressed\r\n\r\nthrough school.  In many cases, it is as if we ourselves have\r\n\r\ngone through school once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system could be visualised as a process\r\n\r\nwhere  at  one end, in go young, bubbly and fun-loving  young\r\n\r\nchildren, and at the other end, out come disciplined, trained\r\n\r\nand  educated  young  adults.  From Primary  4  onwards,  the\r\n\r\nschool  children are graded every two years and  streamed  to\r\n\r\ndifferent ability streams.  They will move on to career paths\r\n\r\ndepending  on  their achievements.  Some 20%  go  on  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversities, another 40% to the polytechnics and the rest to\r\n\r\nITE.   They would have been imbued with the Singapore values,\r\n\r\nensuring a strong Singaporean heartbeat.  We can affirm  that\r\n\r\nour  education  system is an efficient and a well-oiled  one.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  from  time  to  time,  there  are  hiccups,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the Straits Times' report on its front page  today\r\n\r\non the blunder in the administration of examination for third-year medical students.  In the year-end examination they have\r\n\r\njust  sat, some old questions were inadvertently used.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the students had been told to re-sit the paper  this\r\n\r\nSaturday.  The University authority had rejected their appeal\r\n\r\nto waive that examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that by bringing this subject here, we\r\n\r\nwill  bring  undue pressure on the University  administration\r\n\r\nand  might be considered as uncalled for interference.   With\r\n\r\nyour  indulgence, I think it is nonetheless useful to discuss\r\n\r\nsome basic principles.  I believe that so long as no students\r\n\r\nare  given  undue advantages through the use of  past  years'\r\n\r\nquestions  itself,  while  undesirable,  there  is  basically\r\n\r\nnothing wrong.  So long as the syllabus remains unchanged,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  questions about the same topics are by and large  in\r\n\r\nthe   same   ballpark.    In  fact,  some   repetitions   are\r\n\r\nunavoidable.  We all remember our \"A\", \"O\" level  days  where\r\n\r\nwe practised ourselves extensively on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npast years' papers in the 10-year series.  Hence, I would say\r\n\r\nthat  in  handling such a blunder, the students, who are  the\r\n\r\ninnocent  parties  here, should not be unduly  penalised  for\r\n\r\nenduring to sit through the examination one more time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, besides this, there are other issues of\r\n\r\nconcern.   Over the past decade, as our students become  more\r\n\r\nproficient  in  scoring  high marks in  examinations,  it  is\r\n\r\nbeginning to become difficult to differentiate the very  good\r\n\r\nfrom  the good students.  So, from time to time, we are aware\r\n\r\nthat  standards  were raised and the screw  was  tightened  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more.  As a result, stress in our education system\r\n\r\nis  high.  Everyone's focus is on the examination results and\r\n\r\nthe  holistic  development of the person is  relegated  to  a\r\n\r\ndistant second place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students learn too much facts and problem-solving\r\n\r\nmethods  in a structured environment.  But we did  not  learn\r\n\r\nenough   reasoning   and   problem-solving   skills   in   an\r\n\r\nunstructured environment that would allow us to handle  real-life  problems.  Nonetheless, this system has served us  very\r\n\r\nwell  in  our economic development where up to now,  we  need\r\n\r\nonly  to  adopt  established technologies and procedures  and\r\n\r\nimprove upon them.  Furthermore, we are also able to cater to\r\n\r\nthe less academically endowed so that when they leave school,\r\n\r\nthey  have  acquired  some  basic  skills  enabling  them  to\r\n\r\nfunction  in  an  urbanised  society  and  an  industrialised\r\n\r\nworkplace.   This, Sir, is not something to sneeze  at.   Now\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  arrived at the developed stage and  the  next\r\n\r\nstage  of  our  economic development is knowledge  based,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that the focus and the emphasis of  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem must change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the US economy becomes the centre of innovation and\r\n\r\nwealth  creation, we are also becoming more inclined  towards\r\n\r\nthe US education system, to an extent that it is tempting  to\r\n\r\nthink that if we adopt more western education practices,  the\r\n\r\nproblems in our school will be by and large solved.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily so.  It is useful to remember that many high\r\n\r\nschool graduates in the US have such poor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommand  of  reading and writing that the employers  have  to\r\n\r\nsend  these  new  workers for remedial  classes.   While  the\r\n\r\nwestern  education  system might be  more  conducive  to  the\r\n\r\nbrighter  students, they could also be quite  unforgiving  to\r\n\r\nthe weaker students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to make the comparison less meaningful, our\r\n\r\nbilingual policy is the cornerstone of our education  system.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of our emphasis on bilingualism, our pupils  in\r\n\r\nprimary  school  only learn four subjects,  namely,  English,\r\n\r\nMother Tongue language, Mathematics and Science; the last two\r\n\r\ncombined  as  a single examination subject.  For many  pupils\r\n\r\nwith   Chinese   as   the  mother  tongue,   they   spent   a\r\n\r\ndisproportionately  high  percentage  of  their   effort   in\r\n\r\nlearning Chinese.  Some have told me that they spent as  much\r\n\r\nas  60% of their effort on Chinese.  Consequently, few of our\r\n\r\nprimary  school  graduates have been exposed  to  other  more\r\n\r\ninteresting  aspects of human endeavours such as music,  arts\r\n\r\nand history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must adapt our current system to cater to the\r\n\r\nneeds of the new economy while retaining what has worked  for\r\n\r\nus  all  these  years.  The question is how to cater  to  the\r\n\r\ncreativity of the bright and yet ensure that the weak are not\r\n\r\nleft  by  the  wayside.  How do we reduce  the  stress  level\r\n\r\nwithout  compromising the high standards we have attained  in\r\n\r\nour  schools?   How  do we fully exploit technology  to  make\r\n\r\neducation  better tailored to the capability and interest  of\r\n\r\nthe individual students?  How do we encourage greater student\r\n\r\nparticipation in sports?  The list is long and the journey is\r\n\r\nan equally long one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since taking over the Ministry, the Minister has\r\n\r\ninstituted  many  changes.   For instance,  course  load  for\r\n\r\nstudents  has  been reduced.  The compensation  packages  for\r\n\r\nteachers  have  been  enhanced  to  render  teaching  a  more\r\n\r\nattractive  career choice.  But the impact of  these  changes\r\n\r\nwould take some years to show results.  As we look forward to\r\n\r\na Singapore in the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillennium, would the Minister elaborate on his vision of the\r\n\r\neducation  system as well as the areas where he  would  focus\r\n\r\nhis  attention on?  Could he lay out the milestones where the\r\n\r\nvarious  changes introduced by him would produce visible  and\r\n\r\ntangible results?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nfor many years, academic performance has been the focal point\r\n\r\nin  our Singapore education system, as what Dr Wang has  said\r\n\r\njust   now.   Examination  scores  are  more  important  than\r\n\r\nanything else.  This is what matters most in admission to the\r\n\r\njunior  colleges, universities and even jobs,  especially  in\r\n\r\nthe civil service.  School rankings depend on it, so does the\r\n\r\nassessment  of teachers.  Academic performance by examination\r\n\r\nscores  is  the  easiest  to measure,  just  like  output  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  Perhaps that is why such yardstick has been  around\r\n\r\nfor so many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the needs of the new age of technology, the\r\n\r\nMinistry is working out a new school excellence model that is\r\n\r\nnot  only  concerned  with academic  achievements,  but  also\r\n\r\nachievement in areas like arts, sports, uniformed groups  and\r\n\r\nphysical fitness.  The new model widens the scope for schools\r\n\r\nto be assessed - not just in their academic results, but also\r\n\r\nin  other  areas.   With these new criteria,  it  means  that\r\n\r\nschools can encourage students to excel in other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a major leap and I applaud the Ministry. Having\r\n\r\nbeen  steeped in the culture of academic excellence, it  will\r\n\r\ntake  some  time  for  teachers and parents  to  re-orientate\r\n\r\nthemselves to the new possibilities, especially when academic\r\n\r\nperformance  continues  to  matter  most  when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\nadmission to universities, junior colleges and jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in any education system, we must always bear in\r\n\r\nmind that the aim of educating our children is to enable them\r\n\r\nto  contribute to the community.  There is no point nurturing\r\n\r\nwizards who end up caring for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have competition, but not at the cost of\r\n\r\nneglecting other areas of life - the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncamaraderie,  the  need  to care  for  others,  the  need  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to community.  There should be enough  activities\r\n\r\nin  school to let our young learn these values in life.  Only\r\n\r\nthen can we say that education in Singapore is a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the Ministry for having begun the process\r\n\r\nof  revamping  the education system to meet the  needs  of  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the measures that I cannot agree more is the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the double-degree programme at the NUS this\r\n\r\nyear,  allowing  undergraduates  to  earn  two  degrees  from\r\n\r\nseparate  faculties at the same time.  This  paradigm  shift,\r\n\r\naccording to NUS, is to give students a more well-rounded and\r\n\r\nbroad-based  education.  This is a good start.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry does not stop here, but allow such a programme to be\r\n\r\nextended  to  other universities.  Also, the Ministry  should\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing  Singapore or even overseas  graduates  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  second  or even third degrees at our  universities.\r\n\r\nThe  rationale for this proposal is the same as the  one  for\r\n\r\nthe double-degree programme for existing undergraduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits are many. Graduates can acquire more broad-based knowledge that they need at work. The option helps\r\n\r\nthem to become all rounders.  Graduates who want to pursue  a\r\n\r\nsecond  career can do so, without having to spend  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney  overseas or leave their families.  Undergraduates  can\r\n\r\nlearn  from  those  who have been exposed  to  the  workforce\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to open up our universities to provide more\r\n\r\noptions for Singaporeans if we want to inculcate a culture of\r\n\r\na lifelong learning in Singapore.  We have arrived at a stage\r\n\r\nwhere  the  university  is  no  longer  a  place  to  acquire\r\n\r\nknowledge  alone, but a place to search for further knowledge\r\n\r\nand  development.  More changes and flexibility  have  to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced to bring this about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in the next few\r\n\r\nminutes,  I  would  like to touch on four areas:  first,  the\r\n\r\nundermining of our traditional values; second, the importance\r\n\r\nof a holistic education; third, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportance of multi-racialism; and fourth, the allocation  of\r\n\r\nresources to our schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to a KBE dictates the need for change in our\r\n\r\neducation policies.  The importance and urgency of  the  task\r\n\r\nare not in question.  We must imbue in our people, especially\r\n\r\nour young, the capability to search and use information.   We\r\n\r\nmust  encourage our young to be more creative and innovative.\r\n\r\nThese  additional skills and aptitudes would make our  people\r\n\r\nmore  effective in the new economy.  I commend  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nfor  its  vigorous  response  to  this  challenge.   But  the\r\n\r\nresponse  should not undermine the traditional virtues,  such\r\n\r\nas hard work, effort and discipline, that we have worked hard\r\n\r\nto  cultivate  in our society.  These values will  always  be\r\n\r\nrelevant.   In our push for change, we must not inadvertently\r\n\r\ndemean   these   traditional  values.   Take,  for   example,\r\n\r\ncreativity.   Are we overselling it?  Do we need everyone  to\r\n\r\nbe  \"creative\"?  The impression now given seems  to  be  that\r\n\r\nunless  you  are  \"creative\", you will have no  role  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   As some of my learned colleagues in the House  have\r\n\r\npointed  out earlier, many jobs that involve using our  hands\r\n\r\nwill remain.  Besides, is everyone good at being \"creative\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my concern is not the call to our young to be\r\n\r\ncreative and innovative, to be willing to take risks,  but  I\r\n\r\nam concerned that we may oversell these qualities, sometimes,\r\n\r\neven to the exclusion of the traditional virtues.  It takes a\r\n\r\nlong  time, perhaps a generation or two to effect  a  mindset\r\n\r\nchange.   If  it is not done right, it will take  an  equally\r\n\r\nlong time to correct it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore needs wholesome and confident citizens\r\n\r\ncapable  of  adapting  to  and  operating  in  different  and\r\n\r\nchanging   circumstances.   We  must  be  able  to   function\r\n\r\neffectively  as individuals, as members of our  families  and\r\n\r\ncommunities in which we live and work and as citizens.  To be\r\n\r\nable  to do so, Singaporean needs a holistic education.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  task that our Ministry has set for itself to  provide.\r\n\r\nOne of the things the Ministry has done in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  to  achieve  this  goal is to  establish  the  Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes of Education for the various levels of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be interesting to know the mechanism that the\r\n\r\nMinistry has established to measure the achievement of  these\r\n\r\noutcomes by our students.  Based on the results obtained,  is\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  satisfied with what we have achieved  so  far?\r\n\r\nThe success with a holistic education is especially important\r\n\r\nas  we  become a global city by plugging ourselves  into  the\r\n\r\ninternational economic network.  What more can our schools do\r\n\r\nto  enhance  this important goal of producing  wholesome  and\r\n\r\nconfident citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been very successful in bridging the\r\n\r\ndifferences between our races and building strong bonds among\r\n\r\nourselves.   We  have  every  reason  to  be  proud  of   our\r\n\r\nachievements in this area.  However, we must never  take  our\r\n\r\nracial  cohesion and harmony for granted.  Some  may  say  we\r\n\r\nhave  arrived at our destination.  And even if  we  have,  we\r\n\r\ncannot take for granted that we can stay here without further\r\n\r\nefforts  and  care.  Recent events in Kosovo, India,  Nigeria\r\n\r\nand,  closer  home,  in Indonesia, show how  deep-rooted  the\r\n\r\nfeelings  of race and religion are.  We must never take  each\r\n\r\nother for granted, even if we can.  We must continue to build\r\n\r\non  the  respect  and understanding we have for  each  other.\r\n\r\nWith  more time and effort, our bonding will strengthen  even\r\n\r\nfurther.   We must never relax this important aspect  in  the\r\n\r\neducation of our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to the last issue of my cut. Some\r\n\r\npeople  have  advocated that more money should  be  spent  to\r\n\r\neducate  our  good students so that they can be even  better.\r\n\r\nWe  need  capable people to lead.  This makes sense.   Others\r\n\r\nhave  advocated that more money should be spent to help those\r\n\r\nwho  are  less able.  They need more help to level up.   This\r\n\r\nalso  makes  sense.   On the latter line  of  argument,  many\r\n\r\nparents  therefore  have  suggested  that  more  and   better\r\n\r\nresources be deployed at the primary school level.  If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprimary students have a good and strong foundation, they will\r\n\r\nneed  less  help  in  the future years.   The  allocation  of\r\n\r\nresources for education is thus perplexing.  Just how has the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education been allocating its resources?   Many\r\n\r\nwould like to know how the money budgeted to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  is  allocated to the schools.   The  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschools in my area and both elsewhere in Singapore could make\r\n\r\ndo with more help to become even better schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, over the last few\r\n\r\nyears,  there  have been several significant changes  in  our\r\n\r\neducation  system.  We have moved from an  emphasis  on  rote\r\n\r\nlearning  towards  greater creative thinking,  away  from  an\r\n\r\nacademic orientation towards a wider scope of methods through\r\n\r\nwhich  students  can  express  themselves  and  be  assessed.\r\n\r\nCurriculum  has been reduced in favour of that objective  and\r\n\r\nwe  also  have  improved infrastructure and facilities.   And\r\n\r\nperhaps,  most  important of all, we also have  developed  IT\r\n\r\nteaching  in  schools and used it as a vehicle  for  creative\r\n\r\nexpression.  All these are very important changes in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  the  times  and they prepare us for the  so-called  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, a certain bias appears to have crept into our\r\n\r\nvernacular.  We appear to talk of the old economy in somewhat\r\n\r\ndisparaging  terms  and the new economy in  somewhat  glowing\r\n\r\nterms.  If I may illustrate.  In this House, we have numerous\r\n\r\nreferences on the need to work at Internet speed, the need to\r\n\r\nembrace the new economy, otherwise we risk being left behind.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is also that if we do not do so, then we might\r\n\r\nbe  somewhat remiss in the task of governance.  In the media,\r\n\r\nwe  find front page coverage to young junior college students\r\n\r\nwho  have become entrepreneurs or technopreneurs, as the  new\r\n\r\nvernacular  will suggest, taking risks and being prepared  to\r\n\r\nfail  and  wear failure as a badge of honour.  We  also  have\r\n\r\nless  than complimentary references in the media to  the  old\r\n\r\nworld  economy veterans, like Warren Buffet that he  has  not\r\n\r\nembraced  the  new changes with as much speed  as  he  should\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are important messages in their own right.\r\n\r\nBut  they  should be kept in their context.  Ultimately,  the\r\n\r\nInternet  and the new economy is just another way  to  create\r\n\r\nwealth.  It does not represent a new paradigm for the way  we\r\n\r\norganise  ourselves, or the way we govern ourselves,  or  the\r\n\r\nway  we relate to each other.  And I think this is the  point\r\n\r\nthat  must  be  communicated  effectively  to  our  students,\r\n\r\nthrough national education, and other measures, that we  must\r\n\r\nbe  fast but not hasty in decision making, particularly  when\r\n\r\nit  comes  to  policy that affects millions of  Singaporeans;\r\n\r\nthat  we must be connected but not confuse connectivity  with\r\n\r\nbeing  involved with everything, everywhere,  all  the  time;\r\n\r\nthat  we  must be informed, especially when making  important\r\n\r\ndecisions,  but  that  we should not be overwhelmed  by  this\r\n\r\ninformation that is available out there, to be able to  sieve\r\n\r\nout what is important and what is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, the so-called Internet speed has its\r\n\r\nlimits,  particularly in terms of in what context it  can  be\r\n\r\napplied.  You cannot have family relations at Internet speed,\r\n\r\nyou cannot parent your child at Internet speed and certainly,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot build a nation at Internet speed, with the values\r\n\r\nof multi-racialism, meritocracy, integrity and diligence, the\r\n\r\nvalues on which Singapore was built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think national education is the key to\r\n\r\nmaintaining that balance in our education system and I  would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister to pay particular attention to  how  this\r\n\r\nbalance is brought about in the message we give our young  so\r\n\r\nthat  they do not get so enamoured of the wild wild  west  of\r\n\r\nthe  Internet that they forget the old home with  its  yellow\r\n\r\nbrick road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, my question\r\n\r\nis  how is our education system being reviewed to keep it  in\r\n\r\nstep  with what is needed in the new economy?  We have had  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of discussion both in and outside the House about\r\n\r\nhow  we  should  anticipate and meet the  challenges  of  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have identified two goals, and I speak rather\r\n\r\napologetically after Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIswaran  has  spoken.  First, to transform  our  universities\r\n\r\ninto what has been described as \"incubators for inspiration\".\r\n\r\nSecond,  to develop a pool of entrepreneurs willing  to  take\r\n\r\nrisks  and  a  large  group  of workers  with  a  thirst  for\r\n\r\nknowledge and a high degree of creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are highly commendable objectives. They signal a\r\n\r\ndetermination  to  transform our economic  culture  from  one\r\n\r\nwhich  breeds conformity of thought and embraces prudence  to\r\n\r\none  which  celebrates intellectual dissonance  and  aims  to\r\n\r\nremove the stigma of failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on the right track. There is no question that\r\n\r\nthe  system will, in a few years, throw up more entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand  innovators that we now have.  But that is not the point.\r\n\r\nThe  real  issue is whether we will churn out a few  more  or\r\n\r\nmany  more.  The answer, in my view, depends largely  on  our\r\n\r\neducation system.  I do not contend that the education system\r\n\r\nshould be tweaked to teach entrepreneurship.  I subscribe  to\r\n\r\nthe  view  that a person is either born with the stomach  and\r\n\r\ninclination to go off the beaten track or he is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in my view, the true question is not whether\r\n\r\nthe  education  system  can  nurture  entrepreneurs.   It  is\r\n\r\nwhether  it can avoid dampening, or worse, extinguishing  the\r\n\r\npotential  of  the  few  who  have  it  in  them  to  make  a\r\n\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be realistic. We do not have the numbers\r\n\r\nwhich the United States or China or India enjoy.  They have a\r\n\r\nfar larger pool of school children.  It stands to reason that\r\n\r\ntheir  odds  of  producing thinkers and innovators  are  much\r\n\r\nshorter than us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot seriously compete on numbers. So we have to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on quality.  The question is: does our  education\r\n\r\nsystem preserve or lengthen our odds in this game?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine our education system. It imposes\r\n\r\nstandards  and  norms, whether of behaviour  or  achievement.\r\n\r\nThis  is not a criticism. It is a fact.  From young, children\r\n\r\nare  taught  that  there are prescribed  methods  of  finding\r\n\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are made to believe that your test and examination\r\n\r\nresults reflect your ability and potential.  That has  served\r\n\r\nthe  country well.  But are we hurting our chances in the new\r\n\r\nworld?   I  was not surprised when I read that the report  by\r\n\r\nthe   National  Youth  Council  suggested  that  many   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans feel that scoring \"As\" is enough to ensure  them\r\n\r\na  bright future.  Can you take these same people, who for 12\r\n\r\nyears   have  been  told  that  they  should  play  by   long\r\n\r\nestablished  rules  and  that  grades  are  everything,   and\r\n\r\nsuddenly  transform them into hungry and curious participants\r\n\r\nof the new economy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's Straits Times carried a report that parents of\r\n\r\npre-schoolers believe that discipline is more important  than\r\n\r\ncreativity.   80% of parents who were interviewed  felt  that\r\n\r\npre-schoolers   should   have  worksheets.    This   is   not\r\n\r\nsurprising.   Singaporeans are very practical  people.   They\r\n\r\nhave become system smart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is going to be a mammoth task to change the mindset\r\n\r\nof  administrators, principals, teachers, parents who have so\r\n\r\nskilfully  adapted  themselves to the  system  and  are  very\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with  the existing norms.  Unless  we  make  the\r\n\r\neffort and overcome the resistance, we will continue to  have\r\n\r\nscores  of school leavers who will see no sensible reason  to\r\n\r\nstick their necks out or go against the flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of you will remember an athlete by the name of\r\n\r\nRichard Fosbury.  Until 1968, for those who follow athletics,\r\n\r\nhigh jumpers moved from first to the fourth gear and then  up\r\n\r\nthey went over the bar.  In 1968, Dick Fosbury came along and\r\n\r\nhe  did the unthinkable.  He moved from first to third  gear,\r\n\r\nand  just  before the bar, turned direction, engaged  reverse\r\n\r\ngear, and soared over it.  He won the gold medal but that  is\r\n\r\nnot as important as the fact that he changed the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the chances of our system preserving the spark\r\n\r\nof a local Dick Fosbury?  Consider this.  In Mathematics,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  children are taught that getting the right answer is not\r\n\r\nenough.  The method must be right or marks will be  deducted.\r\n\r\nHe is taught that he has to stay in his lane. I am sure there\r\n\r\nis  a  good  reason for that, but do you think  that  we  are\r\n\r\nshortening or lengthening our odds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must move away from prescription and regurgitation in\r\n\r\nthe schools. Children should be assessed not only on content,\r\n\r\nbut  also  on the ability to think on their feet  and  around\r\n\r\nproblems.  The  answer  does not  lie  in  giving  them  more\r\n\r\nprojects.  The sooner we realise it, the better because  most\r\n\r\nof them will end up being done by the parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not going to be easy to develop a pool of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and a creative workforce.  We need to find ways\r\n\r\nto  preserve the potential of the very small numbers that  we\r\n\r\nhave.   It  will be a terrible waste if the education  system\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  transform the street-smart  into  the  system-smart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, we all\r\n\r\nappreciate the need to have clearly defined desired  outcomes\r\n\r\nof  education  so that we will not stray from  equipping  our\r\n\r\nscarce   human  resources  with  the  necessary  skills   for\r\n\r\nsustaining both our economy and society. We are also  mindful\r\n\r\nof  the  competing demands for school time.  Many an argument\r\n\r\nhas  been made to allocate more time to deserving needs, such\r\n\r\nas  national education, inculcation of values, sex  education\r\n\r\nand the list goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to urge the Minister to seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  including  technology as a compulsory  subject,  at\r\n\r\nleast from the secondary school onwards.  This is not just to\r\n\r\nmake  them  entrepreneurs  or Net  savvy.   This  is  because\r\n\r\ntechnology  literacy now ranks as high as language  literacy.\r\n\r\nWithout a working knowledge of technology or specifically  of\r\n\r\ncomputers and the Internet, we will be handicapped. The world\r\n\r\nis  now  a  little smaller if we go by traditional  means  of\r\n\r\nacquiring   knowledge,  such  as  reading  hard   copies   of\r\n\r\nnewspapers and periodicals, books from the library  and  news\r\n\r\nover  television. If we explore all that is at  our  disposal\r\n\r\nvia the Internet, we get the opposite effect, that is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation overload, too many sources, too many channels and\r\n\r\ntoo  many  possibilities.   But  obviously,  to  operate  and\r\n\r\nsurvive  in a global economy, we cannot afford to  limit  our\r\n\r\nability to do more and know more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we should aim at ensuring that our students\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  Internet and related  technology  enough  to\r\n\r\nnavigate and choose.  With technology literacy, they  have  a\r\n\r\ntool  which they can exploit to maximise their own potential.\r\n\r\nHaving  computer-based education in schools is not quite  the\r\n\r\nsame  nor good enough.  Students probably regard the computer\r\n\r\nas  a  means to an end, say, completing a Mathematics lesson.\r\n\r\nBeyond  the lesson, there is little understanding of  how  it\r\n\r\nworks.   Even  if  certain skills were  picked  up,  such  as\r\n\r\nlogging  on  and logging off and the differences between  the\r\n\r\ndifferent disk drives, the emphasis is still very much on the\r\n\r\ncontent rather than the technology itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that we are experiencing ever-changing\r\n\r\nneeds for a knowledge-based and driven economy.  There is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  technology is ever-changing  and  we  can  never\r\n\r\nmaster it perfectly.  But it will be far better to be a  part\r\n\r\nof  its  evolution  than  to have a  long  lag  after  proper\r\n\r\nschooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking for schools to incorporate the equipping of\r\n\r\nsuch skills in a timely fashion as curriculum proper and  not\r\n\r\nbe  left  as  co-  or  extra-curricular activities,  such  as\r\n\r\nleaving IT club to teach web design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise a related issue\r\n\r\nregardless of how technology is introduced in schools and ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to help change the mindsets of those involved in\r\n\r\ntechnology-related  education, from  being  a  teacher  to  a\r\n\r\nfacilitator,  so  as  to  allow innovation  to  spring  forth\r\n\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in this\r\n\r\nbudget,  the  Ministry of Education made out a long  list  of\r\n\r\nachievements  in its educational ideals.  However,  from  two\r\n\r\nrecent incidents, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  help but ask myself what are the educational  results\r\n\r\nthat we have attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have this random survey conducted by Dr Chan\r\n\r\nHan  Ying  of  NUS  which revealed that  one-quarter  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  students did not wish to be Chinese  in  their  next\r\n\r\nlife.   On  the  other hand, the vast majority of  Malay  and\r\n\r\nIndian  students  wished  to remain  as  Malays  and  Indians\r\n\r\nrespectively in their next life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been implementing the unified education\r\n\r\nsystem  and   bilingual education for many  years.   All  the\r\n\r\nstudents from the various ethnic groups are educated  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  educational  system. How is it that there  is  a  great\r\n\r\ndifference in their basic sense of belonging for their ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups? Some commentators felt that this was a result of  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of western culture on Singapore and some people  were\r\n\r\nsaying  that  this  was an inevitable result  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nglobalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the ethnic groups in Singapore are\r\n\r\nsubjected   to  the  same  western  culture  and   the   same\r\n\r\nglobalisation.   How is it that the survey reveals  that  the\r\n\r\ninclination of the Chinese students is so different from that\r\n\r\nof the students from the other ethnic groups?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 30 years of nation building, all the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government have been such that the  emphasis\r\n\r\nis  on  the  use  of  English as the main  stream.  This  has\r\n\r\naffected  the Chinese community most. Apart from the language\r\n\r\nand the family traditions, there is no effective method under\r\n\r\nthe  Government's policy to nourish their sense of  belonging\r\n\r\nto  their  own ethnic group.  Unlike in the Malay  community,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Malays  go  to the mosque and attend  the  various\r\n\r\nactivities  connected therewith, their sense of belonging  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own ethnic group is strengthened, and the use of their\r\n\r\nlanguage  enhanced.   On  the  other  hand,  apart  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   Speak  Mandarin  Campaign  and  some   related\r\n\r\nactivities,  there  is  nothing  very  much  in  our   social\r\n\r\nframework  to  make  the ethnic Chinese in Singapore  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir sense of belonging to their community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with the education system turning to use English as\r\n\r\nthe   main   medium  of  instruction,  learning  of   English\r\n\r\nliterature made compulsory in the secondary schools, and some\r\n\r\nschools offering  European history rather than Asian history,\r\n\r\nmany   Chinese students have very limited knowledge of  their\r\n\r\nown  history and their own literature.  No wonder they do not\r\n\r\nhave a sense of belonging to their own racial group. I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether the aims of our education system  is such  that\r\n\r\nwe  want  to blur the students' sense of belonging for  their\r\n\r\nown ethnic group in order to enhance their sense of belonging\r\n\r\nto Singapore as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second incident was this report on 2nd March in the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  that  one top student  from  a  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschool  was  originally from a well-known  school.   However,\r\n\r\nduring  his  younger days, he committed a number of  offences\r\n\r\nand  had criminal convictions. As a result,  many schools did\r\n\r\nnot  want to take him. Fortunately, this neighbourhood school\r\n\r\nadmitted  him  and gave him a second chance.  He  seized  the\r\n\r\nopportunity, turned over a new leaf, and scored many 'As'  in\r\n\r\nhis  'O'  level examinations.  While we are talking  about  a\r\n\r\nholistic  approach  to  attain our educational  ideals,  some\r\n\r\nschools  are using this unilateral policy. Some schools  want\r\n\r\nto  attain  high  ranking, and they are only  concerned  with\r\n\r\nstudents  scoring   good results for  them  to  attain  their\r\n\r\ntarget.  To them, it is better that those students who do not\r\n\r\nbehave  well  do not come as they may ruin the reputation  of\r\n\r\nthe  school.  If the mindset of the school administrators  is\r\n\r\nsuch  that  they are  so eager for quick results and  instant\r\n\r\nbenefits, then how can we expect them to educate our students\r\n\r\nin  a  holistic educational approach in order to  attain  the\r\n\r\ndesired outcomes of our education policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, our drive to\r\n\r\ndevelop   a   nation  of  entrepreneurs  with  the   required\r\n\r\ncreativity  to  invent  and innovate  and  to  inculcate  the\r\n\r\nconcept of life-long learning further reinforces the need for\r\n\r\nus to re-look at our current system of education which served\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposes  of the nation in the past and, which in my opinion,\r\n\r\nrequires  changes  in  a number of areas  if  we  are  really\r\n\r\nserious  about  achieving  these goals  of  developing  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean to his or her full potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that one of the key considerations of the\r\n\r\neducation  system that we have in place today is  to  achieve\r\n\r\nefficiency  in the delivery of education and hence,  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen   doing   things   like  streaming,  teacher   postings,\r\n\r\nassessment, measurement of school performances and other like\r\n\r\nthings. While from the point of view of the system and  those\r\n\r\nmanaging the system, this looks very good and the outcomes of\r\n\r\nwhich  are easily measurable, the negative impact is that  we\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  nation of people who fit into just one  model  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a nation of entrepreneurs capable of\r\n\r\nparticipating in the knowledge economy, and I am  not  saying\r\n\r\nthat  every Singaporean needs to be an entrepreneur,  but  if\r\n\r\nyou want to get a few of them, then we really need to set our\r\n\r\nsights into something very high.  At least some of them  will\r\n\r\nmake  it.  We need to ensure that our people will  always  be\r\n\r\nable  to  adapt to changes by constantly learning new skills,\r\n\r\nand  it  is time that we took a serious look at how we should\r\n\r\nmodify  our  education system.  Because  the  impact  of  the\r\n\r\neducation  system will only be felt 10 to 15 years  from  the\r\n\r\ntime  it starts, in my opinion, the issue has also become  an\r\n\r\nurgent one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is whether we are looking at\r\n\r\nthe  right models of education from around the world  and  to\r\n\r\nadapt  the  best practices to suit Singapore. In my  opinion,\r\n\r\nour system basically trains our children for one-career model\r\n\r\nof  life, very much like the traditional Chinese and Japanese\r\n\r\nsystems  which placed scholars among the top rung of society.\r\n\r\nAs BG George Yeo recently put it in one of his speeches, such\r\n\r\na  system actually prevented the Chinese from exploiting  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of trade and new technology and, therefore, they are\r\n\r\nlosing out in this competition to western countries.   In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, we really need to look at some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwestern  models in order to achieve the new outcomes  of  our\r\n\r\neducation system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without doubt, the Americans were the leaders for\r\n\r\ninnovation, technology and economic development in  the  past\r\n\r\ncentury,  better  than any other nations  around  the  world.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  they will have an excellent chance to remain  the\r\n\r\nleaders  in this century.  I therefore feel that it is  about\r\n\r\ntime  we learned from the Americans and other western  models\r\n\r\nof  education, not to copy them wholesale, but  to  pick  the\r\n\r\nbest  practices  among them and develop  our  own  model  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I really feel that we can learn a lot from  their\r\n\r\nsystems,  which may not be the most efficient in  the  world,\r\n\r\nbut do produce the results. So, what good does it do to score\r\n\r\nthe   highest   marks   in  the   Science   and   Mathematics\r\n\r\ncompetitions around the world when the desired outcomes of an\r\n\r\neducation system cannot be achieved? So I suggest that we  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to give up some amount of efficiency in our  system\r\n\r\nto achieve the end results for the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that we should re-look at the practice of\r\n\r\nearly  streaming of our children. This has been my pet  topic\r\n\r\nfor some time. The system basically divides our children into\r\n\r\ncategories and put the people of the same capabilities in the\r\n\r\nsame  place and segregate people of differing talents.   This\r\n\r\nis  once  again good for efficiency, but bad in that it  does\r\n\r\nnot  allow our children to benefit from learning from  people\r\n\r\nof  differing talents. I strongly believe in the strength  of\r\n\r\ndiversity  that  if they can learn from people  of  different\r\n\r\ntalents or different abilities, they probably would turn  out\r\n\r\nto  be better students or adults in the future.  Our children\r\n\r\nare  missing out on the important opportunity to  learn  from\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us in this House, including the Minister,\r\n\r\ncame  through  an  education  system  that  mixed  people  of\r\n\r\ndiffering  abilities together for many years  of  our  school\r\n\r\nsystem.  I  am  sure that you must agree  with  me  that  the\r\n\r\noutcome  has  not been a bad one, where all of us  have  been\r\n\r\nable  to compete effectively with the world's best countries.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether there is any other education system in the world that\r\n\r\npractises streaming in the way that we do here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are serious about the concept of life-long\r\n\r\nlearning,  then our current methods of measuring success  and\r\n\r\nfailure need to drastically change.  It is more important  to\r\n\r\nensure that a student has learned the ability to learn in the\r\n\r\nfuture  than  to learn to score well in examinations  and  in\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  achieving academic excellence which we very  much\r\n\r\nwant our children to achieve today. Learning to score well in\r\n\r\nexaminations is not going to inculcate the value of life-long\r\n\r\nlearning,  so  we  really need to develop other  measures  of\r\n\r\nsuccess in our education system.  Similarly, the measures  of\r\n\r\ncreativity and EQ deserve more emphasis as we move ahead  and\r\n\r\nECA,   project  work  and  life  experiences  should  feature\r\n\r\nstrongly in our new measures of success. To be successful  in\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century,  we  need to  develop  a  more  adaptable\r\n\r\nsociety, able to pick up new capabilities and skills all  the\r\n\r\ntime, and not just once in their lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am curious to know how the concept of\r\n\r\nmass  customisation of our education system is working.   The\r\n\r\nMinister announced this some time last year.  The question  I\r\n\r\nhave  is:   is  it really possible to implement  the  system?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Minister can share with Members of this House how\r\n\r\nthis system can be practically implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I would like to follow up on my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh's theme  to  explore  further\r\n\r\nafield  for  best practices in education.  With the  numerous\r\n\r\ndevelopments  on  the education front as well  as  the  fast-changing economy that we are trying to cater to, I would like\r\n\r\nto discuss the role of the private sector in education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the private sector plays an active role in\r\n\r\nboth the pre-school and university segments.  There is a wide\r\n\r\nvariety  of  choices on both fronts and within the  desirable\r\n\r\nframework; families\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  decide the type of services they want for the  children.\r\n\r\nHowever,   the  private  sector,  by  and  large,  does   not\r\n\r\nparticipate in the provision of primary, secondary  and  pre-university education for Singaporeans.  Recently, the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, Dr Tony Tan, mentioned possible  alternative\r\n\r\nroutes    to    university,   including   the   International\r\n\r\nBaccalaureate (IB). Pending a complete review to  see  if  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  offered  by schools across  the  board,  can  the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector  meet  such  demand  in  the   interim,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, where students are unable to cope in the  current\r\n\r\nschool  system,  rather than to lose them, and  possibly  the\r\n\r\nparents  as  well, abroad?  This could well  provide  a  much\r\n\r\nappreciated alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am going to\r\n\r\nstart  by  begging your forbearance, because I  am  about  to\r\n\r\nbring up two old subjects and, being new in the House, I have\r\n\r\nthe advantage of not having heard the debates before.  I will\r\n\r\ntry however not to be too lengthy about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the single biggest stresser for Singaporean\r\n\r\nfamilies  is  worry  over  their children's  education.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education has, in recent years, introduced  many\r\n\r\nadmirable  new  initiatives.  These  include  measures  which\r\n\r\naddress  factors that contribute to the pressure on students,\r\n\r\nsuch  as curriculum review with a view to decrease curriculum\r\n\r\nload  and the review of university admission criteria to  de-emphasise reliance on 'O' and 'A' level results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you talk to senior officers in MOE, they are\r\n\r\nenthused,  convinced  and sincere about these  good  efforts.\r\n\r\nWhen  we talk to parents and teachers on the ground, however,\r\n\r\nwe might be excused if we were to think that they were living\r\n\r\nin  a different world.  The pressure continues unabated.  Why\r\n\r\nthis  incongruence?  Because for all the good intentions  and\r\n\r\nsincere  efforts, certain fundamental issues  have  not  been\r\n\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are anxious for their children on two counts.\r\n\r\nFirstly, they worry about their children being able to access\r\n\r\ntertiary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  and  hence,  subsequently,  earn  a  good  living.\r\n\r\nSecondly, they worry about their children being labelled from\r\n\r\nan  early age as slow, stigmatised, socialised differently in\r\n\r\nthe system and written off as no- hopers.  As the changes  to\r\n\r\nthe  admission  criteria start making  their  impact  to  the\r\n\r\nsystem, the first pressure point should ease.  However,  this\r\n\r\ntakes  time  to happen.  But the anxiety with regard  to  the\r\n\r\nearly  labelling  of  children will persist  so  long  as  we\r\n\r\ncontinue with our policy of streaming children as young as at\r\n\r\nprimary  four.  The second pressure point remains as real  as\r\n\r\never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, curriculum review notwithstanding, so\r\n\r\nlong  as ranking of schools remains, principals will continue\r\n\r\nto  strive  to push their schools up the academic ladder  and\r\n\r\napply  pressure  on teachers who will, in turn,  continue  to\r\n\r\npush  their  students.   Even the  additional  refinement  of\r\n\r\nmeasuring  schools with most value added for their  students,\r\n\r\nthey still  measure this value added in academic performance.\r\n\r\nNo  amount of exhortations that it is not necessary  to  push\r\n\r\nstudents  to  complete 110% of the curriculum  by  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter  of  the year, so that the next two quarters  can  be\r\n\r\nspent  on  revision and drills, and no amount  of  assurances\r\n\r\nthat  other achievements also count, will have any effect  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  the  Ministry continues to rank  schools  on  their\r\n\r\nacademic results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals and teachers will continue to be convinced\r\n\r\nthat  their assessment, progress and promotions are  tied  to\r\n\r\nthe  academic results of their pupils and institutions.   The\r\n\r\npressure  will  not  let  up.  I am not  at  all  denying  or\r\n\r\ndismissing  all  the benefits and advantages of  ranking  and\r\n\r\nstreaming.  There were obviously good reasons why  they  were\r\n\r\nintroduced in the first place.  But as in any policies, there\r\n\r\nare always two sides to the balance.  It is a matter of which\r\n\r\nside  of  the  balance sits heavier.  And as time progresses,\r\n\r\nsometimes  the balance shifts.  For ranking, on one  side  is\r\n\r\nthe  ability to benchmark and assess the schools, and provide\r\n\r\nparents  with  information on how the schools rate.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  side is the unhealthy competition that this engenders,\r\n\r\nand the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresulting  pressures that go right through the  system.   The\r\n\r\nquestion is truly: what would we lose if we were to drop  the\r\n\r\nsystem of ranking schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For streaming, on one side is the purported ability to\r\n\r\nidentify children who would otherwise not be able to cope, to\r\n\r\nhelp them with the less demanding load.  On the other side is\r\n\r\nthe  labelling of the children at an early age with  all  the\r\n\r\nattendant  consequences, to their self-esteem,  the  loss  of\r\n\r\nopportunities open to other children not so labelled, and the\r\n\r\nloss  to the system of late developers, and the loss  of  the\r\n\r\ndiversity, which Mr Inderjit Singh has just referred to.  The\r\n\r\nquestion is truly: is there no other way to help along slower\r\n\r\nchildren but to segregate them in this manner?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Minister has received many calls in the past\r\n\r\nto  review the policies of ranking and streaming, but I  will\r\n\r\nventure to ask him to do so again.  I believe it is time, the\r\n\r\nbalance  has tipped, because the pressures are weighing  very\r\n\r\nheavily  on  the other side.  I am sure that many Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Frontbench  would  also agree  if  only  they  were  not\r\n\r\nconstrained by the solidarity required of their positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my plea to the Minister is to please pause, throw\r\n\r\nout  previous pre-conceptions and premises, and review  these\r\n\r\ntwo  policies.  Before I end, Sir, I would also like to  take\r\n\r\nthe   opportunity  to  invite  the  press   to   make   their\r\n\r\ncontribution  towards easing off on this undue  adulation  of\r\n\r\nacademic results.  We have just missed an opportunity as this\r\n\r\nyear's 'O' and 'A' results have just been released.  But from\r\n\r\nnext  year,  I  suggest  to them to  propose  a  blackout  on\r\n\r\ncoverage  of the top students in the PSLE, 'O' and 'A'  level\r\n\r\nexaminations.   All they are going to disappoint  are  a  few\r\n\r\nproud  parents,  but  it would be their contribution  in  the\r\n\r\ncause of promoting a saner society less preoccupied with  the\r\n\r\npaper chase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the desired\r\n\r\noutcomes  of  education is to have the  young  generation  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  be  prepared as knowledge  workers  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  The Ministry launched the IT Masterplan to equip our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoung with skills for the knowledge-based economy.  IT skills\r\n\r\nare  tools  that  should help our students learn  better  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  the ability to apply what they have learnt.   To  be\r\n\r\nable  to  teach  students  these skills,  obviously  we  need\r\n\r\nteachers  who  are knowledgeable in the use of computers  and\r\n\r\nhave  IT  skills.  We know that the Ministry has  a  plan  to\r\n\r\ntrain  teachers  in the use of the computer  and  IT  skills.\r\n\r\nWhat  has  been the progress in this area?  Have  there  been\r\n\r\nproblems in training the older teachers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the IT Masterplan of the Ministry because\r\n\r\nit allows our students to learn skills that they must have to\r\n\r\noperate  in  the  KBE  era,  irrespective  of  whether  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  own computers at home or not.  The plan allows  our\r\n\r\nstudents  to level up together.  But to ensure that  students\r\n\r\nwho  do not have computers at home have equal chance to learn\r\n\r\nand  practise  IT  skills, we must have enough  computers  in\r\n\r\nschools for them to use and practise.  The long-term plan  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is to equip every two students with a computer.\r\n\r\nAre  we anywhere near the target?  Do all schools, especially\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools, have equal opportunities to  teach  IT\r\n\r\nskills to their students?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers too will be supplied with notebook computers at\r\n\r\na ratio of one computer for every two teachers.  Can teachers\r\n\r\nreally share computers when they have to prepare lessons  and\r\n\r\nreports  using the MOE-supplied laptops?  Sir, I  would  like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to give us an update on the IT Masterplan  for\r\n\r\nschools which has been implemented for the past two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, on this cut, I would like to\r\n\r\naddress  two  topics,  namely,  single  session  schools  and\r\n\r\nprimary one priority allocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a major step was taken on 2nd January this year by\r\n\r\nMOE  when all remaining double session secondary schools were\r\n\r\nconverted  to  single session schools.  It is  a  significant\r\n\r\nconversion  that  took  place  quietly  without  causing  any\r\n\r\ndisruptions.  Conceptually, a conversion of this scale  would\r\n\r\nrequire  having twice as many schools this year  compared  to\r\n\r\nlast\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear.   That the schools were able to do so in a clean  sweep\r\n\r\npoint  to  the tremendous amount of planning and effort  that\r\n\r\nhave gone behind the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the school children have greater access to\r\n\r\nthe school facilities, I would urge the teachers and students\r\n\r\nto make full use of the facilities.  We should avoid carrying\r\n\r\non business as usual.  We should aim to make attending school\r\n\r\na more enriching experience for them.  Furthermore, we should\r\n\r\naim,  through  core curriculum activities, to  create  common\r\n\r\neducational experience that will imprint the Singapore  value\r\n\r\non these students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry is monitoring how schools are adapting to the single\r\n\r\nsession  schools  and  whether  he  is  satisfied  with   the\r\n\r\nsituation.   I understand that there is some resistance  from\r\n\r\nsome  parents  regarding single session school, because  they\r\n\r\nhave  grown used to half day schools.  Many had made  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  half  days  to  send their children to other  enrichment\r\n\r\nprogrammes and part-time religious education programmes  such\r\n\r\nas  part-time madrasahs.  For these students, single  session\r\n\r\nschools actually take away their half days that they used  to\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this point, I think it is useful to point out\r\n\r\nthat  half  day  schools are actually not the  norm  in  most\r\n\r\ncountries.  In fact, half day schools in Singapore are  left-overs  from  the  time  when the nation experienced  a  rapid\r\n\r\npopulation growth in its early days of nationhood.  Now  that\r\n\r\nwe are back to the norm, it is up to the parents and teachers\r\n\r\nto fully exploit the opportunity to benefit our students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the allocation of primary one places, the recent\r\n\r\ncase  of Michael Ong who wrote to the Minister regarding  his\r\n\r\nlong  school  day  struck  a chord with  many  people.   Many\r\n\r\nquestions were asked. Why should pupils spend so much time on\r\n\r\ncommuting, for instance?  Should not the pupils in general be\r\n\r\nallocated  schools closer to their homes?  In  Michael  Ong's\r\n\r\ncase, his father actually has clarified their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition.   Nevertheless,  his case  highlighted  the  unique\r\n\r\nprimary  one  allocation  scheme in  Singapore.   Under  this\r\n\r\nscheme,  parents  sometimes would go to the  extreme  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  children enrolled into their choice schools.  I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister will review the scheme to see whether it\r\n\r\nis  still  relevant  or  whether it could  still  be  further\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nhas  initiated  a  change  in the  direction  of  the  school\r\n\r\ncurriculum towards a more open and creative path.  The change\r\n\r\nproves  to  be  most  timely in view of the  demand  on  more\r\n\r\ncreative  line  in  the IT age.  The emphasis  on  creativity\r\n\r\nwould enable us to prepare our younger generation to face the\r\n\r\nnew  challenge of the demand posted by the rapid  development\r\n\r\nin  the Internet and IT.   The policy is already in place for\r\n\r\na  few  years.   I would like to know from the  Minister  the\r\n\r\nprogress made so far and whether there is a need to implement\r\n\r\nmore  changes in view of the fast pace of changes.   I  would\r\n\r\nalso like to know how the schools as well as the students and\r\n\r\nthe  teachers are responding to the change.  I have  received\r\n\r\nfeedback  both  from teachers and parents that  although  the\r\n\r\npolicy  is  in place, the implementation is hampered  by  the\r\n\r\nfact that the rigid system of recognising  the achievement of\r\n\r\nthe  students based purely on the academic performance  still\r\n\r\nremains.   The  entrance  to schools,  junior  colleges,  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics or even the universities is still based strictly\r\n\r\non the grades achieved.  One point short of what is required,\r\n\r\nhe is out.  For many, their career is over.  No consideration\r\n\r\nis  given  to  ECA  performance.  It  is  not  important  how\r\n\r\ncommitted the student has been or how good leadership he  has\r\n\r\nshown.    Therefore,  some  of the parents  have  told  their\r\n\r\nchildren  not to be too active in taking part in  many  ECAs,\r\n\r\nbut to concentrate more on their study as taking part in more\r\n\r\nECAs may affect their academic results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranking of schools also led to some principals to\r\n\r\ndemand  that  their  students  obtain  the  highest  academic\r\n\r\nresults at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts  in  order  to make the school look  good.

It  is more about  nurturing  the  self,\r\n\r\nconnecting   the   self  with  community,  about   developing\r\n\r\nemotional intelligence and multiple intelligences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ages of 13-16 are the most restless, rebellious\r\n\r\nand  uncertain.  Students in this age cohort do not need more\r\n\r\nstructures and conformity in their learning experience.  They\r\n\r\nneed  diversity, creativity and application of their  talents\r\n\r\nand interactive relationship to enjoy the learning process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These suggestions are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Regularise internship programmes in secondary\r\n\r\nschools.   Students are getting bored with simply staying  in\r\n\r\nschools.   They  are restless and want to get connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  reality  of  work.  Can we encourage  a  tie-up  between\r\n\r\nschools  and private as well as public sectors which  provide\r\n\r\ninternship programmes for secondary 3 and 4 students so  that\r\n\r\nthey learn the values of work, leadership and organisation of\r\n\r\nmanagement  by  shadowing  a  manager  and  observing   board\r\n\r\nmeetings,  etc.   We  could credit the hours  spent  with  an\r\n\r\norganisation as part of character development component or as\r\n\r\nan   extra-curricular  credit.   I  had  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexperiment this with Raffles Girls Secondary School and  with\r\n\r\nNanyang   Girls  School.   It  had  proven  to  be   mutually\r\n\r\nsatisfying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Develop mentoring programmes. Students love to hear\r\n\r\nstories and old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  love  to tell them.  Could we encourage old  persons,\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily teachers, to speak to students or work  with\r\n\r\nthem on specific programmes?  Story-telling as an art form is\r\n\r\na  new  teaching method that should be encouraged and  it  is\r\n\r\nbest done by an interesting and educated elderly person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Writing neighbourhood stories. As part of nation-building programmes, students should be encouraged to write\r\n\r\nstories  about  their homes and neighbourhood, including  the\r\n\r\nCDCs  and other social institutions within the vicinity  that\r\n\r\nthey  live in.  This exercise offers enriching essay  writing\r\n\r\nmaterials and it helps to plug our students to the real  life\r\n\r\nof Singapore.  The Joo Chiat story published by Joo Chiat CCC\r\n\r\nwas a case in point.  If students were invited to participate\r\n\r\nin  the  project,  I  am sure they would  have  enjoyed  that\r\n\r\nthoroughly  and  it would be a good bonding  process  between\r\n\r\nstudents and their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Student mix in overseas field trips. I have read a\r\n\r\nnumber of reports by students who have been abroad with their\r\n\r\nschools to do community work. The experiences that they  have\r\n\r\naccumulated  were  invaluable and I hope  the  Ministry  will\r\n\r\nexpand  the  subsidies  to include  more  students  from  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools to go on such trips.  It would probably\r\n\r\nbe  a good experiment to mix a SAP school and a neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschool in such a field trip to achieve social integration  at\r\n\r\nsome level among students from different backgrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Community service. I have asked for more community\r\n\r\nservice  for  students  in other sittings.  So  I  shall  not\r\n\r\nbelabour  the  point here.  I hope the Ministry  will  review\r\n\r\nthis  in  a  concerted  manner with the National  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial Service and neighbourhood community agencies to render\r\n\r\nthe  experience a fruitful community bonding process so  that\r\n\r\nstudents  will experience the growth of a community  and  how\r\n\r\nthey can contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the implementation of the revised criteria into\r\n\r\nNUS  and  NTU will shift the emphasis from a purely  academic\r\n\r\ncriteria to one which encourages total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the individual.  This direction, I hope,  will\r\n\r\nmoderate  the  school  of thought that  believes  in  getting\r\n\r\ndistinctions as the \"be all and end all\" of all students.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Government's  continued  emphasis  on  merit   and\r\n\r\nscholarships will be looked into.  While we want  to  nurture\r\n\r\nthe  creme de la creme of the nation, this should not be over\r\n\r\nemphasised  at  the  expense of the  majority  who  are  non-scholars.  I  am  glad  to hear that  MOE  was  looking  into\r\n\r\ndeveloping niche areas like sports as a desirable outcome  in\r\n\r\nstudent development.  By broadening the school curriculum  to\r\n\r\ninclude interesting bits that are non-academic in nature,  we\r\n\r\nreap  the  benefit  of  discovering  and  strengthening   the\r\n\r\ndiversity of talents in our student population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir,  for allowing me to come into the debate  at  this\r\n\r\npoint  in time.  There are many cuts and I think I will  take\r\n\r\nthe  cuts  as  they come along so that we can have  a  better\r\n\r\nexchange.   First of all, I would like to thank  Members  for\r\n\r\ntheir comments and suggestions.    As usual, there is quite a\r\n\r\ndiversity of views, not all of them are consistent with  each\r\n\r\nother.   If I implemented all of them, we will have quite  an\r\n\r\nargument over whose view would prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past two weeks, there has been extensive\r\n\r\ndebate  in the House on how Singapore can continue to  thrive\r\n\r\nin the \"new\" economy.  Education has been cited as one of the\r\n\r\nfactors critical to Singapore's success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Dr Tan Boon Wan, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and\r\n\r\nMr  Davinder Singh and others have asked how the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  (MOE)  is  going  to  help  our  young  meet   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the  new  economy.   Have  we  changed  the\r\n\r\neducation system?  Is our education system suitable or not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me say that our education system is a\r\n\r\nremarkably  strong  one.  It is a strong  one  for  our  good\r\n\r\nstudents.   It  is also a strong one for our  weak  students.\r\n\r\nSome Members have asked whether we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlooked  at the systems in other parts of the world,  and  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is  yes.   One of the things that I have  consciously\r\n\r\ndone,  and  which  I  have encouraged  the  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to do, is to go and look at what others are  doing.\r\n\r\nI  would  say  that  after  looking,  I  still  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that our education is one of the strongest in  the\r\n\r\nworld, catering to the weak students as well as to the strong\r\n\r\nstudents.   While we may criticise our education system  and,\r\n\r\nvery often, we are our own harshest critics, and it is as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be,  we  should remember that it  is  a  system  that\r\n\r\nsubstantially  works  very  well  and  that  when   we   make\r\n\r\nadaptations to it, it is to strengthen the system and to make\r\n\r\nit  better, and not to dismantle the whole system  and  throw\r\n\r\naway parts of it which really are working very well and which\r\n\r\nmany  other countries are coming to Singapore to have a  look\r\n\r\nat.   When  I  visit  other countries  I  ask  them  as  many\r\n\r\nquestions  as  they ask me.  So bear that  in  mind  when  we\r\n\r\ndiscuss our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\ntaken a hard look at what we are doing. Re-examining and  re-affirming  fundamental beliefs and practices where these  are\r\n\r\nstill  relevant,  and setting in place necessary  changes  to\r\n\r\ntake our education system to the next stage of development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.55 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1998, the Ministry published the Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes  of  Education, which set out the end-objectives  of\r\n\r\nformal education.  These outcomes encapsulate  the skills and\r\n\r\nvalues which are important for our young to have, not just in\r\n\r\nthe  new economy, but also in the new globalised world.   How\r\n\r\ndo  we  keep our people as one, united and cohesive? We  have\r\n\r\nalso introduced measures to bring us closer to achieving  the\r\n\r\nDesired Outcomes.  These include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiating key programmes, such as the IT Masterplan,\r\n\r\nNational Education, and the Community Involvement Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the way that we assess students and appraise\r\n\r\nschools  to  re-orientate the focus of the education  system;\r\n\r\nbasically changing what counts.  Because if we do not  change\r\n\r\nwhat counts, then the behaviour, as many Members have pointed\r\n\r\nout,  will continue to be the same.  But we have to strike  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between what counts. Among the things that  count  I\r\n\r\nthink that it is still important for students to do well.  It\r\n\r\nis  still important for them to do well in examinations.   If\r\n\r\nwe want to be creative, we have to start from some basis.  An\r\n\r\narchitect cannot design a house if he does not understand the\r\n\r\nmechanics  and the basic relationships between  things.   The\r\n\r\nhouse  may  not  stand.  So we have to have the  basics  upon\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can  build so that people do have a platform  from\r\n\r\nwhich  to  lead further forward.  One example  that  we  have\r\n\r\nchanged is  the  new university admission system which  moves\r\n\r\naway  from the current reliance on the `A' level examinations\r\n\r\ntowards  a more well-rounded evaluation of a person's ability\r\n\r\nand  potential.  Other  areas  that  we  have  introduced  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  other areas of achievement are Edusave Awards  for\r\n\r\nSports, the Arts and Community Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I also shared with Members the important\r\n\r\nshift  we  are  making  in  the  education  system,  from  an\r\n\r\nefficiency-driven  system  to  an  ability-driven   paradigm.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  new paradigm, the emphasis will be on developing\r\n\r\nand  harnessing of the talents and abilities of every  child,\r\n\r\nto  the  maximum  extent possible, through a mass  customised\r\n\r\napproach in Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked whether it is really\r\n\r\npossible  to  mass customise education.  To some extent,  our\r\n\r\neducation system is already mass customised.  Since 1980,  we\r\n\r\nhave    ability-based   streaming.    This    has    provided\r\n\r\nopportunities for students of different aptitudes to learn at\r\n\r\na  pace  that  they are comfortable with. I  know  that  many\r\n\r\nMembers  have raised a number of times, Dr Lee for the  first\r\n\r\ntime  for  herself, but many times for the rest of us,  about\r\n\r\nstreaming.   Actually, streaming has provided the opportunity\r\n\r\nfor students of different abilities and aptitudes to progress\r\n\r\nand do well in education where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\notherwise  they  may  have dropped out.  The  statistics  are\r\n\r\nthere to  be seen.  In 1980, before streaming, nearly 24%  of\r\n\r\nthe P1 cohort attained  5 `O' levels or more. With streaming,\r\n\r\nthe proportion attaining at least 5 `O' levels has increased.\r\n\r\nIt  was 59% last year.  So streaming has allowed many more of\r\n\r\nour  students  to benefit from the education  system  whereas\r\n\r\notherwise they might have not.  Because if we have  a  system\r\n\r\nin  which everybody is forced to take four years to take  the\r\n\r\n'O'  level  and  it is the only benchmark, then  many  people\r\n\r\nwould not be able to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our system today, if you can do it in four years, you\r\n\r\ndo  it  in four years.  If you need five years, you do it  in\r\n\r\nfive years.  If 'O' level is not your cup of tea, and you are\r\n\r\nmore  inclined towards something practical and so  on,  there\r\n\r\nare  other programmes that you can take, and you can move  on\r\n\r\nto  post-secondary education and further education, and there\r\n\r\nare cross-over paths.   So the doors are not closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Inderjit Singh is probably looking at the\r\n\r\npast with rose-tinted spectacles.  If I recall, when I was in\r\n\r\nschool,  we  always had people being collected in classes  of\r\n\r\ndifferent abilities.  We have \"A\" class, \"B\" class, \"C\" class\r\n\r\nand  so forth.  I am not sure which school Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nwent to.   But most of us have been to schools where that has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  practice.  Teaching students in  a  mixed  ability\r\n\r\ngroup poses considerable problems because some students would\r\n\r\nbe  bored, some cannot cope and the teachers would  not  know\r\n\r\nwhere  to pitch the lesson.  But outside the class, in  other\r\n\r\nsettings, the students work together, play together  and  mix\r\n\r\ntogether.    I  remember  in  my  school,  we  idolised   the\r\n\r\nsportsmen.   They  may  not have been  the  top  in  academic\r\n\r\nperformance but they were the top in sports. So there  was  a\r\n\r\nmixing and mutual respect among the different students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass customisation of education has also taken place in\r\n\r\nother ways.  We have introduced programmes to cater to groups\r\n\r\nof  students with special abilities or who need more support.\r\n\r\nFor example, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave elective programmes in languages, art and music already.\r\n\r\nWe have the learning support programme for P1 and P2 students\r\n\r\nto  boost their English proficiency level because some of the\r\n\r\nstudents  come  to  P1  and P2 and have difficulty  with  the\r\n\r\nlanguage.  And because of difficulty with the language,  they\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty with the other subjects.  So we have managed\r\n\r\nto  mass  customise for these children so that we  can  boost\r\n\r\ntheir   reading  age  and  the  programme  has   been   quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some Members have pointed out, the Ministry is also\r\n\r\nencouraging  autonomous  schools to develop  niche  areas  to\r\n\r\nnurture the talents and abilities of their students, and  has\r\n\r\nwidened the entry requirements so that those with talent  and\r\n\r\ninterest in these niche areas, but who may not have qualified\r\n\r\nstrictly  on academic results, can still gain admission.   So\r\n\r\nthis is another signal that there are other things which  can\r\n\r\nbe  considered other than pure academic results.  But, do not\r\n\r\nforget, academic results are still important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next several years in Education will focus on the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of strategies and plans to encourage  further\r\n\r\nmass  customisation of education on a wider scale, so  as  to\r\n\r\nbring about ability-driven education in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has asked what are our areas of priorities. I\r\n\r\nwill  focus  on  the four key areas that we are  working  on.\r\n\r\nThey are: hardware and infrastructure; the curriculum; school\r\n\r\nmanagement; and people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, touch briefly on hardware and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  Dr Wang and Mr Hawazi Daipi have asked about\r\n\r\nthe  progress  of the Single Session Programme for  secondary\r\n\r\nschools and the IT Masterplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that with the exception\r\n\r\nof  four  secondary schools whose transition  to  the  single\r\n\r\nsession system is tied to the completion of their new  school\r\n\r\nbuildings, MOE has met\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  target of having all secondary schools go single-session\r\n\r\nby this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the IT Masterplan is also progressing\r\n\r\nas  planned.  It is currently at the half-way mark, and  thus\r\n\r\nfar  has  met  all  its targets, and this has  put  Singapore\r\n\r\nreally at the forefront in the world in terms of readiness of\r\n\r\nour  schools, teachers and students for IT.  I  will  ask  Mr\r\n\r\nPeter Chen to elaborate on the status of these two programmes\r\n\r\na little later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, putting in place the hardware and infrastructure is\r\n\r\nnecessary  but not sufficient.  We also need to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  \"software\"  in our education system is  aligned  to  the\r\n\r\nDesired  Outcomes.  Let me mention two at this  point  -  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum and school management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Desired Outcomes spell out the general attributes\r\n\r\nwhich  our young should possess at the end of each  stage  of\r\n\r\nformal  education.  But these outcomes need to be  translated\r\n\r\ninto  specific  skills and values which the  curriculum  will\r\n\r\ndeliver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has spent some time, over the past year,\r\n\r\nthinking  through  and distilling from the Desired  Outcomes,\r\n\r\nthe set of core skills and values which schools should aim to\r\n\r\ndevelop  in  their  students.   I  would  ask  the  Clerk  of\r\n\r\nParliament  to  please distribute the  handout.   [Copies  of\r\n\r\nhandout distributed to hon. Members.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight core skills and values have been identified. They\r\n\r\nare:  Character  Development; Self-Management Skills;  Social\r\n\r\nand   Cooperative  Skills;  Literacy  and  Numeracy   Skills;\r\n\r\nCommunication    Skills;   Information   Skills;    Knowledge\r\n\r\nApplication Skills; and Thinking Skills and Creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that this is [indicating] supposed to look\r\n\r\nlike  a tree, with the leaves up there, and the stem and  the\r\n\r\nbranches.  So basically what happens is that the core  skills\r\n\r\nare  the ones which are the horizontal bars at the bottom and\r\n\r\nthey are taught, delivered through the curriculum, which  are\r\n\r\nvertical  bars,  and  the tree grows  and  flowers  into  the\r\n\r\nDesired Outcomes of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are being used now as part of the framework for the\r\n\r\nrevision of the various syllabuses which is now ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran, Mr Kenneth Chen, and Mr Davinder Singh have\r\n\r\nall  raised  issues related to how we can  achieve  this,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the progress made by the Ministry in  developing\r\n\r\nthinking  skills  and creativity, and strengthening  National\r\n\r\nEducation in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, thinking skills and creativity. Since last year,\r\n\r\nwe  have  implemented the Thinking Skills  programme  in  all\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools,  and it has worked  well.   Students  now\r\n\r\napply  these thinking skills to the learning of the different\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  the  curriculum.  The  feedback  that  we  have\r\n\r\nreceived  has  been positive - the programme has  helped  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to enhance their ability to think rationally  about\r\n\r\nissues,   to  approach  problems  creatively,  and  to   make\r\n\r\ndecisions confidently based on sound judgement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Thinking Skills programme, the Ministry is\r\n\r\nalso  introducing  Inter-disciplinary  Project  Work  to  all\r\n\r\nschools  over  this year and next year.  And eventually  when\r\n\r\nthe  system has settled down and we are confident of  it,  it\r\n\r\nwill   become  a  requirement  for  entrance  to  university.\r\n\r\nThrough  such  project work, students get to  appreciate  the\r\n\r\ninter-connectedness of disciplines, acquire  useful  problem-solving and communication skills, and learn to work in teams,\r\n\r\nall of which help to develop their creative capacity.  As  Mr\r\n\r\nDavinder  Singh suggests, parents will then do  the  projects\r\n\r\nfor  the students.  There is not much that I can do about it.\r\n\r\nParents can do the homework for their children too.  I  think\r\n\r\nparents  have to allow their children to learn on  their  own\r\n\r\nand to grow and develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, I informed this House that we had made a\r\n\r\ncut in the current syllabuses while a comprehensive review of\r\n\r\nthe  syllabuses for all subjects is carried out.  The revised\r\n\r\nsyllabuses  and  instructional  materials,  which  will  give\r\n\r\ngreater  emphasis to the development of critical and creative\r\n\r\nthinking  skills, and these core skills and  values  will  be\r\n\r\nrolled out from next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to National Education. This programme\r\n\r\nwas  implemented  in schools since 1997.  Within  the  formal\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  National Education is incorporated  into  Social\r\n\r\nStudies,  History, Geography and a few other subjects.   This\r\n\r\nis  reinforced  by  the many programmes and activities  which\r\n\r\nstudents  take part in.  Our students now commemorate  events\r\n\r\nlike  Racial  Harmony Day and International  Friendship  Day.\r\n\r\nThey   also  participate  in  activities,  such  as  Learning\r\n\r\nJourneys, where they visit key national institutions such  as\r\n\r\nsewerage treatment plants and refuse disposal plants.   These\r\n\r\nare  all very instructive when you go and visit these plants,\r\n\r\nand you get to learn what are the constraints of living in  a\r\n\r\ncity  and  how and why the streets are clean and the  air  is\r\n\r\nfresh,  and  we  have  quite a healthy city.   Through  these\r\n\r\nactivities,  they  learn  about  respect  and  tolerance  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of different race and religion, and  acquire  a\r\n\r\ndeeper  understanding  and appreciation  of  the  challenges,\r\n\r\nconstraints and vulnerabilities facing Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of National Education, our students also take\r\n\r\npart  in  the  Community  Involvement Programme,  where  they\r\n\r\nundertake  projects to serve the community.   We  can  debate\r\n\r\nabout  whether the number of hours is enough and so on.   But\r\n\r\nthat  is a question of degree.  Last year, more than  400  of\r\n\r\nour  JC  and  CI students participated in community  projects\r\n\r\noutside of Singapore, in regional countries such as Malaysia,\r\n\r\nThailand,  Myanmar,  Vietnam  and  Nepal.   This   was   very\r\n\r\nsuccessful and we are working together with other agencies to\r\n\r\nsee how we can expand this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Education programme has contributed greatly\r\n\r\nto a stronger social conscience and our students have come to\r\n\r\nvalue  and  appreciate the good life they enjoy in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand not to take things for granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the National Education programme, many of the\r\n\r\ncore  skills and values are best learned not in the classroom\r\n\r\nbut  through activities outside the classroom.  Someone might\r\n\r\ndevelop another Fosbury flop.  You never know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE's recent move to re-name \"Extra-Curricular\r\n\r\nActivities\" as Co-Curricular Activities is to send  a  strong\r\n\r\nsignal  to  our  principals,  teachers,  students  and  their\r\n\r\nparents  that such activities are no longer \"extra\", but  are\r\n\r\nan integral part of the curriculum and the development of the\r\n\r\nstudents and the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also reinforced this emphasis on Co-Curricular\r\n\r\nActivities   through   other   initiatives,   such   as   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of Sustained Achievement Awards for schools, and\r\n\r\na  new  category of Edusave awards, I mentioned earlier,  for\r\n\r\nsports, arts and community service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community too can play its part in promoting\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  co-curricular  activities  -  I  think   a\r\n\r\nsuggestion raised by Mdm Claire Chiang, she said only six,  I\r\n\r\nwish  she  had more.   The schools, I am sure, if  they  find\r\n\r\nthem interesting and useful, will take them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we can put in place key programmes like Thinking\r\n\r\nSkills and National Education, and delineate core skills  and\r\n\r\nvalues  which  the curriculum should deliver,  and  encourage\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  areas which help  to  develop  these  core\r\n\r\nskills and values, there is no set formula for achieving  the\r\n\r\nDesired Outcomes.  Every child is different.  Each school has\r\n\r\nto decide how best to meet the needs of its students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that curriculum time and resources are limited, it\r\n\r\nis  important for school leadership to recognise that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible  for them and their teachers to  do  everything\r\n\r\nthat  might  be  beneficial to students -  even  with  single\r\n\r\nsession schools.  With single session schools, the temptation\r\n\r\nto  do ever more and more in the schools is very, very great.\r\n\r\nBut trying to do too much within the school curriculum and in\r\n\r\nthe schools can be counter-productive.  Students and teachers\r\n\r\nwill  be  overburdened.  They need some space and some  time.\r\n\r\nSo schools need to prioritise to ensure that the workload for\r\n\r\nstudents and teachers remains manageable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help schools do so, the Ministry is working out\r\n\r\nguidelines on how the different subjects and activities which\r\n\r\nmake  up  the  curriculum today contribute to developing  the\r\n\r\neight  core skills and values.  The guidelines will  be  made\r\n\r\nknown to schools later this year.  And this helps the schools\r\n\r\nto  manage  their  time  and allocate  their  resources  more\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move now to school management. We are unlikely to\r\n\r\nproduce  creative students unless we have innovative schools.\r\n\r\nSo  the  processes have to change.  I agree with the  Members\r\n\r\nwho  have spoken on the subject.  It is important to have the\r\n\r\nright systems and policies in place in managing the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry recognises that mass customisation requires\r\n\r\na  judicious  mix  of  national policies  as  well  as  local\r\n\r\nadaptations  and  initiatives.   For  example,  we  have   an\r\n\r\nEducation  Innovation Fund which was started at  the  end  of\r\n\r\n1998.   There are 20-over projects running. Schools can apply\r\n\r\nfor  it,  and  they can try things.  There are  also  Cluster\r\n\r\nFunds.   Schools can draw on these resources and try  things,\r\n\r\nand  we  encourage  them.  Schools know the  needs  of  their\r\n\r\nstudents better and also what their teachers are capable  of.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to steadily give schools more autonomy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the School Cluster scheme will be rolled out to\r\n\r\nanother  82  schools this year.  They add to the 168  schools\r\n\r\nwhich  are  already grouped in 20 clusters.   The  scheme,  I\r\n\r\nthink, has been well-received by the schools, and it will  be\r\n\r\neventually  extended to all schools.  When that is  finished,\r\n\r\nthere will be about 40 clusters altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MOE will double the number of autonomous schools\r\n\r\nfrom   the  current  number  of  18,  in  the  coming  years.\r\n\r\nAutonomous schools will be given greater flexibility in their\r\n\r\nstudent   intake  to  help  them  develop  into  schools   of\r\n\r\ndistinction  in selected niche areas.  By doing so,  we  hope\r\n\r\nthat they will spark new ideas and help uplift the quality of\r\n\r\nthe entire school system; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we are also reviewing how the Ministry HQ can be\r\n\r\nbetter organised to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport schools.  We are not quite prepared yet to allow more\r\n\r\nprivate  sector involvement in the primary and the  secondary\r\n\r\nschool sectors, although we have independent schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we give schools more autonomy, we need to ensure that\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts  are  directed towards achieving  the  Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help schools focus on the Desired Outcomes and to\r\n\r\nreflect on what they are doing, the Ministry has adopted  the\r\n\r\nSchool Excellence Model for all schools this year.  The Model\r\n\r\nbroadens  the  scope  of the way schools  are  appraised,  by\r\n\r\nmoving beyond academic grades to school achievements in other\r\n\r\nareas which contribute to the Desired Outcomes.  Emphasis  is\r\n\r\ngiven  not  only  to  results but the  processes  applied  to\r\n\r\nachieving the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there has been extended discussion on ranking.\r\n\r\nWe  are not the only people to do ranking.  We did not invent\r\n\r\nthis  idea.   In  fact, ranking was going on  in  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries already before we started.  In fact, our ranking is\r\n\r\na  very  mild ranking system.  We do not rank primary schools\r\n\r\nat  all.  Some countries do.  We only rank the top 40  or  50\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, not all 160 or 170 of them.  So  it  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  mild form of ranking by comparison with the ranking  in\r\n\r\nother places.  In many  states in the United States, they are\r\n\r\nadopting  ranking with a vengeance.  They rank  schools  from\r\n\r\nthe  top to the bottom, every single one of them.  In the  US\r\n\r\nand  the UK, the avowed aim of ranking in some places  is  to\r\n\r\nname  and shame, so that schools will buck up and get on with\r\n\r\nthe work that they are supposed to be doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our ranking system is a very, very mild one, and it\r\n\r\nserves  a  very useful purpose.  You will want to  know,  and\r\n\r\nparents  want  to  know if there are two schools  which  have\r\n\r\nroughly  the same resources, the same students at entry,  and\r\n\r\nthey produce quite different results.  Any sensible system of\r\n\r\nmanagement must know that such differences have occurred\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  it  will  want  to know why and find out  so  that  best\r\n\r\npractices can be transferred from one school to another.   If\r\n\r\nwe  do  not have a system for measuring such things, it  will\r\n\r\nall be hit and miss.  There will be no method of knowing what\r\n\r\nhappens.  And in any case, it is a fiction to believe that if\r\n\r\nwe do not rank schools, people do not know.  Everybody knows.\r\n\r\nBefore  we ranked schools, people knew which schools were  at\r\n\r\nthe  top  and  which schools were not at the top.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nfiction  to believe that if the newspapers stop reporting  on\r\n\r\nwho  the top student is, nobody will know who the top student\r\n\r\nis.  These are things which parents legitimately want to know\r\n\r\nand  we  should  help  them  to know  and  provide  them  the\r\n\r\ninformation rather than hiding the information from  them  in\r\n\r\nthe  belief that if we did so, they would not know and nobody\r\n\r\nwould know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Ong Ah Heng for his comments on\r\n\r\nthe  School Excellence Model.  I agree with him that it  will\r\n\r\ntake  time  to  change  the  culture  in  schools,  and   the\r\n\r\nperception  of  teachers  and  parents.   Feedback  from  the\r\n\r\nschools which participated in the field-testing of the School\r\n\r\nExcellence Model has generally been positive.  There  are  of\r\n\r\ncourse  one  or two little things which have to be  resolved.\r\n\r\nThe  schools  have found the Model to be a  useful  tool  for\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  self-appraisal of how well they are  achieving\r\n\r\nthe  Desired Outcomes, and they have also found it useful  in\r\n\r\nintegrating and prioritizing the different initiatives in the\r\n\r\nschool.    It has helped them to re-orientate the outlook  of\r\n\r\ntheir  teachers, to view education provided by the  different\r\n\r\ndepartments  in  the  school in a more  holistic  and  inter-connected way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the measures mentioned earlier to give schools more\r\n\r\nautonomy, and the School Excellence Model in place  to  guide\r\n\r\nthem towards achieving the Desired Outcomes, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation is confident that we can further mass customise  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  ability-driven education in  our  schools,  and\r\n\r\ncreate an innovative culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the Ministry will continue to give\r\n\r\nevery support to our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprincipals, teachers, and our HQ officers as well,  sometimes\r\n\r\nthey  are very much maligned to do their jobs well.  To solve\r\n\r\nthat  problem, we post the HQ officers and the teachers  back\r\n\r\nand  forth.   There is a natural tendency for people  in  the\r\n\r\nheadquarters to say, \"Well, the people in the schools  really\r\n\r\ndon't  know  what  they are doing.  You give  them  a  simple\r\n\r\ninstruction,  they  can't follow.\"  And  the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nschools  would say the people in headquarters really  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  they  are  doing either because  how  could  they\r\n\r\npossibly  give such an instruction, unless they  are  totally\r\n\r\nignorant of what is happening in the school. The way to solve\r\n\r\nit  is to post them back and forth.   So in the end, they end\r\n\r\nup   scolding  themselves.   That  will  solve  the  problem.\r\n\r\nSeveral  Members are scheduled to speak later on the  subject\r\n\r\nof teachers.   So I will elaborate on the people issues after\r\n\r\nI have had the benefit of their views and suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members have asked how would we know how\r\n\r\nsuccessful  we  are.   What are the  benchmarks?   There  are\r\n\r\nquantitative   measures,   such   as   ranking,   comparisons\r\n\r\ninternationally,  and so on.  But there are  others,  perhaps\r\n\r\nmore  long term, more intangible measures, but more important\r\n\r\nones which we may not be able to measure very well.  Will our\r\n\r\npeople  remain employable in the future?  Will we  really  be\r\n\r\nable  to  venture  forth with new inventions, technopreneurs,\r\n\r\nand so on?  It is very hard to measure that and attribute  it\r\n\r\nand make the connection directly with the education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will our nation remain cohesive and united? The\r\n\r\neducation system has a part to play in it but it is  not  the\r\n\r\nonly  player.   Some  of  these  things  are  intangible  and\r\n\r\nimponderable and we will not know.  We will know when we will\r\n\r\nhave  succeeded, we will know when we will fail, but  to  try\r\n\r\nand  measure it along the way is not so easy.  But as Members\r\n\r\nhave said, we cannot stand still.  The world is changing, the\r\n\r\nenvironment around us is changing.  So we must move on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude this section, when I visit schools, the\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspoken  to  have  welcomed the increased  autonomy  as  being\r\n\r\ntimely.  They see it as an opportunity to bring out more from\r\n\r\nevery  child,  to  raise the quality of education  to  a  new\r\n\r\nlevel.  This augurs well for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I in the Ministry HQ will give them\r\n\r\nour  full support.  But our efforts alone will not be enough.\r\n\r\nWe  will also need parents, the community, and in particular,\r\n\r\nMembers of this House, to continue to give their support  and\r\n\r\nideas  as we strive to help them meet the challenges  of  the\r\n\r\nnew economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will request Mr Peter Chen to give an update on the\r\n\r\nIT Masterplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh wants to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, as far as I remember, we have\r\n\r\nno  streaming  in our primary school.

The results became a  lot  better.   In\r\n\r\nresponse  to  Mr Inderjit, he said that there  was  streaming\r\n\r\nbefore  in the form of A, B and C classes.  So I am not  sure\r\n\r\nwhat was the streaming before, in whatever form, or was there\r\n\r\nno  streaming  before, and therefore all those good  results,\r\n\r\nwere  they that clearly identifiable to streaming in the  way\r\n\r\nthat we have it now.  The other point which I want to say is:\r\n\r\nis  there  not  some other way of helping the  slow  students\r\n\r\napart from this very clear and distinct segregation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh was making the\r\n\r\npoint  that  students were never segregated  in  any  way  by\r\n\r\nability.  And the point that I was making is that that is not\r\n\r\ntrue.   That has been going on for quite a long time  in  the\r\n\r\nschools as it goes on in practically every school system that\r\n\r\nI  know of.  Specifically, on streaming, the time that I  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to school and probably the time Mr Inderjit was  going\r\n\r\nto  school, I am not sure how much younger he is, we did  not\r\n\r\nhave such a wide variety in streaming.  In fact, for many  of\r\n\r\nthe  students  who  were  unable to cope,  they  just  simply\r\n\r\ndropped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as recently as seven years ago, before we\r\n\r\nintroduced the Normal (Technical) stream in the secondary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools, something like 15% of our students were not going to\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, because they went to Primary 6, did not do\r\n\r\nwell, went to Primary 7 and Primary 8.  And some of them went\r\n\r\nto  the  old  VITB, and some left and went to the  workforce.\r\n\r\nBut  with the Normal (Technical) stream, for example, in  our\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, these students now have the opportunity to\r\n\r\ngo  to  secondary schools when they otherwise might not have.\r\n\r\nIn  these four years in the secondary school, they get a much\r\n\r\nstronger  foundation in Mathematics, in Science, in language,\r\n\r\nwhich  allows them to go on to post-secondary education.   Mr\r\n\r\nPeter Chen is very proud of the fact that something like  75%\r\n\r\nof  them have gone on to ITE, something which they would  not\r\n\r\nhave been able to do before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I thought the Minister would\r\n\r\nnot  want to respond because the survey was not conducted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  or  not  related to the Government.

I will  now  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to share with Members our progress  in  some  of\r\n\r\nthese initiatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi has asked about the status of the\r\n\r\nMasterplan  for  IT in Education that was launched  in  1997.\r\n\r\nThe  Masterplan, which is being implemented in three  phases,\r\n\r\nhas met all its targets thus far:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 1 involving 22 schools has been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2, involving another 108 schools, will be\r\n\r\ncompleted  by  the  middle of this year.  These  schools  are\r\n\r\nfully-networked  and  have  access  to  MOE's  Intranet,  the\r\n\r\nInternet and Singapore ONE.  Start-up targets for students to\r\n\r\ncomputer  ratio have also been met.  I wish to  explain  here\r\n\r\nthat the target that has been met is the start-up target, and\r\n\r\nfor  secondary schools and junior colleges, the  ratio  is  5\r\n\r\nstudents  to  1.  The Ministry of Education will  review  the\r\n\r\nneed to go beyond this particular ratio.   We will  go beyond\r\n\r\nthis  ratio when we are satisfied that the equipment  can  be\r\n\r\nfully made use of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some concern that neighbourhood schools\r\n\r\nmay not have enough computers for their use.  I would like to\r\n\r\npoint  out also that although the overall ratio is 5:1, there\r\n\r\nare  some  segments  in our schools, and  in  particular  the\r\n\r\nNormal  (Technical) Stream, the ratio is  much,  much  better\r\n\r\nthan  that.  It is a matter of need, and whether or  not  the\r\n\r\nequipment can be well used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some concern expressed that teachers\r\n\r\nthemselves  may not have enough computers.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  there  is a computer  purchase  scheme  for\r\n\r\nteachers. Under the scheme for desktops, teachers pay 80%  of\r\n\r\nthe  cost, with MOE subsidising the balance, and if it  is  a\r\n\r\nlaptop  or  notebook, teachers pay only 60% of the cost,  the\r\n\r\nrest  being borne by the Ministry.   To date, there are 8,000\r\n\r\nteachers  who have taken advantage of the scheme.   All  this\r\n\r\nhas  enabled  about 15% of formal curriculum  time  in  these\r\n\r\nschools to be IT-enriched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full implementation of the third and final phase of the\r\n\r\nMasterplan  for the remaining schools has already begun,  and\r\n\r\nis scheduled to finish in the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting up of a central unit to source, review\r\n\r\nand  recommend suitable resources, schools can  now  purchase\r\n\r\nfrom a wide selection of courseware and electronic resources.\r\n\r\nIn  areas  where there is a lack of good educational software\r\n\r\nin  the  market,  the  Ministry has collaborated  with  local\r\n\r\nindustry to produce the software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole-school approach has been adopted in the training\r\n\r\nof teachers to create a critical mass of teachers who are IT-savvy  and  help  the IT culture take root  more  quickly  in\r\n\r\nschools.   We  have  so far completed IT training  for  6,500\r\n\r\nteachers  in  the Phase 1 and Phase 2 schools.  By  September\r\n\r\nthis  year,  another 15,500 teachers in the Phase  3  schools\r\n\r\nwill  be IT-trained.  Teachers receive an average of 40 hours\r\n\r\nof training in IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some concern expressed whether or not the\r\n\r\nolder  teachers may be able to cope with it.   I  would  also\r\n\r\nlike to point out that under the training programme, there is\r\n\r\nan  arrangement  called  \"hand holding  sessions\".  In  these\r\n\r\nsessions,  the  teachers and colleagues and their  peers  all\r\n\r\ncome together and those who are IT savvy will help the others\r\n\r\nwho  are  less  so  in sharing their knowledge  and  even  in\r\n\r\ndesigning  courses which are IT-enriched.  There  is  special\r\n\r\nattention given to this.  We know that not all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers  can move at the same pace, just as not all students\r\n\r\ncan move at the same pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Masterplan goes beyond the provision of\r\n\r\nhardware,  infrastructure and training.  It has also  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  a  clear policy on the use of IT in education that  is\r\n\r\nwidely  supported by principals.  This has  helped  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a mindset change in the way schools make use of IT  in\r\n\r\ntheir instructional programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our students are reaping the benefits of the IT\r\n\r\nMasterplan  not  only through IT-enriched lessons,  but  also\r\n\r\nparticipation in IT-based projects with students  from  other\r\n\r\nschools, both local and overseas.  These projects have helped\r\n\r\nto   broaden  the  outlook  of  our  students,  and  provided\r\n\r\nopportunities for them to learn IT and teamwork skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has asked MOE to consider including\r\n\r\ntechnology  as  a  compulsory subject.  We  share  Mrs  Lim's\r\n\r\nobjective of ensuring that our young are technology literate.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen to achieve this objective by first building  a\r\n\r\nstrong  foundation in Mathematics and Science throughout  our\r\n\r\nentire  education system, and also by infusing IT in subjects\r\n\r\nand  other learning activities.  Our aim is for our  students\r\n\r\nin  general  to  learn to make the best  use  of  information\r\n\r\ntechnology  in particular in their own learning, rather  than\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  study the subject of technology in  isolation.\r\n\r\nBut  for  students  who are technically inclined,  there  are\r\n\r\nspecialised subjects like Computer Applications and Computing\r\n\r\nwhich they may take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is also widely acknowledged internationally to\r\n\r\nbe  a  leader in the use of IT in education.  In  the  recent\r\n\r\nSecond Information Technology in Education Study (SITES),  an\r\n\r\ninternational   study   involving  26   other   participating\r\n\r\ncountries  and  economies, including  Japan  and  Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  ranked  top in having a  clearly  articulated\r\n\r\npolicy on the use of IT, the provision of some of the world's\r\n\r\nbest  computers and peripherals to schools, and  IT  training\r\n\r\nfor its teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur  students  have  also  won top  awards  in  international\r\n\r\nwebsite   design   competitions  like   Thinkquest   Internet\r\n\r\nChallenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to Single Session Programme for secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen has asked about the Single Session\r\n\r\nProgramme  for  secondary schools and how these  schools  are\r\n\r\nadapting to the single-session system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the Single Session Programme is a\r\n\r\nsignificant step forward for our secondary schools.   It  has\r\n\r\nallowed  schools to benefit from greater flexibility  in  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  curriculum  time and resources,  a  wider  range  of\r\n\r\nenrichment  programmes  to  cater to  students  of  different\r\n\r\nabilities  and family backgrounds, and a more vibrant  school\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single-session system is still relatively new for\r\n\r\nmany  of  our  schools  and  MOE  has  been  monitoring   its\r\n\r\nimplementation.   So far, we are generally pleased  with  the\r\n\r\nways  schools have made use of the single-session  system  to\r\n\r\nenrich  the  learning experiences of their pupils.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  provide advice and guidance to the  schools  in\r\n\r\ntheir  implementation,  and help them  to  strike  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  optimising  the  use  of  their  resources  and  not\r\n\r\noverloading our teachers and students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested during the Budget debate\r\n\r\nlast  week that we boost the number of construction  projects\r\n\r\nby building new schools and upgrading old ones.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education builds and upgrades schools to meet educational\r\n\r\nobjectives.   If these activities provide a welcome  stimulus\r\n\r\nto  the construction industry, it will be an added bonus.  In\r\n\r\nthe  last  two  years, we have been constructing  new  school\r\n\r\nbuildings  at  the rate of about 12 per year.  Members  would\r\n\r\nalso be aware that in May last year, my Ministry launched the\r\n\r\nProgramme  for  Rebuilding  and  IMproving  Existing  schools\r\n\r\n(PRIME).  Under PRIME, a total of 290 schools will either  be\r\n\r\nrebuilt  or  upgraded  over a period of  seven  years  at  an\r\n\r\nestimated cost of $4.5 billion.  Thereafter, we will  upgrade\r\n\r\nschools to the prevailing standard once every 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIME will be implemented in 5 phases.

To date, the construction for 9 of these\r\n\r\nschools has been completed and construction for most  of  the\r\n\r\nother schools is scheduled to complete by the end of 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, putting in place the necessary hardware and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  has  great influence on total  education  and\r\n\r\nchildren's achievement in school.

I hope that by doing so, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education will not deal a heavy blow on the morale of our\r\n\r\nteachers, and I sincerely hope that the parents will not lose\r\n\r\ntheir confidence in the teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to 10 years ago, our primary and secondary\r\n\r\nstudents  are consistently scoring better results in English.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly attributable to the efforts of the teachers in\r\n\r\npreparing   the students for the examinations. But now,  they\r\n\r\nare  sent  back  to  the classroom for retraining.  I  think,\r\n\r\nbasically,  the problem does not lie with the  teachers,  but\r\n\r\nrather it was because the Ministry of Education had failed to\r\n\r\ntake  into  consideration the expectation of the  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors on the school graduates.  As such,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  appeal  to  MOE  to  touch base  with  the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies and the business community to  establish\r\n\r\nthe  actual  requirement of the employers on the  proficiency\r\n\r\nlevel of the graduates in conversational and written English,\r\n\r\nso  as  to  set  the appropriate and relevant   standard  for\r\n\r\npassing, for the teachers and students to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bilingual education policy, in order for our\r\n\r\nstudents to spend more time and energy to learn English,  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of the mother tongue is lowered to that of   second\r\n\r\nlanguage  or  even to a \"B\" standard.  Psychologically,  they\r\n\r\nwould  not be able to put in full efforts to learn the mother\r\n\r\ntongue  well.   Consequently, when  they  leave  school,  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  their  mother tongue  proficiency  will  be  so\r\n\r\ninadequate that it will be rendered useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to feedback from the business community,\r\n\r\ngenerally  speaking, there is plenty of room for  improvement\r\n\r\nin  the  ability  to  write  Chinese  and  English   for  our\r\n\r\nuniversity  graduates. Therefore, the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nshould  look at this matter squarely, and conduct a  thorough\r\n\r\nreview  to improve our bilingual policy.  This is  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  graduates  of  our  primary and secondary  schools  and\r\n\r\ntertiary institutions have enough proficiency in both English\r\n\r\nand   their  mother  tongue  to  prepare  for  their   future\r\n\r\nemployment,  and  do not treat the passing of  the  requisite\r\n\r\nexamination as the sole purpose of learning these languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also announced that we must use the\r\n\r\nteaching  of the mother tongue to inculcate understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe students' own mother tongue culture and heritage, and  to\r\n\r\nenhance their moral values as well as a sense of belonging to\r\n\r\nsociety and the nation.  But for those who have opted for the\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  (B) paper, because of the constraint  in  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of their lessons, they may lose the opportunity  of\r\n\r\nlearning  the  moral  values through the learning  of  mother\r\n\r\ntongue.  I do not know whether the Ministry of Education  has\r\n\r\nany remedy for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year on 19th March, at the sitting of\r\n\r\nParliament, I proposed that the Ministry of Education  should\r\n\r\nintroduce  Malay  language  as a non-examination  subject  in\r\n\r\nprimary  and secondary schools.  I am glad to  know that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  High  School  and Nanyang Girls'  High  School  have\r\n\r\nalready introduced such lessons.  I suggest that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  substantial  assistance  in  sending  more  good  Malay\r\n\r\nteachers to conduct such courses in more schools so that more\r\n\r\nstudents   can  learn  Malay,  thereby  strengthening   their\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the Malay language and culture, and laying a\r\n\r\nstronger  foundation for the promotion of our social  harmony\r\n\r\nand friendly ties with our neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have a slightly different\r\n\r\nview.   I  think at least the  result of what the Member  was\r\n\r\ntalking  about  is  that  our university  graduates  are  not\r\n\r\nproficient  in both English and Chinese languages   precisely\r\n\r\nbecause we have had too much emphasis placed on mother tongue\r\n\r\nin our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the recent changes in allowing\r\n\r\nstudents the flexibility in choosing different mother  tongue\r\n\r\noptions  through the implementation of the CL(B),  ML(B)  and\r\n\r\nTL(B) options are good and timely.  That is going to make  it\r\n\r\neven  more difficult to be proficient.  I feel that all  this\r\n\r\ntime,  we  have placed too much emphasis on mother tongue  in\r\n\r\ndeciding  on  the  streaming  of  students,  computation   of\r\n\r\naggregate  marks  for the PSLE and other  school  examination\r\n\r\nlevels.   This  has  resulted in unfair ranking  and  student\r\n\r\nperformance measurements.  Many students who did very well in\r\n\r\nall  other subjects, but did badly in the mother tongue  were\r\n\r\npenalised by streaming them to lower streams or in  them  not\r\n\r\ngetting the best subject options in secondary schools.  While\r\n\r\nI  am  not  doubting the importance of learning one's  mother\r\n\r\ntongue,  I however feel that it is about time we changed  the\r\n\r\nway  we  treat  this subject as compared to  the  other  more\r\n\r\nimportant  subjects in the school system.  Mother  tongue  is\r\n\r\nimportant  but, as a subject, I think we need  to  reconsider\r\n\r\nhow we treat it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not going to create successful knowledge\r\n\r\nworkers  by  doing well in the mother tongue  subject  alone.\r\n\r\nBut because of the importance and heavy weightage we place on\r\n\r\nthis  subject  in deciding things in our school  system,  our\r\n\r\nchildren end up spending a disproportionately longer time  in\r\n\r\nstudying this subject,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  I think some Members talked about a lot of time is spent\r\n\r\non  studying the mother tongue, tuition and extra classes and\r\n\r\nso  on,  so much so that you leave very little time  for  the\r\n\r\nthree  other  important subjects  - Mathematics, Science  and\r\n\r\nEnglish.   I  therefore feel that it is about  time  that  we\r\n\r\nstopped  using  the mother tongue subject  as  a  restrictive\r\n\r\ngauge to measure a student's academic ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister three questions.\r\n\r\nFirst  of all, will he consider changing the education policy\r\n\r\nto  place  less  weightage on the mother  tongue  subject  in\r\n\r\ncomputing  the  landmark  examinations'  aggregate  score  by\r\n\r\nplacing  more emphasis on subjects like mathematics,  science\r\n\r\nand  English?  While we can still place some weightage on it,\r\n\r\nI think the weightage needs to be much reduced, and we should\r\n\r\nemphasise  more on the other subjects.  Because we are  using\r\n\r\nthis  to measure whether the student did well or not, whether\r\n\r\nthis student is going to become a scholar or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in practising streaming, will he consider\r\n\r\nexcluding completely the mother tongue subject as a criterion\r\n\r\nfor  measure?   While we can measure all the other  subjects,\r\n\r\nmaybe we should not use mother tongue as a criterion.   As  I\r\n\r\nmentioned, the current practice is unfair for those  who  may\r\n\r\nhave  done  very  well in other subjects but  not  in  mother\r\n\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will he relook at the university admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  and maybe we should exclude this mother tongue pass\r\n\r\nrequirement  at  'O'  levels  as an  admission  criterion  to\r\n\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel we have already achieved our objective of\r\n\r\nrequiring  every Singaporean to learn his mother  tongue,  in\r\n\r\norder  not to lose our traditions and cultures.  But  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  now  need to look into the future and not  let  the\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  be an obstacle in developing  our  own  local\r\n\r\ntalents to be world ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nsteps  by  the Ministry of  Education to upgrade the learning\r\n\r\nof  Malay  language in schools.

Often, we find and\r\n\r\nwe  meet  our Malay students who speak Malay in poor  syntax.\r\n\r\nThe  syntax  is based on English.  Often, their speeches  are\r\n\r\nmixed with English words.  If we want to upgrade the standard\r\n\r\nof  our  Malay  language, it is important that we  take  firm\r\n\r\naction  to  draw up good teaching programmes so that  we  can\r\n\r\nproduce students who have a high proficiency in Malay.  These\r\n\r\nare  the students who will be taking Malay at a higher  level\r\n\r\nfrom primary five to university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language is the spirit of the people and language\r\n\r\nreflects  the  identity  of the people  and  community.   The\r\n\r\nlanguage  is  to channel our heritage to the next generation.\r\n\r\nSo it is very important for us to focus on our young students\r\n\r\nso  that they can learn Malay at a higher standard.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister for Education what are his plans  to\r\n\r\nupgrade the learning of the Malay language in the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education will be conducting a\r\n\r\nprogramme to develop talent called MAS or gold glitters.   We\r\n\r\nhope that the talents will glitter and this will start in the\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang High School next year.  If this plan succeeds,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask whether this plan can also be conducted\r\n\r\nin  other  schools in the eastern part of Singapore,  because\r\n\r\nthere are many Malay students living in the eastern area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move to the achievements of Malay\r\n\r\nstudents at PSLE, 'O', 'A/O' and 'A' levels.  I would like to\r\n\r\nask  how many Malay students have achieved A star at PSLE and\r\n\r\nA1  in  the  'O' and 'A/O' levels.  I have received  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  a number of students in the better schools in Singapore\r\n\r\nthat they find difficulty in achieving excellent results, ie,\r\n\r\nA1 at 'A' and 'A/O' levels.  Is this true?  And what would be\r\n\r\nthe  comparison  with  the  results  in  Mandarin  and  Tamil\r\n\r\nsubjects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwhether excellent Malay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  who achieved the top 10% or 20% will be allowed  to\r\n\r\nlearn  Mandarin, as a third language at secondary  level.

I  say  this\r\n\r\nfollowing  from  the  steps taken  by  two  SAP  schools,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  by Mr Tay, ie, Chinese  High  School  and\r\n\r\nNanyang  Girls'  High  School, to allow  their  students  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to learn Malay at secondary one and two.  I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  step ahead towards closer relations between  the\r\n\r\ncommunities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I would like, first of\r\n\r\nall,  to  declare  that I am a member  of  the  Malay  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee formed by the Ministry of Education to improve  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of Malay in schools.  As a member of the committee,\r\n\r\nI  chair  an advisory group which obtains feedback  from  the\r\n\r\ncommunity on the problems in learning and teaching of  Malay,\r\n\r\nand the means towards improving them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the Malay community supports the decision of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education to meet  the  needs  of  various\r\n\r\ninterests in relation to the teaching of Malay.  The  concern\r\n\r\nis  the  need  to  enhance the proficiency in  Malay  amongst\r\n\r\nstudents  and  to give opportunity for capable  students  who\r\n\r\nwant  to  take higher Malay to do so.  This has been done  at\r\n\r\nsecondary  and junior college levels.  It is also a  proposal\r\n\r\nthat  teacher  candidates with the capability be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ntake  Malay  studies up to honours level.  The  Ministry  has\r\n\r\ntaken  steps  to open degree course studies to honours  level\r\n\r\nfor capable teacher candidates at NIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are not able to study Malay as a second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  like other students, are given the flexibility  to\r\n\r\ntake  the Malay (B) subject.  This has also been welcomed  by\r\n\r\nparents.   I believe Indian parents also welcome the decision\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry to allow students taking Tamil language  to\r\n\r\ntake TL(B).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, generally, the Ministry's decision relating to\r\n\r\nsecond language teaching is good, I would like to suggest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  a  number  of feedback and suggestions  raised  at  the\r\n\r\nprevious session be given attention, particularly on the need\r\n\r\nto  give  wider  opportunities to Malay teachers  to  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  knowledge on Malay language and their ability to teach\r\n\r\nthe  subject.   This  is because there are  concerns  on  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  teaching staff, particularly young teachers  who\r\n\r\nstudied  Malay at only second language level  when they  were\r\n\r\nin  school.   To overcome this situation, among  the  younger\r\n\r\nteachers,  there  were  suggestions that  the  Malay  Studies\r\n\r\nDepartment  at  the National University of Singapore  or  NIE\r\n\r\noffer  honours and MA courses to eligible candidates in Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage.  In other words, they want wider opportunities  for\r\n\r\neligible candidates.  Among younger teachers who teach  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  as ML2, there is also hope that wider opportunities\r\n\r\nbe open to them to upgrade their skills in using and teaching\r\n\r\nMalay.   I think this reflects their desire to be better  ML2\r\n\r\nteachers and I would support their hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, they should have teachers who are able\r\n\r\nto  impart  moral  and cultural values in Malay  through  the\r\n\r\nteaching of second language generally.  We should upgrade the\r\n\r\nabilities  of  the  second language teachers,  including  ML2\r\n\r\nteachers,  by  using better and more interesting  methods  so\r\n\r\nthat  students  will be motivated to learn the  subject,  not\r\n\r\njust  to pass examinations or to go to institutions of higher\r\n\r\nlearning,  but  to appreciate the language as an  element  of\r\n\r\ntheir  culture.   We need more teachers who  are  capable  of\r\n\r\nteaching  the  language because generally Malay students  are\r\n\r\nless proficient in speaking Malay.  Our teachers should be an\r\n\r\nexample  and motivator for the development of more  effective\r\n\r\nspeakers  of  Malay  in the country.  Besides  improving  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  this  can  be achieved  if  the  skills  of  our\r\n\r\nteachers in speaking and using the language and also to teach\r\n\r\nthe language are upgraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, the recent initiatives announced by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narising  from  the review of the Tamil language teaching  and\r\n\r\neducation  in our schools has been welcomed by the community.\r\n\r\nI  have  had the privilege of being a member of the Committee\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister chaired to review the education of  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  also chaired an Advisory Committee  to  obtain\r\n\r\nfeedback from the community on this matter.  I must say  that\r\n\r\nin  general the recommendations accord well with the feedback\r\n\r\nwe   received   from  the  community,  in   particular,   the\r\n\r\nobservations pertaining to the standard of the language as it\r\n\r\nis  taught  in our schools and the methodology  used  in  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  the  language.   In particular,  the  community\r\n\r\nwelcomes  the  Minister's assurance  and  commitment  on  two\r\n\r\ncounts.   The  first was that the standard of Tamil  language\r\n\r\nwould  be set at a level appropriate to our circumstances  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and at a level which would also enable  reasonable\r\n\r\nstudents   with  reasonable  effort  to  achieve   reasonable\r\n\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two reasons why this is important.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  a  growing proportion of students from Tamil  homes\r\n\r\nspeak  English as the main language.  In fact, more than  50%\r\n\r\nuse  English predominantly in their home and this  proportion\r\n\r\nis  likely to increase as the trend suggests.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nsocial and cultural context in Singapore is different to that\r\n\r\nin  India or, in particular, Tamil Nadu, which would be  used\r\n\r\nas  a  benchmark for Tamil.  Therefore, any standard that  we\r\n\r\nderive  from such external sources must be suitably  adjusted\r\n\r\nfor our local context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of the Minister's assurance pertains\r\n\r\nto  the  accessibility  to Tamil language  during  curriculum\r\n\r\nhours  in our schools and there the Minister stated  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  maintained at the present levels.  In  particular,\r\n\r\nthree   out  of  four  primary  schools  offer  Tamil  during\r\n\r\ncurriculum hours and more than half of the secondary schools,\r\n\r\nI  believe 53%, offer Tamil during curriculum hours as  well.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Ministry will be enhancing this availability\r\n\r\nat  the  secondary level through cluster schools.  These  are\r\n\r\nall  very welcome initiatives on this score because this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  bane of many students and, for that matter,  their\r\n\r\nparents, who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaking  Tamil  because  they have to miss  out  on  the  core\r\n\r\ncurriculum  opportunities as well as  remedial  opportunities\r\n\r\nthat might have occurred outside curriculum time because they\r\n\r\nhave  to  go  for classes in Tamil as well.  With the  review\r\n\r\ncomplete, the key aspect is implementation and ultimately the\r\n\r\nsuccess,  it  would  seem, resides with  whether  the  policy\r\n\r\nobjectives are realised in the syllabus, the textbooks and in\r\n\r\nthe classrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I would like to ask the Minister how the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  these initiatives  will  be  managed  and\r\n\r\nwhether  there  would be scope for continual input  from  the\r\n\r\ncommunity or, at least, certain parts of the community  which\r\n\r\nmay  have  knowledge that would be of value to the  Ministry.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the  teachers  would be the  key  agents  of  this\r\n\r\nchange,  not just because they are teaching the syllabus  but\r\n\r\nalso  because  they are the embodiment of  the  language  and\r\n\r\nwould  therefore be a model for these students  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nwhat  teaching  and  learning the language  is  about.   What\r\n\r\nopportunities  will  be made available  for  TL  teachers  to\r\n\r\nenhance their own training and development?  I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister,  in particular, two questions.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nwhat  proportion  of Tamil teachers have tertiary  education?\r\n\r\nSecondly,   whether  there  are  plans  to  introduce   Tamil\r\n\r\neducation  or  training  in Tamil language  teaching  at  the\r\n\r\ntertiary level at our NIE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I put in a cut about\r\n\r\nPromoting Malay Language in our Schools and in my position it\r\n\r\nis  not  about mother tongue, it is really a cut on promoting\r\n\r\nMalay language in schools. Therefore, it is really about  the\r\n\r\nother  tongue.  The Minister has earlier asked me to  put  in\r\n\r\nmore  suggestions  for enriching the school  curriculum.   So\r\n\r\nthis is my seventh suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has replied to me in the last sitting that\r\n\r\nif any school wishes to include Malay as an optional and non-examinable  subject  in  their school  curriculum,  they  are\r\n\r\nwelcome  to  do  so.  He cautioned me not to set  unrealistic\r\n\r\ntargets  as  learning  two  languages  is  already  difficult\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make three points here. In the early\r\n\r\n60s  before  the  independence of Singapore,  we  all  learnt\r\n\r\nMalay, Chinese and English at primary level.  What I remember\r\n\r\nis  Malay was taught as a conversational language without our\r\n\r\nMalay teacher forcing us to read, write and take tests on it.\r\n\r\nIt  was  relaxed and entertaining and I did not remember  the\r\n\r\nresistance   to   it,  which  explains   why   perhaps   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the age cohort of 45-50 today all speak  some\r\n\r\nMalay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore the method of teaching and the climate\r\n\r\nof  learning developed by the teacher which has the effect of\r\n\r\nour responsiveness to the language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point about learning to speak Malay is an\r\n\r\ninter-personal one. A language is a great facility in drawing\r\n\r\ndifferent nationalities closer.  In the neighbourhood which I\r\n\r\nstayed  in,  at Race Course  Road, which parallels  Serangoon\r\n\r\nRoad,  the  multicultural  mix of Malays,  different  Chinese\r\n\r\ndialect  groups and Indians in a relatively low-income,  low-educated  neighbourhood, the Malay language was the  mode  of\r\n\r\ncommunication between these different groups. The result  was\r\n\r\na  colourful  one,  every ethnic group spoke  a  splatter  of\r\n\r\nphrases in different dialects and languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the critical role of Malay in forging\r\n\r\nregional  ties.   Sir, we are surrounded by a  Malay-speaking\r\n\r\nworld.  The usefulness of learning Malay to facilitate cross-cultural communication and promote regional closeness  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  ignored.  We do not need to compel every school to  adopt\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  Language  policy, but some  encouragement  is  in\r\n\r\norder  to help nurture some cohorts of Singaporeans  who  can\r\n\r\nserve  as bridges, networkers as well as broker on behalf  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   in  its  commercial,  political  and   diplomatic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the region.  Language is the key  ingredient\r\n\r\nthat  sparks the emotions of connections between people.   In\r\n\r\nview  of  the pressing political developments around us,  the\r\n\r\nability   to   use  the  Malay  language  as  a   medium   of\r\n\r\ncommunication, a tool in defining friendships and  mobilising\r\n\r\nresources will become increasingly important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the men and women who teach our\r\n\r\nchildren  are key to our education system.

While  this  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  welcomed, many teachers still find administrative\r\n\r\nworkload on the heavy side.  Would the Ministry explore  work\r\n\r\nflow  improvement  process through  the  use  of  information\r\n\r\ntechnology to provide relief in this area?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch upon the age profile of\r\n\r\nteachers.   For  many years until recently,  not  many  young\r\n\r\npeople were attracted into the teaching career.  As a result,\r\n\r\nSir,  if we look at the age profile of teachers, we will find\r\n\r\ntwo  things:  basically a U-shape curve.  There  is  a  group\r\n\r\ncloser  to  the age of retirement and there is another  group\r\n\r\nwho has just joined the teaching career after graduating from\r\n\r\nNIE.   So this presents some concerns and some opportunities.\r\n\r\nLet me describe the concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that within a very few years most of our\r\n\r\nexperienced teachers would have reached retirement age.  With\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement, the core of teachers would have  become  a\r\n\r\nrelatively  young one that impact with the loss of experience\r\n\r\non  the  ability  of  schools to educate  our  young  and  to\r\n\r\ninculcate correct values.  Another aspect of challenge  faced\r\n\r\nby  some  of  the older teachers is the need to  learn  about\r\n\r\ncomputers  and  to  incorporate IT into their  teaching.  For\r\n\r\nsome, the challenge is indeed a great hurdle.  I believe some\r\n\r\nof  the  older  teachers do not even have the basic  keyboard\r\n\r\nskills.   Furthermore, the teachers are also concerned  about\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of authority and stature in front of the  students\r\n\r\nwhen  the  students  and  pupils are probably  more  computer\r\n\r\nliterate and network-savvy than they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to a few teachers and some of them would\r\n\r\nprefer to continue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  old  ways of instructions and leave the new innovation\r\n\r\nin  teaching to their younger colleagues.  If this is  indeed\r\n\r\ntheir  desire, could the Ministry accommodate these teachers?\r\n\r\nThe  opportunity is that with the retirement of these  senior\r\n\r\nteachers, the Ministry would probably be able to push the use\r\n\r\nof computers more extensively in teaching and administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next topic I would like to bring up on this cut\r\n\r\nis  the  pupil-teacher  ratio, a  topic  of  interest  to  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Chiam as well.  The Ministry  has  maintained\r\n\r\nthrough  all these years that pupil/teacher ratio is not  the\r\n\r\nkey  determinant of the effectiveness in teaching.   This  is\r\n\r\nprobably  true in the range of the ratio that we are confined\r\n\r\nto.  I am more interested in the effectiveness of teaching in\r\n\r\nprimary one, in particular, in the first few chaotic weeks of\r\n\r\nthe  new school year.  Many teachers told me that they  spend\r\n\r\nmore  time maintaining discipline and keeping order in  class\r\n\r\nthan  teaching the new pupils.  I wonder whether the Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  consider  having teachers' assistants  in  primary  one\r\n\r\nclasses to help the teachers, perhaps the trainee teachers in\r\n\r\nNIE could be mobilised to help in this particular area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): MOE has been taking a\r\n\r\nlong-term  view and has been correct in its judgement when it\r\n\r\nformulates  education  policies to  identify  talents  to  be\r\n\r\nnurtured  to meet the needs of the nation and society.   This\r\n\r\nis  to be applauded.  I do not agree with the views expressed\r\n\r\nby Mr Inderjit Singh.  Only a small minority of students find\r\n\r\nit  difficult  to  study the mother tongue.  Therefore,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  undermine the interest of the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  The bilingual education policy must be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, MOE published a report by the Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage Review Committee. Many of its recommendations on the\r\n\r\nteaching   of   Chinese  language  have  been   adopted   and\r\n\r\nimplemented.  This  includes the  modification  of  syllabus,\r\n\r\nrevision  of textbooks and the teaching of Chinese literature\r\n\r\nand  history in order to supplement the teaching and learning\r\n\r\nof mother tongue and to train more students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  have  a better command of the mother tongue, culture  and\r\n\r\nlanguage,  in  order  to be effectively  bilingual.   But  to\r\n\r\nachieve  such objectives  we must have enough CL teachers  to\r\n\r\nhelp implement such policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what is the shortfall of CL\r\n\r\nteachers  in both primary and secondary schools.  Will  there\r\n\r\nbe  a  shortage of CL teachers in the next five to 10  years'\r\n\r\ntime?   What measures are being contemplated by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto tackle the problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a language teacher's task is not just to impart\r\n\r\nlanguage  skills  to  the students.  He must  also  inculcate\r\n\r\ncorrect  values among the students and teach them to be  good\r\n\r\ncitizens.   In this regard, CL teachers have all along  taken\r\n\r\nupon  themselves  the sacred duty of imparting  knowledge  as\r\n\r\nwell as instilling moral values in the minds of the students,\r\n\r\nthus  achieving the twin objects of mother tongue  education.\r\n\r\nThe  locally trained CL teachers are able to not only  impart\r\n\r\nlanguage skills to the students but instill in them a  strong\r\n\r\nnational  identity.   Today, we are faced  with  the  serious\r\n\r\nproblem  of a shortage of teachers.  Immediate steps must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  train  more CL teachers.  We  should  not  be  too\r\n\r\ndependent on foreign sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those foreign CL teachers we have recruited, are\r\n\r\nthey  required  to  undergo  some  orientation  programme  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to understand our local situation here before  they\r\n\r\nare  deployed  to  teach  in our schools?   This  is  because\r\n\r\ndifferent countries have different education objectives.  Are\r\n\r\nthese foreign CL teachers familiar with our educational goals\r\n\r\nand  objectives  of  our mother tongue  education?   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which we should take note of.  Is MOE  considering\r\n\r\nretaining the good foreign teachers and let them take on more\r\n\r\nimportant roles in our educational system?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that recruitment of foreign CL teachers\r\n\r\nshould  be  just an interim measure.  In the long  term,  the\r\n\r\nsolution  lies in training more young Singaporeans to  become\r\n\r\nmother tongue teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould like to respond to what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Low Thia Khiang has said just now about the survey by the\r\n\r\nNUS on the Chinese students in Singapore who aspire to be  of\r\n\r\nother  races  in  their  next life.   Personally,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsurprised  by  this  finding because  our  young  people  are\r\n\r\nconstantly  influenced  by  the western  culture  surrounding\r\n\r\nthem.  Recently, when I was in Shanghai, I was told that many\r\n\r\npeople  in  China are also aspiring to become Americans.  The\r\n\r\nyoung people in China receive their education in Chinese.  To\r\n\r\neach  and  every  student in China, the Chinese  language  is\r\n\r\nalways the first language.  In fact, it is their one and only\r\n\r\nnational language.  Based on Mr Low's reasoning, they  should\r\n\r\nnot  aspire to be anything but Chinese. Yet, the Shanghainese\r\n\r\nalso  want  to  become  Americans.   So  when  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents aspire to be foreigners in their next life, I  think\r\n\r\nthere is nothing to do with the education they receive here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the subject which I have filed an\r\n\r\namendment.  Under our educational system, from the  old  days\r\n\r\nuntil  today,  students from primary one right up  to  junior\r\n\r\ncollege  were  passively sent to attend classes conducted  by\r\n\r\nteachers appointed by the schools.  Of course, to the primary\r\n\r\nschool  and  the  lower secondary school  students,  this  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.   But with Singapore becoming a developed  country\r\n\r\nand  with the rapid emergence of the knowledge-based economy,\r\n\r\ncompetition in the future society will certainly become  more\r\n\r\nand  more intense.  So when students go into society and face\r\n\r\ncompetition, they will have to depend on their own wisdom and\r\n\r\ntheir  own  hard  work  to  solve their  problems.   But  the\r\n\r\neducation  handed down by the teachers in their student  days\r\n\r\nwill be a source of great strength to back them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to learn new things, I think our educational\r\n\r\nmodel  and  educational  methods should also be changed.   In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  the traditional model was such that the  emphasis\r\n\r\nwas  on  memorising  knowledge and good  examination  skills.\r\n\r\nThis  must  be  substituted by cultivation of creativity  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of  characters.  The students and teachers should\r\n\r\nestablish a kind of interactive relationship between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the MOE should consider allowing students from\r\n\r\nSecondary 2 onwards to have the right to choose the  teachers\r\n\r\nthey  like.  If a teacher is very popular and his class  size\r\n\r\nis  so big, say, more than 35 students, then arrangement  can\r\n\r\nbe made for his lessons to be conducted in the larger lecture\r\n\r\ntheatres.   In the primary schools, the students may  not  be\r\n\r\nexperienced  enough to know whether the teacher  is  good  or\r\n\r\nbad.  When the students go to secondary one, they may not  be\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with the new school environment.  So let them  wait\r\n\r\nuntil  secondary two, then they should be allowed  to  choose\r\n\r\nthe teacher of their own choice.  This is a new creative type\r\n\r\nof   school  planning.  The  teachers  can  have  a  sort  of\r\n\r\ncompetition among themselves.  It will also motivate them  to\r\n\r\ndo their work better.  Then the students will be attracted to\r\n\r\ncome and learn under them.  In the old days when the students\r\n\r\nwere attending classes by certain teachers whose teaching was\r\n\r\ndull and uninteresting, they were bored and hence  lost their\r\n\r\ninterest in the subject.  But if they can choose the teachers\r\n\r\nthey like, they will be inspired  to learn better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the school adopts this method where the students\r\n\r\ncan  choose their own teachers, promotion of the teachers can\r\n\r\nbe  based  on  the  number of students  they  have  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective  classes in addition to the results  that  he  has\r\n\r\nproduced  by  his  teaching.  Of course,  we  have  to  avoid\r\n\r\nletting some teachers pleasing their students by deliberately\r\n\r\nsetting  some easy questions so that the students  can  score\r\n\r\nhigher  marks in their examinations or could give tips before\r\n\r\nthe  examinations.   The schools should then  conduct  common\r\n\r\ntests or common examinations, as a precaution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, teachers have not only to know how to teach\r\n\r\nthe  subjects, they should also care and love their students,\r\n\r\nso  as  to  cultivate them and to invoke their  interest  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  in their learning.  If a teacher can transform  a\r\n\r\nstudent  from  a  problem student to an outstanding  student,\r\n\r\nthen he or she is a valuable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteacher.  So,  good teachers should be commended and promoted\r\n\r\nand  be  given an increase in their salaries.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  those  not so good teachers should be eliminated.   We\r\n\r\nshould  not  allow these bad teachers to exert bad influences\r\n\r\non  the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we want to reform any traditional method,\r\n\r\nwe cannot just change it overnight, like the way we change  a\r\n\r\ncomputer.   It has to be a gradual process. Put in  some  new\r\n\r\nideas to the old system and gradually replace the old system.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some people will say this will remain just an  ideal.\r\n\r\nBut I feel that this is something to be considered seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we will talk about computers. Computers are very\r\n\r\npopular now.  Everybody now knows how to use a computer.   We\r\n\r\ncan  teach by means of computers.  One teacher can teach many\r\n\r\nstudents  at the same time.  Nowadays, we have a lot  of  new\r\n\r\nteachers.   In  the old days, we had a shortage of  teachers.\r\n\r\nBut  now we have an ample supply of teachers.  I think if  we\r\n\r\nhave  this  enthusiasm to fully develop our human  resources,\r\n\r\nthis  will  be a very creative way to help Singapore  develop\r\n\r\ninto  a  knowledge-based  economy and  to  develop  our  high\r\n\r\ntechnology.  I hope MOE will consider my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, teachers are critical national\r\n\r\nresources.   They help to educate our children.  We  need  to\r\n\r\nhave  enough teachers to meet the needs of our schools.   But\r\n\r\ndo  we have enough teachers in our Ministry?  Not only is the\r\n\r\ntotal  number  of  teachers  important,  but  there  must  be\r\n\r\nsufficient numbers of them in the various disciplines.  Here,\r\n\r\nagain, how do we fare in this latter criterion?  How many new\r\n\r\nteachers did we recruit in the past two years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers are committed and dedicated but some have\r\n\r\nfound  the  job  stressful and unsatisfying and,  thus,  they\r\n\r\nleave.   Could  the Minister share with us how many  teachers\r\n\r\nleft the service again in the last two years and how many  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  resigned were already trained?  Where  a  teacher\r\n\r\nresigns,  this  is  a  waste  of valuable  resources  to  the\r\n\r\neducation service, especially when he or she is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready  trained  and productive.

What  has the Ministry done to retain our  teachers?\r\n\r\nWhat more can the Ministry do in this area?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continued strengthening of the economy, I would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to ask the Minister for his view of the situation\r\n\r\nthis year.  Sir, I think it is important for the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nreassure  our teachers of their importance and that  it  will\r\n\r\nmake all possible efforts to provide teachers with meaningful\r\n\r\nand satisfying careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, with the improvements in the\r\n\r\nsalary  and  career package of teachers, we have successfully\r\n\r\nattracted  candidates  into  the teaching  service.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nevery year we see more and more graduates interested to  take\r\n\r\nup the challenges of the teaching profession.  The stories of\r\n\r\nthe   dedication,  innovations  and  care  given  by  today's\r\n\r\nteachers are heartwarming, to say the least.  Moreover, there\r\n\r\nhave  been  tremendous changes in the curricula, training  of\r\n\r\nteachers  and  policies in the last  couple  of  years.   The\r\n\r\nannual  recognition given to teachers and chances of speedier\r\n\r\npromotions for young teachers have helped attract new trainee\r\n\r\nteachers.   While the Ministry has been able to recruit,  has\r\n\r\nit  been  able to retain?  How many young teachers  left  the\r\n\r\nservice immediately after they have completed their bond?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of recruitment of teachers, we must\r\n\r\nindeed  try to get the best candidates to teach our students.\r\n\r\nTowards this end, the Institute of Education and MOE normally\r\n\r\nrecruit   those  who  study  what  are  called  the  teaching\r\n\r\nsubjects.  Do we really need to restrict ourselves in teacher\r\n\r\nrecruitment as at primary level any graduate should  be  able\r\n\r\nto  manage  teaching Mathematics, English and Science?   Many\r\n\r\nsubjects  are  increasingly becoming  multi-disciplinary,  so\r\n\r\nthere is room for graduates who may not have studied specific\r\n\r\nteaching subjects to be recruited into the teaching service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising this matter as I have been approached\r\n\r\nby residents whose applications to get into NIE have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrejected  presumably because they are not holding degrees  in\r\n\r\nteaching  subjects.  Interestingly, at least one of them  has\r\n\r\nbeen   teaching   as  a  relief  teacher.    Further,   their\r\n\r\napplications  have been rejected without any reasons  stated.\r\n\r\nThis gives rise to general unhappiness among those affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it might be useful in cases of rejection that there\r\n\r\nshould  be  reasons  given  why  some  degree  holders   were\r\n\r\nrejected.  Perhaps there should be clearer guidelines so that\r\n\r\nthose  who are unsuitable need not apply in the first  place.\r\n\r\nI  can only say, from feedback given, that it is particularly\r\n\r\ndifficult  for those who have applied, because they  seem  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  passion  for teaching, to be rejected  out  of  hand\r\n\r\nwithout any explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, should it not be possible to have an appeal\r\n\r\nboard  to  reconsider those applicants  who  really  want  to\r\n\r\nteach?   Perhaps,  after  a period of  time,  the  Board  can\r\n\r\nconsider  the applications of those who were rejected.   This\r\n\r\nwould,  in  effect, form a cooling off period on  both  sides\r\n\r\nwhere  an opportunity to re-consider can be taken.   Then  if\r\n\r\nthe  candidate is exceptionally keen and has the aptitude  to\r\n\r\nteach  and  decide to follow through with an  appeal,  should\r\n\r\nthere not be some latitude given to those who are in earnest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, like Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi Daipi before me, talking on the subject of recruitment\r\n\r\nand   retention   of   teachers,  a  fair   amount   of   the\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  we  hear  expressed  by  parents  would   be\r\n\r\nalleviated  if  we  had more teachers.  We can  have  smaller\r\n\r\nclass  sizes, more attention to students, better  interaction\r\n\r\nwith  parents.  The problem, it seems to me, however, is  not\r\n\r\nat  all  an  unwillingness  to  provide  more  positions  for\r\n\r\nteachers.

And we do not  have\r\n\r\nthat  many sports associations, and all that, to employ  many\r\n\r\nof  them.  I hope for the accomplished ones, people who  have\r\n\r\ndone  well, at least at the national level, or until national\r\n\r\nlevel, I am sure we can find ways where we can employ them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, if they are good enough to become coaches for\r\n\r\nprofessional leagues, I am sure they can be good  coaches  in\r\n\r\nschools as well.  Now you see a lot of very formal structured\r\n\r\ncertification programmes in place and recognised world  wide,\r\n\r\nor  regionally, and I am sure we can also use this as one  of\r\n\r\nthe admission criteria.  Certainly, we know of many sportsmen\r\n\r\nwho are personalities themselves who can inspire students and\r\n\r\nI  can  think of some who are actually good role  models  for\r\n\r\nstudents.  Unfortunately, not many can qualify to be teachers\r\n\r\nif  we use the normal admission criteria.  But I hope this is\r\n\r\none  area that we can make an exception.  If you look at some\r\n\r\nplaces  like  the  US, for example, basketball,  or  baseball\r\n\r\ncoaches,  had  seen accomplished sportsmen in  their  earlier\r\n\r\nyears.  I hope the Minister would seriously consider, if  you\r\n\r\ncannot employ them as full-time in one school, perhaps, part-time, or have a cluster of schools to do that.  I think  this\r\n\r\nis  important  so  that  while we not  only  allow  for  more\r\n\r\nflexible  recruitment, we can also help people who contribute\r\n\r\nto  Singapore, people who want to make a career in sports  to\r\n\r\nsee that they have very long and successful careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, earlier I shared with Members\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's  efforts  to  build  up  the  \"hardware\"  and\r\n\r\n\"software\"  of  our education system and now we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  what  is the heart of the whole education system  and,\r\n\r\nthat is, the 24,000 teachers who make up our teaching force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the recruitment, retention and\r\n\r\nstaffing situation, which Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHawazi  Daipi, Dr Tan, Dr Jennifer Lee and others have  asked\r\n\r\nabout.   Over  the past few years, the Ministry has  made  it\r\n\r\nmore  attractive to join and remain in the  Education Service\r\n\r\nthrough   more  competitive  remuneration,  better  promotion\r\n\r\nprospects,   strong  emphasis  on  continual  upgrading   and\r\n\r\nprofessional  development.  We hope also  that  our  teachers\r\n\r\nwill  derive more professional satisfaction in their work  as\r\n\r\nschools   get   more   autonomy  and   teachers   have   more\r\n\r\nopportunities to try out their own ideas for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\ntheir students.  I have always considered teaching as one  of\r\n\r\nthe most satisfying jobs because you see the children grow in\r\n\r\nfront  of  you  and they always remember later  on  in  life.\r\n\r\nPeople walk up to you and say, \"Hello.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these efforts, we have been able to\r\n\r\nrecruit  more teachers.  I am happy to report to  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  last  year,  1999,  we recruited  3,300  teachers,  the\r\n\r\nlargest  number that we have recruited for as long as  I  can\r\n\r\nthink  perhaps  the largest number we ever  recruited.   This\r\n\r\nexceeded our target of 3,000. We were able to do so  in  part\r\n\r\ndue  to  the economic downturn, and because we were  able  to\r\n\r\nattract people from previous cohorts of job entrants who were\r\n\r\nkeen  on  teaching but at the time when they entered the  job\r\n\r\nmarket, found the previous employment terms unattractive.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not expect to be able to sustain such a recruitment rate.\r\n\r\nA  more realistic recruitment rate is between 1,700 and 2,000\r\n\r\na  year.   In the previous two years, 1997 and 1998, in  1997\r\n\r\nthe  economy  was still quite strong, we had  been  averaging\r\n\r\n2,100  teachers a year.  This is double the average of  1,000\r\n\r\nteachers per year that we had been recruiting prior to 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual resignation rate among trained teachers has\r\n\r\nalso  remained quite stable in the last few years,  averaging\r\n\r\nabout  2%,  that  is, about 400-500 teachers  a  year.   This\r\n\r\nfigure may look large, but is very reasonable given the  size\r\n\r\nof  the teaching force.  If 400 teachers resign in a year, it\r\n\r\nis  slightly  more  than  one per school  which  I  think  is\r\n\r\nmanageable.   And teachers resign for a number  of  different\r\n\r\nreasons: some go and look after their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamilies, some want to try something else, and some come back\r\n\r\nafter  that,  so  that  is all right.  The  figure  is  quite\r\n\r\nreasonable  when compared to the rest of the  civil  service,\r\n\r\nand  certainly very reasonable when compared to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector where turnover rates are typically double digits.   So\r\n\r\n2% is quite reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee has expressed concern at the few\r\n\r\nthousand  vacant teaching posts in MOE.   I have  to  explain\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening.  We can only employ people if there  are\r\n\r\nposts  for  them.  And we employ people as soon as they  join\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  service, that means, before they  go  to  NIE,\r\n\r\nwhile they are in NIE, while they are overseas, and so forth,\r\n\r\nso  the  number  includes all these.   And  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  has been very supportive in giving us posts so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can recruit them if we are able to do so.  So that is the\r\n\r\nreason why there is a very large number of such posts and the\r\n\r\nvacancy  rate looks quite alarming.  But in fact, the vacancy\r\n\r\nrate is much more reasonable than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the more important figure is what we actually\r\n\r\nhave in the schools.  One of the things we have been able  to\r\n\r\ndo in the last few years also is to create new teaching posts\r\n\r\nin  schools in anticipation of being able to fill  them.   In\r\n\r\nthe  last  two years, we have increased the establishment  in\r\n\r\nschools by 1,500 posts, and not all of this increase has been\r\n\r\nfilled  yet.  The actual number of trained teachers has  gone\r\n\r\nup by 1,000 from 22,500 in 1998 to 23,500 at the end of 1999.\r\n\r\nSo  we  had 1,000 more trained teachers in the space  of  two\r\n\r\nyears.   The other teachers that we have recruited are  still\r\n\r\nin  the  pipeline being trained and they will come  into  the\r\n\r\nsystem  soon.  We have about 380 schools.  So, put in another\r\n\r\nway,  over the last two years, every school in Singapore  has\r\n\r\non  average three more teachers than they had two years  ago.\r\n\r\nSo  that is a welcome increase, with more shoulders to spread\r\n\r\nthe  load  on in the schools.  But because we have  increased\r\n\r\nthe  establishment, there are still additional posts  in  the\r\n\r\nschools yet to be filled.  The situation will improve in  May\r\n\r\nthis  year, when about 1,700 NIE graduands will be posted  to\r\n\r\nschools upon completion of their pre-service training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has asked whether a better pupil-teacher ratio at the lower primary level will be beneficial\r\n\r\nto  children's  education.  I think we have to  differentiate\r\n\r\nbetween  class size and pupil-teacher ratio because  a  class\r\n\r\nsize  is  how many students there are in a class,  while  the\r\n\r\npupil-teacher  ratio  is  how  many  teachers  there  are  to\r\n\r\nstudents and that may not be directly related to class  size.\r\n\r\nSmaller  class  size   is  only one  of  many  factors  which\r\n\r\ninfluences  the  quality of education.  The  quality  of  our\r\n\r\nteachers, the curriculum, the school environment, all play  a\r\n\r\npart  in  determining their level of educational achievement.\r\n\r\nWe need to take a total perspective of all these factors.  Of\r\n\r\nall  these  factors,  teacher quality  is  perhaps  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant.   In the end, whatever we may say in the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education HQ, or for that matter whatever we may  say  in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  as  pointed out by a number  of  Members,  what\r\n\r\nactually  goes  on in the classrooms is what  determines  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  education  that  is received.  The  delivery  of\r\n\r\neducation  is,  ultimately, at its heart, a completely  human\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain quality in the teaching profession, the\r\n\r\nMinistry aims to recruit those with teaching aptitude roughly\r\n\r\nfrom  about  the  top one-third of each cohort.   We  have  a\r\n\r\ncohort  of about 40,000 a year, and one third is about 13,000\r\n\r\npeople.   If we recruit 2,000 a year, we have to recruit  one\r\n\r\nout of every six-and-a-half persons in this cohort.  I am not\r\n\r\noptimistic  that we will be able to recruit  many  more  than\r\n\r\nthat.   Any significant reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio,\r\n\r\neven at the lower primary level, is likely to lead to a sharp\r\n\r\ndrop  in  the quality of our teachers.   And we have  to  ask\r\n\r\nourselves whether we are better off if children are taught in\r\n\r\nsmaller  classes but taught by teachers of low  quality.   So\r\n\r\nthis is a trade-off that we have to think about.  And I think\r\n\r\nteacher quality is probably the most important factor in  the\r\n\r\nquality of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do recruit teachers who are in the so-called non-teaching subject areas, particularly for the primary schools,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe have been doing so for some years now.  The way we recruit\r\n\r\nteachers   is  actually  to  have  an  interview   panel   of\r\n\r\nexperienced  teachers who will talk to the aspirants  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  they are suitable, ie, those who are called  up  for\r\n\r\ninterview.  In some cases, when we offer the appointment,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  so  much  that  we are not  prepared  to  offer  the\r\n\r\nappointment, it is that the level of the appointment that  we\r\n\r\nare  offering is not something which the applicant  is  happy\r\n\r\nwith.  So the applicant declines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For class size and pupil-teacher ratio, the Ministry's\r\n\r\nphilosophy is not to adopt a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach  of\r\n\r\nstipulating  a smaller class size for our schools.   Instead,\r\n\r\nour  approach  is  to build up and maintain  a  high  quality\r\n\r\nteaching  force by recruiting and retaining as many  teachers\r\n\r\nas  possible  -  with the right qualities  -  in  order  that\r\n\r\nschools  can be given the additional resources.   As  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained   earlier,  we  have  succeeded  in   doing   that.\r\n\r\nPrincipals  have the flexibility to decide  on  how  best  to\r\n\r\norganise and deploy their teacher resources, according to the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  their  students and the nature of the  activities.\r\n\r\nSome  schools where they think they need to give the students\r\n\r\na  boost  in  English have organised it in such  a  way  that\r\n\r\nteachers give more attention to students.  Some schools where\r\n\r\nthey think that teaching in larger classes and lecture halls,\r\n\r\nand  so  forth, works better, well, they have done that  too.\r\n\r\nSo  we  can  leave  that with principals  to  experiment,  to\r\n\r\ninnovate and see what works best  given the teachers and  the\r\n\r\nstudents that they have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the larger number of teachers recruited in recent\r\n\r\nyears,  and  stable  retention, we have  been  able  to  give\r\n\r\nschools  more  teacher resources.  In particular,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  net increase of almost 2,000 primary school teachers\r\n\r\nsince 1996.  This is quite significant.  This has enabled  us\r\n\r\nto  lower the pupil-teacher ratio in the primary schools from\r\n\r\n26.5 to 25 during this period, even though pupil enrolment in\r\n\r\nthe  primary schools has increased by about 37,000 or  13.6%.\r\n\r\nEven  in  the face of that, we have been able to improve  our\r\n\r\npupil-teacher ratio. If we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintain  our  recruitment rate, we may be  able  to  improve\r\n\r\nthis,  but gradually over time.  I do not expect any dramatic\r\n\r\nor sudden changes to pupil-teacher ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Dr Jennifer Lee have raised the\r\n\r\nissue of teacher workload.  The Ministry recognises that  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives mean greater demands on the schools and teachers.\r\n\r\nOur teachers support these new initiatives as they feel these\r\n\r\nare  good  for the students.  Being dedicated teachers,  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  do  more  for their students.   Their  efforts  are\r\n\r\ncommendable.  However, while they have the students' interest\r\n\r\nat  heart,  school leadership and teachers need to prioritise\r\n\r\nin  order  to  focus  on  the key essentials,  so  that  both\r\n\r\nstudents  and  teachers  are not  overburdened.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nbalance  that  they  have to strike  and  in  single  session\r\n\r\nschools  where the schools are available for the  whole  day,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  great temptation to do more and more,  but  the\r\n\r\ncorrect balance has to be struck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to the selection and training of teachers. Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  Daipi  has  asked  about  the  selection  of  trainee\r\n\r\nteachers,  particularly  those  who  obtained  their  degrees\r\n\r\noverseas.   I  have already covered that just  now.   We  set\r\n\r\nstringent  criteria for the selection of teachers, regardless\r\n\r\nof  where  they  have obtained their qualifications,  whether\r\n\r\nlocal or overseas institutions.  Candidates are assessed  not\r\n\r\nonly on their records, but also their aptitude for teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua has suggested allowing students to pick\r\n\r\nand   choose   their  teachers.  Teaching  quality   is   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  a  function of popularity.  Nevertheless,  I  am\r\n\r\nopen.   Any school which wants to try it is free to go  ahead\r\n\r\nand do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With large numbers of new teachers joining the Education\r\n\r\nService,   teacher  training  has  taken  on   even   greater\r\n\r\nsignificance.   Over  the  past  two  years,  the   Ministry,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the National Institute of Education, has  made\r\n\r\nimportant changes to the teacher training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem to ensure that it remains aligned to the needs of  our\r\n\r\neducation system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of this is the framework for continual\r\n\r\nteacher  training  which NIE will be implementing  from  next\r\n\r\nyear to encourage serving teachers to continually update  and\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves.   To  complement  this  framework,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  continue to expand the scope of opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  serving teachers to pursue upgrading courses through its\r\n\r\nvarious study leave and professional development schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli has asked about sportsmen becoming teachers\r\n\r\nand  coaches.  We already have a number of teachers  who  are\r\n\r\nnational sportsmen. We have people like Lee Wung Yew, Mah  Li\r\n\r\nLian,  Melanie  Martens, and so on.  But  not  all  sportsmen\r\n\r\nwould  necessarily make good teachers nor even good  coaches.\r\n\r\nWe  have quite a number of sportsmen as coaches already.  And\r\n\r\nfor  those who are able to do so, we are, in fact, more  than\r\n\r\nhappy to have them for precisely the reasons that Mr Zulkifli\r\n\r\nhas mentioned.  They are good role models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group of teachers whom we will be providing greater\r\n\r\nupgrading  opportunities to are the  mother  tongue  language\r\n\r\nteachers.    I am pleased to inform Members that with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom   Academic   Year  2000/2001,  the  Ministry   will   be\r\n\r\nintroducing  a  new award to sponsor mother  tongue  language\r\n\r\nteachers  for full-time undergraduate studies in  the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  languages.  Under the award, teachers  will  be  paid\r\n\r\nsalaries  for up to two years while undergoing the  full-time\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The  award, which is tenable  both  locally  and\r\n\r\noverseas,  will  complement other improvements  made  to  the\r\n\r\nteaching   and  learning  of  the  mother  tongue   languages\r\n\r\nannounced  over  the  past year.  This will  be  particularly\r\n\r\nuseful to our Tamil language teachers. Because of the numbers\r\n\r\ninvolved,  I do not think it is practical to organise  degree\r\n\r\nlevel  programmes in Singapore. This is an  avenue  which  is\r\n\r\nopen  to  them which they can make use of. I do not have  the\r\n\r\nstatistics on the number of tertiary educated Tamil  language\r\n\r\nteachers. I can provide them to the Member later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked about opportunities for upgrading for\r\n\r\nMalay  language teachers. We have just introduced an  Honours\r\n\r\nprogramme in NIE for Malay language and I would like  to  see\r\n\r\nhow  this programme develops first before taking any  further\r\n\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked about Chinese language\r\n\r\nteachers.  The Ministry has been able to recruit about  60-70\r\n\r\nChinese language teachers per year for the secondary schools.\r\n\r\nThis  is  sufficient  to  meet the  needs  in  the  secondary\r\n\r\nschools.   We  do  recruit a small number  of  teachers  from\r\n\r\noverseas  and  they are subject to stringent criteria  before\r\n\r\nthey  are deployed to secondary schools.  They do go  through\r\n\r\nan  induction  programme before doing so  and  this  includes\r\n\r\nnational education and the Singapore education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in primary schools is different. There\r\n\r\nare  many  older  CL  teachers.  As these older  CL  teachers\r\n\r\nretire,  the  need to fill vacancies in the  primary  schools\r\n\r\nbecomes greater.  We have several measures to recruit as many\r\n\r\nSingaporean teachers as possible.  We have introduced the  4-year mother tongue language Diploma in Education. We have the\r\n\r\nPostgraduate  Diploma  in Education  to  provide  \"conversion\r\n\r\ntraining\"  for  graduates who did not  specialise  in  CL  at\r\n\r\nuniversity,  but  who  have good grades.  We  also  have  for\r\n\r\nretired Chinese language teachers to be re-employed to  teach\r\n\r\nChinese  language.  This scheme has been quite well-received.\r\n\r\nAs  at  end-January  this  year, about  100  retired  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage  teachers  have been re-employed under  the  scheme.\r\n\r\nThis will help to smooth out the retirement pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to meet the demand for Chinese language primary\r\n\r\nschool teachers using this multi-pronged approach.  If  there\r\n\r\nis  a need, we will recruit from overseas.  However, we would\r\n\r\nprefer  Singaporean Chinese language teachers in the  primary\r\n\r\nschools because the teaching of mother tongue language at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  primary  level  has  a  significant  element  of  values\r\n\r\ntransmission  which requires familiarity with our  own  local\r\n\r\nenvironment and social contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for upgrading opportunities for serving non-graduate\r\n\r\nChinese  language teachers, there are many avenues  open  for\r\n\r\nfull-time  and  part-time courses.  One  example  is  the  BA\r\n\r\ndegree  run by OUDP in collaboration with the Beijing  Normal\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Since its inception in 1999, I am told  a  total\r\n\r\nof 155 serving teachers have enrolled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to languages in the school. Why are we\r\n\r\nretraining English language teachers?  It is because we  felt\r\n\r\nthat  we  need to strengthen the teaching of English language\r\n\r\nin  schools  and to return to teaching a little more  grammar\r\n\r\nthan  we  were before. We did a re-evaluation as we  do  from\r\n\r\ntime  to time, and we felt this was necessary and so this  is\r\n\r\none  of the things we are doing for English language teachers\r\n\r\nin  school.   We  must  understand that from  time  to  time,\r\n\r\nteachers need to be retrained. So re-training of the teachers\r\n\r\nis  something  which should be expected and  normal,  and  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  welcomed  and  not seen  as  something  which  is\r\n\r\nfundamentally wrong with the education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Mr\r\n\r\nPeh  Chin Hua do not quite agree on the importance of  mother\r\n\r\ntongue languages in the school.  But a bilingual policy is in\r\n\r\nplace  and we need to have this bilingual policy for  reasons\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have  explained earlier.   English  is  a  unifying\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  is a language for international  communication\r\n\r\nand  business.  Mother tongue is for values transmission  and\r\n\r\nto have an understanding of our ethnicity and culture so that\r\n\r\nwe have a cultural ballast in this new globalised world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh feels that there is too much emphasis\r\n\r\non  mother tongue and streaming and so on.  The weighting  of\r\n\r\nthe four subjects at the PSLE has been adjusted over time and\r\n\r\ncurrently, it strikes a good balance between our various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjectives  that we have described, and there is no  need  to\r\n\r\nchange this. We do not intend to do so.  It is not true  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  many students channelled to the Normal stream  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  who are not doing well  in  their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue,  even  if  they have scored top marks  in  the  other\r\n\r\nsubjects. While there are students who score within  the  top\r\n\r\n30%  in  English, Mathematics and Science, but bottom 30%  in\r\n\r\nmother  tongue language in PSLE, none has been channelled  to\r\n\r\nthe Normal stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming at P4 is based on performance in English,\r\n\r\nMathematics   and  mother  tongue,  while  the  PSLE   counts\r\n\r\nperformance  in 4 subjects, only one of which is  the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  language.  As you go to secondary school, the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  language is in fact de-weighted because it is only  a\r\n\r\nthreshold  requirement to get D7 to go on to the next  level.\r\n\r\nWe have also  introduced the syllabus `B' for students facing\r\n\r\nexceptional difficulties so that they would continue to learn\r\n\r\ntheir mother tongue, get some cultural transmission, and  get\r\n\r\nsome foundation so that later on in life, if they do want  to\r\n\r\npick  it  up  again, they have some foundation. This  is  not\r\n\r\nmeant  for  the  general students but for  students  who  are\r\n\r\nfacing exceptional difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Iswaran for his comments on the\r\n\r\nvarious  mother tongue language reviews.  In  line  with  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations from these reviews, the Ministry is currently\r\n\r\nrevising    the    syllabuses,    instructional    materials,\r\n\r\nexamination  formats  and  so  on.   Mother  tongue  language\r\n\r\nteachers  in  all schools have been briefed on  the  changes.\r\n\r\nWorkshops  and  group discussions will also be organised.  We\r\n\r\nwill  see  how we can continue to include feedback  from  the\r\n\r\ncommunity as we implement these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Ibrahim Othman's query regarding\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are  eligible for the Malay language  elective\r\n\r\nprogramme, they are either within the top 10% in PSLE, or  in\r\n\r\nthe  top 11-30% who have done well and have scored either  an\r\n\r\n`A*'  in  Malay  language or a distinction  in  Higher  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage, and at least an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`A'  in  English  language so that they  can  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nheavier  study  load.  Likewise, those who  qualify  for  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language elective programme at the JC level must  have\r\n\r\nscored at least a B3 in Higher ML or an A2 in ML in their `O'\r\n\r\nlevel examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ibrahim has also asked whether the standard for A1 or\r\n\r\nA*  in Malay language in the `O' level examinations and other\r\n\r\nexaminations  is set too high.  The standards of  the  papers\r\n\r\nand  the marking are subject to careful control of difficulty\r\n\r\nlevel  and  to ensure consistency in marking. I  can  confirm\r\n\r\nthat it is not any more difficult for Malay students to score\r\n\r\nan `A1' or A* in Malay language in the `O' level examinations\r\n\r\nor  any  other examinations, than for Chinese students taking\r\n\r\nCL  and Indian students taking TL.  Our statistics bear  this\r\n\r\nout.   For  the EMAS programme, in fact, we are just starting\r\n\r\nit  up  in  Bukit Panjang and we will see how  this  develops\r\n\r\nbefore we take any further steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Mdm Claire Chiang have\r\n\r\nsuggested  again that MOE conduct non-examination courses  in\r\n\r\nMalay  language.  My position remains the same. We have heard\r\n\r\nviews of Members that studying two languages already is quite\r\n\r\na  load.   I  would let them persuade Mr Inderjit Singh  that\r\n\r\ndoing even more than that is good.  And we can leave it as an\r\n\r\noption  to those schools who think it is a good idea for  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to  do it on an enrichment basis.  But  I  have  no\r\n\r\nintention  of  making  it compulsory.  Mr  Ibrahim  suggested\r\n\r\nallowing  top  Malay students to take Chinese. I  will  think\r\n\r\nabout  it and see whether that is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said in this House last week, I would provide\r\n\r\nsome flexibility to the schools to decide on how to implement\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  programmes and not  mandate  them,  as  some\r\n\r\nMembers have suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nsays  that the quality of teachers is most important.
