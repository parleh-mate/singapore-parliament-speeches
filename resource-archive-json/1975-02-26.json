In  the  contents  of  the   education\r\n\r\nprogramme  we  should stress on the  strengthening\r\n\r\nand  inculcation of an ethical concept  so  as  to\r\n\r\nenable  our  younger generation to be law-abiding.\r\n\r\nThe  teachers and the authorities concerned should\r\n\r\nrevise the textbooks by doing away with unsuitable\r\n\r\ncontents and replacing them with relevant contents\r\n\r\nwhich will add to the moral sense of the children.\r\n\r\nAs the Addendum on the Ministry of Education deals\r\n\r\nwith   the  publication  of  textbooks  and  other\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  I  hope my suggestion will  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is pointed out in the Addendum on the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Foreign  Affairs  that  we  need  to\r\n\r\ncooperate  with our neighbours. Our  participation\r\n\r\nin  ASEAN activities is beneficial to countries in\r\n\r\nthis  region because it contributes to the  peace,\r\n\r\nprosperity  and order of this region. This  is  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with  our foreign policy of  making  more\r\n\r\nfriends  and fewer enemies, and it also  maintains\r\n\r\nour  good  relations with peoples  throughout  the\r\n\r\nworld.  In order to ensure our long term interests\r\n\r\nand  survival, our people must learn  to  co-exist\r\n\r\nwith our neighbours. In this respect, besides  the\r\n\r\nofficial government contacts, we can also keep  in\r\n\r\ntouch with our neighbours through trade, commerce,\r\n\r\nculture  and other exchanges in order  to  promote\r\n\r\nmutual interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is mentioned in the Addendum on the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  that  a  new  Bill  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced to amend the Workmen's Compensation Act\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  amount of compensation  to  the\r\n\r\ninjured worker, and that payment will be made more\r\n\r\nspeedily.  In a fatal case, the compensation  will\r\n\r\nbe  raised from $21,600 to $35,000 and in the case\r\n\r\nof  a  worker  who  is  disabled  permanently  the\r\n\r\ncompensation will be raised from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$28,800 to $45,000. Sir, this is no doubt  a  very\r\n\r\nreasonable  figure of compensation for the  family\r\n\r\nof  the  victim.  It  is  a  clear  indication  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  concern  for  the  welfare  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  their families.  But  what  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant is to safeguard the lives and welfare of\r\n\r\nthe   workers  because  they  contribute  to   the\r\n\r\nprogress of our national economy. In view  of  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of industrial  accidents,  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Department  will  have  to  tighten   its\r\n\r\nsupervision over the safety of the workers and  to\r\n\r\nrequest   employers  to  abide   by   all   safety\r\n\r\nregulations. The workers themselves should also be\r\n\r\nsafety-conscious   and  play  their   part.   With\r\n\r\ntripartite  cooperation, we will then be  able  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the number of industrial accidents to  the\r\n\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Ministry of Culture, I would say that\r\n\r\ncultural and art activities are very important  in\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  of  cultural  development  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  In  the past year we have  had  quite  an\r\n\r\nactive  programme of cultural and art  activities.\r\n\r\nConsidering  the  fact that tickets  for  cultural\r\n\r\nperformances at the Victoria Theatre were  usually\r\n\r\nsold  out,  we can judge the popularity  of  these\r\n\r\nperformances, which included dramas, concerts  and\r\n\r\nplays in the vernacular. All these speak well  for\r\n\r\nthe   development   of  our   cultural   and   art\r\n\r\nactivities.  With  the concerted  efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture, the people and the  artistes\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  will be able to  promote  creative\r\n\r\narts  and  cultural  forms.  In  this  way,  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that we will be able to instill  in  our\r\n\r\npeople a better sense of culture and art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the standard of our medical service has all\r\n\r\nalong  been  maintained at a very high level.  Our\r\n\r\nmedical  service  has  made  a  good  contribution\r\n\r\ntowards the health care of our people. In addition\r\n\r\nto   the   purchase   of  modern   equipment   and\r\n\r\nparaphernalia, the Government has also taken steps\r\n\r\nto increase and to train medical personnel to look\r\n\r\nafter  our  sick. Today, our people  are  able  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  healthy  life and they  must  thank  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned for the services  provided.\r\n\r\nThe Ministries of Defence,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation and Health have the largest share of the\r\n\r\nbudget  expenditure, but it is well worth spending\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is related to the people's  security,\r\n\r\nknowledge  and health. However, I am perturbed  by\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion to increase the outpatient medical\r\n\r\ncharges, because it is the poor people who  go  to\r\n\r\nthe Government clinics or hospitals for treatment.\r\n\r\nSo  it  will have a very hard effect on the  poor,\r\n\r\nbecause  the additional charge of $2  or  $3  will\r\n\r\nincrease  their burden. I would like to appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  not to increase the  charges  for\r\n\r\noutpatient treatment and Third Class Ward charges,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  burden  of the  poor  will  not  be\r\n\r\naggravated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past the Community Security Force has\r\n\r\nplayed their role very well in the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nsecurity,  peace  and  order  in  various   areas,\r\n\r\nincluding   Housing  Board  estates.   They   have\r\n\r\ncontributed much to the efforts of the police  and\r\n\r\nthe security force. This security measure will not\r\n\r\nonly  train  our younger people in the cultivation\r\n\r\nof  a  sense of security but it will also  promote\r\n\r\ngood  relationship between the Community  Security\r\n\r\nForce and the people. We hope that in future  they\r\n\r\nwill be able to provide a greater contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe security of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have studied the Addendum on 13 Ministries\r\n\r\nbut I have not been able to find a single item  on\r\n\r\npublic construction in the rural areas. I am  very\r\n\r\nmuch   perturbed  by  this.  In  the   past,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has allotted large sums of  money  for\r\n\r\npublic  construction and development in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  such  as  the provision of drains,  street\r\n\r\nlights, the construction of roads, electricity for\r\n\r\nhomes  and the betterment of the rural environment\r\n\r\nor  the  rural dwellers. Although a great part  of\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  have been improved,  there  are\r\n\r\nstilt many areas which need improvement. There are\r\n\r\nstill some kampongs which lack water supply,  good\r\n\r\nroads and other facilities. As a representative of\r\n\r\na  rural  constituency, I would like to speak  for\r\n\r\nthese   people.   I  appeal  to  the   authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned to continue to allocate large\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsums  of  money to remedy the ills  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  by  the  provision of public utilities  and\r\n\r\nother facilities so that the rural people will  he\r\n\r\nvery grateful for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are happy to note that although the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been paying attention to  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   national   construction   and   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of means of livelihood for the  people,\r\n\r\nyet it has not neglected the recreational needs of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  According to  the  Addendum  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  the  Government  has  undertaken  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a 300-acre site along the Tanjong Rhu  and\r\n\r\nBedok  sea coast. This area will be developed  not\r\n\r\nonly  as a holiday resort for our people but  also\r\n\r\nas  a  tourist resort. Various kinds of  amenities\r\n\r\nwill be provided there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on other matters, 1 am glad to note\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  of Social Affairs  will  take\r\n\r\naction to curb the unreasonable and high rates  of\r\n\r\ninterest  charged by the moneylenders in order  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the interest of the poorer people.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development will also  build\r\n\r\ncondominium housing in order to meet the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  middle-class  people. The  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs will have full-time national servicemen in\r\n\r\nthe  Police Force. The increased manpower  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force will curb the increasing  number  of\r\n\r\ncrimes  and it will also help to maintain law  and\r\n\r\norder   more  effectively.  On  the  question   of\r\n\r\nhawkers'  livelihood, the Government will  set  up\r\n\r\nmore  hawker centres in the coming years to  house\r\n\r\nthe   temporary   hawker  licence   holders.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to improve the environment  of\r\n\r\nthe  people by reducing all kinds of pollution and\r\n\r\nraising the standard of public hygiene. All  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  will show that the Government is  taking\r\n\r\nall the necessary steps to try its best to promote\r\n\r\nthe  interest and livelihood of the people.  In  a\r\n\r\nreview of the performance of our economy over  the\r\n\r\nlast  year,  the  President  has  said  that   our\r\n\r\neconomic growth was about 7%.In the wake of world-wide  recession and inflation, our achievement  is\r\n\r\nreally  laudable. As the President has said,  this\r\n\r\nhas all been due to the self-discipline,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiligence,  frugality and the spirit of enterprise\r\n\r\nof  our  people. In the coming years  we  will  be\r\n\r\nfaced   with  possibly  even  greater  challenges.\r\n\r\nHowever,    with    the   effort,   determination,\r\n\r\ncapability   and  the  wisdom  of  the  Government\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the diligence,  effort  and  self-discipline of our people, I am confident  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  overcome all difficulties  and\r\n\r\nachieve  all  the  various  beneficial  programmes\r\n\r\ntowards nation building in a more glorious way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I join my colleagues in\r\n\r\nthanking the President for his policy statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the old saying, every cloud has a silver\r\n\r\nlining,  he  has  forecast that our  economy  will\r\n\r\nprobably do better in the second half of 1975 than\r\n\r\nin  the first half. This is a welcome forecast and\r\n\r\nI  have  no  doubt that given the proper planning,\r\n\r\nguidance  and leadership Singaporeans will  strive\r\n\r\ntowards  making  the  best of even  the  deepening\r\n\r\nrecessionary period that we are facing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister himself has cautioned\r\n\r\nthe  over-reactive Singaporeans to  any  situation\r\n\r\nand  the  Deputy  Prime Minister has  also  warned\r\n\r\nagainst   over-worrying  and  guessing  when   the\r\n\r\nrecession  would end. In spite of the  possibility\r\n\r\nof  an  improved economic situation in the  second\r\n\r\nhalf   of   this  year,  we  must  guard   against\r\n\r\ncomplacency  and its other extreme, panic  of  any\r\n\r\nkind.  Even  in the past year, although  our  real\r\n\r\ngrowth  has  been only around 7%, we were  not  so\r\n\r\nbadly  off  as many other developing countries  in\r\n\r\nview of our sound currency, favourable balance  of\r\n\r\npayments,  sound industrial relations  system  and\r\n\r\nthe climate of social and political stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President confidently stated that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans being relatively young will adjust to\r\n\r\nslower growth rates. I certainly hope they do.  My\r\n\r\nfear  is  that a large number of our young workers\r\n\r\nhave  come into the labour market after  1968  and\r\n\r\nthey have tasted rapid economic boom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  have  taken  the  higher  growth  rate  we\r\n\r\nenjoyed for granted. It is incumbent upon  all  of\r\n\r\nus to stress the virtue of hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the end of January this year, about 18,000\r\n\r\npeople have been retrenched in Singapore. This  is\r\n\r\nabout  2%  of our total work-force. The slackening\r\n\r\nof  demand  for the products of existing factories\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  as a result of the world  economic\r\n\r\nsituation,  was  the main factor that  caused  the\r\n\r\nclosure  of  a large number of establishments  and\r\n\r\ncutting   down  on  the  labour  force  of   other\r\n\r\nestablishments.  Hardest hit among  the  factories\r\n\r\nwhich  had  to  reduce their work-force  were  the\r\n\r\nelectronics,   plywood  and  textile   industries.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  the retrenchment situation  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  manifestly felt until recently because about\r\n\r\n79%  of the workers who lost their jobs were women\r\n\r\nand  young girls who were apparently not the  sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinners of their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour  has set up a special retrenchment unit  to\r\n\r\nassist  retrenched  workers  to  seek  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment. Although it was known earlier that the\r\n\r\nretrenched workers responded very poorly  for  job\r\n\r\nplacements, things have now changed. In the  early\r\n\r\ndays  of  retrenchment, the vast majority  of  the\r\n\r\nretrenched girls were perhaps depending  on  their\r\n\r\nsavings or expecting better jobs because they were\r\n\r\nnot  the  sole breadwinners of their families.  In\r\n\r\nrecent  months, more and more of these  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  have  come to Members of  Parliament  for\r\n\r\nassistance   in  employment.  This  is   a   clear\r\n\r\nindication  of  the tightening labour  market  and\r\n\r\njobs  becoming  scarcer as a  result  of  mounting\r\n\r\nretrenchments  in the light of world  recessionary\r\n\r\ntrends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must in a concerted manner take steps to\r\n\r\nprevent  or  minimise the impact of  retrenchment.\r\n\r\nThese  measures are effected within the  framework\r\n\r\nof   a   rational   economic   analysis   of   the\r\n\r\nretrenchment    situation    within     tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship   of   active   cooperation   between\r\n\r\nGovernment,  trade  unions  and  employers,   with\r\n\r\nspecial emphasis placed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  increasing  productivity through  adoption  by\r\n\r\nmanagement  of new productivity techniques,  skill\r\n\r\nacquisition by workers and preference given to job\r\n\r\ndeployment and part-time work as against  complete\r\n\r\nretrenchments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore employers whose industries are hit by\r\n\r\neconomic   recession  should   be   required,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary  by  legislation,  to  give  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  and the trade unions advance  notice  of\r\n\r\nany  impending retrenchment exercise. I  am  aware\r\n\r\nthat   the   Labour  Ministry  has   advised   the\r\n\r\nindustries to do so. But I am doubtful as  to  how\r\n\r\nmany  employers are complying with  this  request.\r\n\r\nThey  should provide the Ministry with a  list  of\r\n\r\nworkers to be retrenched and the reasons for their\r\n\r\naction.  This  would  enable the  Labour  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials,  if  necessary with  the  help  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board, to advise them on  how\r\n\r\nbest to tackle the various problems involved. This\r\n\r\nalso  helps  the  Ministry to monitor  the  labour\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is fortunate in that there is no\r\n\r\ndominant  sector  in our economy  which  generates\r\n\r\nmost  of  our  Gross National Product or  provides\r\n\r\nmost jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have industries and multinational corporations\r\n\r\nfrom all corners of the globe. In other words,  as\r\n\r\nit  has  often been said, we do not have  all  our\r\n\r\neggs  in  one  basket.  Such  diversification   is\r\n\r\ncertainly   Singapore's  hope  and  mainstay   for\r\n\r\neconomic  survival,  for while certain  industries\r\n\r\nare  badly  hit, such as electronics, plywood  and\r\n\r\ntextiles, other industries like tourism and  ship-repairing continue to expand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Labour stresses\r\n\r\nthe  need  for \"discipline, hard work,  efficiency\r\n\r\nand  skill of our workers, and the enterprise  and\r\n\r\ninnovation of our entrepreneurs.\" This has  always\r\n\r\nbeen  the  NTUC  philosophy. In fact,  to  further\r\n\r\nemphasise  it,  the  NTUC has  instituted  certain\r\n\r\nchanges in its own set-up so that broad principles\r\n\r\nfor  its  affiliates can be drawn up. One  of  the\r\n\r\nimportant  aspects of this change is the education\r\n\r\nof  trade  union officials as well as members.  In\r\n\r\nthis  context,  we  will  have  to  decry  certain\r\n\r\nemployers who begrudge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   granting  of  paid  educational  leave   to\r\n\r\nworkers.  Such employers are antisocial  as  these\r\n\r\nworkers'  educational courses  have  a  pronounced\r\n\r\nsocial  value  and  orientation emphasising  basic\r\n\r\neconomics,   means   and   methods    of    higher\r\n\r\nproductivity and tripartitism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also welcome the initiative of the National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Board  in  convening  the   National\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Committee  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nissue of productivity and wages. The NTUC which is\r\n\r\nrepresented in this Committee is on public  record\r\n\r\nas being in full support of the twin objectives of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee to increase productivity and wages,\r\n\r\nbut  the difficulties of this Committee should not\r\n\r\nbe  minimised.  The  past record  of  attempts  to\r\n\r\nestablish productivity councils under the old name\r\n\r\nof works council is dismal indeed and if we are to\r\n\r\nmake   a  success  of  them  this  time  -a  vital\r\n\r\nnecessity if Singapore is to progress and  prosper\r\n\r\non the industrial front\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-  both  management and labour must discard  their\r\n\r\nold  prejudices.  Both  sides  must  approach  the\r\n\r\nproblems with a positive determination to work out\r\n\r\na just and equal solution in which the key issues,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  increasing productivity  and  equitable\r\n\r\nrewards  for greater inputs are exactly  balanced.\r\n\r\nNothing is more certain than that if the Committee\r\n\r\nproduces   a   solution  which   ensures   greater\r\n\r\nproductivity and neglects to see that the workers,\r\n\r\nwhose   additional  efforts  that  generate   this\r\n\r\nincreased    productivity   are   not   adequately\r\n\r\nremunerated,  the  whole effort will  collapse  in\r\n\r\nfuture as have previous efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another welcome feature of the Addendum on the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour is the decision to set  up  an\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Division. I do not  know  if\r\n\r\nthis  would  be  an extension of the  Conciliation\r\n\r\nSection, or a supplement to it, or if it is  going\r\n\r\nto be a separate division. It is praiseworthy that\r\n\r\nthey  intend obtaining high level staff.  I,  too,\r\n\r\nhappen to be in the same business of looking  for,\r\n\r\nif  not  high level, suitable industrial relations\r\n\r\nstaff  for  our requirements in the  NTUC.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure   the  Ministry  that  they  are  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult to come by. Even if we recruit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome,  the  promising as well  as  a  few  of  the\r\n\r\nmediocres  are grabbed by management.  Apparently,\r\n\r\ntheir  need  is  greater than ours  and  they  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to pay for their needs. I would  like  to\r\n\r\ncaution  the  Ministry, however,  that  recruiting\r\n\r\nstaff for the Industrial Relations Division is one\r\n\r\nthing,  but recruiting the right calibre of staff,\r\n\r\nwho   must   not  only  gain  the  confidence   of\r\n\r\nmanagement,  but also of labour is  necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe  success of the Industrial Relations Division.\r\n\r\nGaining the confidence of one party at the expense\r\n\r\nof the other is bound to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC's call for the inclusion of industrial\r\n\r\ndermatitis and noise-induced deafness to the  list\r\n\r\nof   compensable  diseases  under  the   Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Act was made as early as 1972. We are\r\n\r\ngrateful that the Ministry of Labour has  at  last\r\n\r\nfound  the  soundness of this request and  has  so\r\n\r\nlisted. In the industrial safety and health field,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour is very actively  pursuing\r\n\r\npolicies  of inspection and enforcement. In  spite\r\n\r\nof  the  inadequacy  of sufficiently  well-trained\r\n\r\nofficers, the Ministry of Labour is doing  a  good\r\n\r\njob.  This  division has got to be  congratulated.\r\n\r\nOur  industrial  safety and health  standards  are\r\n\r\nreasonably  high in comparison with  that  of  the\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries despite the recent  accidents\r\n\r\nin   building   construction  and   ship-repairing\r\n\r\nfields.   However,  inspection   and   enforcement\r\n\r\nofficials should be ever vigilant and mindful that\r\n\r\nour  action  does  not in any way  result  in  the\r\n\r\nstifling  of the competitive edge we have  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprenticeship schemes for children between the\r\n\r\nages of 12 and 14 years and allowing young persons\r\n\r\nbetween  14  and  16  years  of  age  to  work  in\r\n\r\nindustrial  establishments would  help  those  who\r\n\r\nleave  school at an early age for some  reason  or\r\n\r\nother.   However,  proper  apprenticeship  schemes\r\n\r\nshould  be drawn up and inspection of such schemes\r\n\r\nwould   be   necessary   to   prevent   abuse   of\r\n\r\napprenticeship trainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make a few comments now on the Addendum on\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Health.  Looking  through  the\r\n\r\ncomprehensive Addendum, it says so much about  our\r\n\r\npopulation policy, hospital\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment, disease patterns, etc.,  but  nothing\r\n\r\nabout  recruitment of doctors, specialists,  etc.,\r\n\r\nand  most important of all the retention of  these\r\n\r\nspecialists.  We cannot just write-off  the  whole\r\n\r\nepisode  by  just  saying  that  doctors  are  not\r\n\r\ndedicated.  There  is  definitely  more  money  in\r\n\r\nprivate  practice.  It appears  as  if  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals  train  doctors in the  early  years  of\r\n\r\ntheir career for the private sector. Although this\r\n\r\nmay not necessarily be a bad thing, the Government\r\n\r\nshould be in a position to retain some experienced\r\n\r\ndoctors  and specialists for its own  use  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  hospitals.  Perhaps  a  commission  of\r\n\r\ninquiry like the Police Services Commission should\r\n\r\nbe  set  up  to  resolve  the  situation.  Such  a\r\n\r\ncommission  would indicate the areas of discontent\r\n\r\namong our medical officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that growing numbers of\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans have come to regard career  in\r\n\r\nthe  Armed Forces rewarding and respected.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  with  pride that we can state  categorically\r\n\r\nthat  we are now embarked on a qualitative instead\r\n\r\nof  quantitative defence capacity. However,  there\r\n\r\nis  one  aspect in which the Ministry  of  Defence\r\n\r\nshould direct its planning with a little more care\r\n\r\nthan now, i.e, the in-camp training for discharged\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen. It has been  brought  to  my\r\n\r\nnotice that a few ex-national servicemen have been\r\n\r\ncalled up for full-time in-camp training twice  in\r\n\r\na  year;  each  training lasted for more  than  20\r\n\r\ndays. Particularly in respect of officers who  are\r\n\r\nengaged  in  executive  positions  in  government,\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  and  the private  sector,  this\r\n\r\nplaces a strain on the employers as well as on the\r\n\r\nofficers.  This also disrupts, in some  instances,\r\n\r\nimportant work that the officers are performing in\r\n\r\ntheir place of work. I am sure some device can  be\r\n\r\nformulated  so that they are only called  up  from\r\n\r\ntheir  place  of work once a year or this  in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining given during the weekends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the Ministry of Home Affairs is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  organise more campaigns in  the  coming\r\n\r\nyears.   Like   the  hon.  Member  for   Henderson\r\n\r\nmentioned yesterday, well planned and spaced-out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncampaigns have their educational effectiveness. If\r\n\r\nI  remember correctly, last year the Ministries of\r\n\r\nHealth  and Home Affairs organised the most number\r\n\r\nof  campaigns. If we are not careful, one of these\r\n\r\ndays,  some  hon.  Members  of  this  House  might\r\n\r\norganise  a campaign against all campaigns!  Those\r\n\r\nMembers  who  are  organising campaigns  for  next\r\n\r\nyear, please note this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While congratulating the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  on  the  record number of 26,000  units  of\r\n\r\nflats  built  last  year, I  would  also  like  to\r\n\r\ncomment  on the qualitative aspect of its  housing\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  I strongly believe that  with  proper\r\n\r\nand  vigilant  supervision  quality  need  not  be\r\n\r\nsacrificed for quantity. In recent months, I have,\r\n\r\non  behalf  of the Housing and Development  Board,\r\n\r\nballoted  for thousands of flats in Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nand  I  have received just as many complaints.  It\r\n\r\nappears as if the Housing Board takes over  blocks\r\n\r\nof   flats   from  the  contractors  without   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  full  inspection of the flats,  ballots\r\n\r\nthem  off  and  hands keys over to the  respective\r\n\r\ntenants  or flat-owners. Trouble starts from  then\r\n\r\non.  Complaints of leaking sewerage  pipes,  doors\r\n\r\nand  windows which are either jammed or unable  to\r\n\r\nbe   locked,   floors  that  are   as   rough   as\r\n\r\nunmaintained rural roads, pour in. The  complaints\r\n\r\npour  in  as  fast as the flats are  let  out.  It\r\n\r\nsometimes takes months for the Board to attend  to\r\n\r\nthese complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, my friend the Honourable Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education is not here and if he were here,  he\r\n\r\nwould be terribly disappointed if I do not comment\r\n\r\non   the   Ministry  of  Education,  my  favourite\r\n\r\nMinistry. The policy and the content of changes in\r\n\r\nour  Education system has been far too many. While\r\n\r\nreserving the details for the Budget Debate, may I\r\n\r\njust  make  a few general comments with regard  to\r\n\r\nthese changes, past and present. Let me start with\r\n\r\nHistory.  The hon. Member for Ulu Pandan mentioned\r\n\r\nyesterday  of  the importance of  History  in  the\r\n\r\nschool curriculum. I will only mention the changes\r\n\r\nin our Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  with regard to History. Once, Sir, just  a\r\n\r\nfew  years  ago, we taught History in primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools in the first language. Recently,\r\n\r\nwe  taught History in the second language. The new\r\n\r\npolicy is \"History in no language\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently too, the second language exposure\r\n\r\ntime was increased. Even more recently, principals\r\n\r\nwere  told  that  they can be flexible  about  the\r\n\r\nexposure  time  depending upon  language  teachers\r\n\r\navailable. Yet another change, mind you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, at the end of primary school,\r\n\r\nchildren were graded into academic, technical  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  streams  and  later,  practically  all\r\n\r\nsecondary  one and two pupils were made to  attend\r\n\r\ntwo   years  of  workshop  practice  after   which\r\n\r\nstreaming  would take place. Now,  again,  we  are\r\n\r\ntold  that streaming is going to be at the end  of\r\n\r\ntheir primary school career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> That is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Well, I will wait for the\r\n\r\nreply at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few years ago, emphasis and more emphasis\r\n\r\nwas  placed on extracurricular activities.  Inter-District Meets of all kinds were encouraged.  More\r\n\r\nrecently, there have been directives for reduction\r\n\r\nof ECA activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary education is to be extended to seven\r\n\r\nyears  with provision for some pupils to  complete\r\n\r\nit  in  six years. Schools were told that  grading\r\n\r\nfor six-year or seven-year primary education is to\r\n\r\nbe  made at primary three level. A proper guidance\r\n\r\nin  this regard is yet to be given.

I  am\r\n\r\nsure  everyone of us will fully endorse  the  view\r\n\r\nexpressed by the President that it is the  primary\r\n\r\nduty   of   government  to  establish  an   equal-opportunity society, where everyone has  an  equal\r\n\r\nchance  to live, learn, work and play to the  best\r\n\r\nof his or her capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to comment on a few\r\n\r\nissues  relating  to  the  implementation  process\r\n\r\nwithin government machinery. Firstly, however well-intentioned   government  may   be   and   however\r\n\r\nmeaningful the policies formulated, they will mean\r\n\r\nvery  little,  unless they can be implemented,  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the objectives and the impact,  that  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  wants. In this regard, I  support  the\r\n\r\nviews expressed by the hon. Member for Jalan  Kayu\r\n\r\nyesterday  -that the Government should  look  into\r\n\r\nthe  various  systems under which it now  operates\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to  achieving better  co-ordination\r\n\r\nbetween   Government   departments,   and   better\r\n\r\ncommunication   and  interaction   between   civil\r\n\r\nservants  and  the  public they serve.  Sending  a\r\n\r\nletter,  particularly a badly worded or a strongly\r\n\r\nworded   one,  to  a  member  of  the  public   is\r\n\r\ncommunication  at  its lowest  level.  Interaction\r\n\r\nimplies  that  the reason for the letter  is  made\r\n\r\nknown to the reader, and the governmental policies\r\n\r\nbehind it explained, in polite and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear tones. As I see it, there is need in certain\r\n\r\nareas,  for better co-ordination, while in  others\r\n\r\nthere  is  a need for decentralisation. Procedures\r\n\r\nand  mechanisms which have stood us in good  stead\r\n\r\nin  the  past  may  now require  modification  and\r\n\r\nrevamping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1980's, if everything goes on well in the\r\n\r\nAsian and Pacific region, Singapore will be in the\r\n\r\nbeginnings  of  the technological  era.  The  main\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  our society will revolve  not  only\r\n\r\naround  the  production of goods  alone  but  also\r\n\r\naround the difficulties and opportunities involved\r\n\r\nin  a  Singapore of accelerating changes and ever-widening options. While it is true that change has\r\n\r\nalways  been  a  characteristic of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nenvironment, in the eighties, the pace  of  change\r\n\r\nwill  come much faster and will affect every facet\r\n\r\nof  life,  from  personal values to education  and\r\n\r\nlife styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore glad to note that special\r\n\r\nattention will be given to caring for the old, the\r\n\r\nhandicapped and the youths. In the past, and quite\r\n\r\nrightly  too,  the  Government  has  focused   its\r\n\r\nattention  on the productive side of  the  economy\r\n\r\nsuch as jobs, tourism, income, and industries.  In\r\n\r\nso  doing,  it may not have done as much  for  the\r\n\r\nyoung,  the old, and the handicapped as  it  would\r\n\r\nlike  to.  As  a  Government  which  has  achieved\r\n\r\nconsiderable success in developing the economy and\r\n\r\nredistributing  the economic cake  to  workers,  I\r\n\r\nwould  think it is time now for the Government  to\r\n\r\npay  more attention to the less exciting but  more\r\n\r\nhuman  and  social  aspects of development.  After\r\n\r\nall,  the  aged and the handicapped are  also  our\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is satisfying to note that the Education\r\n\r\nsystem  will be restructured to meet the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  times and the educational facilities expanded\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  needs of  our  population.  We\r\n\r\nshould  also remember that teachers play  a  vital\r\n\r\nrole  in shaping the attitudes and the life-styles\r\n\r\nof  our  youths. I would urge for a more objective\r\n\r\nand  effective system to reward and  motivate  the\r\n\r\nteaching  profession. On the other hand, we  would\r\n\r\nalso need to evolve a system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto identify and penalise the few black sheep. I am\r\n\r\npersuaded  to  think  that the  various  teachers'\r\n\r\nassociations and unions may be well-placed  to  do\r\n\r\nthis  to  seek out these few who tarnish the  good\r\n\r\nname  of  the  teaching profession. This  need  to\r\n\r\nidentify and penalise the black sheep should  also\r\n\r\napply  to  other sectors, for example,  the  Armed\r\n\r\nForces. Human nature being what it is, much public\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding and ill-feeling  can  result  if,\r\n\r\nunder the guise of discipline, harsh penalties and\r\n\r\nlabour  are  meted  out  to  national  servicemen,\r\n\r\nusually by an irresponsible few. More efforts must\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  made to minimise such incidents  to\r\n\r\npreserve the good image of our army. Trade  unions\r\n\r\nshould  also  see  to  it that  irresponsible  and\r\n\r\nmischievous  elements amongst  their  members  are\r\n\r\nweeded out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we have developed very fast. It\r\n\r\nis also true that we may have achieved in 16 years\r\n\r\nwhat it may take some other countries a century to\r\n\r\nattain.  At  such  a  rapid rate  of  development,\r\n\r\nproblems will most certainly loom. Already, we are\r\n\r\nexperiencing a shortage of skilled and experienced\r\n\r\nmanpower  in  certain sectors which  can  only  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped with time. The Government should try  to\r\n\r\nminimise  these problems and not merely shrug  its\r\n\r\nshoulders in a \"can't-be-helped\" attitude or \"What\r\n\r\nto  do?  The  system is such?\"  attitude.  Let  us\r\n\r\nrecognise   and   drive  home   the   point   that\r\n\r\nindividuals are responsible for their  actions  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  inactions.  The Government  should  take\r\n\r\ncognizance  of  this  lest,  in  the  process   of\r\n\r\naccepting certain systems and not daring  to  make\r\n\r\nchanges,  it may produce demigods among the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  and  cause frustration to many  whom  the\r\n\r\nservice is supposed to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, what is most important is\r\n\r\nfor   the   Government  policies  to  be   lucidly\r\n\r\nexplained  to  the public by those  who  implement\r\n\r\nthem.  Our  people  must know and  understand  the\r\n\r\nproblems of development, so that they can learn to\r\n\r\naccept  the  things they cannot change;  have  the\r\n\r\ncourage to change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  they can change; and above all, possess  the\r\n\r\nwisdom  to  know the difference. This  wisdom  can\r\n\r\nonly be developed through better communication and\r\n\r\neducation.  The Government can and should  take  a\r\n\r\nleading role in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  associate  myself  with  the  sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  by the Member for Kim Keat in  thanking\r\n\r\nthe President for his speech at the opening of the\r\n\r\nThird Parliament on 21st February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has had to face a number of crises over\r\n\r\nthe  past  decade,  both  internal  and  external.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Government has been constantly on the\r\n\r\nalert   and   was  able  therefore  to   draw   up\r\n\r\nalternative  plans well in advance.  The  Republic\r\n\r\nhas consequently managed to weather the storm. The\r\n\r\ndetermination  and willingness of  our  people  to\r\n\r\nmake    adjustments   to   new   situations   also\r\n\r\ncontributed  in  this  effort.  In  fact,  it  was\r\n\r\npossible for Singapore not only to survive but  to\r\n\r\nprosper as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most people, including well-known\r\n\r\neconomists, predicted that 1975 would be a year of\r\n\r\neconomic  recession which could bring in its  wake\r\n\r\nvery  difficult situations, things appear to  have\r\n\r\nlevelled  off,  at least for the time  being,  and\r\n\r\nthere is every hope that with a certain amount  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice, determination and careful planning,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to surmount the more recent crisis.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is imperative  that\r\n\r\nwe ensure that none of our resources is wasted and\r\n\r\nthat  government  spending will help  bring  about\r\n\r\nmaximum returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I would like to refer to one\r\n\r\nitem  which  I feel has not been given  sufficient\r\n\r\nattention.  The Government, I understand,  intends\r\n\r\nto spend a large sum of money to recruit and train\r\n\r\napprentices,  to boost the supply of  skilled  and\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled personnel for our industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that vocational schools\r\n\r\ndo not provide the entire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining required for apprentices. The training at\r\n\r\nvocational schools cannot be as effective as  that\r\n\r\ngiven  to  apprentices  in factories.  There  they\r\n\r\nreceive  or the job training which, in due course,\r\n\r\nwill  enable them to do the actual work  they  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  do. Although workshop  practice  and\r\n\r\ntheory   will  undoubtedly  provide   some   basic\r\n\r\ntraining, it is the practical application of  this\r\n\r\nlearning-in-industry which is most important,  and\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of  training can only be  acquired  by\r\n\r\nsolid work experience in factories. If we leave it\r\n\r\nsolely  to vocational schools to train our  future\r\n\r\ntechnicians, there will be a time lag  of  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  years  before  these  technicians  can   be\r\n\r\nefficient  in  the work that they will  eventually\r\n\r\nhave to do in the factories, the workshops and  so\r\n\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would respectfully submit, therefore, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that Government should evolve  more\r\n\r\ntraining schemes for apprentices in factories  and\r\n\r\nutilise  funds for these training schemes  instead\r\n\r\nof  spending  more  money in  building  vocational\r\n\r\nschools.  I feel sure that industry would  welcome\r\n\r\nthis  move,  for  although  many  industries   are\r\n\r\nwilling   to  train  apprentices,  training   also\r\n\r\nconsumes the employer's time and money. Perhaps  a\r\n\r\nscheme could be worked out whereby the apprentices\r\n\r\nreceive  simultaneous on-the-job training  in  the\r\n\r\nfactories  as well as instruction in the  existing\r\n\r\nvocational  schools. This, Mr Speaker, Sir,  would\r\n\r\nappear  to  be  a more practical approach  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering training schemes, with joint\r\n\r\nparticipation from industry, provision  should  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  disallow apprentices from joining  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  because they are trainees, and  as  such,\r\n\r\nare  students. There appears to be no valid reason\r\n\r\nwhy   students   should  join  trade   unions   of\r\n\r\nemployees.  If the apprentices join  in,  one  can\r\n\r\nappreciate  the employer's reluctance to  take  on\r\n\r\napprentices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation's proposals for the coming year, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to draw the attention of this House  to  the\r\n\r\nproblems that are being created and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nirritation that is being felt by local students\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the University's policy  to  give\r\n\r\nforeign  students their share of accommodation  in\r\n\r\nthe  hostels, ignoring the requirements of our own\r\n\r\nstudents.  This is not to say that I am advocating\r\n\r\nthe  total  ban  on  accommodation  at  University\r\n\r\nhostels  for  overseas students. On the  contrary,\r\n\r\nthey  are most welcome, in principle, for it is  a\r\n\r\ngood  thing for our students to live and mix  with\r\n\r\nstudents   from  other  countries.   It   promotes\r\n\r\nunderstanding,  tolerance  and   a   widening   of\r\n\r\nhorizons.   However,  I  feel   that   a   correct\r\n\r\nproportion  must be maintained for  many  reasons.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I need only mention two. One is that if  a\r\n\r\nlarge proportion of our students are unable to get\r\n\r\naccommodation, they are bound to feel  disgruntled\r\n\r\nand  dissatisfied and this, instead  of  promoting\r\n\r\nharmony,  will  ultimately bring about  resentment\r\n\r\nagainst  overseas students. This should  naturally\r\n\r\nbe  avoided. Second, if large numbers  of  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents  are permitted in our hostels, they  will\r\n\r\ntend  to  group together and form little societies\r\n\r\nof their own, and this will inevitably be counter-productive in a very real way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is planning to impose stiffer penalties\r\n\r\nfor certain crimes.\r\n\r\nIt  is a well-known fact that it takes a long time\r\n\r\nto  change laws. It is true that in recent  times,\r\n\r\nsome laws and regulations have been updated, but I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  most  of  our laws could  bear  closer\r\n\r\nscrutiny and are worthy of updating and revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore inherited quite a large number of laws\r\n\r\nwhich  were  enacted during colonial days,  for  a\r\n\r\ndifferent era. Circumstances have changed over the\r\n\r\nlast  25 years. Social values have changed, social\r\n\r\nproblems  have changed, in fact the very  form  of\r\n\r\nGovernment has changed. And yet, we are attempting\r\n\r\nto  govern  on the basis of some of these  archaic\r\n\r\nlaws.  I have no doubt that the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  must have given this matter thought  and\r\n\r\nhave  updated some of the laws, but  I  feel  more\r\n\r\ncould  be  done  to bring the laws  in  line  with\r\n\r\npresent day requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take, for example, the penalty for\r\n\r\nkidnapping or armed robbery. In certain countries,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  Taiwan or China, the  penalty,  on\r\n\r\nbeing  found  guilty,  is death.  They  are  shot.\r\n\r\nAlthough  in  recent  times,  penalties  for  some\r\n\r\noffences  have  been increased - fines  have  been\r\n\r\nraised  and longer sentences imposed and  whipping\r\n\r\nintroduced in some cases - it is apparent from the\r\n\r\ncrime  rates  that it is necessary to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe penalty fits the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may appear to be a hard approach but, as I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, society has changed and  it  is\r\n\r\npossible that some laws cater for situations which\r\n\r\nprobably do not exist any more and even as we deem\r\n\r\nit necessary to modernise and update our industry,\r\n\r\nto meet new technological needs, so also should we\r\n\r\nupdate  our  laws to meet new social and  economic\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think nobody can deny that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the  foremost  State  in  providing\r\n\r\nattractive  housing  schemes  for  its   citizens.\r\n\r\nToday, the working man is able to purchase a  flat\r\n\r\nof  his own, even though he may be earning $300  a\r\n\r\nmonth  or less. I feel we can be justifiably proud\r\n\r\nof  the  fact  that  Singapore has  been  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide this basic social amenity for its citizens\r\n\r\nand  indeed  it is an important one.  Without  the\r\n\r\nBuilding Control Division and without proper  laws\r\n\r\ngoverning  the construction of private  dwellings,\r\n\r\nboth   by   individuals  and  developers,  serious\r\n\r\nproblems must arise. Nevertheless, I hope that the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control  Division will  divert  more  of\r\n\r\ntheir energies to the bigger issues and the bigger\r\n\r\nprojects,  rather than to small matters and  minor\r\n\r\nissues.  .I  understand that the Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision  appears  to be spending  a  considerable\r\n\r\namount  of  time  and energy chasing  after  small\r\n\r\nhouse owners who, in their ignorance or need, have\r\n\r\nsomehow  committed minor infractions of  the  law,\r\n\r\nsuch  as putting up awnings nearer the fence  than\r\n\r\npermitted  by law. I think we should ask ourselves\r\n\r\nwhether  certain  sections of the regulations  and\r\n\r\nlaws which were enacted many many years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nago,  when  land  area was no problem,  are  still\r\n\r\nvalid  today.

I would be grateful if  time\r\n\r\nwould  be  allocated for the  House  to  give  its\r\n\r\nattention to these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

However,  these\r\n\r\nproposals  must  be  carefully and  systematically\r\n\r\nimplemented. Otherwise the masses will be taken by\r\n\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a welcome move that the Government\r\n\r\nintends to increase the Police manpower by  taking\r\n\r\nin full-time national servicemen. This move has to\r\n\r\nbe introduced because of the growing crime rate in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, one setback is that  we  must\r\n\r\nsee  that the people who are being trained in this\r\n\r\nfield are loyal and dedicated personnel, otherwise\r\n\r\nthe Police Force would be made a laughing stock if\r\n\r\ncrooks  are  found in their midst. I have  to  say\r\n\r\nthis because I understand that some of the present\r\n\r\nlot  of part-time national servicemen are a  bunch\r\n\r\nof  rogues.  Some  even engage in part-time  crime\r\n\r\nactivities after their duty hours. Some  part-time\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen in the Police Force are  even\r\n\r\nsporting  long hair. So, steps must  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nensure that the move is well implemented with, out\r\n\r\ncreating problems in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the point on the park and ride\r\n\r\nscheme.

Nevertheless,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to mention that though this is a wise move to\r\n\r\nsolve  our  traffic problem, there  will  be  many\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  in the Central Business District  who\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to pay the mere $60 Area licence  fee\r\n\r\nfor  their  vehicles. They might buy licences  for\r\n\r\nmost of their employees and thereby this will  not\r\n\r\nsolve  the  traffic problem. It  will  defeat  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the  park and ride  scheme.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that we limit or apportion the number  of\r\n\r\nlicences for every business enterprise in the CBD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education system has gone through a\r\n\r\nrevolution during the last decade. There have been\r\n\r\nso  many  changes that most parents are  confused.\r\n\r\nThough we must admit that we have to keep up  with\r\n\r\nthe  times in our Education system, it should  not\r\n\r\nbe   changed  so  often.  Otherwise  teachers  and\r\n\r\nprincipals will adopt a carefree attitude in their\r\n\r\nmethods of teaching. I hope the Ministry will take\r\n\r\nmy  advice  and see that changes are not  made  so\r\n\r\noften.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year there was a headline in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  regarding  the pledge by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications that there would not  be  any  more\r\n\r\nproblems of public transport in the years to come.\r\n\r\nI   must  congratulate  the  Minister's  move   in\r\n\r\nimproving  the public transport system  from  then\r\n\r\non.  But,  nevertheless, there is still much  room\r\n\r\nfor improvement. Daily we find many breakdowns  of\r\n\r\nthe  buses,  infrequency of services and  snobbish\r\n\r\nconductors  and reckless drivers.  Every  now  and\r\n\r\nthen  we  hear  that the SBS is commissioning  new\r\n\r\nbuses  on  the roads. This is indeed a  heartening\r\n\r\nmove. But, on the other hand, what about the buses\r\n\r\nthat  are  being involved in major accidents.  The\r\n\r\nSBS  should  set up a committee to look  into  the\r\n\r\nrising  rate of major accidents. Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nnew  buses are of poor quality. Very often we  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  seats in the new buses are damaged  and\r\n\r\nthey are not very safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SBS should not only look into the question  of\r\n\r\nquantity but also on the quality of buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last one year, bank rates on fixed\r\n\r\ndeposits  and  savings accounts had  been  revised\r\n\r\nseveral  times. At one time the rate was increased\r\n\r\nby  2%.  It was reduced subsequently. Though  this\r\n\r\nmay  be good for investments, it might cause  some\r\n\r\nside  effects on people who are misguided by these\r\n\r\nconstant fluctuations, and it might result in  the\r\n\r\npromotion of illegal activities like tontines  and\r\n\r\nchit funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a wise act that the Government is\r\n\r\nintroducing  benefits for couples  to  have  their\r\n\r\nparents  live  with them. This  is  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nparents to work while the grandparents look  after\r\n\r\nthe  children. By this move, it will induce  close\r\n\r\nrelationship within the families and will  relieve\r\n\r\nto  a  certain extent the social problems  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry. This concept should be greatly publicised\r\n\r\nto  let  the  people be more aware of  it  and  to\r\n\r\nfollow it accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I did speak something on the subject\r\n\r\nof  medical charges. I had asked the Minister  not\r\n\r\nto  increase the medical charges. He did not reply\r\n\r\nto  my question. I am sad to note that there is  a\r\n\r\nhint  that  the  cost of medical services  may  be\r\n\r\nincreased.  I hope that the Minister  will  review\r\n\r\nhis    intention,   because   there    is    great\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction   among  the  people   over   this\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the cost of medical services.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, some people even turn to quack doctors  as\r\n\r\nan alternative to the expensive hospital charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must admit that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have complained of the rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving   which   is  the  result   of   world-wide\r\n\r\ninflation.  Nevertheless,  the  problem  is  being\r\n\r\neradicated  by  and  large and  let  us  hope,  as\r\n\r\npredicted, that in the second half of the year  we\r\n\r\nwill do better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join hon. Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House in supporting the Motion moved  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kim Keat to thank the President for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  speech  delivered on behalf of the Government\r\n\r\nat the opening of the Second Session of the Third Parliament on Friday,  21st\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's speech together with the\r\n\r\nAddendum  on  the various Ministries give  us  the\r\n\r\nfull picture of what the Government intends to  do\r\n\r\nfor   the  people  of  Singapore,  especially   to\r\n\r\nmaintain  political  and economic  stability  with\r\n\r\nindustrial  and economic growth. It is  also  very\r\n\r\nnecessary  to preserve the tripartite  cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween Government, Management and Labour in order\r\n\r\nto  solve all the various problems caused  by  the\r\n\r\npresent  world  inflation and recession.  However,\r\n\r\nlet  us  all do our very best to achieve the  same\r\n\r\nreal  growth  around 7% like  last  year,  and  if\r\n\r\npossible, to score a higher percentage if we  can,\r\n\r\nby the end of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to learn that the Singapore birth\r\n\r\nrates  continued  to fall and  that  total  births\r\n\r\ndeclined  in 1974 to 44,000 from 48,000  in  1973.\r\n\r\nFor  a  country to achieve industrial  growth  and\r\n\r\neconomic progress, it is important that its  birth\r\n\r\nrates  must be controlled. I sincerely  hope  that\r\n\r\nall  the  young  married people in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nhave  small families and to limit each  family  to\r\n\r\ntwo children only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that crime rates have been\r\n\r\nincreasing. The President had rightly said in  his\r\n\r\nspeech on 21st February, 1975, that \"they want  the\r\n\r\ngood things in life but without working to pay for\r\n\r\nthem.\"  Quite frequently you will find reports  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers about theft, armed  robbery,  gang\r\n\r\nfights,  rape  and murder. We must find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans to stop them. I fully support the Government\r\n\r\nin  introducing full-time national service for the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force to help deal with the growing  crime\r\n\r\nrates.  I would request the Government to  recruit\r\n\r\nmore   Police  officers  to  maintain   its   full\r\n\r\nstrength.  Also the public must give full  support\r\n\r\nand  cooperation  to the Police  in  dealing  with\r\n\r\ncriminals.  I think we can be proud of our  Police\r\n\r\nForce. It is efficient in dealing with crimes  and\r\n\r\nnot  tainted by corruption. I would also  like  to\r\n\r\npraise the good work the Vigilante\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorps  are  doing under the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Security Force, especially  in  helping\r\n\r\nthe regular Police in crime prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Development Board is doing a\r\n\r\nfine  job.  Last  year it completed  a  record  of\r\n\r\n26,000  units.  I  am  happy  to  learn  that  its\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme will eventually  reach  40,000\r\n\r\nunits per year. In view of the fact that there  is\r\n\r\na  waiting list of 80,000 intending purchasers and\r\n\r\n20,000 applicants to rent HDB flats, may I request\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  limit the private  developers\r\n\r\nfrom  building too many luxurious and costly flats\r\n\r\nor  houses.  Most  Singaporeans cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\npurchase them because of the high prices. They are\r\n\r\nspecially   built   for   businessmen   and   rich\r\n\r\nforeigners  in  order to make  big  profit.  These\r\n\r\nprivate  developers  care for their  self-interest\r\n\r\nfirst,  purely  for  profit-making  and  not   for\r\n\r\nnational interest. With the present inflation  and\r\n\r\nrecession, most of the luxurious and costly multi-storey flats and houses are vacant in spite of the\r\n\r\nfact that their prices have slightly gone down.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  by  limiting the private developers  from\r\n\r\nbuilding  unnecessary luxurious and costly  multi-storey  flats and houses, the Government can  make\r\n\r\ngood  use of the construction workers and building\r\n\r\nmaterials  to build many more HDB flats  to  reach\r\n\r\nthe  target  of  40,000 units  a  year  so  as  to\r\n\r\neliminate   the  long  waiting  list   of   80,000\r\n\r\nintending purchasers and 20,000 applicants to rent\r\n\r\nHDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several thousands of our young workers have\r\n\r\nbeen  retrenched  from  the  electronic,  garment,\r\n\r\nplywood  and  other  industries  because  of   the\r\n\r\npresent   inflation  and  recession.  Workers   in\r\n\r\nAmerica,  U.K., Europe, Japan and other  countries\r\n\r\nhave  also suffered retrenchment. Unemployment  is\r\n\r\non  the  increase everywhere. I am happy that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour has already set up  a  special\r\n\r\nretrenchment  unit  in August  1974  to  help  the\r\n\r\nretrenched workers to get other employment.  Young\r\n\r\nworkers  should not be too choosy in  accepting  a\r\n\r\njob.  They  should  realise  that  all  jobs   are\r\n\r\ndignified, but to remain idle, unemployed  and  to\r\n\r\ndepend   on  parental  support  is  shameful   and\r\n\r\ndisgraceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Labour together with the\r\n\r\nunions will keep a close watch on the retrenchment\r\n\r\nsituation  and  see that employers  do  not  abuse\r\n\r\ntheir  right to retrench workers unless  there  is\r\n\r\nreal  justification to do so. Should there be  any\r\n\r\nretrenchment, it is appropriate that the employers\r\n\r\nshould  discuss  these questions  with  the  union\r\n\r\nleaders  as early as possible - whether  there  is\r\n\r\nany  possibility  of avoiding it;  or  lessen  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of workers to be retrenched; or to  deploy\r\n\r\nthem  to  other  departments or worksites;  or  to\r\n\r\noperate a four or five-day week; or any other ways\r\n\r\nand means to solve the problem to the satisfaction\r\n\r\nof  both  parties.  If, finally,  retrenchment  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable, the employers should give them  ample\r\n\r\nnotice  so  as  to cushion a sudden shock  and  to\r\n\r\nenable  them  to make preparation  to  seek  other\r\n\r\nemployments.  Also  the workers  should  be  given\r\n\r\nsubstantial  compensation as retrenchment  benefit\r\n\r\nfor the years of service that they have given.  If\r\n\r\nthis  procedure  of  retrenching  the  workers  is\r\n\r\nadopted,   I   am   sure  there   will   be   less\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding   and  all   hostile   industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes  or  confrontation  can  be  avoided.  To\r\n\r\nachieve  industrial peace, employers must  respect\r\n\r\nthe  workers as human beings and not to treat them\r\n\r\nlike machines but to appreciate the importance  of\r\n\r\nunderstanding the human feelings of  the  workers.\r\n\r\nTo  enjoy  job  security, good wages,  and  better\r\n\r\nconditions of service, workers must do their  duty\r\n\r\nhonestly,  sincerely,  efficiently  and  help   to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity. However, it  is  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  both  sides  to develop trust, understanding,\r\n\r\nconfidence   and  cooperation  to   achieve   good\r\n\r\nindustrial relations and industrial peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Government's intention\r\n\r\nto  raise  the standards of industrial safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth, especially in building construction, ship-building and ship-repairing. These industries have\r\n\r\nthe   highest   rates   of  industrial   accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving  serious bodily injuries and even  death\r\n\r\nas  happened  in several cases. In  spite  of  the\r\n\r\nwarning  given  by  the  Ministry  of  Labour   to\r\n\r\nemployers,  there  is  not  much  evidence  of   a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the number of industrial  accidents\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeaths  in  these industries. These employers  are\r\n\r\nonly  interested in making big profits as  quickly\r\n\r\nas  possible.  They do not care  very  much  about\r\n\r\nadequate  safety equipments necessary to safeguard\r\n\r\nand protect the workers from industrial accidents.\r\n\r\nI am happy to learn that the Factories Act will be\r\n\r\namended  to  provide  for  more  stringent  safety\r\n\r\nmeasures  and enhanced penalties will  be  imposed\r\n\r\nwhere contraventions are likely to cause death  or\r\n\r\nbodily  injury. I think we have given them  enough\r\n\r\nwarnings about giving proper industrial safety and\r\n\r\nhealth  protection to their workers.  It  is  time\r\n\r\nthat severe action was taken against employers who\r\n\r\nneglect  the  safety  of  the  workers,  as  their\r\n\r\nnegligence  may cause severe bodily  injuries  and\r\n\r\ndeath to their workers. I would recommend that  we\r\n\r\nimpose maximum penalty of a fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  action should also be taken  against\r\n\r\nworkers  who  refuse to use the  safety  equipment\r\n\r\nsupplied to them. We cannot afford to lose so many\r\n\r\nworkers  in the industries, especially the skilled\r\n\r\nones,  through  incapacity  caused  by  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is most appropriate that a new Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Bill will be presented to  Parliament\r\n\r\nfor  approval to increase the maximum compensation\r\n\r\nfrom  $21,600 to $35,000 for a fatal case and from\r\n\r\n$28,800   to  $45,000  for  a  case  of  permanent\r\n\r\nincapacity.  I  am sure all hon. Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse will give full support to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would request the Government to expedite\r\n\r\nthe   passing   of  legislation  to  control   the\r\n\r\noperations and management of private welfare homes\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure minimum standards for the care  of\r\n\r\ninmates and cleanliness of homes. This legislation\r\n\r\nwill  stop the exploitation and suffering  of  the\r\n\r\npoor   aged   people.  May  I  also  request   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to allocate a number of Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats  to  the  aged  people  who  wish  to   live\r\n\r\ncollectively with their aged friends and  near  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of their families in the Housing estates.\r\n\r\nThey  prefer  to stay in Housing Board  flats  and\r\n\r\nnear to their own people rather than going to  the\r\n\r\nHomes of the Aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Sunday Times report on 16th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1975, under the heading \"Tax Sleuths  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  hawkers pay up\", it is stated that  the\r\n\r\nInland Revenue Department has got several aces  up\r\n\r\nits  sleeve  to  make hawkers who  are  liable  to\r\n\r\nincome  tax to pay up. Hon. Members of this  House\r\n\r\nare  fully aware that a good number of hawkers are\r\n\r\nmaking very good profit from their business.  Some\r\n\r\nof them are earning more than hon. Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse.  It is a fact that some hawkers are  owners\r\n\r\nof houses, cars and partners of other enterprises.\r\n\r\nHon. Members of this House will agree with me that\r\n\r\nwhen  hawkers  make  big  profits  they  have  the\r\n\r\ncapacity to pay income tax, and the Inland Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment  should not delay any further  to  make\r\n\r\nthem  pay  income tax. It will be  interesting  to\r\n\r\nknow how many hawkers have been paying income  tax\r\n\r\nso far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is some improvement in the public\r\n\r\ntransport,   especially,  the  bus  service.   The\r\n\r\nimplementation of the scheme to use  school  buses\r\n\r\nto  carry  office commuters and other workers  has\r\n\r\ngreatly  helped to ease the long wait  for  buses.\r\n\r\nSeveral  new buses have already been added  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  many more will follow. I would request  that\r\n\r\nthe  school  buses should not be  withdrawn  until\r\n\r\nthere are adequate buses to serve the commuters. I\r\n\r\nalso  welcome  the  employment  of  women  as  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers  and  conductresses. They are doing  their\r\n\r\njobs  quite  satisfactorily. I  hope  more  female\r\n\r\nworkers will be employed in the bus service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H.

Member for Kim\r\n\r\nKeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of our Republic has reminded us\r\n\r\nthat  we have thrived in the past because of self-discipline,  hard work, thrift and enterprise.  He\r\n\r\nalso  exhorted  hon. Members to be guided  by  the\r\n\r\nlong-term interests of our people and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  to  be  swayed  by  short-term  political\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  We should take his  reminder  and\r\n\r\nhis exhortation seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only to ponder upon the twin problems of\r\n\r\ninflation  and recession, affecting  the  advanced\r\n\r\ncountries   and  the  international  economy,   to\r\n\r\nrealise the truth of the President's words. In the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries, government expenditures  tend\r\n\r\nto  increase inexorably, spurred by misguided,  if\r\n\r\nwell-motivated, compassion for the unemployed  and\r\n\r\nthe underprivileged. Every congressman and senator\r\n\r\ntries  to  get  government projects  for  his  own\r\n\r\nconstituency.  Subsidies are used as vote-catching\r\n\r\ndevices. Such expenditures and subsidies  must  be\r\n\r\nfinanced  by  higher  taxes or  by  printing  more\r\n\r\nmoney,  or  both. Higher taxes hit those  who  are\r\n\r\nable  to  pay, penalising in the process not  only\r\n\r\nthe  feudal rich but also the hard-working and the\r\n\r\nenterprising.  Since higher taxes are  politically\r\n\r\nunpopular,   governments  then   resort   to   the\r\n\r\nadditional, and easier, way of printing more money\r\n\r\nto finance the higher expenditures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net result of the process is, firstly, the\r\n\r\nerosion   of   incentives  for   hard   work   and\r\n\r\nenterprise,   and   secondly,   inflation,   which\r\n\r\npenalises the thrifty, pensioners and fixed income-recipients,  and  which causes  disorientation  in\r\n\r\nproduction and consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments then react to curb inflation,\r\n\r\nprincipally  by reducing the rate of  increase  in\r\n\r\nmoney  supply.  However, in the meantime,  demand-pull  inflation, which was caused by the  monetary\r\n\r\nand  fiscal excesses, becomes wage-push inflation,\r\n\r\nas trade unions attempt to compensate for cost-of-living  increases.  The  problem  is  made  worse,\r\n\r\nbecause  trade  unions demand  wage  increases  in\r\n\r\nexcess    of   productivity   and   cost-of-living\r\n\r\nincreases. Thus, inflation continues; at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  recession  is  brought about,  as  business\r\n\r\nfirms  experience  a liquidity crunch  on  top  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  costs of production. Since  recession,\r\n\r\nwhich    causes   unemployment,   is   politically\r\n\r\ndangerous,  the next reaction is to stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy by cutting taxes and easing credit. It  is\r\n\r\npolitically difficult to cut expenditures. In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevenues in a recession tend to decline, as income\r\n\r\nand  employment are lower. Therefore, the  tax-cut\r\n\r\nresults  in a huge budget deficit, which  must  be\r\n\r\nfinanced   by  borrowing  or  by  easing   credit.\r\n\r\nBorrowing  at a time of recession is  supposed  to\r\n\r\ndepress the economy further; hence, printing  more\r\n\r\nmoney or easing credit is the standard solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we see in America, President Ford's\r\n\r\nproposal  to  cut  taxes  to  the  tune  of  US$16\r\n\r\nbillion,  and  we  read about his difficulties  in\r\n\r\ngetting  Congress  to trim expenditures.  The  two\r\n\r\nmost depressed sectors in America are housing  and\r\n\r\nthe motor vehicle industry. Whether people who get\r\n\r\nthe   tax  rebates  will  spend  on  housing   and\r\n\r\nmotorcars  is  one question. What happens  to  the\r\n\r\nmoney supply is a more critical question. And  the\r\n\r\nrate  at  which the economy will turn  around  and\r\n\r\nwith  what degree of inflation depends on how much\r\n\r\nthe  confidence  of businessmen has  already  been\r\n\r\neroded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Europeans are also easing\r\n\r\nfiscal and monetary policies and the Japanese  are\r\n\r\nexpected   to   do  likewise  shortly.   What   is\r\n\r\ndisturbing  to  me is that, with  so  much  global\r\n\r\ninterdependence  in  trade, investment  and  money\r\n\r\nflows, there is hardly any attempt at coordination\r\n\r\nof  policies  as  vital  as monetary  and  fiscal.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would  expect  another   round   of\r\n\r\ninflation,    without    much    alleviation    of\r\n\r\nunemployment.  I hope that the harvest  this  year\r\n\r\nwill  be  good,  for, with world  food  stocks  so\r\n\r\nprecariously  low,  any shortage  will  send  food\r\n\r\nprices soaring, thus compounding inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three reasons why I expect further\r\n\r\ninflation.    Firstly,   monetary    and    fiscal\r\n\r\nstimulation produce considerable price effects for\r\n\r\na  given reduction in unemployment. Secondly,  not\r\n\r\nmany  people  are aware that monetary  and  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicies  do  not  work  the  same  way  when  the\r\n\r\nexchange   rate   is   floating   and   there   is\r\n\r\nconsiderable   mobility   of   capital.   Thirdly,\r\n\r\nalthough there is controversy among economists,  I\r\n\r\nam  inclined  to  the view that floating  exchange\r\n\r\nrates  are  an engine of international  inflation.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because  wages and prices  are  flexible\r\n\r\nupwards but not downwards. So  a  depreciation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the exchange rate causes\r\n\r\nprices  and  wages to rise while  an  appreciation\r\n\r\ndoes  not  do the reverse to the same degree.  The\r\n\r\nresult is a net increase in world inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another worrisome aspect about floating exchange\r\n\r\nrates  is  that there is a loss of stability  -  a\r\n\r\nloss  of  a  stable  point of reference.  As  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   know,  the  American  dollar  has   been\r\n\r\ndepreciating  rapidly and the OPEC  countries  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the  price  of  oil  as  it   is\r\n\r\ncurrently  denominated in the American dollar.  So\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  can  see, there can be  no  return  to\r\n\r\nstability  and  fixed  exchange  rates  until  and\r\n\r\nunless  the major industrial countries are willing\r\n\r\nto  coordinate  their monetary, fiscal  and  trade\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Singapore, we have no choice but to\r\n\r\naccept floating rates as our trade and sources  of\r\n\r\ninvestment  are diversified. We can have  a  fixed\r\n\r\nexchange rate if the international economy returns\r\n\r\nto  a  fixed  rate system or if we  tie  ourselves\r\n\r\nexclusively to a particular currency and therefore\r\n\r\na  particular trading area. Our floating  exchange\r\n\r\nrate  poses  a  policy dilemma. On the  one  hand,\r\n\r\nallowing  our  rate to float upwards,  as  it  has\r\n\r\nrecently,  may  be  helpful in  reducing  imported\r\n\r\ninflation,  provided our importers and wholesalers\r\n\r\npass  on  the benefits to retailers and consumers.\r\n\r\nOn   the  other  hand,  allowing  our  dollar   to\r\n\r\nappreciate  would penalise the competitiveness  of\r\n\r\nour  goods and services abroad. To hold  down  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  our currency would require the Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore to buy up foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nHowever,   unless   such   foreign   exchange   is\r\n\r\nsterilised,  this would result in  an  undesirable\r\n\r\nincreased  money supply generated by  the  banking\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound monetary management is vital to the health\r\n\r\nof  our economy especially when our exchange  rate\r\n\r\nis  floating.  Our  problem is compounded  by  the\r\n\r\ninternational  mobility  of  capital.   If   other\r\n\r\nfinancial  centres raise their interest rates,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to raise ours, or else money will flow  out,\r\n\r\nand  conversely.  To  maintain  our  own  set   of\r\n\r\ninterest   rates   independently   would   require\r\n\r\ncontrols   on   capital  movements   or   interest\r\n\r\nequalisation taxes, or both. Such measures, however,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould hinder our development as a financial\r\n\r\ncentre.  We  have therefore to balance  the  gains\r\n\r\nfrom being a financial centre against the loss  of\r\n\r\ncontrol over interest rates and money supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, welcome the amalgamation of the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Board  with  the Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to form a central bank. However, I would\r\n\r\nurge  Government to keep careful track of monetary\r\n\r\npolicy  at  the highest level. This is because  of\r\n\r\nthe  instability  in  the  international  monetary\r\n\r\nsystem and because, under floating exchange  rates\r\n\r\nand  capital mobility, monetary policy is a  major\r\n\r\ninstrument of control over economic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons that emerge for us should be quite\r\n\r\nobvious.  Firstly, we should continue to  exercise\r\n\r\nfinancial   prudence,   making   sure   that   new\r\n\r\nexpenditures are properly justified and  that  the\r\n\r\nmeans  to  pay for them are available. Any  fiscal\r\n\r\ndeficit  can  only be justified  if  the  projects\r\n\r\nenhance  development and will eventually  directly\r\n\r\nor  indirectly  pay for themselves.  Secondly,  we\r\n\r\nshould  maintain  our climate  of  confidence  for\r\n\r\ninvestors,   ensuring  that  we   do   not   erode\r\n\r\nincentives for hard work and enterprise.  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nwages  should be related to productivity.  Workers\r\n\r\nmust  not get the attitude of wanting higher wages\r\n\r\nwithout  acquiring the skills, the experience,  or\r\n\r\nputting  in  the effort. In this connection,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  National Productivity Board will do its  best\r\n\r\nto  promote productivity committees, and  to  help\r\n\r\nformulate  policies to gear wages to productivity.\r\n\r\nThe  National  Industrial Relations Committee  has\r\n\r\nalready  met to discuss these issues. The  members\r\n\r\nof  the  committee are drawn from  the  NTUC,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Employers'  Federation,  the   National\r\n\r\nEmployers'  Council,  the Singapore  Institute  of\r\n\r\nManagement  and  the  Labour Ministry,  under  the\r\n\r\naegis   of   the   National  Productivity   Board.\r\n\r\nAcquiring skills and raising productivity are  the\r\n\r\nkeys  to our survival and prosperity. Some  people\r\n\r\nhave  argued  that it is meaningless  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity at a time of recession because  firms\r\n\r\nalready have difficulty in selling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir products or services. Increasing output with\r\n\r\na  given  input  is  only one way  of  looking  at\r\n\r\nproductivity. More important to us at  this  stage\r\n\r\nis  to  minimise inputs for any desired  level  of\r\n\r\noutput.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the Labour Ministry's move to\r\n\r\nset  up  an Industrial Relations Division and  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  the NTUC. Tripartism  must  be\r\n\r\nexercised,  not just at the top level. To  achieve\r\n\r\nresults, Sir, the principle must permeate down  to\r\n\r\nthe  rank and file. What we should learn from  the\r\n\r\nmistakes  of the advanced countries is that  wages\r\n\r\nare   too   important  to  be  left  to   ordinary\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining and that a spirit of  mutual\r\n\r\ncooperation  must  prevail.  Workers   should   be\r\n\r\ncommitted  to the viability of the firm  and  both\r\n\r\nworkers  and  management should keep in  view  the\r\n\r\nnational interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth lesson we can draw is that fiscal and\r\n\r\nmonetary policies should he made to serve the long-term   interests   of   the   nation.   Short-term\r\n\r\nexpediency leads to traumatic stop-go policies. We\r\n\r\nmust   indeed   educate  our  people   to   accept\r\n\r\nunpleasant, even painful, measures that  will  pay\r\n\r\noff  in  the long run. We complain about high  PUB\r\n\r\nbills,  bus fares and HDB conservancy charges.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  expedient,  easy and  popular  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to raise such charges. But how will\r\n\r\nthese  services  be  financed?  Higher  taxes   or\r\n\r\nprinting  more  money are the alternatives  -  the\r\n\r\nfirst penalises the hard-working and enterprising,\r\n\r\nand  the second produces inflation which, as  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers know, is indirect taxation. In the end, if\r\n\r\nwe  follow expedient measures, we shall all be the\r\n\r\nlosers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many difficulties\r\n\r\nahead  as  there  is considerable uncertainty  and\r\n\r\ninstability in the world economy. As a small, open\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  are  highly vulnerable  to  external\r\n\r\nevents.   We  can,  however,  by  being  vigilant,\r\n\r\ninsulate  ourselves to some degree. We can  ensure\r\n\r\nour viability by working harder, by being prudent,\r\n\r\nand   by  maintaining  a  proper  longer-term  and\r\n\r\nnational perspective. Our younger people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust acquire greater skills and diligence. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  current  difficulties will bring  a  dose  of\r\n\r\nrealism  to  the spendthrift and the  job-hoppers,\r\n\r\nspurring   them   towards   thrift   and   greater\r\n\r\nendeavours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the midst of\r\n\r\nworld-wide     inflation,     unemployment     and\r\n\r\nuncertainty, and at a time when many countries are\r\n\r\nfaced   with   all   kinds  of  difficulties   and\r\n\r\npressures,  it  is  gratifying to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  was  able to deliver a  speech  in  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Session of the Third Parliament  outlining\r\n\r\nthe   various   political,  social  and   economic\r\n\r\npolicies.   In   the  Addendum  on   the   various\r\n\r\nministries  we  can  see the various  measures  to\r\n\r\nprovide  solutions to the problems  faced  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech is a shot in the arm for\r\n\r\nthe  people,  both  within and outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey   are  imbued  with  greater  confidence   in\r\n\r\nSingapore when they face the future and our people\r\n\r\nwill  be  more  steadfast in  their  pursuits  and\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  nation building.  The  immediate\r\n\r\ntask  is  to implement all the measures  patiently\r\n\r\nand  carefully.  This  is  a  very  important  and\r\n\r\ndifficult task, especially when we have to  adjust\r\n\r\nto  the  lower economic growth rate. In  order  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  these policies and objectives,  the  first\r\n\r\nrequisite is to have a government which  is  fair,\r\n\r\npragmatic  and  dares to face up  to  reality  and\r\n\r\nwhich  can rally talents around it. I believe  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party is the one party which  can\r\n\r\nform   such  a  government.  Secondly,  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants in the various ministries should be  hard\r\n\r\nworking,  honest and dedicated to their duties.  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  the Member for Jalan  Kayu  that  the\r\n\r\ncivil servants should enhance the quality of their\r\n\r\nservice.  They should shun bureaucracy  and  serve\r\n\r\nthe people. Thirdly, our people should be aware of\r\n\r\ntheir  civic duties. They should not be complacent\r\n\r\nnor should they be despondent. They should be self-disciplined,     hardworking,     thrifty      and\r\n\r\nenterprising, and should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace  national  interests  above  personal   and\r\n\r\nsectional  interests  at  all  times.  With   such\r\n\r\ncooperation and unity, we will be able to surmount\r\n\r\nall difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Health Ministry, the\r\n\r\nPresident stated categorically that we must fulfil\r\n\r\nthe objective of a two-child-family, otherwise the\r\n\r\nstandard of social service and the quality of  our\r\n\r\nenvironment  will  deteriorate,  because  of   the\r\n\r\npressure of population and congestion. This  is  a\r\n\r\nsharp reminder to the people in Singapore that the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  family planning must be accepted  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  must be a curb on population  growth.\r\n\r\nThe  campaign on family planning not  only  has  a\r\n\r\ndirect  bearing on the well-being and interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  present and the next generations  but  it  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  major social and national task. We should\r\n\r\npay  tribute to the Health Ministry for  the  good\r\n\r\njob they have done in bringing down the birth rate\r\n\r\nto  19.8 per thousand. However, we should  not  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent with such mean achievement.  We  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  make greater efforts to achieve  our\r\n\r\nultimate  objective. Our success  in  curbing  our\r\n\r\npopulation growth depends upon both the people and\r\n\r\nthe Government. Of the people, everyone should  be\r\n\r\naware  of  the  importance of family planning  and\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  accept  the  social  need  for\r\n\r\ncontrol   of  population.  Every  family,  whether\r\n\r\naffluent  or  destitute,  should  adhere  to  such\r\n\r\nprinciples.  They should strive for the  objective\r\n\r\nof a two-child-family. Of the Government it should\r\n\r\nalways  review  the  services  and  increase   the\r\n\r\nfacilities  provided for the people  in  order  to\r\n\r\nensure effectively that every family has an  equal\r\n\r\nshare in enjoying such facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the results of the family planning campaign,\r\n\r\nwe  find  that people from the lower income  group\r\n\r\nand  in rural areas do not respond well to such  a\r\n\r\ncampaign.  This is perhaps because  of  their  low\r\n\r\nlevel  of  education  or  because  of  their  more\r\n\r\nconservative  attitude.  They  therefore  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult   to  accept  the  concept   of   family\r\n\r\nplanning.  This requires our immediate  attention.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact they are the ones who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  greater  need of family planning,  because  if\r\n\r\nthey  can  keep  their  families  small,  it  will\r\n\r\nalleviate  their  burden.  But  because  of  their\r\n\r\neducational background and environment  they  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  able to pay heed to such problems.  The\r\n\r\nHealth   Ministry   should  therefore   pay   more\r\n\r\nattention  to  this class of people.  They  should\r\n\r\nprovide  more  and better facilities to  publicise\r\n\r\nsuch campaigns. Adequate educational campaigns and\r\n\r\ngood  public relations facilities should  also  he\r\n\r\nprovided,  otherwise  we  will  not  be  able   to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  stable society where  everyone  will\r\n\r\nhave  an equal opportunity to live, learn,  train,\r\n\r\ncontribute their best and earn their living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  we note that the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  doing well. In the  past  we  have\r\n\r\noften  experienced shortages of  imported  primary\r\n\r\nsupplies  and high prices. But we have been  self-sufficient in the production of pork, poultry  and\r\n\r\neggs,  and this has a stabilising effect  on  food\r\n\r\nprices. Thus, it can he seen that our farmers have\r\n\r\na  great role to play in bringing down our cost of\r\n\r\nliving.  This is especially so when the  world  is\r\n\r\nexperiencing   food   shortages.    The    Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department should make greater  effort\r\n\r\nto   promote  and  widen  the  range  of   farming\r\n\r\nactivities   rather   than  concentrate   on   the\r\n\r\nproduction of a few agricultural items,  resulting\r\n\r\nin a surplus of supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop and protect water supplies,\r\n\r\ncertain  pig-rearing  farms  would  have   to   be\r\n\r\nresited. This is unavoidable. The farmers  realise\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  such  resettlements.  The  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department should advise the farmers to\r\n\r\ncarry out other alternative farming activities. So\r\n\r\nlong as the Government can give them encouragement\r\n\r\nand  help,  they  will  he  able  to  succeed   in\r\n\r\nembarking  on other farming activities to  make  a\r\n\r\nliving.  This will both maximise the use  of  land\r\n\r\nand benefit the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion by the Member for Kim\r\n\r\nKeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support\r\n\r\nof  the  Motion  to  thank the President  for  his\r\n\r\nspeech to this house. According to the President's\r\n\r\nspeech,  last year there was a 7% economic  growth\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, while our foreign reserves exceeded\r\n\r\n$6.5  billion,  showing a 20-fold growth  compared\r\n\r\nwith  1959. 1974 was a most eventful year for many\r\n\r\ncountries.  The  energy crisis and inflation  have\r\n\r\ncaused  many  developed countries to  suffer.  All\r\n\r\nover  the world unemployment is mounting and  many\r\n\r\nfactories  have  closed down.  In  some  countries\r\n\r\nthere  have  been no economic growth at  all,  and\r\n\r\nsome  countries  have  only 2-3%  growth.  But  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, without natural or energy resources and\r\n\r\nwith  very  limited  land, we have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  growth rate of 7%.  This  is  a  clear\r\n\r\nindication that the Government and the people  are\r\n\r\nable    to    adapt   themselves    to    changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  and we could change  according  to\r\n\r\nthe  changes that are taking place. This  is  also\r\n\r\none  indication of our ruggedness  and  our  cool-headed adaptability, which are very laudable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President said in his speech that our economy\r\n\r\nmay  probably do better in the second half of this\r\n\r\nyear.  We must therefore prepare ourselves, always\r\n\r\nwith  our fighting spirit to meet the better times\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has pointed out in his speech that\r\n\r\nsteps  will be taken by the Government to make  it\r\n\r\nattractive for young couples to have their parents\r\n\r\nlive  with  them,  so that their children  can  be\r\n\r\neducated  and  taken care of by their grandparents\r\n\r\nand at the same time the problem of the welfare of\r\n\r\nthe  old people can be solved. To have taken  note\r\n\r\nof  this matter is something praiseworthy. This is\r\n\r\nentirely in keeping with the ethical values of the\r\n\r\neastern  culture. Those who propound that the  old\r\n\r\npeople should be sent to Homes for the Aged should\r\n\r\ntake note that their proposition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not solve the problem because the old people\r\n\r\nwill  still  feel  lonely and miserable  in  those\r\n\r\nHomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude taken by the Government in this\r\n\r\ndirection reminds me of the many grievances that I\r\n\r\nhave come across in my Meet-the-People sessions. I\r\n\r\nhave  received complaints from those who live with\r\n\r\ntheir  parents in one- or two-room flats that  the\r\n\r\nspace  available is very limited and as a  result,\r\n\r\nold  parents  have  to sleep in the  sitting  room\r\n\r\nwhile  further  addition to the family  makes  the\r\n\r\npremises  even more congested. When they  ask  for\r\n\r\nlarger  flats, the normal reply from  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard is that the allocation of larger flats  will\r\n\r\nbe  made  on  a  \"first come first  served\"  basis\r\n\r\nwithout  taking into consideration the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  old people have to sleep in the sitting room.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this  situation  young  couples   are\r\n\r\ncompelled  to move out of the flat of the  parents\r\n\r\nand  set  up  their own homes, thus leaving  their\r\n\r\nparents  behind. Mr Speaker, Sir, in view  of  the\r\n\r\nencouragement by the Government for young  couples\r\n\r\nto   stay  with  their  parents,  I  propose  that\r\n\r\npriority  for transfer to larger flats  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven to people who have their parents living with\r\n\r\nthem in Housing Board flats and who find that  the\r\n\r\naccommodation is inadequate. This is one  concrete\r\n\r\nstep towards the encouragement of young people  to\r\n\r\nhave  their parents stay with them. If the present\r\n\r\npolicy  remains unchanged, then the young  couples\r\n\r\nmay  have  to move out and stay on their  own  and\r\n\r\nthis  would be contrary to the Government's policy\r\n\r\nof looking after the aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From next month onwards, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunications  will  implement  the  new  traffic\r\n\r\nticketing  system and the points  demerit  system.\r\n\r\nThis  new  legislation will  greatly  enhance  the\r\n\r\npower of the traffic police to do good or evil.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to remind the authority concerned  that\r\n\r\nin  implementing  this  new  law,  more  care  and\r\n\r\njustice  should  be  exercised.  I  have  received\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from various sources that some  police\r\n\r\nofficers have abused their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npowers.  They seem to be very fond of persecuting\r\n\r\ncertain   motorists   and  harassing   them   with\r\n\r\ninnumerable  summonses. At first  these  motorists\r\n\r\nput up with this over-excessive implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe law because of fear, until they could bear  it\r\n\r\nno   longer.  When  they  complained   to   me   I\r\n\r\nstraightaway   referred  them  to   the   relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities,  after  which  the  complaints   were\r\n\r\neasily resolved. In some cases, the traffic police\r\n\r\nofficers themselves are guilty of traffic offences\r\n\r\nby  not  setting good examples. There was  a  case\r\n\r\nwhere one police personnel himself did not observe\r\n\r\nthe traffic rules and knocked into somebody's car,\r\n\r\nyet  he threatened the other party involved in the\r\n\r\naccident. I am very concerned about such policemen\r\n\r\nwhen  such wide powers are given to them,  thereby\r\n\r\ncreating  more  ill-will between  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic and the police. This is particularly so  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of transport workers who are on the road\r\n\r\nthe whole day to earn their living. With such wide\r\n\r\npowers,  the traffic police are able to break  the\r\n\r\nrice  bowl  of  these  workers  and  affect  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the cases that I have mentioned touched on\r\n\r\nthe   relationship  between  the  Police  and  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In  the past, of course, the Police  took\r\n\r\nnote of the question of public relations and there\r\n\r\nhave  been  a number of Police Weeks,  forums  and\r\n\r\nPublic Relations Promotion campaigns and so forth.\r\n\r\nIn my view, campaigns, exhibitions or forums alone\r\n\r\ncannot succeed in promoting public relations.  The\r\n\r\nmain  crux of the whole matter is that the  police\r\n\r\nofficers themselves should behave properly in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  their duties and gain the  respect  of\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
