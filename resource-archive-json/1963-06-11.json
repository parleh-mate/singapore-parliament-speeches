The first half year's  Budget  was\r\n\r\npassed in 1961, and according to the P.A.P.,  there\r\n\r\nwould   be   \"numerous  complicated   and   onerous\r\n\r\ntechnical problems of details\" involved because  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. merger with the Federation on or before\r\n\r\nJune  1963. But June has come by and there is still\r\n\r\nno  merger. Where are the \"complicated and  onerous\r\n\r\ntechnical  problems  of details\"  involved  in  the\r\n\r\npresent   Budget  that  necessitate   the   present\r\n\r\nprocedure? And how is the present Budget  different\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nessence  from the usual Budgets that  we  see  year\r\n\r\nafter  year,  that it could not have been  prepared\r\n\r\nearlier  in  December  1962?  The  reason  for  the\r\n\r\npresent  procedure is, of course, that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  no use of the Legislative Assembly other  than\r\n\r\nto   use   it   as  a  rubber  stamp   for   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmachinations. Passing the Budget early in 1961 made\r\n\r\nit  unnecessary for the P.A.P. to hold  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  sittings  again for a  long  period.  And\r\n\r\nindeed,  there  has  been no Assembly  sitting  for\r\n\r\nmonths    at    a   stretch.   This   unprecedented\r\n\r\nparliamentary  procedure, like the  telescoping  of\r\n\r\nthe time-table for the present Budget debate, shows\r\n\r\nwhat  parliamentary practice we have  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday.  We have already had a long Assembly holiday\r\n\r\nof eight months and an Assembly seat vacant for ten\r\n\r\nmonths. Today, the P.A.P. merely wears the garb  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy  for  the  convenience  of\r\n\r\ndeceiving  the  people  both  inside  and   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is hardly anything that one can enthuse\r\n\r\nabout  in the Budget statement of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance. As usual he talks of P.A.P. successes. But\r\n\r\ntake  away  the grease, the paint and the  make-up.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  there  left to show?  Like  the  previous\r\n\r\nyears,  the  year  1962 has been  another  year  of\r\n\r\ndismal failure. Funds had been voted for use by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on development projects in  order  that\r\n\r\nthey  may  benefit the people. But what development\r\n\r\nprojects do we see in 1962? Until today, the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore have not been told as to how funds had\r\n\r\nbeen  spent on the development projects in 1962.  A\r\n\r\nsum of $207 million had been voted in December 1961\r\n\r\nfor  the  1962 Development Estimates. The whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore can see that the money has not been spent\r\n\r\nas  was  budgeted for. As the Minister himself  has\r\n\r\nadmitted in the statement, in 1962 there was a huge\r\n\r\nsurplus  of $97 million, just as there was  a  huge\r\n\r\nsurplus  of $110 million in 1961. What has happened\r\n\r\nto the surplus of $97 million in 1962? Why does the\r\n\r\nMinister  not  inform the House and the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as to what he has done with the money - the\r\n\r\npeople's money and not P.A.P.'s money?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

It could only  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a  source of shame to the P.A.P. and  not  a\r\n\r\nsource of boasting and bragging. For the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\ngo about telling the people that the surplus is due\r\n\r\nto  the  good government of the P.A.P. is therefore\r\n\r\nsheer deception. The people, of course, are not  so\r\n\r\neasily  deceived; nevertheless, the P.A.P. must  be\r\n\r\ncondemned  for  such  attempted  deception  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  we ask the P.A.P. not to repeat  this\r\n\r\ndeception.  The  Prime  Minister  goes  round   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies. Let the Ministers here tell him not\r\n\r\nto brag about this surplus anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, Sir, we can also see that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers do not mean what they  say.  When\r\n\r\nthey  say  success, they in fact mean failure.

The unemployment  problem\r\n\r\nis  worsening.  In  addition, of course,  there  is\r\n\r\nrepression and the deprivation of the basic  rights\r\n\r\nand  freedoms of the people. Only in one department\r\n\r\ndo  the P.A.P. Ministers excel in, and that is  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  of malicious distortion, deception  and\r\n\r\ntreachery. The P.A.P. excels in sell-outs. That  is\r\n\r\nthe only thing they are good in, nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of the financial merger talks, in\r\n\r\nspite  of all the brave talk of the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nit  is  clear  that the P.A.P. is  already  getting\r\n\r\nready to surrender in toto to the Federation.  This\r\n\r\ntalk  of limited common market terms is only  meant\r\n\r\nto  save  the  face of the Prime  Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nabject  surrender. The Minister for  Finance  still\r\n\r\ntalks of independence through merger. But he cannot\r\n\r\nbe  serious. He was talking with his tongue in  his\r\n\r\ncheek  because  there is no independence  with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger and the P.A.P. itself has admitted as\r\n\r\nmuch  in  the  financial  talks  tussle  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  If  it  really thinks  that  there  is\r\n\r\nindependence,  why should it fight  or  pretend  to\r\n\r\nfight?  Therefore, let us get rid of this  nonsense\r\n\r\nabout independence through merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talks of finding the money to pay for new schools and houses. But although we had the money in hand in 1962, we nevertheless did not have the many new schools and hospitals. Nor the equipment and staff for them. We have surpluses which have merely been sent overseas for investment. In 1959, the surplus funds invested\r\n\r\noverseas   amounted  to  $139  million.   The   sum\r\n\r\nincreased to $249 million in 1960 and by  1961  the\r\n\r\namount  invested  overseas had increased  to  $316 million.  I  do  not  wish to repeat  what  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  said only two months ago in the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. It can always\r\n\r\nbe found in the Hansard. Unfortunately, the figures\r\n\r\nfor  1962 have not come out yet. But I am sure that\r\n\r\nthe  figure for 1962 will be much higher  than  for\r\n\r\n1961. The P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan advocates the use\r\n\r\nof  local funds for investment in Singapore. Today,\r\n\r\nwe  see  that  the P.A.P. has not only not  brought\r\n\r\nback to Singapore money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvested  overseas, but, on the  contrary,  it  has\r\n\r\nincreased  the  investment abroad. What  good  will\r\n\r\nmoney   invested  abroad  do  to  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem in Singapore's economy remains\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of unemployment. How are  we  to  get\r\n\r\nenough jobs for the increasing number of unemployed\r\n\r\nin Singapore? Every year, more than 30,000 students\r\n\r\nleave  school. What has the P.A.P. done  to  obtain\r\n\r\njobs for all these job-seekers? How does the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndeal  with  this  problem of -  according  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister - sustaining   the   economic   growth    of\r\n\r\nSingapore to keep pace with the yearly increase  in\r\n\r\npopulation?  For  four years, the P.A.P. has  been\r\n\r\nplaying  politics. Although the Five-Year  Plan  in\r\n\r\nThe  Tasks Ahead was announced to the people before\r\n\r\n1959,  and  the  Four-Year  Development  Plan   was\r\n\r\nprepared  more  than two years ago, no  appreciable\r\n\r\nconcrete results have been shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialisation programme has been left\r\n\r\nstagnating  as  a  result  of  the  P.A.P. playing\r\n\r\npolitics and the Ministers' obsession to fix  their\r\n\r\npolitical opponents. The Minister boasts of pioneer\r\n\r\ncertificates  for industries, that they  will  soon\r\n\r\ncommence  operation  and  provide  jobs  for  3,500\r\n\r\npeople, and of a range of goods, which if and  when\r\n\r\nthey  go  into production, will provide  employment\r\n\r\nfor  1,620  people.  Even  if  these  figures  were\r\n\r\nrealised, for the sake of argument, it still  would\r\n\r\nnot  help  the situation. In four years  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmisrule. 30,000 times 4, that is, 120,000 young men\r\n\r\nand  women have left school to look for jobs. Where\r\n\r\nare  the  120,000  jobs for these  120,000  people?\r\n\r\nThere  have  not  been enough jobs,  and  the  only\r\n\r\nresult so far is that there is a steady increase in\r\n\r\nthe already large number of hawkers and other under-employed people. So what is there for the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\ncrow about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another aspect of this\r\n\r\nindustrialisation scheme of the P.A.P. which is not\r\n\r\nso  well  known. It is that Singapore has to  spend\r\n\r\nmillions in the provision of the basic services for\r\n\r\nthe  industrial site, namely, roads, railways, post\r\n\r\noffices,   power,  water,  telephones   and   other\r\n\r\nservices.  Now,  if this money had  been  spent  on\r\n\r\nthese   services  for  the  benefit  of  our  local\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  then it would have  been  money  well\r\n\r\nspent. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  fear,  Sir,  is that this money  will  benefit\r\n\r\nmostly  the foreign capitalists. The present trends\r\n\r\nare  that  all the benefit will go to  the  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists and not to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation has always been linked with the\r\n\r\nformation  of  the common market between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the Federation. Yet from the financial  merger\r\n\r\ntalks  between the two Governments, we  learn  that\r\n\r\nthe subject of the common market has never actually\r\n\r\nbeen  discussed until very recently. This tells  us\r\n\r\none very important thing, that during the crisis of\r\n\r\nthe chicken and egg war in November and December of\r\n\r\nlast  year  and  January of this  year,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was merely deceiving the people  when  he\r\n\r\ntold diem that there would be a common market.  Why\r\n\r\nshould the people be deceived in this manner? As we\r\n\r\nhave  all  the Time pointed out, the Causeway  will\r\n\r\nremain   a  barrier  between  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation even after the P.A.P. merger.  We  still\r\n\r\ndo not know what sort of common market arrangements\r\n\r\nthere will be, Rueff Report or no Rueff Report,  we\r\n\r\nmust hear in mind that, with overall control in the\r\n\r\nhands  of the Federation, Singapore will he treated\r\n\r\nas  and  will  remain, a very  junior  and  unequal\r\n\r\npartner.  In  which ease, all the major  industries\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be approved first by the  Federation\r\n\r\nbefore  they  will  be allowed  to  be  set  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is a far cry from the common market\r\n\r\noriginally  envisaged,  which  would  permit  joint\r\n\r\nFederation  /  Singapore control  and  planning  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  programme for all Malaya.  Now  without\r\n\r\neven  proportional  representation  to  exert   the\r\n\r\nappropriate  influence on the  Central  Parliament.\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  not be able to set  up  industries\r\n\r\nthat  may  compete with similar industries  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation, whether they be in actual operation  or\r\n\r\nstill under planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.A.P. industrialisation has obviously failed so\r\n\r\nfar   as  local  businessmen  are  concerned.   The\r\n\r\nMinisters   cannot  even  persuade  importers   and\r\n\r\ntraders    to   take   a   serious   interest    in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  Why  are  these  importers  and\r\n\r\ntraders reluctant to change to industry? There  are\r\n\r\nvarious  reasons. But a very important one is  that\r\n\r\nthere has never been political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstability  in  the country. Of course,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould  like to pass the buck on to the workers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  unions. But the facts cannot  be  hidden  so\r\n\r\neasily.  The  Government has only 25  seats  in  an\r\n\r\nAssembly  of  51, and is so afraid of  meeting  the\r\n\r\npeople  that it has not even dared to face them  in\r\n\r\nthe  Sembawang  constituency, now vacant  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  ten  months.  The P.A.P. today  exists  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  only because all the P.A.P. Assemblymen\r\n\r\nhave  a  vested  interest  in  keeping  a  wobbling\r\n\r\nGovernment  going,  and,  of  course,  because  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A./  U.M.N.O. Alliance for the Time being,  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  reasons,  want to keep  it  going.  But\r\n\r\nalready  a new crisis is looming. The Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture has  resigned\r\n\r\nfrom  his  post of Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister, and the question arises as to whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  he  will cross the Floor. Whether  or  not  he\r\n\r\ncrosses  the Floor, the new crisis merely  confirms\r\n\r\nwhat all Singapore already knows, namely, that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  is  soon  going   under.   The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nbelieves  that it is safer to depend on the  nurses\r\n\r\nand P.T. workers than on the Government itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But from all that we can see, political instability is the most decisive factor here in Singapore. The sham referendum on the 1st September, 1962, has not helped to stabilise the shaky P.A.P. Government. Even the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  said that the sham referendum  did\r\n\r\nnot  show the strength of the pro-Malaysian forces.\r\n\r\nSo  fearful,  Sir, are the investors of Singapore's\r\n\r\npolitical  instability that not so  very  long  ago\r\n\r\nNewsweek  gave  prominence to $20  million  fleeing\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore  to  Hong Kong  for  investment.  I\r\n\r\nremember the Minister for Finance saying that  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  has  succeeded  in industrialisation  because\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  trade unions in Hong Kong.  But  he\r\n\r\nconveniently  forgets that few people  today  trust\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government. Even the Federation does not\r\n\r\ntrust the P.A.P. But from that small remark by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, we can also  see  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact, the Minister secretly harbours hopes of doing\r\n\r\naway with unions that are opposed to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is curious, Sir, that with so much money\r\n\r\naround,  we  still need to borrow  money  from  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank.  A loan from the World Bank  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  confidence in the Government as the  Minister\r\n\r\nclaims.  All  sorts of conditions are imposed.  The\r\n\r\ninterest  is  not  low either.  5\u00bd  per  cent  plus\r\n\r\nincidentals comes to about 7 per cent.  Why  should\r\n\r\nwe  pay 7 per cent? The Minister should follow what\r\n\r\nhe  himself had advocated long ago, and make use of\r\n\r\nlocal   funds  for  whatever  we  want  to  do   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Why  does he not do  so?  It  would  be\r\n\r\ninteresting to learn from the Minister who are  the\r\n\r\npeople  who subscribe to the loans floated  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in Singapore. Are they local citizens or\r\n\r\nare  they  foreigners? Are the  subscribers  mostly\r\n\r\nbanks and insurance companies and, if so, are  they\r\n\r\nlocal  banks  or foreign banks? We  must  warn  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. of unnecessarily getting deeper and  deeper\r\n\r\ninto  the  clutches  of  neo-colonialism.  For  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the P.A.P. Members, neo-colonialism  is\r\n\r\neconomic  and  military domination after  political\r\n\r\nindependence  has been apparently  granted  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  As far as possible, it is our policy  that\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore should rely on the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister refers to the increased volume of trade. But it has not brought with it a corresponding increase in national income. In fact, with the falling prices of our raw materials and products and the rising prices of imported manufactured goods and foodstuffs, the loss to us of national income becomes greater and greater\r\n\r\nevery  year.  The  end result of  it  all  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will sink further and further  into  the\r\n\r\nclutches  of neo-colonialism. The present  economic\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government with its pro-colonial bias\r\n\r\ncan  only  lead us to be under tighter and  tighter\r\n\r\nforeign  indirect control which,  in  effect,  will\r\n\r\nmean  that  the rich in Singapore will get  richer,\r\n\r\nand the poor will get poorer, with a daily widening\r\n\r\nof  the economic gap. This is what we must ask  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was elected to office by the people in\r\n\r\n1959. All we ask of it is that it should admit  its\r\n\r\nmistakes of the past and immediately attend more to\r\n\r\nthe needs of the poor.

But these are not true\r\n\r\nand   sincere  concessions.  The  P.A.P. has   the\r\n\r\nintention  of collecting as much money as  possible\r\n\r\nfrom  whatever  source  there  is,  regardless   of\r\n\r\nwhether it is from the poor or the rich. It is only\r\n\r\nthe  fear of loss of whatever support there is left\r\n\r\nfor  the P.A.P. amongst the attap dwellers that the\r\n\r\nMinister   has  been  forced  to  grant   so-called\r\n\r\nconcessions. We urge the P.A.P. to change the error\r\n\r\nof its ways and stop taxing the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. takes great pride in its so-called\r\n\r\nhousing  achievements. Thousands of  housing  units\r\n\r\nhave  been  built, but they are built  in  such  an\r\n\r\nunplanned  manner that they have, in  fact,  become\r\n\r\nwhite  elephants.  Thousands  of  flats  are  still\r\n\r\nvacant,  unsuitable in site and in  rent,  for  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority  of  the people  of  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  then  arises: for whom  are  the  housing\r\n\r\nflats  built?  For the comparatively well-to-do  or\r\n\r\nfor the poor? A big show was made of Selegie House.\r\n\r\nWe just want to ask the Minister a simple question:\r\n\r\nhow  does  he  expect a poor man to  stay  in  such\r\n\r\nexpensive flats at rents of $60, $90, and $120? All\r\n\r\nthat a poor man can earn will not be enough to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  the rent. Is that the way to build houses?  Is\r\n\r\nmoney  collected  in taxes from the  poor  and  the\r\n\r\nexploited   to   be   used  as  subsidy   for   the\r\n\r\ncomparatively   well-to-do?   Are    these    flats\r\n\r\nsubsidised with taxes from the poor to he  used  as\r\n\r\nbarracks for military troops brought into Singapore\r\n\r\nto suppress the legitimate hopes and aspirations of\r\n\r\nthe people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To suppress the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What has happened to the\r\n\r\npromises of cheap housing in the P.A.P.'s Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan?

The\r\n\r\nGovernment must build for the use of the poor,  and\r\n\r\nlet   the   P.A.P. amend   its   housing   policy\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the decision of subsidy for housing,\r\n\r\nbut  let the subsidy be really used for housing for\r\n\r\nthe  poor and not for the comparatively well-to-do.\r\n\r\nWe still remember, Sir, the adamant attitude of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers  in their wanting  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nrentals  of all the Housing Board flats,  beginning\r\n\r\nwith the flats at the Kallang Airport, in spite  of\r\n\r\nstrong protests and opposition from us who are  now\r\n\r\nin  the Barisan Sosialis. And we are glad that  our\r\n\r\nstrong  protests  have borne  fruit  and  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  not  dared  to  raise  the  rents  any\r\n\r\nfurther. In fact, they have done an about-turn  and\r\n\r\nare  trying to gain the goodwill of the  people  by\r\n\r\ntelling them of Government subsidies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the Government also to spend more on\r\n\r\nimproving public amenities in the rural areas.  Let\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. not  just  concentrate  on  community\r\n\r\ncentres  and  T.V. for the  sake  of  forcing  its\r\n\r\npropaganda on the people. Let more rural  roads  be\r\n\r\nbuilt.  Let  electric lights and  pipe  water,  the\r\n\r\nessentials of a modern society, reach the  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands  in the rural areas and in the  kampongs,\r\n\r\nwhose  people  still do not enjoy  these  essential\r\n\r\namenities.  In  order  to  buy  votes,  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  announces the so-called improvements  for\r\n\r\nthe   rural  constituencies  during  his   week-end\r\n\r\nvisits. But the unfortunate thing about it  all  is\r\n\r\nthat  these improvements have come three years  too\r\n\r\nlate.  We object to the delay in the implementation\r\n\r\nof  these  projects which should have been  carried\r\n\r\nout  more than three years ago. But for the  coming\r\n\r\nelections,  these projects might  never  even  been\r\n\r\nthought  of  again by the arrogant and self-centred\r\n\r\nMinisters, so busy are they in playing politics  to\r\n\r\nfix their political opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also much talk of increased\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  Education.  But  until  today  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University question has not been  settled.\r\n\r\nThis  question  cannot be settled by just  ignoring\r\n\r\nit.  It  is  there,  and it must  be  settled.

There is no question\r\n\r\nof not having the money. Millions of dollars are in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  kitty.

Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  not  something that comes from the  spontaneous\r\n\r\ndesire of the people to have national unity. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary, Sir, it is designed to be a strategic and\r\n\r\nan  aggressive  bloc  for the  use  of  imperialist\r\n\r\npowers   to  suppress  the  legitimate  hopes   and\r\n\r\naspirations  of the people in the whole  of  South-East  Asia. More than two-thirds of the  people  in\r\n\r\nthe world condemn Malaysia. The wrangle for finance\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore for the expansion of Malaysian armed\r\n\r\nforces  tells  us  what  we  can  expect  with  the\r\n\r\nformation of Malaysia. It will not do Singapore any\r\n\r\ngood.  The  P.A.P. must realise that the future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   not  tied  up  with   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories and so with the present Malaysia  plan.\r\n\r\nOur future is with the Federation. All this talk of\r\n\r\nMalaysian   prosperity  sounds  very  hollow   when\r\n\r\ngenuine   job  opportunities  for  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore   are   restricted  to  the   island   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   People   from  all   the   surrounding\r\n\r\nterritories  can  come into Singapore  and  compete\r\n\r\nwith  the people here for jobs. On the contrary  we\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  cannot freely go to  the  other  so-called  Malaysian territories for jobs  because  of\r\n\r\nimmigration    restrictions   and   our    inferior\r\n\r\ncitizenship status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Do you want to go there yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister talks of golden\r\n\r\ngeese  and  golden  eggs.

Similarly, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill, the then leader of the Labour Front.\r\n\r\nHe  agreed  that  the  Labour Front  should  be  in\r\n\r\nalliance  with  the  P.A.P. to  contest  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil elections ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What about you now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- but too late, he found that\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front and he were just being  exploited\r\n\r\nand  they suffered terribly. Now, what happened  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim and to Messrs.  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  and  company is well known. Therefore,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwith that record behind them, this new tone in  the\r\n\r\nvoice of the Finance Minister does not convince the\r\n\r\npeople unless the P.A.P. can outlive this record of\r\n\r\na Party with the kiss of Judas. That is the fear of\r\n\r\nmany  people, the fear of the Tunku,  the  fear  of\r\n\r\nmany  in Singapore, that if they support the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nagain,  they  will  be betrayed after  the  general\r\n\r\nelections. I sincerely hope that my words  are  not\r\n\r\ntrue, that this change of heart is a deep one, that\r\n\r\nthey  can  be trusted, regardless of the result  of\r\n\r\nthe  coming elections, to be consistent  with  this\r\n\r\nnew line, this new approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now come to the question of new jobs. All\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  in Singapore  are  agreed  that\r\n\r\nthere must be more and more jobs because there  are\r\n\r\nmore and more people in Singapore, and because  the\r\n\r\nrate of increase of the population in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nso   tremendous,  then  the  rate  of  increase  of\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities must also  be  rapid.  In\r\n\r\n1959, the P.A.P. said the same thing and today they\r\n\r\nsay  the  same thing. In that, they are consistent.\r\n\r\nAll  Parties have been consistent in that. So  they\r\n\r\nsay,  [Page  49  of  the  unrevised  transcript   -\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 20, No. 5, dated 7th June, 1963, col.\r\n\r\n556]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Recognising that the creation of new jobs is of\r\n\r\nover-riding importance, the Government believes\r\n\r\nthat the attack must be mounted on s broad front.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives are the same. What we believe has\r\n\r\nbeen wrong, has been the method of achieving these\r\n\r\nobjectives with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  result  that  today  the  mistakes  made  have\r\n\r\nnullified even the efforts of previous governments.\r\n\r\nI will come to that with statistics, Sir. We cannot\r\n\r\nignore ideologies. In Singapore any Party which  is\r\n\r\nshort-sighted will adopt the policy  of  the  class\r\n\r\nstruggle.  But  in  the light of the  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and the Finance Minister knows  it,  and\r\n\r\nin  this  nuclear age, the ideology  of  the  class\r\n\r\nstruggle and of class hatred will lead Singapore to\r\n\r\ndisaster  and the world to a nuclear war.  We  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  face those facts. If we are realistic,  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  allow any resentments from the  past  to\r\n\r\nobscure the fact that for the sake of the future of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and of humanity, we must rise above  our\r\n\r\nresentments and learn to co-operate. Now,  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. fully believe in this new approach of co-operation, then there is a chance that all  Parties\r\n\r\nworking  together instead of being  at  loggerheads\r\n\r\nwith  one  another can produce a new tempo,  a  new\r\n\r\nproductivity  which  will  help  us  to  solve  our\r\n\r\nserious unemployment problem. We know that hitherto\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has played a double game with labour and\r\n\r\nmanagement.  They  have  shown  one  face  to   the\r\n\r\nemployer  and another face to the trade  union.  It\r\n\r\ntells one union to go on strike; then it tells  the\r\n\r\nemployer  to  hold on. Sir, politics  have  entered\r\n\r\ninto  the  field of labour - the Barisan for  certain\r\n\r\nunions,  the  P.A.P. for certain  unions   - and  the\r\n\r\nresult, I think, is considerable labour unrest  and\r\n\r\nstrikes,  and  the  number  of  jobs  available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  not  only increased  commensurately\r\n\r\nwith  the population, but has diminished.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1957, the Labour Ministry Report recorded\r\n\r\nthat  there were 123,000 workers in employment;  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1960, there were 105,600;  in  September\r\n\r\n1961,  there were 109,286. So after four  years  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. rule, Singapore has less jobs  for  workmen\r\n\r\nthan  in  1957. That is our present position,  that\r\n\r\nwith  increasing  population we  have  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere there are less and less jobs. I would like to\r\n\r\ninform the Finance Minister of some of the reasons.\r\n\r\nI asked one employer why, since this is a period of\r\n\r\nexpansion,  he  does not expand  and  take  in  new\r\n\r\nhands.  His reply was, \"We dare not expand  because\r\n\r\nwe  do  not know what the labour situation will  be\r\n\r\nlike  later, and if we take in new hands we  cannot\r\n\r\ndismiss   them   if   they   are   found   to    be\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory. So we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  found that the best thing to do is to  remain\r\n\r\nas  we are.\" Sir, that is a defeatist attitude  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  we  must  have  a  climate   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  so  that there is rapid  expansion  and\r\n\r\ntherefore a corresponding increase in the number of\r\n\r\njobs. I think the Finance Minister himself realises\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we come now to surpluses. It is expected\r\n\r\nthat  this  year will end with a surplus of  nearly\r\n\r\n$100  million.  The  figure given,  Sir,  is  $97.1\r\n\r\nmillion ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Last year. This year's surplus\r\n\r\nmay even be bigger because that has been the record\r\n\r\nso far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of budget surpluses, I find, is\r\n\r\nlinked   up  very  closely  with  the  problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment. Finance Ministers all over the  world\r\n\r\nwould  like to have large surpluses just as private\r\n\r\nindividuals   like  to  have  large  savings.   But\r\n\r\neconomists  say  that there  is  such  a  thing  as\r\n\r\nexcessive  surpluses, and excessive  surpluses  are\r\n\r\nbad for the people's welfare ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Talking about socialism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> If the surplus is excessive,\r\n\r\nthen either the people are being overtaxed or there\r\n\r\nis   under-expenditure  depriving  the  people   of\r\n\r\nbenefits they should have or depriving them of more\r\n\r\njobs. The remedy then could be reducing some of the\r\n\r\ntaxes,  like the taxes on petrol or providing  more\r\n\r\ntax  reliefs or spending more on projects  to  give\r\n\r\nmore employment to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I be regarded as just guessing, took\r\n\r\nthe trouble to consult an economist ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Your daughter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No. And I took the trouble to\r\n\r\nread a book on Principles of Public Finance by Hugh\r\n\r\nDalton, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> He is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> He may be dead, Sir, but his\r\n\r\nthoughts   are   still  relevant.   He   talks   of\r\n\r\noverbalanced  and  underbalanced budgets.  He  says\r\n\r\nthat    public   policy   may   sometimes   require\r\n\r\ndeliberately  that  temporary  budget  deficits  be\r\n\r\nincurred  in  pursuit of larger  aims,  notably  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  employment through  an  expansion  of\r\n\r\ncredit.   Therefore,  when  Singapore   has   large\r\n\r\nsurpluses,  although the Government may take  great\r\n\r\npride  in  them and look forward to more surpluses,\r\n\r\nthis  achievement may have been at the  expense  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. More jobs could have been\r\n\r\nproduced if more money had been spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also conscience money in that big\r\n\r\nbag. Now, as the Finance Minister is interested  in\r\n\r\nincome tax payers being honest and not cheating the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Department by keeping back some  facts\r\n\r\nabout  their incomes, in the same way I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should set a good example and  not  keep\r\n\r\nin  their surplus bags money which really does  not\r\n\r\nbelong to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were young we learnt some poetry\r\n\r\nwhich  is  relevant,  I think,  in  this  situation\r\n\r\nbecause  these  are words of wisdom  which  can  be\r\n\r\nremembered and applied even when we are old:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n               'I'll fares the land,\r\n\r\n                To hastening ills a prey,\r\n\r\n                Where wealth accumulates,\r\n\r\n                And men decay.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>And the wealth can accumulate also in a government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever anybody talks of his successes he\r\n\r\nshows  the  real  spirit of  humility  if  he  also\r\n\r\nacknowledges the debt he owes to the past,  to  his\r\n\r\npredecessors.  Now, one mistake  which  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  made and which they have not admitted so  far\r\n\r\nis  that  they  assume  that  everything  that  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in  Singapore to the credit of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbelongs to them. Nothing good came from those  past\r\n\r\ngovernments,  from  the government  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront,   of  the  imperialists - nothing.  [Laughter]\r\n\r\nEverything  good  began from 1959 onwards.  I  see,\r\n\r\nSir,   that   the  Barisan  friends  are   enjoying\r\n\r\nthemselves. Maybe they appreciate that point too ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They are behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The Finance Minister said in\r\n\r\n[page 48 of the Un-revised Transcript-Hansard, Vol.\r\n\r\n20, No. 5 dated 7th June, 1963, col. 554]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We both possessed and still so far have retained\r\n\r\nall  the pre-requisites of economic growth.

They said that it could  not\r\n\r\nbe relied upon to generate economic growth. I agree\r\n\r\nthat  we  cannot depend on that alone. But we  have\r\n\r\nheard   time  and  again  reference  made  to   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur spirit of the people of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthat is a great asset. But the mistake made by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  Sir,  is  that  they  went  to  the  other\r\n\r\nextreme.  They said they must remedy this  by  some\r\n\r\nform  of positive State action. Sir, I want to  say\r\n\r\nhere  that they took so much State action  that  it\r\n\r\nbecame  almost  gross interference with  individual\r\n\r\nenterprise and the people said that if :we have  no\r\n\r\nfreedom and we are bound by this and that, we would\r\n\r\nhave  to  go to the Federation and Hongkong.

They\r\n\r\nadmit  that  laissez faire and  the  trade  of  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  is  important  because  it   develops\r\n\r\nenterprise in each man who has got initiative,  and\r\n\r\nthere  must also be State encouragement  and  State\r\n\r\nhelp.  The reason why we are in difficulty is  that\r\n\r\nwith  the  Jurong scheme well advanced,  the  sites\r\n\r\nready,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  find  that  there  is  not  enough\r\n\r\nresponse from the industrialists and they  have  to\r\n\r\ngive some advice to the local merchants saying that\r\n\r\nthe  local  merchants had better transfer  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir  investments to industries.  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nlocal merchants are keen on making profits.

An increase  in  profit\r\n\r\nfor  any  particular company or individual  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  the criterion. The criterion  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number of people employed.  If  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  a tariff, we thereby cause  firms  and\r\n\r\norganisations to be closed for the sake  of  a  new\r\n\r\nfactory, then we have got to calculate whether  the\r\n\r\nnumber of workers thrown out of employment would be\r\n\r\nless or more.

But  in practice, it  sometimes  means\r\n\r\nover-centralisation in the hands of a few.

It is because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has betrayed the people, has departed  from\r\n\r\nits  objectives, and deviated from its  principles.\r\n\r\nWhy should the P.A.P. leaders be so bitter, as they\r\n\r\nare today? They should not he so, for they have not\r\n\r\nlost  anything. Most of them, or almost all of them\r\n\r\nhere,  came  into the picture at a  Time  when  the\r\n\r\ngoing was good - never so good in the history of  any\r\n\r\npolitical  Party in the world - when the  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nsure  of  victory, when it was sure of forming  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. They have by now enjoyed for four years\r\n\r\nand one week, Sir - and I have counted 1,467 luscious\r\n\r\ndays - and  if  at  the end of it all  they  are  not\r\n\r\nreturned  again,  they should  not  complain.  They\r\n\r\nshould he grateful to me for the lovely Time I have\r\n\r\ngiven them. Sir, half of the blame for the downfall\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. should be apportioned to the policies\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Finance. We are not concerned\r\n\r\nin   today's  Budget  debate  with  the  Minister's\r\n\r\npolitical plots, which, though misfired,  would  be\r\n\r\nmore  appropriate subjects for debate on some other\r\n\r\noccasion.  It is sufficient for today's  debate  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  Minister  for  Finance,  more  than\r\n\r\nanybody  else  in  the Government,  has  served  to\r\n\r\nalienate the people from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the word go, the Minister's financial policies were a flop. Every scheme, every new measure he introduced turned more and more sections of the people against the P.A.P. Everything that his magic wand touched turned into cold lead, generating the anger and hostility of\r\n\r\nthe  people against the P.A.P. Government. The Hong\r\n\r\nLim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby-election  was  the  water-shed  of  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicies,  in  particular  its  financial   policy.\r\n\r\nBefore   Hong  Lim,  we  had  so  many  new   taxes\r\n\r\nintroduced, new fees, new contrivances  to  squeeze\r\n\r\nthe  masses of the people. During that period,  the\r\n\r\nbig  European firms were never asked to  share  the\r\n\r\nadditional burden of taxation on a fair,  just  and\r\n\r\nequitable  basis.  The weight of  the  Government's\r\n\r\nonslaught  fell  mainly and  heavily  on  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople  and  the middle class. After Hong  Lim,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there was a moratorium. No new taxes  were\r\n\r\nintroduced.  Some old ones were even repealed.  The\r\n\r\nmiddle class was let off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant feature in this change of\r\n\r\npolicy  is that despite the change or the shift  in\r\n\r\nemphasis,  the  basic  position  has  not  altered,\r\n\r\neither   before  or  after  Hong  Lim.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment sees to it that the interest of and  the\r\n\r\nbig  profits earned and reaped by the big  European\r\n\r\nfirms  are  not  only  well protected  but  further\r\n\r\nadvanced  by it. Sir, the Hong Lim by-election  was\r\n\r\nalso  the  water-shed  of the  P.A.P.  Government's\r\n\r\nindustrial  policy. Before Hong Lim,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwas  only interested in one huge industry, a  giant\r\n\r\nsteel  mill  with  $600  million  capital  covering\r\n\r\nalmost half the area of Singapore, and when  I  was\r\n\r\nin  the P.A.P., I remember an occasion when he told\r\n\r\nme  that this giant steel mill of his could  create\r\n\r\nemployment for 80,000 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in those days, all his mind was bent on\r\n\r\nthe  fruition of this laudable project.  His  great\r\n\r\nambition was to turn Singapore into a Newcastle  or\r\n\r\nan  Anshan.  We know that it was a mirage.  It  was\r\n\r\nlike building castles in the air. I told him so  in\r\n\r\nthose  days,  but he turned a deaf ear.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  first two years of the P.A.P. Government  were\r\n\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the defeat in Hong Lim, the change came\r\n\r\nabout.  The  shift  in emphasis  came.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  gradually  began  to  understand   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  only accommodate small  and  medium\r\n\r\nscale  type of light industries. However, to  cover\r\n\r\nup the failure in the impracticability of a genuine\r\n\r\nsteel mill in Singapore, the P.A.P. Government went\r\n\r\nout of its way to give away\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillions to a scrap plant. One had already  existed\r\n\r\nin  Bukit  Timah Road for many years. I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  this  scrap  plant in Bukit  Timah  Road  was\r\n\r\nestablished  under the Lim Yew Hock Government  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  was struggling along and finding it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  carry on. This plant was  forced  to\r\n\r\nclose  down.  And  I believe it  did  approach  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  aid. But the Government  for  some\r\n\r\nreason  or  other did not come forward to  help  an\r\n\r\nexisting scrap plant. Instead, the Government  gave\r\n\r\naway  millions to a new scrap plant. Sir,  why  was\r\n\r\nthis  so?  The answer is simple. It is because,  by\r\n\r\nestablishing   a  new  scrap  plant,   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment can claim that it has established a  new\r\n\r\nindustry- a new steel mill. It can claim  that  its\r\n\r\nprogramme  of a steel mill has been realised.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  nonsense! The difference between a steel mill\r\n\r\nand a scrap plant is like the difference between  a\r\n\r\nmotor-car  factory and a motor-car assembly  plant;\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Yang-tze River and the Tebrau  River:\r\n\r\n(the Tebrau River is about six feet wide and it  is about six feet deep); between the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\na  country like India and the Prime Minister  of  a\r\n\r\nsmall semi-colonial State like Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You were the Mayor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no\r\n\r\nneed  to  ridicule that I was Mayor  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWithout that phase in history, these persons on the\r\n\r\nFront benches will never be here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Superman!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mighty Mouse!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> None of them, on their own,\r\n\r\ncould have got more than 200 votes in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

And they were  wise  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nThese  past  mistakes were realised after  so  many\r\n\r\nyears  at  the  expense  of  our  economy  and  the\r\n\r\ndeteriorating  unemployment situation.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to  be blamed  for  the  increasing\r\n\r\nnumber of people who have swelled the ranks of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed today. For the first Time in the history\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  and  under  P.A.P. rule,   a   new\r\n\r\nphenomenon  has emerged. There are now hundreds  of\r\n\r\ngraduates  from the Universities of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nNanyang,  the Polytechnic, and overseas educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions who are wanting jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is because of the failure of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  industrial policy. Despite the change  of\r\n\r\nemphasis,   the   basic  feature  of   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment's  industrial policy remains  unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe   encouragement  and  the  support   given   by\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  been  concentrated   on   foreign\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government does not bother with and is\r\n\r\nnot interested in tapping the national resources at\r\n\r\nour  disposal, our local entrepreneurs,  our  local\r\n\r\ncapital, and divert all of them into industry.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  deviated  from  its  enunciation   of\r\n\r\neconomic principles in its election manifesto,  The\r\n\r\nTasks  Ahead,  where it has solemnly declared  that\r\n\r\nlocal businessmen can help in the industrialisation\r\n\r\nof  our economy and our country and we do not  need\r\n\r\nto  depend solely on foreign capitalists. What  has\r\n\r\nhappened  to  the  P.A.P.  Government's  industrial\r\n\r\npolicy   is   the  same  as  the   Lim   Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment's.   In   fact,  even   worse.

It  is\r\n\r\nthis  blatant,  open and consistent championing  of\r\n\r\nforeign economic interests which is one of the main\r\n\r\ncontributing factors which have brought  about  the\r\n\r\ndownfall of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not against foreign capital coming in to\r\n\r\ninvest in this country, but we must give incentives\r\n\r\nto  our  local businessmen, give them  support  and\r\n\r\nencouragement,  show them how to start  industries,\r\n\r\ngive   them   more  liberal  pioneer  certificates,\r\n\r\ninstead  of giving these certificates liberally  to\r\n\r\nforeign firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said at the beginning of my\r\n\r\nspeech,  the economic policies of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  have  served more than  anything  else  to\r\n\r\nalienate  many  people from the  P.A.P.  Today  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is no more a political organisation,  but  a\r\n\r\nmere grouping of individuals hanging on together in\r\n\r\ntheir last days of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the humble trishaw-rider to the civil\r\n\r\nservants and the local businessmen, from every race\r\n\r\nand   in   every   walk  of  life  except   foreign\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, no section of the people has not  been\r\n\r\nharassed  and  oppressed by the P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nThe petrol tax, the cigarette tax, the increase  in\r\n\r\ntraffic  and  hawkers' fines, the twakow  tax,  all\r\n\r\nforms of new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxes  and  many new fees have been introduced  and\r\n\r\nhave  made  the masses of the people bitter.  Their\r\n\r\nattempts   to   introduce  the  shopkeepers'   tax,\r\n\r\nalthough  cancelled after the Hong Lim by-election,\r\n\r\nhave   annoyed  the  shopkeepers.   The   rise   in\r\n\r\nassessment  rates  on  huts  in  rural  areas   has\r\n\r\nantagonised the rural dwellers and farmers. The pay\r\n\r\ncuts,  though  restored after Hong  Lim,  have,  in\r\n\r\nconjunction   with  P.A.P. arrogance,   completely\r\n\r\nalienated  the  civil  servants  from  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. Where is the P.A.P. going to  draw  its\r\n\r\nfuture  support?  From the Work Brigade?  From  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres? I do not think that  those  who\r\n\r\nwork  in the Work Brigade and those who go  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres will support the P.A.P. when  the\r\n\r\nTime for decision comes. Even the last vestiges  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. support in Singapore - the foreign capitalists\r\n\r\nand  the local compradores -  are now switching their\r\n\r\nsupport to the M.C.A., which has made the P.A.P. so\r\n\r\nbitter  in the past few months. Sir, the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that in the first two\r\n\r\nyears  of  P.A.P. rule, how tight  was  the  money\r\n\r\ncirculation in Singapore. The economy was in a very\r\n\r\nbad  condition.  Taxis  switched  away  from  their\r\n\r\nmeters  to collecting passengers at as low as  five\r\n\r\ncents  each on some routes. What was the  cause  of\r\n\r\nall this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last year of the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment,  there  was a stop  in  new  Government\r\n\r\nconstruction   and   development   programmes.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand there is also a standstill now - that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  is  no  more  initiating   new\r\n\r\nprojects,  so  that `the next government  will  not\r\n\r\nreap  the  benefits of opening them.  This  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, playing party politics without the interest\r\n\r\nof  the people at heart. From June 1959 until about\r\n\r\nMay  1961, when the P.A.P. Government took over the\r\n\r\nlegacy  of the Lim Yew Hock Government, when  there\r\n\r\nwas  a standstill in the economy, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   embarked  on  the  suicidal   policy   of\r\n\r\ndeflation  by  pressing  even  lower  the   already\r\n\r\ndepressed economy. He did it with his pay cuts  and\r\n\r\nhis  new  taxes  on  the  poor,  which  immediately\r\n\r\nreduced spending power in the country; floating new\r\n\r\nloans  at  six  per cent interest and  keeping  the\r\n\r\nmoney presumably in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbanks  at a loss with lower interest; freezing  all\r\n\r\nmajor  Government expenditure. All this  and  other\r\n\r\nsundry   measures  to  tighten  credit  and   money\r\n\r\ncirculation have helped to bring down 1959 and 1960\r\n\r\nas   the  darkest  years  in  Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nhistory.  There  were curses everywhere.  In  those\r\n\r\ndays,  the policy of injecting more money and  more\r\n\r\ncredit  into the economy should have been  embarked\r\n\r\nupon.  On  the contrary, the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nventured   into  the  self-destruction  policy   of\r\n\r\ndeflation  and it was only due to the  catastrophic\r\n\r\ndefeat of the P.A.P. in Hong Lim, where one of  our\r\n\r\nmain planks is the P.A.P.'s financial policy, that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister realised the mistakes  of  his\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance and put a brake to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if one does not have the interest of the\r\n\r\npeople  at  heart, one can never learn. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment does not have the interest of the people\r\n\r\nat  heart and whatever, it embarks upon is for  its\r\n\r\nself-interest.  Any worthwhile  things  they  might\r\n\r\nhave done during the past one year or so were meant\r\n\r\nmerely  to capture votes or to play party politics.\r\n\r\nIt is not sincere and the people know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember the Four-Year Plan in a\r\n\r\nblue-coloured  book - the Four-Year Development  Plan\r\n\r\n1961-1964  of  the  State  of  Singapore - which  was\r\n\r\nintroduced into this Assembly at the height of  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election. Everybody knew it was for the\r\n\r\npurpose of capturing votes. After three years  have\r\n\r\nelapsed, it is very evident that the so-called Four-Year Plan was a bluff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in page 35 of the Four-Year Development Plan the Government promised to spend $650 million in 1961, 1962 and 1963 on capital development projects. I do not think the Government has fulfilled even a small quota of the Plan. The P.A.P. Ministers cannot organise the\r\n\r\nwhole government machinery into fulfilling the many\r\n\r\nprojects  envisaged in the Plan; and that  explains\r\n\r\nthe  $400  million surplus which the Government  is\r\n\r\nnow  boasting  of.  If I were on the  P.A.P.  Front\r\n\r\nbench,  I  would really be ashamed of it.  This  is\r\n\r\nanother example of the P.A.P. twisting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only item in the Four-Year Plan where the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  has made  some  headway  is  in\r\n\r\nhousing.  Sir,  when  the P.A.P.  Ministers  search\r\n\r\ntheir conscience in the dark of night - if they  ever\r\n\r\ndo so [Laughter] - they know why that is so. If I may\r\n\r\nput  it,  the Four-Year Plan, which was printed  on\r\n\r\nhigh  quality, first-class glossy paper,  bound  in\r\n\r\nthick  blue  covers at much expense to  the  State,\r\n\r\ntook  a  much  shorter  Time to  travel  into  this\r\n\r\nChamber  than  this  flimsy 1963  Budget  which  is\r\n\r\nnothing but a routine job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget has come in by the slow way, by\r\n\r\na  bullock-cart, but the Four-Year Development Plan\r\n\r\nhas  come  in  by a jet plane. It took  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  only a few weeks to cook up this  Four-Year Plan, but it took them one and a half years to\r\n\r\nframe, prepare and submit this 1963 Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give you one instance which will\r\n\r\nserve  to expose P.A.P. cheat. Since at present  we\r\n\r\nare  experiencing  the  worst  water  rationing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for many years, it is perhaps appropriate\r\n\r\nto  refer  to only one item in the Four-Year  Plan,\r\n\r\nthe  item on water. Page 77 of the Four-Year  Plan\r\n\r\nhas one paragraph to say about providing additional\r\n\r\nsupplies of water to Singapore. The Plan reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide additional supplies of water, it is\r\n\r\nproposed to have a new waterwork, the Johore  River\r\n\r\nproject,  which  will, when completed,  produce  25\r\n\r\nmillion gallons per day. Pending its completion, it\r\n\r\nis  proposed to have a stop-gap scheme, the  Scudai\r\n\r\nRiver project by means of which water will be drawn\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Scudai River to meet increased  demands,\r\n\r\nespecially  during spells of dry weather  when  the\r\n\r\nwater supply would be in a precarious position.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  Time,  it  is intended  to  augment  the\r\n\r\nstorage facilities. In this respect, it is proposed\r\n\r\nto  construct  the Seletar Dam which will  increase\r\n\r\nthe   storage  capacity  of  the  present   Seletar\r\n\r\nReservoir.  This dam will replace the existing  dam\r\n\r\nwhich is too low resulting in low storage and  less\r\n\r\neffective  utilisation of total rainfall.  Further,\r\n\r\nit  is  proposed to construct another  two  Service\r\n\r\nReservoirs, one at Telok Blangah and the  other  at\r\n\r\nJurong,  to  increase storage of treated  water  to\r\n\r\nbalance the peak and idle low pressures, since  the\r\n\r\npressure  variations  in these  areas  tend  to  be\r\n\r\nmarked.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, so many schemes to augment our water supply. None of these schemes have been carried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout.  Only the Scudai River Scheme  - one out  of  so\r\n\r\nmany,  a stop-gap scheme due to P.A.P. inefficiency\r\n\r\nwhere  millions of dollars were spent and would  be\r\n\r\nwasted  - a scheme which had merely been scratched on\r\n\r\nthe surface. By this month, in June 1963, according\r\n\r\nto  the Four-Year Plan, it is proposed to spend $13\r\n\r\nmillion on another more important scheme - the Johore\r\n\r\nRiver project. From what we can read in the papers,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is still debating on this  project,\r\n\r\nand therefore not even within smelling distance  of\r\n\r\ninitiating the project. Nothing has been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Johore River project - not done; the Scudai River - just only\r\n\r\nscratched; the Seletar Dam - has not been done; Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  Reservoir - not done;  Jurong  Reservoir - not\r\n\r\ndone.  Five  schemes - all not done. Only the  Scudai\r\n\r\nRiver scheme has been scratched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it shows that the Four-Year Plan is nothing but a device to deceive the people for the purpose of electioneering. Sir, every Time I hear about this $400 million surplus, which was repeated in this Chamber again yesterday, I laugh. The moral of it is like that of a father\r\n\r\nsending  his  son  with $3 to a  shop  to  buy  ten\r\n\r\nkatties of rice. The son played truant and, instead\r\n\r\nof  going  to the shop, had a game of marbles.  The\r\n\r\nshop  having closed after the boy had finished  his\r\n\r\ngame, he returned home without rice for the evening\r\n\r\nmeal.   Being  a  very  smart  boy - and  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  are very smart boys, there is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nabout it - and before the father could scold and cane\r\n\r\nhim,  he  jumped  up and exclaimed to  his  father,\r\n\r\n\"Daddy, daddy, I have saved $3 for you.\" The family\r\n\r\nwent without rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if I remember rightly, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance once said that this surplus money has  been\r\n\r\ninvested mostly in countries overseas. Sir, on  the\r\n\r\none hand, we are investing hundreds of millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  overseas, but, on the other hand,  we  are\r\n\r\nborrowing,  begging  a  few  tens  of  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  from  the World Bank at a higher  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest and with all sorts of conditions attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Low interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> This is P.A.P. finance.

Even their Parliamentary Secretaries are getting fed up and quitting one by one. They have no more confidence in whatever the Government says or does. For instance, in the past few weeks the people were not jubilant over the announcement that the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  a  common market  has  been  reached\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Governments  of  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  They have seen too many  sell-outs  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government. They are only watching  the\r\n\r\nsituation  closely  until the  details  are  known.\r\n\r\nCould it be another attempt to cover up P.A.P. sins\r\n\r\nand P.A.P. sell-outs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have reached the stage that whatever the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government says is never believed, is always\r\n\r\ndistrusted.  Can  a  Party,  arriving  at  such   a\r\n\r\npredicament  and such a situation, still  hold  out\r\n\r\nhopes  of staging a come-back? It is easier  for  a\r\n\r\ncamel  to  go through the eye of a needle than  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to  stage a political  come-back.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. could very soon only interest  students  of\r\n\r\nhistory  It is finished. There is no use to  stifle\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members in this  Chamber.  By  its\r\n\r\nmanoeuvres during the past few days, each of us was\r\n\r\ngiven so little Time to study the Budget. But,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, the opposition to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  not  only  found in this Assembly Chamber,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are more than a million of them outside  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we had\r\n\r\na  very  interesting half-hour just  now  when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim was on his feet.

He  tries\r\n\r\nto explain in his Budget Speech the manner in which\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government is going about to ensure that\r\n\r\nthere is greater industrialisation in Singapore, so\r\n\r\nthat  more and more employment opportunities  could\r\n\r\nbe offered to the mass of unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tackle his Budget speech in the\r\n\r\nsequence  that it has been presented. On the  first\r\n\r\npage  of  his Budget speech he says there are  only\r\n\r\ntwo  outstanding issues remaining to be settled  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the financial talks which the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been  having with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we had a very lengthy debate on the\r\n\r\nprogress that these talks have taken, and the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  considered it to be such a good  tactical\r\n\r\nmove  that he moved an amendment in order  to  nail\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, particularly us,  whom  he  rudely\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  the  agents of principals  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  Sir, we gave our support to the  amendment\r\n\r\nbecause  we feel, in the same manner as the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfeel  (if  they honestly feel), that the  financial\r\n\r\ntalks in Kuala Lumpur have been dragged on for  too\r\n\r\nlong and that some finality must be reached so that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  can come into existence on  the  31st  of\r\n\r\nAugust.  He  did disclose in his speech last  night\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  were to give him our support  in  his\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to the Federation Government,  his\r\n\r\nGovernment would feel greatly strengthened  in  its\r\n\r\nrepresentations in the talks that will be resumed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearly  next week. We gladly  give  him  that\r\n\r\nsupport and we hope that with it he will be able to\r\n\r\nsecure for the people of Singapore terms that  will\r\n\r\nbe in the best interest of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance in his speech has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the most important pursuit in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  trade  and its related occupations  -  banking,\r\n\r\nshipping and transportation. We agree with him, and\r\n\r\nwe  also agree with him when he says that it  would\r\n\r\nbe an error to take measures harmful to established\r\n\r\neconomic  functions in the quest of  something  new\r\n\r\nand  uncertain.  Not only should  we  maintain  and\r\n\r\nimprove our efficiency as a trading centre, but  we\r\n\r\nshould also do so in other established lines.  This\r\n\r\nthen  brings me to the industrialisation policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and to their claim  that  a  common\r\n\r\nmarket  for Malaysia would be in the best interests\r\n\r\nof industrialisation in Singapore and would help to\r\n\r\nbuild up the economy of Singapore. I will touch  on\r\n\r\nthat when I come to his speech on industrialisation\r\n\r\nand the common market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is nearly five o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It would seem that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  wants a tea-break.

The Opposition cannot but take\r\n\r\nvery  strong objection to the manner in  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is treating this Budget debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government says that it has a\r\n\r\nwonderful industrialization programme. It  must  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  that it tried all it could  to  implement\r\n\r\nits   industrialization  policy,   and,   in   this\r\n\r\nimplementation,  it  did  adopt  certain   of   the\r\n\r\nimportant  measures  that were  introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government,  such  as  the  granting   of\r\n\r\npioneer certificates, tax holidays, inducements  by\r\n\r\noffering industrial sites at very attractive rates.\r\n\r\nBut one thing the P.A.P. has done which has damaged\r\n\r\nthe   industrialization  policy  is  that  it   has\r\n\r\nactively participated in the trade union war. It is\r\n\r\nuseless  to offer all kinds of inducements such  as\r\n\r\npioneer  status, tax holidays and sites at economic\r\n\r\nrents  if there is industrial unrest. What is  more\r\n\r\nreprehensible is that such industrial unrest  arose\r\n\r\nas a result of P.A.P. manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has been in office for the past\r\n\r\nfour years and all its industrialization policy and\r\n\r\nits  claim  to  having industrialized Singapore  is\r\n\r\njust  nothing but a paper claim. I have heard,  and\r\n\r\neven  the  Minister  has  himself  said,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has set aside large sums  of  money  to\r\n\r\nlend  to would-be industrialists. That would  be  a\r\n\r\nvery   big   draw,   lending  money   to   would-be\r\n\r\nindustrialists to open up factories.  Despite  this\r\n\r\nvery  attractive offer, there have been very,  very\r\n\r\nfew  industrialists  taking advantage  of  it.  The\r\n\r\nreason  is obvious. The labour situation is out  of\r\n\r\nhand.  The Government claims that these politically\r\n\r\ninspired  labour  troubles are  happily  now  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Where  is  the  control?  The  number  of\r\n\r\nstrikes  keeps  mounting  up,  and  even   an   ex-Parliamentary  Secretary of the Government  is  now\r\n\r\nwith the pickets on strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Leader of the House\r\n\r\ncalls it \"democracy\", but I say that it is a P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntwist  of  the meaning of \"democracy\" to pay  money\r\n\r\nout  of  public funds to a Member, to  make  him  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, to make use of him to  try\r\n\r\nand  control the civil service for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. But, as there is a God above us, it has\r\n\r\nboomeranged. What they hoped to control has now got\r\n\r\nout of hand. And yet the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsays  that the politically-inspired labour troubles\r\n\r\nare now under control. It is because of this labour\r\n\r\nunrest  that industrialists are rather hesitant  to\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore and open up factories, and it  is\r\n\r\nalso  because of this unhealthy climate that  there\r\n\r\nhave been more and more factories opening up in the\r\n\r\nFederation.  And  now to beat  this  labour  unrest\r\n\r\nwhich   has  come  about  as  a  result  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmanoeuvres,  the Government thought of another  way\r\n\r\nto induce capital to come into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. Government took office in\r\n\r\n1959, and in order to lay claim that new industries\r\n\r\nhad  been  set  up almost overnight,  they  gave  a\r\n\r\nBritish-owned tobacco company, known as the Malayan\r\n\r\nTobacco Distributors Limited, the opportunity to re-start  its  factory in Tanjong Pagar with  100  per\r\n\r\ncent   British  capital.  When  we  were   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, this Company approached us with a  view\r\n\r\nto reopening that tobacco factory. We did not allow\r\n\r\nit  to  reopen  except with the acceptance  of  our\r\n\r\ncondition that local capital participation must  be\r\n\r\naccepted  by the company to the extent  of  51  per\r\n\r\ncent local capital. We felt that this condition was\r\n\r\nimperative   in   the   interests   of   Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially as we knew that the very minute the well-known   brands  of  this  company  like  \"Players\",\r\n\r\n\"Capstan\"    and   other   popular   brands    were\r\n\r\nmanufactured in Singapore, they would knock out all\r\n\r\nthe  other  local brands manufactured by  factories\r\n\r\nowned  by  local capital. But the P.A.P., in  their\r\n\r\nwisdom  to show that they had new factories opening\r\n\r\nup,  allowed  this tobacco company to re-open  with\r\n\r\n100  per cent British capital and, as we knew,  the\r\n\r\nlocal  factories of other brands that  were  making\r\n\r\ngood business had to close down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government are very fond of claiming\r\n\r\nthat they are the true socialists of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nyet  they sold away the rights of local capital  to\r\n\r\nBritish  vested  interests. Yet  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance in his speech says that local capital  need\r\n\r\nnot  worry,  that there is a place for  them,  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  divert  their  capital  from  trade  and\r\n\r\ncommerce  to  industry.  But  when  there  was   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  local capital to  have  a  proper\r\n\r\nshare of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe profits of the manufacture of popular brands of\r\n\r\ncigarettes in Singapore, the Government  just  gave\r\n\r\nthem away to British vested interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, Sir, of the P.A.P. Government's\r\n\r\ndesire  to produce results, whatever the  cost,  is\r\n\r\nthis oil refinery at Pasir Panjang. During our time\r\n\r\nthe Shell Company negotiated with us for occupation\r\n\r\nof  that  piece of land. We were adamant.  We  were\r\n\r\nquite  firm  in  our  attitude  towards  the  Shell\r\n\r\nCompany,  because our view was that  as  they  were\r\n\r\nmaking  good money, there was no reason  why  there\r\n\r\nshould be special concession rates offered to  them\r\n\r\nfor  that piece of land at Pasir Panjang, Labrador.\r\n\r\nWe were firm.

When the Government took office in its very first stage, \"Ah, we must have a common commodity market.\" He seems to think that that is a wonderful thing and he ran down the previous Government. He said, \"Ah, the previous Government never thought of that idea.\" The pros and cons of\r\n\r\nthe common market have not yet been debated in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  but the way this Government is going  about\r\n\r\ntrying to secure a common market is making it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult. A common market is meant for the good of\r\n\r\nall  the participants. A common market is not meant\r\n\r\nfor  serious competition between participants.  The\r\n\r\nprevious Government had thought and discussed  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government that a  better  way  of\r\n\r\nprotecting industry on a Pan-Malayan basis - at  that\r\n\r\nTime  it  was Pan-Malayan, there was no thought  of\r\n\r\nPan-Malaysian  - was for a Joint Committee to  advise\r\n\r\nboth  Governments on the types of  industries  that\r\n\r\ncould  be set up. If it was felt that because there\r\n\r\nis  rubber in the Federation it is better for  them\r\n\r\nto  manufacture  rubber shoes and rubber  slippers,\r\n\r\nthen  no  rubber shoes and rubber slippers need  be\r\n\r\nmade  in Singapore. And if it was felt that it  was\r\n\r\nbetter  for  textiles and shirts to be manufactured\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, then there need not be a factory  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation to manufacture textiles and shirts.\r\n\r\nSo  in this way there would be a fair distribution.\r\n\r\nThere would not be that element of competition. And\r\n\r\nif  the  Singapore Government want  to  enter  into\r\n\r\ncompetition with the Federation Government, can  we\r\n\r\nexpect  the two competitors will sit down to  think\r\n\r\nof  a  way out whereby both competitors can  go  to\r\n\r\ntown?  It  cannot be done that way. Here they  have\r\n\r\noil  refineries in the Federation  - you know we have\r\n\r\noil  refineries here all right. But now rush on  to\r\n\r\nanother oil refinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is not the Government's\r\n\r\nrefinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is not the Government's\r\n\r\nrefinery but it is the Government that is going  to\r\n\r\ngrant  all the facilities for this refinery  to  be\r\n\r\nstarted in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If they want to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And in fact this company, if I\r\n\r\nread   it  correctly,  is  also  demanding  certain\r\n\r\nassurances from the Government. I do not know  what\r\n\r\nthose  assurances  are, but  anyway,  unless  those\r\n\r\nassurances  are  satisfied  by  a  Government  that\r\n\r\nclaims to be socialist, by a Government that  tells\r\n\r\nlocal   capital  that  their  interests   will   be\r\n\r\nprotected, that company may not start. But the fact\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  come  out in the papers  means  that\r\n\r\nassurances  have  already been  given.  What  those\r\n\r\nassurances are is always done in the P.A.P. style,\r\n\r\nnever  disclose.  What will be the  effect  on  the\r\n\r\ncommon   market   talks?  Not  knowing   what   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the Rueff Commission  are,  we\r\n\r\ncannot debate on that. But there is one point  that\r\n\r\nhas  been  brought out by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nHe  says,  \"You  know, we have this common  market.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have to have bonded warehouses  for\r\n\r\ngoods  manufactured  either  in  Singapore  or   in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  where there is this common market.  Never\r\n\r\nmind  the  people oil Singapore will benefit.\"  But\r\n\r\nhow will it benefit the people of Singapore if they\r\n\r\nhave  to pay more for goods which they are used  to\r\n\r\nhaving as a result of tariffs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a free port and therefore goods\r\n\r\nmanufactured  in  the Federation or  elsewhere  can\r\n\r\ncome freely into Singapore. The Singapore market is\r\n\r\nalready  open to the Federation, but the Federation\r\n\r\nmarket  is  not open to Singapore goods. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  common market is aimed at allowing  Singapore\r\n\r\ngoods  to  flow  freely into  the  Federation.  But\r\n\r\nsurely, Sir, the price that has to be paid for that\r\n\r\nfree  flow of Singapore manufactured goods  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  going to be a price the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  have to pay. Suppose  shirts  were\r\n\r\nmanufactured  here, because of this  common  market\r\n\r\nagreement, the local people would have  to  pay  an\r\n\r\nextra tax for all foreign-made shirts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What is yours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Tooth paste is one of the\r\n\r\ncommodities   in  this  common  market   agreement.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  tooth  paste manufactured  outside  and\r\n\r\nsold in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  sold at a  higher  price.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  Government  can  say  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore can buy locally manufactured tooth paste,\r\n\r\nbut  the Government cannot ride roughshod over  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there  is  such a thing  as  consumer's\r\n\r\nprejudice.  It is strange that although  a  certain\r\n\r\nthing  is manufactured locally and there is a known\r\n\r\nsimilar  product  manufactured outside,  a  product\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  used  to, we keep  on  buying  that\r\n\r\nproduct. Therefore, the people will have to  pay  a\r\n\r\nhigher price for what they are used to getting.  It\r\n\r\ndepends  on what the common market is for. We  keep\r\n\r\non  talking  about  the common market  without  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance letting us know what the terms\r\n\r\nof the common market are. We do not know the terms,\r\n\r\nso  we cannot debate them. But I want to point  out\r\n\r\nthat  no  matter  What it is, a Common  Market  may\r\n\r\nresult  in higher prices of goods which the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  are  used to having.  There  is  one\r\n\r\nsentence  here that has got me tickled  about  this\r\n\r\nCommon  Market  on  page 55 [Unrevised  Transcript]\r\n\r\n(Hansard, col. 564). The Minister for Finance  says\r\n\r\nin his speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For nearly four years we have strained every\r\n\r\nresource and ingenuity to achieve it,'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>For  nearly  four  years they have  strained  every\r\n\r\nresource  and  ingenuity. Ingenuity! What  kind  of\r\n\r\ningenuity? Just to show that they are cleverer than\r\n\r\nthe  Federation! Is it ingenuity to allow a hundred\r\n\r\nper  cent foreign capital to start a refinery  here\r\n\r\nin  Singapore? Ingenuity indeed! Is it ingenuity to\r\n\r\ngo  about telling the people of Singapore  how  bad\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of  the Federation  was?  Is  that\r\n\r\ningenuity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they call that ingenuity, they are\r\n\r\nentitled  to  call it, but I call  it  nothing  but\r\n\r\nP.A.P. twist and double talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 56 [Unrevised Transcript] (Hansard, col.\r\n\r\n566)  we see the Minister for Finance crowing  that\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board completed 12,230\r\n\r\nhouses,  but  during  the debate  on  the  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech  I pointed out to the Government that  there\r\n\r\nwere 4,000 units\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunoccupied-vacant-resulting in a loss of revenue to\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board of a few hundred\r\n\r\nthousand dollars a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that the way to look after the economy of the\r\n\r\ncountry?

Although the Government in its Four-Year  Development Programme has stated  very,  very\r\n\r\ncategorically that it would proceed with the  water\r\n\r\nscheme  more than two years ago, it has  failed  in\r\n\r\nthis  important task. Singapore is facing  a  water\r\n\r\nshortage for the second time since the P.A.P. took\r\n\r\noffice. Why was there a delay in implementing  this\r\n\r\nscheme?  It  was  because the Government  wants  to\r\n\r\nborrow $50 million from the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nis  fond  of  saying  rubbish, but  did  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  not  say that when we were  debating  the\r\n\r\nBill  to enable the Government to enter into a loan\r\n\r\nagreement?

They tried to claim\r\n\r\nthat the budgeting of a subsidy to the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board is an innovation  introduced  by\r\n\r\nthem.  This is not correct. The previous Government\r\n\r\nhad  already started this. That there should be  no\r\n\r\nhidden subsidies in the S.I.T. it was arranged that\r\n\r\nevery  year the S.I.T. would have to apply  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for a Vote for the subsidy in rents. Now\r\n\r\nthey  try  to  run down the previous Government  by\r\n\r\nsaying  this,  and  I could not allow  this  to  go\r\n\r\nwithout  challenge. And this is what  the  Minister\r\n\r\nsays,  on  page  61  of  the  unrevised  transcript\r\n\r\n[Hansard, col. 574]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I should mention here that a substantial subsidy\r\n\r\narose  from the uneconomic rents which the previous\r\n\r\nadministration had fixed in 1958/59 shortly  before\r\n\r\nthe general elections.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  an allegation which I cannot accept.

He said that this year has been\r\n\r\na  very  good financial year. There is  no  problem\r\n\r\nexcept  that the question of the common market  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  resolved  yet. In  his  speech  when  he\r\n\r\nreviewed  the  economic situation of Singapore,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  in 1962 the people of Singapore  bought\r\n\r\nmore cars, more refrigerators, more radio sets  and\r\n\r\nmore cameras. He also said that more people went to\r\n\r\nthe cinemas to enjoy the pictures. That was why, he\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  people of Singapore had  been  enjoying\r\n\r\nbetter  amenities  and had more enjoyment  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular  year. If it had been true,  then  there\r\n\r\nmust have been peace and prosperity in Singapore. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  picture  as presented  by  the Minister for Finance is true. But the question  is, who bought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  cars?  Which  class  of  people  bought  those\r\n\r\nthings, such as cameras? Who enjoyed these luxuries\r\n\r\nof  life?  The Minister for Finance did  not  point\r\n\r\nthat  out. We say that for the past one year  there\r\n\r\nwere many symptoms, facts and phenomena which go to\r\n\r\nshow  that the labouring class and the poorer class\r\n\r\nof Singapore have been worse off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you have seen that there are increasing numbers of hawkers. Why is that so? In the Press every day, we can read lots of news concerning more and more robberies, thefts and all sorts of crimes. If the people have been enjoying a better livelihood and have been enjoying a more prosperous year, how is that there have been so\r\n\r\nmany criminal activities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has built a good number of\r\n\r\nhousing units with all sorts of sanitary amenities.\r\n\r\nHow   is   that  that  there  are  so  many   units\r\n\r\nvacant - 4,000 units are still vacant? It is  because\r\n\r\nthe  people have not been able to afford to pay the\r\n\r\nrents.   If   there  had  been  opportunities   for\r\n\r\nemployment,   then  why  should   there   be   such\r\n\r\nphenomena?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of gambling has also increased. We\r\n\r\nread  also  from  the  Press  that  more  and  more\r\n\r\ngraduates   of  secondary  schools   as   well   as\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  higher  institutes  of  learning\r\n\r\nadvertise  in  the newspapers for jobs  as  private\r\n\r\ntutors. They have been looking everywhere for jobs.\r\n\r\nAll these go to show one aspect of the true picture\r\n\r\nwhich  the Minister for Finance has not been daring\r\n\r\nenough to point out to the people of Singapore.  It\r\n\r\nis   that  the  working  people  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nbecoming worse off and their livelihood is becoming\r\n\r\nmore difficult day by day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance, in his speech, said that if the volume of Singapore's exports increased, then the employment opportunities and the income of the people would accordingly increase. Perhaps statistics clearly show that in the past one year the volume of exports in tonnage has increased, but the Minister for Finance has not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to cover one aspect of it, which is that\r\n\r\nin the past one year the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprices of the basic local produce have fallen.  The\r\n\r\nprice  of  rubber  has also fallen.  The  price  of\r\n\r\ncoconut oil has also dropped. The prices for pepper\r\n\r\nand  coffee have also dropped in the past one year.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  that? And why did the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nnot  dare  to  point out these facts? The  fall  in\r\n\r\nprice   has   increased   the   profits   of    the\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figures of exports and imports given by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance, we can see that under the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. rule, Singapore's colonial economic system,\r\n\r\nwhich is subjected to foreign exploitation, has not\r\n\r\nchanged.  For the foreign industrialised  countries\r\n\r\nprofits   have   increased  more.   These   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries   could  therefore  benefit   more   from\r\n\r\nSingapore and thus benefit the bourgeois  and  they\r\n\r\ncan  throw out more crumbs. Now can we say that  it\r\n\r\nis  a  merit to the P.A.P.? It is not. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance seems to be satisfied with last year's\r\n\r\nfinal  results and has credited this to the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  and P.A.P. policy. But I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  shameful. The P.A.P. has left  the  socialist\r\n\r\nline and stand. That is why it has been expelled by\r\n\r\nall socialist parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a socialist political Party, with a socialist\r\n\r\nplatform,  the main concern of such a Party  should\r\n\r\nbe  how  to  distribute wealth,  the  profits  from\r\n\r\nSingapore's  entrepot trade. In their  distribution\r\n\r\nof  the  profits, have the P.A.P. changed? We  have\r\n\r\nseen  that during P.A.P. rule, the total number  of\r\n\r\nemployed workers has not increased. Even the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  has pointed this out  just  now.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance knows this very well. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  at  rallies and on various other occasions  he\r\n\r\nhas dared not point out these facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech he has only pointed out that there\r\n\r\nhave  been  larger surpluses in the  previous  year\r\n\r\nwhich  have been derived from such taxes as customs\r\n\r\ntax,  property  tax, tobacco tax,  petrol  tax  and\r\n\r\nothers. But who has paid most of these taxes? I can\r\n\r\nsay  the labouring class. From this we can see that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government have squeezed a great deal of\r\n\r\ntaxes from the large masses of the labouring class,\r\n\r\nbut  they  have not used the taxation derived  from\r\n\r\nthem for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  these  people. The  Jurong  industrial\r\n\r\nsite,   the   making  of  roads,  the   supply   of\r\n\r\nelectricity,  water-all these projects  and  social\r\n\r\namenities  depend on money derived  from  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople in various forms of taxes. Therefore, we can\r\n\r\nsee  that  the so-called Development Plans  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  nothing to be praised  about  because\r\n\r\nthey  use  revenue derived from the poor people  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  foreign capitalists and to give them  more\r\n\r\nconcessions  and  better terms to make  more  money\r\n\r\nlocally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government have been boasting about\r\n\r\ntheir  housing  plan, but they dare not  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  behind these buildings there are poor  people\r\n\r\nliving in houses which are in a very bad condition.\r\n\r\nThey talk about the Toa Payoh Housing Plan. Why  is\r\n\r\nit  that  the people living in that area  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen   willing  to  remove  especially   when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment are going to provide them with very good\r\n\r\nhousing accommodation? The Government blame this on\r\n\r\nCommunist instigation, but, in fact, it is  because\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government do not have a proper plan  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the project in that area and  have  not\r\n\r\npaid   sufficient   attention  to   the   immediate\r\n\r\ninterests of the people staying there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in Toa Payoh there are many poor\r\n\r\npeople who, in addition to growing vegetables,  are\r\n\r\nalso  engaged  in  many other  sidelines,  such  as\r\n\r\nmaking  bean  curd, bean shoots,  rattan  work  and\r\n\r\nthings  like that, the so-called cottage or  family\r\n\r\nindustries.  But  the  Government  have  not   paid\r\n\r\nattention to these other means of livelihood.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  these people are not willing to move  out.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  remove, how are they to maintain  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood and earn money? The Government have  not\r\n\r\npaid   sufficient   attention  to   these   people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   do  the  so-called  industrialisation,\r\n\r\neconomic  development, and the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard and all these other things mean that they can\r\n\r\nboast  about them? But these poor people  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen   paid  sufficient  attention  by   the   PAP.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  P.A.P. Government  want  to  show\r\n\r\ntheir  achievements, such as building houses;  but,\r\n\r\non the other hand, they are ignoring the livelihood\r\n\r\nof these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you explain away this sort of policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have been able to see the building\r\n\r\nof  bridges  and the installation of street  lights\r\n\r\nand  stand-pipes in the rural areas. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  done a lot in this respect. One thing I do not\r\n\r\nunderstand  is  this. They have put  up  all  these\r\n\r\nthings,  e.g. in the Ponggol and Serangoon  areas,\r\n\r\nbut  for  the things that they have failed  to  do,\r\n\r\nthey put all the blame on my shoulders. This is one\r\n\r\nof the things that I do not understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, perhaps you will remember when I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, I was appointed Chairman of the Rural and Urban Services Consultative Committee. I believe there are many Backbenchers in the Government who know how much money the Committee had at its\r\n\r\ndisposal when I was the Chairman. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  refused to provide us with money.  Because\r\n\r\nof  the refusal of the Treasury to provide us  with\r\n\r\nmoney,  many  of  the programmes  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  were not implemented. At that time,  the\r\n\r\nCity Council Treasurer wrote to us saying that this\r\n\r\nCommittee had no legal rights to ask for money from\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury  because  the  Committee  was  not  a\r\n\r\nstatutory body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are these. The P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\ninstalling  these  stand-pipes  and  street  lights\r\n\r\nbecause of the coming general election. That is why\r\n\r\nthey  are  trying to do something. And the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, in order to further his own interests,\r\n\r\nhas seen fit to give some money in order to improve\r\n\r\nthe  amenities in the rural areas so as to  deceive\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Bras Basah left the .P.A.P.\r\n\r\nshe pointed out in this House that, when she was  a\r\n\r\nmember of the Rural and Urban Services Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee, the Committee threatened to resign if it\r\n\r\nwas not provided with money. Sir, from this, we can\r\n\r\nsee   that  the  economic  policy  of  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister was not aimed at bettering the lot of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  This blame should not fall on  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbut on the Minister for Finance alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Minister for Finance also\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  stability on the industrial  front,\r\n\r\nand  that  this  was attributed to  the  repressive\r\n\r\naction  taken by the P.A.P. I say that this is  all\r\n\r\nwrong.  The  fact is that the progressive  workers'\r\n\r\norganisations have matured in the past  few  years.\r\n\r\nAs   long   as  they  are  safeguarded   in   their\r\n\r\norganisations and they have the right  to  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves,  they will be able to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the nation, provided their legitimate\r\n\r\nrights are looked after. The decrease in the number\r\n\r\nof  strikes  was  not  because  of  the  Government\r\n\r\npolicy. This was brought about as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nco-operation  between employers and  employees.  It\r\n\r\nwas  also  because  of  the  confidence  the  local\r\n\r\nemployers  had in the Left-wing trade unions.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  we  have  been able to  see  quite  stable\r\n\r\nindustrial   relations   between   employers    and\r\n\r\nemployees in the past years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. thinks that it can make use of\r\n\r\nrepressive  actions and the Police  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of strikes. I say that this is a very  wrong\r\n\r\napproach.   If  the  working  class  have   genuine\r\n\r\ngrievances they will not kow-tow or succumb to this\r\n\r\nhigh-handed action. The glowing picture painted  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance about Singapore's economic\r\n\r\nactivities  cannot conceal this fact. Although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been able to accumulate  surpluses,\r\n\r\nthese  surpluses have not been equally  distributed\r\n\r\namong  the population. The overall increase in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  surpluses  points  to  one  thing:  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore can maintain their prosperity\r\n\r\nthrough maintaining its entrepot trade. In the next\r\n\r\nfive or ten years they can depend on themselves  to\r\n\r\nexpand  their  prosperity  without  help  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  But  the  P.A.P.,  because  of   their\r\n\r\nattempt to prolong their political life, have  sold\r\n\r\nout  the  rights  of economic independence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore. The P.A.P. Government  intend\r\n\r\nto  deceive the people by saying that after  merger\r\n\r\nthere  will  be very good conditions in respect  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and that there will be  a  common\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speech of the Minister for Finance and\r\n\r\nthe  statement delivered by the Prime  Minister  on\r\n\r\nthe progress on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  financial talks, we are able to see  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole picture of a common market is not very clear.\r\n\r\nAll  the  terms are not finalised yet.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment try to deceive the people in the  matter\r\n\r\nof  economy by saying that after Malaysia  all  our\r\n\r\neconomic  problems can be resolved. All  this  talk\r\n\r\ncannot deceive the people. We have a very grave and\r\n\r\nserious  unemployment  problem,  and  so  has   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government. I do not understand how  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance can come to this  conclusion,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  unemployment  plus  unemployment  equals\r\n\r\nprosperity.  He also mentioned in his speech  about\r\n\r\nGovernment's effort on technical education. He also\r\n\r\nboastfully said that we have a Polytechnic and  the\r\n\r\nFaculty  of Science in the University of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  can  cater for the training of  professional\r\n\r\npersonnel  and  that  the  courses  which  are  not\r\n\r\nprovided  locally  for the training  of  our  local\r\n\r\npeople  will  be provided by other countries  under\r\n\r\nthe Colombo Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the Minister for Finance of one thing. The P.A.P.'s so-called technical education is biased in favour of English education. In the Polytechnic, the University of Singapore and the so-called Secondary Technical School, in all these institutes of learning, the\r\n\r\nmedium  of instruction is English. That is to  say,\r\n\r\nthose  who are not educated in English are deprived\r\n\r\nof  an  opportunity to receive technical education.\r\n\r\nIf   the  P.A.P. does  not  want  to  change  this\r\n\r\npolicy - even if they want to change it  now,  it  is\r\n\r\ntoo  late - the problem of unemployment in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  get worse especially for those who come  from\r\n\r\nChinese  schools; then there will be grave problems\r\n\r\nin  the future. Therefore, the P.A.P.'s support  of\r\n\r\nthe  English-educated in the  matter  of  technical\r\n\r\neducation  can only ensure the English-educated  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to get technical education. This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery dangerous and risky approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with one point raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill, which is about the Work Brigade.  In\r\n\r\nhis speech the Minister for Finance pointed out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the Work Brigade was not expanded according to\r\n\r\nthe   original  plan  because  there  had  been   a\r\n\r\nreduction of applicants into the Work Brigade.  The\r\n\r\noriginal  intention of setting up the Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nis  to  alleviate the unemployment problem  in  the\r\n\r\nform   of   public   assistance.  With   increasing\r\n\r\nunemployment, why is it that the Work Brigade, as a\r\n\r\nsocial  relief  work, is not able to  attract  more\r\n\r\npeople?  The  correct  inference  is  that,   being\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  the P.A.P., it is no  more  than  a\r\n\r\nparty piece of machinery. That is why they are  not\r\n\r\nwilling,  for the sake of half a bowl of  rice,  to\r\n\r\nbecome lackeys of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on economic problems the fundamental thing is the economic system of a country. In the manifesto of the P.A.P., it is clearly stated that the P.A.P. was determined to alter the system of distribution of wealth. However, the P.A.P. has forgotten about this pledge\r\n\r\nof eliminating the system of exploitation of man by\r\n\r\nman   according  to  the  socialist  platform.  The\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech is a confession that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis   now  working  for  the  vested  interests   of\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan  countries. They  have  now  lost  all\r\n\r\ntheir   revolutionary  fervour.  They  shout  about\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and foreign investment, but today\r\n\r\neveryone  of  us can see that although Britain  and\r\n\r\nthe U.S. are highly industrialised countries, there\r\n\r\nare  millions of unemployed people there.  How  can\r\n\r\nthey  come here to help the people in the  colonial\r\n\r\nterritories  when they have millions of  people  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  countries who have no jobs? Because  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's unique geographical position,  that  is\r\n\r\nwhy  when the colonialist countries intend to carry\r\n\r\nout  exploitation  in  this  area,  they  must   do\r\n\r\nsomething  for  the  benefit of  the  people  here.\r\n\r\nBecause   of   their   connections   with   British\r\n\r\ninterests,  that is why the civil service  here  is\r\n\r\nall  along  under  stricter  control.  Because   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic position and its importance to\r\n\r\nthe  British, they are willing to throw more crumbs\r\n\r\nto  the people here. That is why although Singapore\r\n\r\nis  still a colonial country, outwardly the  people\r\n\r\nhere  seem to be better off than the people in  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know how much longer the\r\n\r\nMember  intends  to  speak.

They do not understand because of their  long\r\n\r\nexploitation  by the colonialist countries  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  Although  they have become independent,  yet\r\n\r\nthey  are not able to solve their economic problems\r\n\r\nand  to  raise their living standards  in  a  short\r\n\r\nTime. This is not to the credit of the P.A.P.  This\r\n\r\nis   because  of  Singapore's  unique  geographical\r\n\r\nposition  as a centre of British exploitation,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  why the British are willing to give  more\r\n\r\ncrumbs and benefits to the people here. Now, we can\r\n\r\nsee   the   P.A.P.,  which  professes   to   be   a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  Party, is complacent  and  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith   the   crumbs  dealt  out  by   the   British\r\n\r\nimperialists  and laughs at the sufferings  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  our neighbouring countries. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not make use of the surplus  which\r\n\r\nwas   accumulated  in  the  past  few   years   and\r\n\r\ndistribute  it  to  the labouring  masses.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  because of its shaky  position  and  its\r\n\r\ndesire to enter Malaysia, the P.A.P. is now willing\r\n\r\nto  hand over control of economic affairs to a pro-capitalist  Government in the Federation.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  speech of the Minister for Finance is  a  very\r\n\r\nbeautifully written one, it is hollow.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not forget the fact that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot the P.A.P. alone who can look after the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people. Even the past colonial  Government\r\n\r\ndid  something for the benefit of the  people.  The\r\n\r\nLim  Yew  Hock  Government also  carried  out  some\r\n\r\nmeasures,  but they were very foolish because  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  make  use of publicity or  do  propaganda\r\n\r\nwork.  Before I left the P.A.P., I told the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters that the people of Singapore would not be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the small amount of social  welfare\r\n\r\nwork. What they demanded was political emancipation\r\n\r\nand economic freedom from foreign control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  S.P.A.'s  economic  plans\r\n\r\nenvisaged  that industry could be promoted  locally\r\n\r\nby  compelling local capitalists to put up  51  per\r\n\r\ncent   of   the  investments  and  getting  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists  to put up the balance of  the  49  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the money required, the reason being  that\r\n\r\nthey wished local capitalists to have a controlling\r\n\r\ninterest  in the industries to be started up.  They\r\n\r\nfound  that  no foreign investors were prepared  to\r\n\r\ninvest and contribute their skill and expertise  if\r\n\r\nthe  controlling interest was in local hands.  That\r\n\r\nis   why   they  were  not  able  to  get   foreign\r\n\r\nparticipation  for  any  of  the  industries   they\r\n\r\nthought  of setting up. Nor have they been able  to\r\n\r\nget  any local capitalists to be interested in  any\r\n\r\nof   their  industrial  schemes.  This  was  mainly\r\n\r\nbecause  local capitalists distrusted them as  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  like the idea of well-connected outsiders\r\n\r\nbeing given nominee shares in undertakings in which\r\n\r\nthey were expected to put up the money. Because  we\r\n\r\ndid  not  try  to do the same foolish  and  unclean\r\n\r\nthings  as  the  S.P.A. Government  did,  they  now\r\n\r\ncharge us with favouring foreign capitalists at the\r\n\r\nexpense of local capitalists. Is it not better  for\r\n\r\nus to have three foreign oil companies - one British,\r\n\r\none  Japanese  and one American - than to  allow  one\r\n\r\nforeign well-established oil company to expand  its\r\n\r\nactivities so that it gets a local monopoly in oil?\r\n\r\nThe  S.P.A. thinking was that if they could get  an\r\n\r\neconomic  price for the new site in which  a  well-established  foreign  oil company  was  interested,\r\n\r\nthey were quite prepared to let it have a perpetual\r\n\r\nmonopoly  in  oil. Is it not very much cleaner  and\r\n\r\nmore   in  accord  with  socialist  principles   to\r\n\r\nstimulate   keen   competition   amongst    foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists  as  we  have  done?  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill spoke about the Inter-Governmental  Joint\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Federation and  Singapore  Ministers\r\n\r\nwhich  the  SPA.  Government set up to  co-ordinate\r\n\r\nindustrial development in both territories.  Except\r\n\r\nfor  the  fact  that once or twice it met,  nothing\r\n\r\nelse happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare all this, Sir, with the massive schemes\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. Government in the public sector  of\r\n\r\nindustrial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that the S.P.A. Government could think\r\n\r\nof  doing  was to set up sites for small industries\r\n\r\nand  set  up a puny Industrial Promotion  Board  to\r\n\r\nmake  coffee-shop loans, many of which were written\r\n\r\noff. One such loan which had to be written off  was\r\n\r\nto the owner of a piece of land for the development\r\n\r\nof  a  quarry  who did not even possess  the  title\r\n\r\ndeeds  to  the  land.  The  S.P.A.  Government  was\r\n\r\nincapable  of looking at the industrial development\r\n\r\nof Singapore with anything like the depth of vision\r\n\r\nand acumen that our Minister for Finance possesses;\r\n\r\nnor  could  they conceive of an industrial  complex\r\n\r\nlike  that  to be sited at Jurong. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairn-hill's  criticism of  the  P.A.P. industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programme  is  in  keeping  with   the\r\n\r\nconscribed  thinking of which  he  and  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nleaders are only capable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this is\r\n\r\nOpposition time, I will not take up too much ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is now Government time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Anyway, I shall not take up too\r\n\r\nmuch  of  the Opposition time. But I want to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  in this debate the Opposition  obviously\r\n\r\nhad  great difficulty in coming to grips  with  the\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Minister for  Finance.  They  went\r\n\r\nthrough the motions of trying to pick holes in  his\r\n\r\nspeech.  There  were facts and figures  which  they\r\n\r\ncould not refute and, therefore, they launched  out\r\n\r\ninto  rumours,  conjectures, and so  on.  But  what\r\n\r\nshould be made quite clear, Sir, is that it is  all\r\n\r\ntoo easy for Opposition Members to say, \"Yes, but I\r\n\r\ncould have done better.\" If we had done better,  it\r\n\r\nis  always possible for them to say, \"I could  have\r\n\r\ndone  still better.\" We should go by what  each  of\r\n\r\nthe  three Opposition groups had done when they had\r\n\r\nthe  power  to do something for the country.  Take,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  the  Labour  Front  Government,  now\r\n\r\ncalled  the S.P.A. [Interruption] The Labour  Front\r\n\r\nwas  a  relative, somewhat a cousin of the  S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nbecause at that time they could not agree with  the\r\n\r\nfamily but since then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  a family reconciliation  and  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and  the Labour Front are all in  the  same\r\n\r\nclique.  So  there was the Labour Front  Government\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the Right-wing. They were  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to show what they could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> More employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The only monumental and\r\n\r\nconstructive  effort, as I understand  it,  was  an\r\n\r\niron   mine  in  the  Federation.  That  is   their\r\n\r\ntestimony.  That was the last stage of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Government, because towards the end of their\r\n\r\nterm, they ended up in political corruption and  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  melee. They had the chance  to  show  what\r\n\r\nthey  could  do, and they failed. Therefore  today,\r\n\r\nevery  Time they see concrete evidence  of  what  a\r\n\r\nsocial  democratic government can do, it  naturally\r\n\r\nannoys  them. They even have to refute  that  these\r\n\r\nachievements are either not there, or that if  they\r\n\r\nare  there, that they are not as good as they could\r\n\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, the Member for Tanglin. His\r\n\r\nspeech  always  reminds me of a gentleman  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  to a gay party and goes back meandering  home\r\n\r\nbut  never  quite getting home. The  hon.  Member's\r\n\r\nspeech was something like this, it went on and  on,\r\n\r\nand I was not quite sure whether he approved of the\r\n\r\nachievements  of the Government or  disapproved  of\r\n\r\nthem.  He meandered on and on, but what he did  say\r\n\r\nwas  that  he claimed to have read Dalton,  and  in\r\n\r\nbetween  he spouted poetry. But where have we  gone\r\n\r\nwrong in our policy? What suggestions has he got to\r\n\r\nshow  us  how  we could have done better?  The  two\r\n\r\nimportant essentials for economic development  are,\r\n\r\nfirst,  political stability, and second,  a  clean,\r\n\r\nhonest  and efficient government. No capitalist  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  put money into any venture if he  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  the government is not efficient, is not clean\r\n\r\nand  is not incorruptible. Therefore, ill the first\r\n\r\nyear  of the P.A.P. Government, we were just trying\r\n\r\nourselves out -  studying the lie of the land. In the\r\n\r\nsecond  year, everybody knows that it was  a  fight\r\n\r\nwith the Communists because the Communists had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  reasons  for  halting  and  sabotaging   the\r\n\r\neconomic  plans of a non-Communist Government.  The\r\n\r\nCommunists  believe, and they tell their  followers - like  the  Member for Upper Serangoon who  spent  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of time speaking - that you cannot  give\r\n\r\nthe  people  anything but crumbs unless you  change\r\n\r\nsociety.  The  Member  kept  on  referring   to   a\r\n\r\nsocialist society, but we know that he was  talking\r\n\r\nof a Communist society. Therefore, any advance made\r\n\r\nunder  a non-Communist government is one more  nail\r\n\r\nin   the  Communist  propaganda  that  unless   you\r\n\r\noverthrow this system, you cannot improve  the  lot\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, after two years when the Communists\r\n\r\ncould not get their was with us, they realised that\r\n\r\nthe  most  important thing, as far as the  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore was concerned,  was  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of  merger. For four years,  the  then\r\n\r\nLabour   Front  kept  on  saying,  \"In   the   1959\r\n\r\nelections,  you  vote for us and we  will  get  you\r\n\r\nmerger.\"  But  they never got merger.  Today,  they\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Yes\" but at that Time, they said. \"Don't  if\r\n\r\nyou  vote  for the P.A.P., there will be no  common\r\n\r\nmarket  and no merger.\" We have proved that we  can\r\n\r\nget  merger  and common market. I think the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nwas the Party that offered the third alternative in\r\n\r\nthe last referendum. They did not want merger. They\r\n\r\nsaid  that  they wanted something like Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nNorth   Borneo.  Just  before  the   eve   of   the\r\n\r\nreferendum, they told their own followers. \"Switch,\r\n\r\nand  vote for Alternative A.\" These are the  people\r\n\r\nwho  switch and change their attitude. But we said.\r\n\r\n\"This  is what we want -  merger on the basis of  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper which we have approved and which we are\r\n\r\nquite  convinced that the people of Singapore want,\r\n\r\nnot complete merger or merger on the same terms  as\r\n\r\nSarawak  and  North Borneo but the kind  of  merger\r\n\r\nthat  we have put through.\" We have got merger  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  are  waiting for the  prospects  for\r\n\r\neconomic  advancement. The only fly in the ointment\r\n\r\nwere the Communists. When they knew that merger was\r\n\r\nabout  to  be  achieved,  that  the  prospects  for\r\n\r\neconomic advancement were good and that there would\r\n\r\nbe less people unemployed, less discontent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  knew that they had to fight merger  not  only\r\n\r\nfor political but for economic reasons. That is why\r\n\r\ntoday  you  will  notice that after the  Communists\r\n\r\nhave  been  conscribed and contained, stability  is\r\n\r\nachieved, industrial disputes lessen, and  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  last eight or nine months there is an  air  of\r\n\r\nprosperity and confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, we are now having trouble from\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing. These same people - this time  the\r\n\r\nM.C.A. and certain Senators from the Federation - \r\n\r\ndecided  to upset the merger arrangements  because\r\n\r\nthey  felt  that the Communists were out  and  that\r\n\r\ntherefore  the Right-wing had a chance.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey tried to discredit us because we got merger on\r\n\r\ncertain  terms.  And  they  went  round  to   local\r\n\r\nmerchants  and said, \"Well, now that the Communists\r\n\r\nare  on the way out, there is a good chance  of  an\r\n\r\nelection comeback.\" Therefore, they tried to  upset\r\n\r\nour  merger  terms,  to change  them  and  to  give\r\n\r\neconomic  control to the Federation - in  fact,  to\r\n\r\ncertain M.C.A. Senators and so on. So that they can\r\n\r\nmanipulate  things  and tell the merchants,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nthere you are. After merger, you must deal with us.\r\n\r\nWe  have got the financial strings.\" They attempted\r\n\r\nit,  but fortunately for us we fought them  out  in\r\n\r\nthe open. And the two Senators were quiet. In fact,\r\n\r\none  of  them challenged to he named. We named  him\r\n\r\nand  lie  has been keeping quiet. The other Senator\r\n\r\nentered into an argument, but again he is quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, today the prospects for merger\r\n\r\nare good and the prospects for economic advancement\r\n\r\nare also good. The people know that there have been\r\n\r\nconcrete  achievements under the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\nThere  are facts and figures. The fact is that  the\r\n\r\nbuildings  are  there; the schools, roads,  lights,\r\n\r\nand standpipes are there. This you cannot deny.  We\r\n\r\nare not saying that we have created a Utopia. There\r\n\r\nis  a lot of room for improvement, but what we  say\r\n\r\nis   that   the  S.P.A. - the  former  Labour   Front\r\n\r\nGovernment - were given a chance but they failed. The\r\n\r\nCommunists   are   not   interested   in   economic\r\n\r\nconstruction and advancement. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe have every reason to say that what we have\r\n\r\ndone  has been something for the cause of socialism\r\n\r\nand democracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget time,\r\n\r\nas  recognised  by  everybody, is Opposition  time.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Opposition got to  a  bad  start\r\n\r\nwhen  the Member for Queenstown opened the innings.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Queenstown, as every Member in this\r\n\r\nAssembly  knows, is a person who aspires  to  great\r\n\r\npublic oratory. But unfortunately, he labours under\r\n\r\nthe   mistaken  impression  that  quantity   is   a\r\n\r\nsufficient  substitute for quality.  He  holds  the\r\n\r\nrecord in the Assembly for the longest speech ever.\r\n\r\nAnd  not  only that, he also holds the  runner's-up\r\n\r\nrecord. But in his present state of mind, with  the\r\n\r\nstresses and troubles which are now afflicting  his\r\n\r\nParty,  he  has been reduced to a state  where  his\r\n\r\nmind  is  unable  to distinguish between  fact  and\r\n\r\nfantasy. So I think it would be a sheer waste of my\r\n\r\nTime  to rebut at all the fantastic statements  and\r\n\r\nassertions that he has made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second speaker was the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\nSir, everyone in this House acknowledges the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin as a man with many sterling qualities.\r\n\r\nHis  performance today has given mc some hopes that\r\n\r\nhe  may  yet  move on to great things. Sir,  he  is\r\n\r\nunder  the  curious  illusion that  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nchanging for the better - I mean, thank goodness, he\r\n\r\nbelieves  that  we  are  improving,  we  are  being\r\n\r\nrnoderate.  But  I  believe that his  standards  of\r\n\r\njudgment are changing - we have been consistent,  but\r\n\r\nhe  has  modified  the way he looks  at  us  - his\r\n\r\napproach  to  our political problems. I  see  great\r\n\r\nhopes in this. He passed many complimentary remarks\r\n\r\nabout  our Government. I do wish to thank him  most\r\n\r\nwarmly  for his kind remarks, and I think he  means\r\n\r\nwell.  We  are  very  glad  that  we  have  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Bench a man who, when he thinks that the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  done  well,  openly   gives   the\r\n\r\nGovernment a pat on the back. We do accept his kind\r\n\r\nremarks in the spirit that it was offered. I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  trouble  is this:  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  assessing the actions of the Government in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  the  Party, is unable at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment to realise that when conditions change  your\r\n\r\ntactics  must  change although your basic  strategy\r\n\r\nremains consistent. It is only after the Party  had\r\n\r\ncome  to an open clash with the pro-Communists  and\r\n\r\ngot  rid  of the Communists and their stooges  from\r\n\r\nour  ranks that the differences between the  social\r\n\r\ndemocrats in the Party and the Communists who  were\r\n\r\nclinging  on  to  us became very  clear  and  self-evident.  And  so all the virtue  that  he  is  now\r\n\r\nseeing  in the Party and in the Government is  more\r\n\r\nevident than before. I will not argue at all in any\r\n\r\ndetail  about  some of the proposals  he  makes.  I\r\n\r\nthink  on  most matters we see eye to eye, although\r\n\r\nin the little matter of deficit financing by credit\r\n\r\ncreation, I think I will reserve my position there,\r\n\r\nbecause under the present Currency Board system  it\r\n\r\nis  just impossible to do so. But when he says that\r\n\r\nwe  accepted his point of view in the deliberations\r\n\r\non the Tariff Board, may I say that it was just the\r\n\r\nother  way round? We have always held the  position\r\n\r\nthat if you want to impose protective tariffs, then\r\n\r\nyou  must do the necessary calculations. There will\r\n\r\nbe  some  effect on trade especially the  re-export\r\n\r\ntrade.  It may diminish: it certainly will diminish\r\n\r\nif  tariffs  are  too  high.  There  will  be  some\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the entrepot trade. You have to  balance  that  against  the  gain  to  the  country\r\n\r\nthrough employment in new industries that could  be\r\n\r\nestablished as a result of tariff. That was, if you\r\n\r\nwill recollect, Mr Speaker. Sir, exactly the point\r\n\r\nthat  I  was trying to make in the Select Committee\r\n\r\non the Tariff Advisory Bill. I am very glad to hear\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Tanglin has now come all  that\r\n\r\nway with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third speaker was the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim.  He  is a curious gentleman, a very  ambitious\r\n\r\nman. Even when lie was in the Party I remember that\r\n\r\nwhen  we  prepared  our Sixth Anniversary  Souvenir\r\n\r\nnumber,  and we asked various Ministers - he  was  a\r\n\r\nMinister then - to contribute an article, we all  did\r\n\r\nour little hit, and, of course, the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  sent  an article entitled  \"When  I  was\r\n\r\nMayor\".  Sir, in the history of mankind,  important\r\n\r\nevents   occur   which  serve   as   landmarks   to\r\n\r\nhistorians.  For instance, the great  flood  before\r\n\r\nwhich Noah brought animals in twos into his ark ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Adam and Eve. For the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim, the great event in the  history  of\r\n\r\nmankind  was the Hong Lim by-election. Before  then\r\n\r\nall  was darkness, chaos and confusion. After that,\r\n\r\nlight,   progress.  Sir,  this  is  so   absurd   a\r\n\r\nproposition  that  I  do  not  think   anybody   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will take him at all seriously  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that before Hong Lim we wanted one big  steel\r\n\r\nmill,  and  after  Hong Lim we saw  the  light  and\r\n\r\ndecided to have many small-scale industries. It  is\r\n\r\ntoo  fantastic a proposition. It was not  the  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  by-election  nor  what  he  said  to  us.  Our\r\n\r\nindustrial policy was influenced by the  advice  we\r\n\r\nreceived  from  several expert missions  which  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations and the World Bank sent to Singapore\r\n\r\nat  our  request. The Member for Hong Lim sometimes\r\n\r\nreminds  me  of Russian emigres after  the  October\r\n\r\nRevolution  in  1917 in Russia. You will  recollect\r\n\r\nthat many landed aristocrats fled the country. Many\r\n\r\nof them landed in London, impecunious. But they had\r\n\r\ntwo great assets. They had an imposing physique,  a\r\n\r\ntall  figure, blond hair, nice features and  plenty\r\n\r\nof medals. This quality qualified them for the post\r\n\r\nof  commissionaires  in London hotels.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthese Russian emigres always hark back to the great\r\n\r\ndays before the October Revolution in the same  way\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Hong Lim harks  back  to  the\r\n\r\ngreat days of the Hong Lim by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must most vigorously refute him, not on\r\n\r\nall  his  inaccuracies, because that will  take  me\r\n\r\nwell past midnight, but at least on the subject  of\r\n\r\nwater expansion schemes. This is a subject of great\r\n\r\ntopical interest in Singapore today because of  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  water. The Member for  Hong  Lim,  in\r\n\r\ncastigating the present Government for  neglect  in\r\n\r\nproviding early enough these water expansion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschemes,  forgot  that he was  Mayor  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil from 1957; in 1959, he graduated from Mayor\r\n\r\nof  the  City  Council to the City Council  itself,\r\n\r\nwhich august office he held until May 1960, when we\r\n\r\ndecided we had had enough of it. Sir, during  these\r\n\r\nthree  to  four years, he was responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nwater  supply  and for the expansion of  the  water\r\n\r\nsupply in Singapore. He was fully aware that  there\r\n\r\nwas  one  factor that prevented any  steps  towards\r\n\r\nexpanding the water supply, and that was  that  the\r\n\r\nagreement  to draw water from Johore, the agreement\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore signed with the Johore  Government\r\n\r\nto draw water for Singapore, had lapsed and it must\r\n\r\nbe renewed if there was to be any expansion to draw\r\n\r\nmore  water from Johore. He knew that. He  took  no\r\n\r\nsteps  at all when he was Mayor, when he  was  the\r\n\r\nCity Council, to renew negotiations with the Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment so that water expansion schemes could be\r\n\r\nset  afoot.  And if there is one man in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwho  is responsible for our present plight,  it  is\r\n\r\nnone other than the former Mayor of Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim, and the former City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim is one of the most\r\n\r\naudacious  men it has been, my misfortune  to  meet\r\n\r\nfor the spreading of deliberate untruths, untruths\r\n\r\nwhich  he  knows  to be completely  untrue,  to  be\r\n\r\nfalse.  The Member for Anson is a different  kettle\r\n\r\nof  fish.  He  does  have his  moods  of  euphoria,\r\n\r\nsometimes  in  moments  of  rage  when  facts   and\r\n\r\nfantasies  merge into each other.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim is not of that type. He is cold and he  is\r\n\r\ncalculating. And when he says that nothing had been\r\n\r\ndone  at  all to press on with our water  expansion\r\n\r\nschemes  as  set  out in the Development  Plan,  he\r\n\r\nknows  that what he said was absolutely untrue.  He\r\n\r\ncited   four  instances  and  claimed  that  beyond\r\n\r\nscratching the surface of the Scudai River  nothing\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  had been done. First, the Johore  River\r\n\r\nscheme,  the  Scudai River scheme,  the  scheme  to\r\n\r\nraise   the  height  of  the  dam  at  the  Seletar\r\n\r\nReservoir  and  the  scheme to provide  more  fresh\r\n\r\nwater  at  Jurong. His indictment of the Government\r\n\r\nis  that  beyond  minor  works  at  Scudai  nothing\r\n\r\nwhatsoever had been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the facts are just the reverse. The Johore\r\n\r\nRiver  scheme, which is the biggest water expansion\r\n\r\nscheme  to be undertaken by Singapore, is  well  on\r\n\r\nfoot  - detailed design, planning, specification  of\r\n\r\ncontract now being undertaken. In this work we have\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  advice from one of  the  foremost\r\n\r\nfirms  of water engineers in the world. As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, we shall be applying for a World Bank loan to\r\n\r\nfinance part of this scheme, but the loan itself is\r\n\r\nnot  of the essence, Mr Speaker, as the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park has said. It is to pay for the foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  counterpart cost of  imported  materials;\r\n\r\nthat  is  not of importance. But work  is  in  full\r\n\r\nswing. The Scudai River project has gone a long way\r\n\r\nand  the date of completion is expected to  be  May\r\n\r\nnext   year.  The  scheme  to  raise  the   Seletar\r\n\r\nReservoir  dam has been abandoned on the advice  of\r\n\r\nour  water consultants. The Jurong River scheme has\r\n\r\nbeen extended not only to provide what is called  a\r\n\r\nservice  reservoir, raising it to  some  height  so\r\n\r\nthat  water pressure can be through gravitation  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in  the distribution of water, but  also,  by\r\n\r\ndamming  the  Johore River, to build a  substantial\r\n\r\nreservoir on what was formerly the Jurong River  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  substantial supply of fresh  water  for\r\n\r\nindustries in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next speaker was the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.  He  always likes  to  perform  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Sometimes I am in doubt whether I  should\r\n\r\ntake him seriously or whether I should sit back and\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  performance. So I am not going  through\r\n\r\nall the points he raised. But he and the Member for\r\n\r\nHong Lim and the Member for Upper Serangoon stated,\r\n\r\nin  their  various ways, that our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  has one great shortcoming, and  that  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  favour  the foreign investor  as  against\r\n\r\nlocal  capital. Sir, my colleague the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  has  given  some gruesome  details  of  how\r\n\r\nindustrial   promotion  took   place   during   his\r\n\r\nGovernment  and I do not want to repeat  them.  But\r\n\r\nthere  was one point which the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwas  at  great  pains to stress, and that  is  that\r\n\r\nwhereas  his  Government insisted on  51  per  cent\r\n\r\nparticipation by local capital and 49 per  cent  by\r\n\r\noverseas capital, the P.A.P. Government is more lax\r\n\r\nin this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect.  In  fact,  in a number  of  undertakings,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the oil refineries, we were  prepared\r\n\r\nto  see  the whole of the capital investment coming\r\n\r\nfrom   abroad.   He  thought  this   was   a   very\r\n\r\nreprehensible  and  unpatriotic practice.  Sir,  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Health, has  explained\r\n\r\nthat  this  policy  of his had led  to  a  complete\r\n\r\ncessation of industrial expansion between 1958  and\r\n\r\n1959.  When  we took office there was obviously  no\r\n\r\nprospect  at  all  of industrial  growth,  for  the\r\n\r\nsimple reason that if you want an overseas firm  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore and contribute their  know-how,\r\n\r\ntheir techniques and their capital, they must he in\r\n\r\na  position  of control in regard to the management\r\n\r\nof  the business. It is common sense and apparently\r\n\r\nself-evident.  Maybe  what  the  former  Government\r\n\r\nwanted  was for overseas manufacturers to make  all\r\n\r\nthe   necessary   contribution,   but   for   local\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  to  have the final say in  management.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, this is an excellent state of affairs.\r\n\r\nI  have  no quarrel with that policy provided  they\r\n\r\ncould  deliver  the goods, and the  experience  was\r\n\r\nthat they had failed to deliver the goods. Not only\r\n\r\nthat. Between 1957 and 1959 there was a contraction\r\n\r\nof industrial output in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin quoted labour statistics\r\n\r\nto  bear out this point. That is quite true.  There\r\n\r\nwas  a  contraction of employment  in  industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  during that period. Why was it  so,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir? The answer is simple.  In  1957  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya achieved independence and they\r\n\r\ndecided that they must have their own policy.  They\r\n\r\nput   up  tariffs  for  products  manufactured   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  purely on nationalist grounds.  That  is\r\n\r\nquite  understandable.  The  net  result  was  that\r\n\r\nwhereas  before  1957 we had something  like  1,500\r\n\r\nworkers  employed in the industries  making  rubber\r\n\r\nshoes, two or three years after that the number was\r\n\r\nreduced to less than a third because the management\r\n\r\nof  these  factories decided that they should  site\r\n\r\nthem  in  Johore, Kuala Lumpur, Kiang or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe  same  thing happened to other industries.  The\r\n\r\nbiscuit industry is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutstanding  example.  The  result  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee to advise both  Governments\r\n\r\non  industrial expansion -  the committee  which  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill was so proud of - the net result\r\n\r\nto Singapore was extremely damaging. It was because\r\n\r\nwe  saw  an  unhealthy  trend  before  the  general\r\n\r\nelections  that  we decided that unless  we  had  a\r\n\r\ncommon market whereby one territory on one side  of\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway  does not try to pinch industry  from\r\n\r\nthe other side of the Causeway, we can never get  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  and balanced industrial growth  either  in\r\n\r\nSingapore or in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have given sufficient details of\r\n\r\nour  general proposals on the common market  in  my\r\n\r\nBudget speech. I do not think I can go much further\r\n\r\nthan  that without breaking confidence, or  without\r\n\r\nbringing in details of the Report of the World Bank\r\n\r\nMission. But I do wish to stress that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment    is    in   deadly    earnest    about\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. It sees the common market as the\r\n\r\nvital    missing   factor   in   our   drive    for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. We are determined that, as  part\r\n\r\nof  the terms of merger of Singapore into Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwe  shall  have fair and legitimate  terms  on  the\r\n\r\ncommon market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not our intention, as has been\r\n\r\nsuggested  by the Member for Cairnhill, to  compete\r\n\r\nas   a  Government  with  the  Government  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. Governments do not compete in\r\n\r\nindustry, because they do not establish industries.\r\n\r\nIndustries are established by private enterprise in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Federation of  Malaya.  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained the reasons why this must be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon disagrees with the\r\n\r\npolicy. He considers the policy of allowing foreign\r\n\r\nfirms  to establish industries in Singapore  to  be\r\n\r\nintensifying  the exploitation of  the  country  by\r\n\r\nforeign  capital. But I will deal with that  matter\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, so far as the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, that Singapore is trying to compete with\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   the  matter  of  establishing  industries,  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  may I say that that is a  most  harmful\r\n\r\nand  mischievous statement to make? Towards the end\r\n\r\nof  my Budget speech, in the concluding paragraphs,\r\n\r\nI   particularly  stressed  the  point  that  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia  we are likely to prosper as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  common market, and it would be quite wrong for\r\n\r\nus,  wrong ethically, wrong morally and wrong  from\r\n\r\nthe  point of view of our own self-interest, to hog\r\n\r\nthe whole prosperity for ourselves. I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat there will be fair and reasonable means of co-ordinating  industrial growth in the whole  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  territories.  In  fact,  not  merely  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation but also in Borneo and\r\n\r\nSarawak, a reasonable and effective method  of  co-ordinating  industrial growth in  Malaysia  can  be\r\n\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the last speaker was the Member for\r\n\r\nUpper Serangoon who, unfortunately, is not with  us\r\n\r\ntoday.  I  am  not going to reply  to  the  various\r\n\r\nnagging complaints and the minor belly aching  that\r\n\r\nhe has indulged in his speech. But I would say that\r\n\r\nthe  basis of his approach to the economic problems\r\n\r\nfacing  us  in  Singapore is a clearly recognisable\r\n\r\napproach  to  me. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have  studied\r\n\r\nthe  Marxist  classics, from  Das  Kapital  to  the\r\n\r\nselected  works of Stalin and Mao Tse-tung,  and  I\r\n\r\nimmediately recognise his approach. First, he  says\r\n\r\nthat we have lost our revolutionary fervour - mind\r\n\r\nyou,  he says we lost it only after he hopped  out,\r\n\r\nnot  before  that! - particularly in  our  economic\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, The Tasks Ahead, the Five-Year Plan on which\r\n\r\nwe   were  elected  to  office,  is  available  for\r\n\r\nreference. In our election platform, it  is  stated\r\n\r\nquite  clearly that in the entrepot trading economy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, you cannot have socialism. Socialism\r\n\r\nis  not  possible. Anybody who thinks that you  can\r\n\r\nestablish  a  socialist  society  in  an   isolated\r\n\r\nSingapore  needs to have his head examined.  If  he\r\n\r\nhas   any  pretence  to  being  a  Marxist   or   a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary,  he will do well to  study  some  of\r\n\r\nLenin's more serious works on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubject. Lenin has got one epithet for such  types.\r\n\r\nHe  said, \"These are not revolutionaries. They  are\r\n\r\nonly chatterboxes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member deplored the fact that I had\r\n\r\nsought  to  draw a comparison in my  Budget  speech\r\n\r\nbetween  the  modest  but nevertheless  significant\r\n\r\nprosperity  which  Singapore  and  Malaya  are  now\r\n\r\nenjoying,  and have enjoyed for the last two  years\r\n\r\nor   so,  with  the  economic  depression  and  the\r\n\r\neconomic troubles in our neighbouring countries. He\r\n\r\nsaid  the reason is simple. They have gone  through\r\n\r\ncolonial  exploitation  for  a  longer  Time   than\r\n\r\nSingapore or Malaya had. We have been colonised  in\r\n\r\nSingapore really since 1819, whereas in the case of\r\n\r\nother  neighbouring  countries,  colonisation,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  dated much earlier - from the 17th  century,\r\n\r\nin  fact, if my history serves me right.  But  the\r\n\r\ntrouble with this Marxist dogmatic approach is that\r\n\r\nthere are countries which have never been colonised\r\n\r\nin  this  part  of  the  world  -  Thailand,  for\r\n\r\ninstance - or have never been colonised at  all  in\r\n\r\nother  parts of the world, like parts of Melanesia.\r\n\r\nThey have never been colonised. They are not richer\r\n\r\nthan  us. In fact, they are poorer than us. So  how\r\n\r\ndoes  he square up these hard facts of life,  which\r\n\r\ncannot be contested, with his dogmatic approach? He\r\n\r\nsees in our efforts to industrialise through openly\r\n\r\ninviting overseas capital as an attempt to use  the\r\n\r\npoor  people's  money  to pave  the  way  for  more\r\n\r\nintensive exploitation by foreign capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in The Tasks Ahead we have already stated\r\n\r\nopenly  before the electorate that we shall welcome\r\n\r\nforeign capital and foreign know-how and give  them\r\n\r\nall  the  assistance that they require in order  to\r\n\r\nestablish  industries in Singapore  and  give  more\r\n\r\njobs to our people. That was the programme on which\r\n\r\nnot  only  we were elected but he was elected.  How\r\n\r\nthen  can  he complain of the loss of revolutionary\r\n\r\nfervour,  the betrayal of the socialist revolution,\r\n\r\nhobnobbing with the colonial exploiters and all the\r\n\r\nrest of Marxist claptrap and rubbish?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not ever imagine I would succeed in\r\n\r\nconvincing him of the error of his ways. But  I  do\r\n\r\nwarn  his  other colleagues that the tone  and  the\r\n\r\nbeliefs  that this great theoretician of theirs  is\r\n\r\nespousing in public and in this Assembly  is  quite\r\n\r\nunmistakable. If they lend their support  to  these\r\n\r\npolicies  and  to this ideology, then  I  say,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, after 31st of August, they will  not\r\n\r\nhave a tolerant, democratic non-Communist socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Internal Security Council with at\r\n\r\nleast one hand on the steering wheel - not only that,\r\n\r\nbut  there  are three hands on the steering  wheel,\r\n\r\nand one of them is ours.
