From August 1970 to October 1983, he was the Finance Minister. He steered our economy through two oil crises. But for a mild hiccough of the low 4% growth in 1974, he secured an average of 8 1/2% real growth for this period. In his unassuming way, he never claimed any credit for it. In truth he had worked for the 11 years previous to 1971 to help lay the foundations of this success. As Permanent Secretary (Economic Development) in the Finance Ministry from 1959, Chairman EDB 1961 - 68, Chairman and President DBS 1968 - 1970, he helped Goh Keng Swee to work out the strategy for our economic transformation. At a micro-level, he was Chairman of nine companies the Government held equity in:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Iron &amp; Steel Mills Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Shipyard Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sembawang Shipyard (Pte) Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keppel Shipyard (Pte) Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptune Orient Lines Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Shipbuilders Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Electronic &amp; Engineering Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Corporation of Singapore Ltd \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Petroleum Company \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also a Director of INTRACO. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970 I was confronted with the awesome prospect of moving Goh Keng Swee from the Ministry of Finance to Defence. The Ministry of Defence needed him to move from the first stage of basic military training to the second stage of weapons systems and brigade structures. I was in a quandary. An inadequate Finance Minister would be a disaster. There would be no money to pay for any defence build-up. Goh Keng Swee proposed Hon Sui Sen. He had retired from the permanent secretaryship in 1966 and was enjoying his work in DBS. I drew upon my friendship with him. It dated back to 1942 in Japanese-occupied Singapore. For about a year he had stayed with me in Norfolk Road sharing a room, Then inflation made his fixed salary as a civil servant meaningless. He went back to join his wife in Penang. I visited him in Penang in 1944 and stayed for several days with him in his family home at Logan Road. In 1945, after the British returned, he came back to Singapore with his wife and young daughter. He stayed with me in Oxley Road for several months before he moved into Government quarters. In the early 1950's, after I returned from England, we started to learn Mandarin together at his quarters in Cantonment Road, sharing a teacher. We have been good friends for so many years. He could not refuse me; he could not say no to public duty. But he was a reluctant politician - a technocrat before the word was defined to mean a well-qualified Minister who did not come up through the political rough and tumble. I remember his look of incredulity, his astonishment, in the counting room at the Singapore Polytechnic in Prince Edward Road in the 1972 General Elections. His unknown opponent had secured 26.8% of the votes. I comforted him. It was no insult to him. It was in the nature of the system and of the pressures of life in a society where those who did not get what they wanted vented their frustrations through the anti-vote. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976 he wanted to stand down. In 1980 he again wanted to retire. On each occasion I persuaded him to soldier on and to prepare his successor. In 1979 he allowed Goh Chok Tong to prepare and to present the Budget. It was no easy task. He \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> was in charge. He was responsible and knew that I expected him to ensure that no major error was committed. He made minimal changes to the draft Budget speech and sent it on to me. In fact, I made more textual changes than he did, though we left the tax measures unchanged. The next two times, in 1980 and again in 1981, with Goh Chok Tong, there were little textual changes. In 1982 and 1983 he allowed Tony Tan a free hand with no amendments. I also left the text unchanged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon Sui Sen was a big man. It will not be easy to find another Finance Minister to repeat this delicate exercise in on-the-job training with the Budget. It was only possible because it was Hon Sui Sen, and because he and I understood each other well. In early 1975 he had urged me to talent scout for his successor. Over lunch he recounted a conversation he had with the then Chairman of Shell (Singapore) J.J. Gerzon. At his level and age, Gerzon said that his most important task was to identify, test, and train his successor. I pressed Hon Sui Sen to do likewise. He did. He helped me talent scout both Goh Chok Tong and Tony Tan among others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 13 1/4 years the per capita GDP of Singapore more than doubled from $2462 in 1970 to $5752 in 1982 at 1968 dollars; Singapore's official reserves went up by over six times from $3.1 billion in 1970 to $18.9 billion in 1983. Personal income tax rates have been reduced and reliefs for CPF greatly increased. My relationship with him was close and easy. We both shared a common basic philosophy, that hard work deserves to be rewarded, that the free market should determine the value of products and services, that savings should be encouraged over consumption, and that savings should go into investments which yield the most secure long-term dividends. That is not to say that he was averse to well-calculated risks in new industrial or commercial ventures. The wide-ranging portfolio in Temasek Holdings, testify to his eclectic and catholic approach. From a capital worth of $197 million in 1970, Government equity in wholly-owned and joint-venture companies are $2.03 billion in 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought a powerful intellect to bear on our economic and financial problems. His academic training was in the hard sciences. Born in Balik Pulau, Penang, he was educated at St Xavier's Institution. He was the top student for the Senior Cambridge Certificate Examination in all Malaya in 1932. He went to Raffles College in 1935. In 1938 he got a Class 1 Diploma in Science, doing Chemistry, Mathematics and majoring in Physics. He was appointed to the Straits Settlement Civil Service for which there were only two recruits each year. His first duty was as a Police Court Magistrate. Then he became a Deputy Collector of Land Revenue, before the Japanese occupied Malaya and Singapore. He was to specialize in Land Office work until he rose to become Commissioner of Lands in 1957. He had no academic grounding in Economics. His theoretical training in Economics was late in life when he was sent on attachment to the World Bank in 1960 for several months. What he had was high helicopter quality as the Shell appraisal system would term it: a strong power of analysis, and the imagination and sense of reality to match. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his excellent work in the Ministry of Finance and the EDB he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1962. For his outstanding contributions in starting up so many economic ventures he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1967. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Land Office experience was of inestimable value to me when the British were about to withdraw from their bases in 1968. He knew the value and the uses that land could be put to. He was familiar with the different titles under which the British War Office occupied various parcels of land in Singapore - some to which they had proper title, having paid for it in private purchases, and others, the majority, which had been made available for defence use by the Government of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, and later the Colony of Singapore. He urged me to obtain the transfer and surrender of all lands, whatever the title, together with all buildings and fixtures. The British were in an apologetic frame of mind and generous in wanting to help Singapore survive the shock of withdrawal. They handed over all the real estate they held with all buildings \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and fixtures. This was the essential capital for a rapid development of dockyards, factories and new housing estates. We turned adversity to advantage. Hon Sui Sen set up the Bases Economic Conversion Department and, as its first Commissioner, started converting and commercialising the Sembawang Naval Base, Seletar Airfield, REME workshops in Ayer Rajah Road, and barracks in Blakang Mati, now Sentosa. Much of this success was under his direction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Singapore made 13% growth at real prices from 1966 to 1973 is no mean achievement. That for the 10 years, from 1973 to 1983, in spite of two oil crises, Singapore could make an average of 8% growth, is a near miracle. The average growth rate of the developing countries for this period was 4.2% according to the World Bank. He was a prime mover in most of the big decisions that generated this growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a deeply religious man. Honourable Members will remember him as an unassuming, modest man who never bore malice to anyone. He was an even-tempered man. Members will remember that he never lost his cool in this House. His good friend from Raffles College days is Tan Teck Chwee, now Chairman of the PSC. He summed up nearly 50 years of friendship thus: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He was a very devout Roman Catholic who lived his life on the high moral principles of his Church. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Though he was studying science, he read widely the liberal arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He was thoughtful in his actions but a man of few words. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I feel that he was a stoic as in the nearly half a century I knew him, he had never expressed any frustration or disappointment with anything in life. He would apply himself unassumingly and assiduously to any work he was assigned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He was absolutely devoid of jealousy of others - be it power or wealth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'His tolerance of the foibles and weaknesses of his fellow men and his loyalty to all those who worked with him or under him almost verge on a fault.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with this assessment, including the last point, that he sometimes allowed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> loyalty to subordinates to go to great lengths. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sim Kee Boon, Head of the Civil Service, described his characteristics as: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'His loyalty to his staff was almost legendary - both as Chairman of the EDB and later as Minister in charge of personnel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Despite tough pronouncements and fierce defence of tax or unpopular measures in Parliament, Hon Sui Sen always had a caring, soft other side to his personality. This is revealed in the Treasury files whenever matters affecting people's welfare are concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the eyes of the Civil Servants he was an officer and a gentleman.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goh Chok Tong was in NOL from 1969 to 1977. From 1974 to 1979 he was Managing Director responsible to Hon Sui Sen as Minister for Finance. Slowly NOL turned from red to black balance sheets. Goh Chok Tong remembered him thus: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'NOL had not done well. It was losing money every year in its first five years, But never once did I hear a complaining word nor see a displeased face when I met him occasionally as part of NOL management team. Instead, he was ever ready to pump in more money into the company. He took a long view. He showed faith in people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This point was reaffirmed later when I had more occasions to attend his meetings with Government-owned companies. Once he had picked a management team he would back it. He never discouraged. He always encouraged. He never blamed others for losses. He tried to offer suggestions to solve them. He thought big, never small. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I have never seen Mr Hon angry or heard him raise his voice. Annoyed yes. The mere trace of annoyance in his voice or in his minute was enough to buck up his officials. The words were not harsh, but to know you have let him down or caused him annoyance was enough to make you feel bad with yourself.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this would be an insincere tribute if I did not add that there were occasions when I took a less kindly view of the mediocre and the pedestrian who worked faithfully for him occupying key appointments. On such occasions, I moved by transferring the responsibility for the portfolio to a less forbearing taskmaster. Such operations were never pleasant. Whilst he accepted my view that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the able and talented must be emplaced in top positions in all key departments and agencies, he was prepared to settle for less than the best when they tried hard and he thought them adequate. His approach was more kindly and gradual. But even though the reshuffle pained him, he acknowledged my right to act differently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lost a close personal friend of more than 40 years, and an exceptionally able Minister for Finance. I still find it difficult to talk of him in the past tense. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw him on Tuesday afternoon on the 11th of October, I thought he had several more years. So did he. We bantered. I said that the average life span of the Singaporean male was 69. He was only 67. He countered my argument by quoting his genetic inheritance. His father had died at 53. His mother at 63. Heart failure, he said, was a good way of going compared to many other illnesses. He added that he had no intention of going just yet. Then we turned to more cheerful subjects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, the 14th of October, at 4.10 pm, whilst talking to E.W. Barker, I was sent a note that he had chest pains and was back in intensive care. At 4.45 pm, I walked in to see him at the Coronary Care Unit in Singapore General Hospital as a Catholic priest walked out. Yet he was as calm and composed as he was on Tuesday. He was at peace with himself. He was prepared to face his Maker. After 10 minutes of conversation I left to see someone else at the hospital. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went back to see him again about an hour later, at 10 to 6.00 pm. A team of doctors was trying to bring up and control his blood pressure. His eyes lit up in recognition as he saw me. The doctors then engaged his attention. I left as he was answering checks by the doctors. At my office at 7.00 pm I was told he had died at \n  <br>6.30 pm, some 40 minutes after I left. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did those who knew him well think of him? Two of his friends, one a Dutchman, Dr Albert Winsemius, and another a Japanese, Mr Norishige Hasegawa of Sumitomo, travelled all the way from Amsterdam and Tokyo within hours of hearing of his death to pay their respects \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to him and to console his family. They had only 2 days between the death and the funeral. The normal duty of friendship and the demands of protocol did not require them to come such long distances. I met them at and after the funeral. They came because they had deep regard and affection for a warmhearted, good and sincere friend. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will want me to send his wife and family its sympathies at their great loss. His was a happy marriage to Annie Voon. They were devoted to each other. They had four daughters, Joan, Elizabeth, Vivien and Brenda, all graduates, all married. There are 11 grandchildren. He has a close three-tier family, with one daughter and her family living with him. His home in Malcolm Road was, he jocularly told me, a creche-cum-child care centre. Over one lunch last October, he explained how easy it was to learn to change children's nappies. He helped look after his grandchildren. I had recounted my clumsy inexperience with my own grandchildren. He was a good man whose whole life has been one of service for the welfare and wellbeing of his family and of his country, and least of all himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sudden death was a grievous loss for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> As a mark of respect to the Late Member, I propose that the House observe a two-minute silence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House rose and paid respect. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>3.02 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HAVELOCK CONSTITUENCY</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Right to elect Member of Parliament)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

It makes little sense to hold a bye-election. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Supplementary question, Sir. Would the Prime Minister say what was the reason for the amendment to the Constitution way back in 1965, taking away the requirement for the vacancy to be filled within three months? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, 1965 did not see such an amendment. He goes by what he reads. The Member for Anson, as a member of the learned profession, should not go by what he reads in the press. The legislation on elections was governed by laws which were promulgated in 1959, and I remember distinctly that when the then Member for Sembawang died in August of 1962, we did not have to hold an election because there was an evenly divided House of 25 Members on each side until we held the General Elections in September 1963. When we became part of Malaysia, Malaysian laws then applied to Singapore. When we were separated from Malaysia, we re-adopted the 1959 practice which does not require us to hold an election or bye-election within three months. There are variations in as many countries as there are running the first-past-the-post system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Prime Minister explain why it was necessary to go back - if that was the practice before the Malaysian Constitution came into effect -because the Malaysian Constitution contained a requirement that the vacancy be filled within three months? Secondly, how long does he expect to leave the seat vacant? The Prime Minister has spoken about dwindling constituents and the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies. How long does he expect to leave the seat vacant? Thirdly, does he not agree, Prime Minister, that appointing a caretaker Member of Parliament is to stand the principle of parliamentary representation on its head? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I find it tedious and tiresome to have to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> explain the simple elementary rules of parliamentary practice. There is no requirement. There never was a requirement to hold a bye-election, and we decided to go back to the practice of 1959 because of my experience. As I have explained, the House was evenly divided, 25 on each side, and we governed with firmness and fairness from August 1962 to September 1963, for 15 months, and we won the General Elections. I can assure the Member for Anson that we will govern with firmness and fairness between now and a date before the end of 1985. 1 have already given him the answer when the General Elections will be held, how long it will be, and if there is any further information which will be helpful to him, I will contrive to ensure that he is duly informed and given as much notice as all other Opposition parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am afraid the Prime Minister has not answered my question. Does he not agree that appointing a caretaker MP when the citizen electors have a right to elect their own representative is to stand this principle of parliamentary representation on its head? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one final question before I sit down. Did he appoint this caretaker MP as Secretary-General of his party or did he appoint him in his office as Prime Minister of the Government and, if so, under what powers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am standing no principle on any head. The laws are as set out in the Constitution. There is no reason why the people of Havelock should have a bye-election.

For purely grassroots purposes and to ensure that the vote will be forthcoming in the General Elections, I have thought fit, both in my capacity as Secretary-General of the PAP and in my capacity as Prime Minister, to ask Mr Lee Yiok Seng, the Member for Bukit Panjang, to nurse the constituency. And it is completely open to the Member for Anson to set up his branch there and to meet us there in the General Elections.

Thus, the overall improvement has been about 6%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the major impact to be expected of streaming is the reduction of the dropout rate.

Pupils who have been selected for this programme will be informed sometime during this week. The schools involved are ready for the programme.

The team members, together with the project consultant, will be working very closely with the teachers in the implementation of the programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning representations and reservations expressed, these have come mainly from parents whose children are involved in the project. The main concern of many of the parents of the selected Primary 3 pupils was the distance of Rosyth and Raffles Girls Primary Schools from their homes and the difficulty in arranging for transport for their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The pupils come from all over Singapore, ranging from Woodlands, Pasir Ris and Jurong.

This may arise if the children are given too much to do or if they are over-pressured by their own parents. Another fear was that the children might become arrogant. These concerns have arisen in gifted programmes in other countries, With proper curriculum, teaching methods and close cooperation between teachers and parents, they can be overcome. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some parents have asked how teachers are selected and trained. There are, in fact, very few formal courses anywhere on teaching the gifted. The teachers will be working very closely with the project team and the project consultants.

In recent months, the situation has been aggravated by the occurrence of several violent crimes in which firearms were used.

The overall objective was to keep up pressure on potentially criminal groups, to emphasize our efforts to maintain law and order, and to serve as a reminder to criminal elements that tough action will be taken against them. The specific objectives were: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to increase police presence on the ground and thereby help strengthen the feeling of public security and order; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to intensify discreet checks in locations which have been found to have habitually attracted criminals, and thereby deter crime; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to intensify efforts in apprehending specific targets wanted in connection with major offences committed in recent months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation was certainly a success in meeting these objectives.

For as long as my Ministry of Health is required to provide up-to-date and progressively better medical and health services to keep pace not only with the rapidly advancing medical science and technology but also to satisfy increasingly sophisticated public demands, and for as long as there is inflation causing escalation in wages and running costs of hospitals and clinics, I am afraid regular revisions of hospital, outpatient, and dental charges will be necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have circulated to Members of the House a Schedule (Cols. 295 - 304) setting out the main changes in hospital, outpatient and dental fees that will be implemented with effect from 1st January, 1984. When my Ministry announced the last revision of fees which took effect on 1st January, 1983, it stated that fees should keep pace with improved services and rising running costs, as otherwise there could not be any improvement in our health care services. Fee increases, however, would be gradual and would take into account Singaporeans' capacity to pay for health care. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19831220/19831220-HA-0430295.htm\">Schedule - REVISION OF HOSPITAL, OUTPATIENT AND DENTAL CHARGES, MAXIMUM FEES PAYABLE BY CLASS B2 AND C PATIENTS PER ADMISSION OR SPECIALIST OUTPATIENT ATTENDANCE (Cols. 295 - 304)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Reason for fee increase</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason and taking into account the increasing recurrent expenditures on medical and health services, which expenditures are likely to exceed $340 million for the current financial year and estimated to increase to $390 million for the next financial year 1984, it is necessary for regular upward revisions to be made to the fees and charges for services provided by our hospitals, outpatient clinics, and dental clinics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this revision minimal increases will be made in respect of fees charged at the outpatient and dental clinics. These slight increases are set out in items 9 and 10 on pages 3 and 4 of the Schedule that has been circulated to Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Itemized charges for hospital services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be readjustments of fees and charges for the various services pro- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> vided by our hospitals. I must emphasize that in the Government hospitals, with the exception of the daily meals that are different, all the medical services, investigations, X-rays, laboratory tests, surgical operations, and treatment are the same for all classes of patients. Currently Class A and Class B1 patients are charged fees in respect of professional treatment and prescriptions, X-rays, laboratory, and other investigative tests and services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class B2 and Class C patients have hitherto been paying only an all-inclusive daily ward fee which covers all these services. This implies that the daily ward fee includes the cost of meals and all the other services whether supplied or not. For proper accounting purposes, each item of service rendered should be costed and charged. With effect from 1st January, 1984, a separate daily meal fee will be charged. The principle is that while Government can continue to subsidize heavy health care services, the Ministry of Health should not be burdened with the job of subsidizing the provision of meals in the hospitals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class A and Bl patients will pay a separate daily meal fee of $15, while Class B2 and C patients will pay a daily meal fee of $5. This daily meal fee, however, will not be levied on patients in intensive care units, neither will it be levied on the chronic and mentally ill patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Same services for all Classes</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the separate daily meal fee, logically for all classes of patients only one scale of fees should be levied in respect of professional services, investigations, surgical operations, and treatment. But this will clearly cause much hardship to people, many of whom may not be able to afford the full Class A medical treatment and surgical operation fees in the public hospitals. Present Government policy is to ensure that the hospital fees for Class A should reflect actual recurrent costs. This means that our hospitals can recover run- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ning costs but will not be able to recover capital and equipment costs even from the Class A patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of Classes Bl, B2 and C patients, they will be subsidized up to 25%, 75%, and 85% respectively of Class A rates for the various treatment, surgical operation, X-rays, laboratory, and investigative services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is likely that even after such heavy subsidies some hardship can still be caused to a small number of patients. Because of this, for the next few years at least, my Ministry will fix maximum levels of charges for Class B2 and Class C patients, beyond which levels the charges will be borne by the Government. Class Bl patients will not enjoy this privilege, but they will pay at the reduced rate of 75% of Class A charges. Thus Class B2 and Class C patients should not be put to excessive difficulty in meeting the revised hospital charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Fees payable by Class B2 and Class C patients</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary that I elaborate on the increased hospital charges that affect Class B2 and Class C patients. For a long time now these patients have paid a minimum all-inclusive fee per day in our hospitals. But with effect from 1st January, 1984, this will change. A separate daily meal fee of $5, as I have said, will be levied in addition to the present daily ward fee of $20 for Class B2 in hospitals other than the Singapore General Hospital, (where the daily ward fee is $30). Class C patients will pay a daily meal fee of $5 in addition to the daily ward fee of $10. In respect of professional treatment, prescriptions, X-rays, laboratory tests and other investigations, Class B2 and Class C patients will pay 25% and 15% respectively of Class A rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lighten the burden of Class B2 and Class C patients, they will pay only up to a fixed maximum on a per admission or per specialist outpatient attendance basis as specified in Appendix I (Cols. 303 - 304) to the Schedule \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> circulated to Members. This maximum ceiling will apply to the groups of services and investigations, tests, irrespective of the number done per admission or specialist outpatient attendance. Appendix I - MAXIMUM FEES PAYABLE BY CLASS B2 AND C PATIENTS PER ADMISSION OR SPECIALIST OUTPATIENT ATTENDANCE (Cols. 303 - 304) \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards surgical fees and medical treatment charges, Class B2 and Class C patients will pay up to a maximum of $200 and $120 respectively for an operation; and $40 and $25 respectively for all the necessary tests and investigations per admission regardless of the complexity of the operation or the number of X-rays, laboratory procedures, investigations and tests that were carried out. In the Singapore General Hospital, Class B2 and Class C patients undergoing surgery will pay up to a maximum of $215 and $129 respectively due to higher operating theatre and equipment costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a simple illustration will bring out the extent of subsidy to Class B2 and Class C patients. A Class A patient staying for six days in hospital to undergo surgery of a serious nature will be charged in excess of $2,200 in a hospital. For the same kind of surgery and treatment a Class C patient need only pay $248. The treatment and operation are exactly similar, so too is the length of stay in hospital. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, while a Class A patient will be charged $4,300 (or $4,900 at SGH) in surgical operation fees alone for a major operation; but for a similar major operation a Class B2 patient need only pay the maximum surgical fee of $200 (or $215 in the SGH) while a Class C patient pays $120 (or $129 in the SGH). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Assistance for the poor</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to emphasize that no Singaporean will be deprived of medical treatment merely on the ground of financial hardship. The genuinely poor can continue to apply for remission of medical fees and for welfare assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A medical social work service is available in all our hospitals. The Child Psychiatric Clinic and the School Health Services as well as the general psychiatric outpatient clinics will also have medical \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> social workers to assist patients with their emotional, social, and financial problems. Accouchement fees \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accouchement fees have been raised to reflect increased costs. To discourage large families, there will be an increase of $50 for the third order birth and $100 for the fourth and subsequent birth for all classes of patients. Item 8 on page 3 (Cols. 299 - 300) of the Schedule sets out the various charges in respect of accouchement fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Reduction of fees</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of certain laboratory tests and investigations where automation and electronic technology have replaced laborious manual work and thus drastically reducing costs and saving time, the benefits achieved will be passed on to the patients. In this respect, many of the laboratory and investigation test fees have been reclassified and lowered. There has also been a rationalization of these investigative and laboratory test charges into eight groups with a range from $5 to $40. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Concessions</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is conscious that some categories of patients will require more assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiotherapy patients, for instance, will need treatment daily. Such patients will with effect from 1st January, 1984, no longer be required to pay the attendance fee of $12 at each radiotherapy session. This fee will only be paid when they attend the designated specialist outpatient clinic for review by a doctor periodically. My Ministry estimates that this concession will result in a reduction of revenue of $1 million a year, but as a consequence many patients will be able to save between $240 and $480 in attendance fees depending on the length of treatment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who require follow-up attention at the outpatient dispensaries (OPDs) for minor procedures, dressings, or injections without the need to see the doctor in attendance, currently pay the full attendance fee of $4. This OPD fee will now be raised from 1st January, 1984, to $5. But where patients are not attended to by the doctor and only receive minor procedures, dressings, and injections from the nurse in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> attendance, the fee is reduced to half, i.e. $2.50 per attendance. Patients who attend the hospital specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs) will be advised to obtain their dressings or injections at the outpatient dispensaries nearest their homes. This will save them considerable time, money, and travel expenses. If, however, they choose to return to the specialist outpatient clinics in the hospitals for dressings and injections, they will have to pay the full specialist outpatient clinic attendance fee of $10 (or $12 at the Singapore General Hospital). The intention of the Ministry of Health is to reduce the congestion and long queues at the specialist outpatient clinics and to make better use of the outpatient dispensaries nearer the patients' homes where the running costs are lower. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior citizens aged 65 and above and children under 18 years of age who are not employed, as well as students in schools and junior colleges, will continue to enjoy a 50% concession in respect of outpatient dispensary fees. They will also enjoy similar concessions for dental treatment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>No change in A &amp; E and SOC fees, and charges for the mentally and chronically sick</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of increasing running costs, the current Accidents and Emergency Units. Specialist Outpatient Clinics and other prescription fees at these clinics have not been increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment of the mentally and chronically sick will continue to be heavily subsidized by Government. They will pay the nominal daily fee of $2 and $5 respectively now levied on Class C mentally and chronically sick patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these increases that I have outlined are minimal in order to ensure that the subsidies that are paid out for hospital and health care will not be increased beyond the policy guidelines that are laid down by the Government. Regular revisions in fees will be unavoidable if we are to improve the services provided by our hospitals and clinics in the light of rapidly changing and improving scientific and medical discoveries and in view of continuing increases in recurrent expenditures. My Ministry, as I have said earlier, will take special steps to ensure \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that these increases will be gradual and will bear in mind the Singaporeans' capacity to pay for health care. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> May I remind hon. Members that they may only raise questions but not debate on the statement? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I put all my questions to the Minister at this one rising? Is the Minister aware that contrary to what he has told the House -that in the present charges, the ward fee was only $6 and there was a prescription fee of $2.50 and laboratory fee of $1.50, making in all $10 - is he aware that the Ministry has been collecting $10 regardless of whether there were any laboratory or X-ray tests done?. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Minister aware that these fee increases are staggering for Class C patients, without even taking into account the laboratory and X-ray fees which are 15% of Class A fees? They represent something like 85% increase on the present fee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister know how much revenue the Government now hopes to collect? I have had this answer from the Minister for Finance - how much revenue the Government hopes to collect from the increase in the registration fees for cars and in the road licences - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, that is not relevant to the Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I wish to ask why is it not possible for some of the charges for Class C patients to be met out of the substantially increased revenue which the Government is now collecting? Has he thought about that? Has he consulted the Minister for Finance about using some of those monies to pay for these Class C costs? The Minister for Finance's answer was that these monies would be used for the provision of services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Could you please confine your questions to the Statement? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> These are the questions that I have asked, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as I know there are only two questions. One is whether I am aware that the current fee of $10 is made up of $6 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for this, $2.50 for that and $1.50 for the other. That might have been in the colonial times. But now, ever since 1st January, 1983, the $10 was just an all-inclusive charge for Class C. And I have explained just now in my Statement that this is unsatisfactory because in order to control costs we have to itemize and cost every item so that we can decide what to charge. Otherwise there will be no financial control of the subsidies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asks whether or not I am aware that this is 180% of the present charge. I am more than aware of this. But, as I explained to him the last time, his reference to percentages i&amp; totally irrelevant. If I were charging 50 cents before and I now raise it to $1.50, 1 will be increasing it by 200%, making it 300%. It is irrelevant. If last year I did not charge anything, and this year I increase it to 1 cent, I will be charging one billion per cent or maybe more. So all these are irrelevancies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he brings up the question of taxes for motorcars. I have nothing to do with those things. So I cannot answer him, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he asks what is the increase in fees. I have given you the figures. This year the cost to the Government or the Ministry of Health is $340 million. Next year it will be $390 million. And I am quite sure that the year after, it will be more. So every year it will be more, We are saying that since these are the people receiving the treatment and the services, they should bear part of the cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked one relevant question. What will be the amount of increase in revenue that will arise from these increases in charges for hospitals and clinics? The figure is in the region of $15-$16 million which does not contribute to make-up the increase between $340 million and $390 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope he is satisfied. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all fee increases are painful to bear but my questions to the Minister are designed to find out whether \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> these particular increases are bearable to the patients involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is: since the Medisave is not to be introduced until April next year, why can he not wait until then to implement his fee increases? Why is he so impatient? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is the rate at which he is reclassifying the wards from C to B1, B2, A and so forth? Because this would have a direct bearing on the people who can enjoy the Class C wards at the lower rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, does he have any figures to show this House what is the percentage of workers and their families who are covered by company medical insurance schemes? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another question is: when does he intend to implement the means test whereby patients will not be admitted to Class C wards because they are able to pay for the higher class wards? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as regards the increase in fees, I am well aware that there will probably be people who feel that they are being charged too much. But, as I tried to explain, if you want the services to improve, it is unavoidable that these fees will have to increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question why we are so keen to implement it even before the Medisave comes into force, I have indicated that we will try to make regular but gradual increases. Since the last one was 1st January, 1983, it is a good date to have it on 1st January, 1984. The difference is three months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Statement, I have also referred to the assurance that I gave that medical services will be provided to people even though they cannot pay, Those who are poor can ask for write-off of their medical charges and we have done this regularly. I think the Member for Whampoa has experience in writing to my Ministry and some of the appeals that he made on behalf of the patients have been very sympathetically considered. We are not the monsters that you imagine us to be. In any case, every appeal for help goes \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> directly to the medical social worker stationed in the hospital. And -I am quite sure the medical social worker has been trained to be sympathetic to the poor. So that assurance having been given, we will probably meet with some people who claim that there will be difficulty. But I think that these problems can be ironed out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question, what is the reclassification of wards from C to B to A, our decisions are more dictated by the demand. And paradoxically, there is more demand for A and B1 wards than for C wards. At the moment, 70% of our hospital wards are C and we find that we cannot satisfy some of the B1 wards and better B2 wards. So there will be gradual reclassification. But I can assure him that even after all the reclassification, there will be 50% C wards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the means test, we are not very sure whether we want to introduce it at all. It depends on how this present increase works out and whether or not many people who claim that they want to go to C, although we know that they come in big cars, still insist on C. But with this rationalization of rates, there may not be the kind of people who want to go to C. My feeling is that they want to go to C now because the present rate structure is totally inequitable. I go to A. I want to save face. I pay $4,900. If I go to C, I pay only $248. The rate structure is totally skewed, lopsided. So we are not very sure when or even if we want to introduce the means test. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it was my past experience to announce the Ministry of Health's increases and charges, but I would like perhaps to assist the Minister for Health by asking him a few pertinent questions. Can he inform us what proportion of the Ministry of Health's revenue will arise from patients after the revision from taxes paid into the consolidated fund, what is the estimate in percentage increase in revenue after the revision and the percentage increase in MOH expenditure? If I calculated correctly, he said it was estimated to be 14.7% in 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could his Ministry, perhaps from the point of good housekeeping and accounting as well, inform the House whether bills would be itemized according to bed charge, meals, professional fee, prescriptions, laboratory fees, X-ray fees, operation fees, radiotherapy, physiotherapy? Would he also indicate the percentage increases in expenditure for maintaining wards, for maintaining dietary services, prescriptions, laboratory and X-ray services, operating services, radiotherapy and physiotherapy services? In this way we have a clearer idea whether the increases in fees in these different items are proportionate to increases in expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that, apart from the last question asking for details which are not yet available, the other three questions can be answered; except, of course, the part about the tax revenues that are paid into the consolidated fund. That is not within my purview. With the increase in fees, instead of collecting a revenue of $91 million from the patients, the estimated collection will be $97 million when we upgrade certain wards, and $106 million when we impose the new charges. Therefore, it is slightly more than the 14.7%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend first to cost every item - bed space charge, meal charge, prescription charge, nursing attention charge, X-ray, laboratory, various other costs and then itemize them and charge the A-class to expect at least recovery of costs. So the A-class will reflect the actual cost. For the B1 we will charge 75% of the cost. For the B2 we will charge 25% of the cost. For the C we will charge 15% of the cost. But, in addition, as I say, the B2 and the C-class patients will have the cut-off so that it will not give the charges an extra burdensome character. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what percentage of total revenue these various tests will constitute, I cannot give him the answer. I probably will want to work it out before giving it to him later. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>4.03 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BANKING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Banking Act (Chapter 182 of the Revised Edition)\", presented by the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (Dr Goh Keng Swee); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Companies Act (Chapter 185 of the Revised Edition)\", presented by the Ag Minister for Labour (Prof. S.

Stringent measures to prevent pollution of the watercourses and reservoirs will therefore be necessary so that our water supply is safe for consumption. This is especially so when many of our reservoirs are in unprotected catchments where only limited housing development and clean industries are allowed. Preventive measures have been taken whereby all industrial, trade and residential premises will need to comply with the pollution control requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a growing threat of contamination of our water resources through the indiscriminate dumping of toxic waste, which originates from the processes of industrial and trade establishments. This could have very serious consequences. An entire reservoir built at substantial cost may have to be written off altogether. There could be serious health implications as the toxic materials could be carcinogenic or cause long-term health effects. Outside of the catchments, efforts to clean up the rivers and canals to bring back marine life would be negated if such illegal dumping is unchecked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in April this year, a substantial quantity of toxic waste was found to have been dumped in the Kranji Catchment. The waste, containing mainly copper chloride, had leached through the ground and into a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> stream which flowed into the Kranji Catchment. A sample analysis of the water in the polluted stream indicated a high copper concentration. Fish kept in this water died within a few hours. A high level of copper in human beings can lead to brain damage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another illegal toxic dump was found the following month in May, just outside the Kranji Catchment, which contained nickel, copper, chromium, lead and zinc compounds. These chemicals, if consumed in sufficient quantities, can cause damage to the nervous system, internal organs and the brain. It could also lead to other long-term health hazards which are yet unknown or even death. A case in point is the highly publicised Love Canal in the United States where the population of an entire town suffered from various diseases associated with drinking contaminated water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the two local incidents were discovered in time to prevent contamination of the reservoirs. However, these serve to illustrate the vulnerability of our water resources to such wanton acts by irresponsible individuals and companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, important that we have sufficient penalties to deter people against the indiscriminate discharge of toxic wastes. The existing Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act, 1975, does not have penalties that sufficiently discourage such indiscriminate discharge which can cause untold damage. The Bill before the House is to provide these deterrent penalties to protect our population and water resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 14A of the Act will prohibit the discharge of toxic substances into any inland water and persons convicted of such an offence will be liable to a penalty of up to $10,000 fine or six months' imprisonment or both for a first offence. Mandatory imprisonment of between one month and one year will be prescribed in addition to a fine not exceeding $20,000 for a second or subsequent offence. For a third offence, the Minister may by order direct the person to cease with the process or business were the toxic substance is being produced. The present penalty is only a fine of up to $5,000 for the first \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> offence, and up to $10,000 for a subsequent offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision has been included to provide that where an offence is committed by a body corporate with the consent, connivance or due to neglect on the part of any officer of the body corporate, he will also be guilty of the offence. The Minister will also be empowered to make regulations on storage, removal and disposal of toxic wastes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the proposed penalties are heavy, no prosecution shall be instituted without the consent of the Public Prosecutor to prevent excesses in the enforcement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Pang Boon]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NOTARIES PUBLIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.18 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a short Bill which seeks to amend the Notaries Public Act in two respects. First, it amends section 5 of the Act relating to the revocation of appointment of a notary public in cases of misconduct. At present, that section only has application where the notary public has been struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. The Bill amends that section so as to enable the Attorney-General, who is the appointing authority, to also revoke the appointment of a notary public who has become a bankrupt or made an arrangement with his creditors or who has been found to be guilty of professional or other misconduct. The professional or other misconduct for the purposes of revocation must be of such a nature as to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> render, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, the notary public unfit to practise as such. This amendment is dealt with in clause 4 of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill inserts a new section 5A to the Act to enable the appointment of a notary public to be revoked in certain other circumstances where no misconduct is involved. These are where the notary public himself requests that his appointment be revoked (e.g. when he is leaving Singapore for good), or where he has ceased to practise as an advocate and solicitor for a continuous period of more than two years. This amendment is contained in clause 5 of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 3 are purely formal amendments and have no substantive effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise really on a point of clarification. The Minister has said that the present position is that the Attorney-General may revoke the appointment if the notary public has been struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors, and then he said that the Bill is designed to extend this power to give him the power to revoke the appointment if the notary public has been found to be guilty of such professional or other misconduct. What I would like to know from the Minister is, who is the person contemplated for finding the advocate and solicitor guilty of such professional or other misconduct? Is the Attorney-General made the arbiter or judge of whether a particular advocate and solicitor is guilty of professional misconduct and therefore empowering him to revoke? Or is it intended that he can only revoke the appointment if the notary public has been found guilty by a disciplinary committee of the Law Society and has been censored by the High Court of three judges but who have not struck him off the roll of advocates and solicitors? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, I am just wondering whether you wish to make a declaration.

Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this short Bill is to protect secret or confidential information relating to the affairs of certain statutory bodies and Government companies which are specified in the Schedule. The Bill prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of such information by existing as well as former members, officers, employees and agents of these specified organizations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizations specified are those which handle sensitive documents and information, the improper disclosure of which could be detrimental or damaging to the national or public interest. Although we have the Official Secrets Act, that Act does not extend to the disclosure of information which is concerned solely with the affairs of a statutory body or a Government company. There is no general provision dealing with the protection of secrecy of information received or generated by statutory bodies and Government companies (except where official secrets entrusted by the Government are involved). Further, no provision exists which prohibits former officers and employees of such organizations from making unauthorized disclosure of information. This Bill seeks to remedy the situation so that the secrecy and confiden- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tiality of sensitive information of such organizations can be better protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of the statutory bodies and Government companies in the Schedule has been made with great care. Only those statutory bodies and Government companies handling or likely to handle sensitive information which warrants protection by penal sanction have been specified in the Schedule. As a safeguard, the Bill also provides that no prosecution will be instituted without the written consent of the Attorney-General. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, you do not want me to make any declaration that I have no pecuniary interest in this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is up to you. I was just reminding you earlier on. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill seeks to throw a veil of secrecy over all affairs of a statutory body or a Government company. The Minister has set out the purpose of this Bill. That is quite evident from the Bill itself, that it seeks to throw a blanket, as it were, over all affairs of a statutory body or a Government company. What the Minister has not tried to explain to this House is why it is considered necessary to enact this Bill at this stage. He has referred to the Official Secrets Act. That Official Secrets Act spells out clearly the circumstances in which a person may be prosecuted for divulging information which he should not divulge and which information is considered to be detrimental or prejudicial to the safety or the national interest of Singapore. This Bill does nothing like that. It does not go out to spell any circumstances under which the man may be prosecuted, the man or woman. It virtually gives a carte blanche to the Attorney-General to decide whether anyone should be prosecuted or not for disclosing any information on the affairs of a statutory body or of a Government company, however innocuous, however trivial the information or document may be. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, claim is often made that in Singapore we have a democratic Government, that all our public affairs are conducted democratically. It is the essence of democracy - I do not have to remind Members of this House and the Minister - it is the essence of democracy that the conduct of public officials and the affairs of statutory bodies and companies should be subjected to the scrutiny of public opinion so long as whatever is subjected to their scrutiny does not endanger the safety of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 3 of this Bill makes it an offence for any person to disclose to any other person any secret or confidential document or information which he has obtained or to which he has access by virtue of his position as such member, officer, employee or agent. One might suppose that it is only a secret or confidential document or information that it is intended to be protected by this Act. But that begs the question, Sir, because who decides whether such information is confidential or secret? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I may illustrate what I am saying. After I became a Member of this House, I tried to obtain some information from the Prime Minister's Office, and my precise inquiry was whether I may be supplied with the rules of the Residents' Committees. The official that I spoke to at the Prime Minister's Office said, \"Oh, these rules of the Residents' Committees are not available to any person.\" So I had to remind him firmly that I was not just \"any person but I happened to be the Member of Parliament elected by the voters of Anson.\" After some haggling over the phone, he said, \"Well, it is all confidential, but if you want, you write in. So I had to write in and eventually, of course, I got it. But is that the sort of thing - rules designed to regulate the activities of the Residents' Committees are not to be disclosed, it would seem, even to a Member of Parliament if he does not happen to be in the official group of Members of Parliament in that club? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet one other instance, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Again, about three \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> months after I was elected, I wrote to the Ministry of Social Affairs asking whether I could be supplied with a list of persons in my Constituency who were receiving public assistance. And what did I get? \"Oh, no, you can't be supplied with that list.\" This is the sort of thing I get, but I am becoming used to it, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it would appear that we are going to extend all this even to Government companies and statutory bodies. If this Bill becomes law, and I am sure it will, it would mean that the public may not get any information about the affairs of a Government company or a statutory board. They will be told quite blandly, \"I am sorry. If you look up the Statutory Bodies and Government Companies (Protection of Secrecy) Act, 1983, you will see that we cannot disclose any information.\" Why is it necessary to keep all the activities of statutory bodies and Government companies under wraps? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, if we are as we claim, a democratic society, should we not open the doors wherever they can be opened without detriment to our national safety, without prejudice to our national interests? Should we not open the doors not only of Government Ministries but also of statutory boards and Government companies to public scrutiny? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in many countries there is this freedom of information available to a member of the public. Members may know that in Australia they have just passed quite recently a Freedom of Information Act under which any member of the public can telephone any Ministry or department and require information and he has got to be supplied with that information, unless the information falls within the exception laid in that Act. Should we not be thinking along those lines if we claim to be a democratic society, or should we as it were wrap the blanket more closely around ourselves so that nobody may even be able to look into what we are doing? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been said that the discovery of what has been known as Watergate which led to the downfall of the President of the United States was only possible because information was made \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> available and it had to be supplied. Is that not the sort of society that we should be aiming for, so that the public are kept informed of what the various Government companies are doing, what the Ministries are doing, what the statutory boards are doing? One might say, \"Well, the statutory boards put up their reports. You get the information in the reports if you look at them.\" Do we get the correct information? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had occasion before this to refer to the Annual Reports and the Financial Accounts and Statements of the Housing and Development Board. I have complained not once but twice that those Financial Accounts do not tell the whole story about the Housing and Development Board's activities. I have referred to the profits that were secreted away, and I see that even in the Report for the year ending 31st March, 1983, those profits derived by the Housing and Development Board from its MND Holdings have not been consolidated in the accounts. It would appear that I can just go on talking in vain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, that rather than introduce a Bill to cover up all affairs and activities of Government companies, we should really have a Bill making available information. Some of these boards are public utilities. The public would want to know what they are doing. They are entitled to this information. What is sensitive about their undertakings? What about the Government companies? Should we not know what they are doing? After all, the taxpayers are the shareholders. Are the shareholders not entitled to information? Why are we closing the doors? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I say that this Bill is thoroughly bad in principle and I shall vote against this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I shall be very brief because the hon. Member for Anson has given a lengthy speech based totally on a wrong reading of the Bill. Inadvertently or otherwise he has interpreted the Bill's intention as weaving a veil of secrecy over all affairs. He asked why should this Bill hinder the right of any one to ask questions about the organizations named in this Bill. If he had only taken the trouble to read the Bill \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> carefully, this Bill does not say anywhere in any of the provisions that any of the statutory boards or a Government company is barred from divulging any information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the gravamen of this Bill? It relates to unauthorized disclosure of secret or confidential information by a person who was in the employ or is in the employ of a statutory board. The issue is whether a person who was in the employ of a statutory board or a Government company, without authority of the statutory board or a Government company, should have the right to freely disclose to a third party confidential or secret information: The issue is not the right of the Member for Anson or anybody else to ask questions. The record speaks for itself. Other Members of this House and the Member for Anson at past sessions had not been prevented from asking questions, Questions for Oral Answer, Questions for Written Answer, and to raise matters during the Budget or other Sittings to elicit information and response from Ministers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all this edifice that he has erected about sinister motives of this Bill is completely unfounded. The issue again is very simple. If a person was or is in the employment of a statutory board or a Government company and has access to secret or confidential information, should our law permit him, without the authority of his employer, to divulge this information to whomsoever and in whatsoever circumstances? The Member for Anson seems to think that it is permissible. If that is his view, well, he is entitled to it. This Government cannot continue to let the gap in this law remain unfilled, and the purpose of this Bill is simply to ensure that persons in employment cannot resort to unauthorized disclosure of secret or confidential information without the penalty of the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have not misread the Bill, if it may please the Minister.

Of course, the company will decide - something which it does not want the public to know - to say, \"Well, this is unauthorized, my dear boy. We cannot breathe a word of this to anybody else.\" Why should the company be made the sole arbiter of what is authorized and what is unauthorized? That is my point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to dwell on this.

The collection of stamp duty on cheques, including travellers cheques, besides imposing an additional cost to banks and tourists alike is anachronistic, particularly when other methods of payment by credit cards and Giro do not attract stamp duty. The abolition of duty has already been affected by notification in the Gazette. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stamp Duties (Amendment) Bill, 1983, seeks to make consequential amendments. The amendments consist mainly of deleting the word \"cheque\" whenever it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> appears and those provisions, namely, sections 9, 44 and 45 relating to cheques in the Stamp Duties Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.00 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Finance and Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance and Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill is to give legislative authority to the income tax concessions announced in the 1983 Budget Statement, Opportunity has also been taken to include two other amendments to the existing legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was announced in the 1983 Budget Statement that with effect from Year of Assessment 1984, the chargeable income of any author or composer would be not more than 10% of the gross royalties and other payments received from local publishers for the right to use the copyright in any literary, dramatic or artistic work. Any company wholly owned by such authors or composers would also be able to enjoy this concession. Clause 2 of the Bill provides for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Budget concession is the exemption from tax on income derived from syndicated offshore loans, where the syndication work is carried out in Singapore, for the next five years beginning 1st April 1983, and for such further period as the Minister may approve. Clauses 3 and 8 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> amend sections 13 and 43A of the Act to empower the Minister to make regulations to provide for this. Clause 4 amends section 13B of the Act to allow dividends declared from the exempt income of such syndicated offshore loans to be also exempt from tax in the hands of shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st April 1983, if the periods of use of private hire (SZ) cars by any company or business enterprise exceed in aggregate 183 days, the whole amount of the rentals and other expenses incurred will be disallowed for purposes of tax deduction. If the rental periods overlap, the overlapping periods will be counted once only for the purpose of determining the 183-day limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the amendment effective, it is now necessary to include the use of other SZ cars by his employees as an employer's own use in computing the 183day limit for the purpose of claiming expenses on the use of SZ cars. Similarly, the use of SZ cars by his employer or co-employees would be taken into account in determining the employee's claim for deductions on the use of such cars. These are provided in clause 5. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 19A of the Act to provide for 100% depreciation allowance in the first year to be claimed on expenditure incurred on any computer or office automation equipment from Year of Assessment 1984. Residual allowance in respect of such equipment will also be available for full set-off. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from Year of Assessment 1983, the earned income relief will be increased from $2,000 to $3,000 for persons above 55 but below 60 years of age and from $3,000 to $4,000 for persons aged 60 years and above. Clause 7 provides for this as well as to allow handicapped persons of 55 years and above to claim earned income relief of $2,000 by virtue of his handicap in addition to the earned income relief of $3,000 or $4,000, depending on his age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced child relief for the specially qualified married woman is now the normal child relief plus 5% of the woman's annual earned income for each of her first \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> three eligible children. Clause 9 amends the fifth Schedule to the Act to provide for this to take effect from Year of Assessment 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to two other amendments to the existing legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 13 of the Act to extend the Minister's power to exempt from tax remittances of income from abroad to cover remittances from countries which have double taxation arrangements with Singapore. This will enable full tax exemption to be granted in those cases where the double taxation arrangement only provides for a reduced rate of tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 19A of the Act has been enlarged to enable the Minister to approve enhanced depreciation allowances for any balance of expenditure incurred on such equipment by a taxpayer, notwithstanding that he had previously claimed normal depreciation allowances in respect of that expenditure. These are provided in clause 6. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I speak, perhaps I had better say that I benefit by this amendment to clause 7, being over 55. So having declared my interest, may I speak. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the Minister has said, this Bill seeks to give legislative effect or authority to concessions made in the Budget for this year. What the Minister forgot to say was that these concessions were made purely to the rich. I do not want to repeat what I said in my Budget speech. There are two concessions here - enhancement of allowances for those who are 55 and those over 60 and also to the married women who are specially qualified persons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, as I tried to point out in my Budget speech, and as has been pointed out in letters after the Budget speech and the debates in this House, these two concessions are discriminatory. They favour the rich as against the poor. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> We have just been told this afternoon that those entering Class C wards will have to pay substantially higher charges. Whereas we are all too ready to impose charges on the poor for hospital care and treatment and for other services given to them because we say we cannot go on giving free services; the revenue cannot afford it or for whatever reasons. On the other hand, it would appear we are equally ready to hand back to those who do not need these concessions large sums of money. We have been told in the Budget that the loss to the revenue would be about $1.4 million in the concession given to married women who are specially qualified persons. I see now that this concession was probably brought in to prepare the way for the Prime Minister's appeal in the National Day Message to lure the specially qualified women who were not married yet to marry to get these concessions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I say that these concessions that were made, I do not want to repeat, are thoroughly objectionable. They are discriminatory based on wealth. And I say it is a shame that this Government should continue to bring in concessions for the rich whilst loading the poor with higher fees and costs for services given to them. For those reasons, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I shall oppose this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to give legislative authority to the concessions which have already been approved in the 1983 Budget Statement.

Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two aspects of the proposed amending legislation. One concerns the COWEC Scheme or Company Welfarism from Employer's Contributions. The second concerns the Approved Residential Properties Scheme. I shall deal with each of these separately. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>COWEC Scheme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept of using a portion of the employer's contribution to CPF for benefits provided by the companies to employees was outlined and discussed in this House in March this year. The proposed amendments, now before the House, particularly clause 4 which introduces two new sections, are to facilitate the implementation of the COWEC Scheme and to provide for certain safe-guards and penalties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living in an age of economic uncertainties and increasing protectionism. For Singapore to survive in this harsh economic climate, our products and services must have an edge over that of our competitors. Productivity must therefore be the cornerstone of our economic growth. One of the means of increasing the productivity will of our workers is to enhance the nexus between the employee and his employer. Employers must be encouraged to provide directly for the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> welfare of their employees who will then know that they are cared for by their employers and be willing to upgrade themselves and contribute to the well-being of their companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with this in mind that the National Productivity Board promoted the COWEC Scheme. Under this Scheme, an employer will be allowed to pay CPF contributions at a reduced rate of 36% of the salaries instead of the full rate of 46%. The 10% which would otherwise have been contributed to the CPF will be retained by the employer and paid into a trust fund to be set up by the employer for the benefit of the employees. Rules must be dr,awn up governing the amount of contributions payable by the employer into the trust fund, the time period within which the contributions must be paid, the interest payable on late payments, and the management, investment and use of the trust fund must be drawn up. The employer must also furnish a bank guarantee in favour of the CPF Board so that the Board can recover the contributions retained by the employer should the need ever arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the COWEC Scheme therefore is intended to forge a link between workers' efforts and good management. Experience elsewhere has shown that absence of such linkage leads to erosion of the will to work and to improve. The COWEC Scheme is one way of enhancing the nexus between the employees and their company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a pilot scheme, 10 companies have agreed to participate in the COWEC Scheme. It must be emphasized that the Scheme will be a voluntary one for both employers and existing employees. We shall use the pilot scheme to build up our experience so that we will gradually learn and broaden its scope. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 40A deals with the powers of the CPF Board, the obligations of the employers participating in the Scheme and the protection of contributions paid under the COWEC Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board will be empowered to approve any welfare scheme which provides for the payment of pensions, gra- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tuities or other pecuniary or welfare benefits by an employer to his employees. Any such welfare scheme which has been approved by the CPF Board will be called an \"approved employees' scheme\". An employer who has established a scheme will be entitled to pay a reduced rate of CPF contributions in respect of employees who are members of the scheme. The Board will also be empowered to revoke any approval given under the section. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section also requires the employer to furnish to the CPF Board audited accounts in respect of the approved employees' scheme, comply with the rules of the scheme, pay contributions in accordance with the rules, obtain the prior permission of the CPF Board before amending the rules and furnish such returns and other information which may be required by the CPF Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer who fails to comply with any of these obligations imposed under the provisions will be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000. If an employer is convicted for failure to pay contributions to the scheme, the court can also order him to pay the outstanding contributions and interests due thereon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All contributions paid into an approved employees' scheme will enjoy the same protection against creditors, etc., as CPF contributions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Approved Residential Properties Scheme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of the Bill relates to the Approved Residential Properties Scheme. This aspect of the Bill concerns Approved Residential Properties Scheme under which CPF moneys can be used to pay the purchase price of a private residential property or to redeem an outstanding mortgage loan on the property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present section 14 of the CPF Act was enacted in 1981 for purposes of implementing the Scheme. It creates a charge on a residential property which has been purchased with CPF moneys to secure the repayment of the moneys withdrawn, including the interest that would have accrued to the Member's account if the withdrawals had not been made and provides for matters relating thereto. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the Scheme, Sir, more than 10,000 members have withdrawn over $500 million. The experience gained in implementing the Scheme has shown that certain improvements can be made to the present section to overcome certain practical and legal problems encountered by the CPF Board, to save legal fees and other costs and to reduce the time taken for processing applications. Clause 3 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts with amendments section 14 of the Act to achieve this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just touch on a few of the important changes. First, where a property is owned by more than one person, the charge created under the present section 14 does not extend to the estates and interests of the co-owners who do not use their CPF moneys in respect of the property. Consequently, a co-owner who wishes to use his CPF moneys can only be allowed to withdraw up to 80% of the value of his share in the property instead of the value of the whole property. However, there have been applications under the Scheme by members, especially those who owned a property jointly with the spouse who was not a CPF member, to withdraw up to 80% of the value of the entire property. To meet this difficulty, the CPF Board had to require all the co-owners to execute a legal mortgage in favour of the Board. This, however, involves the payment of legal and stamp fees and other costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed new section 14, the charge created by the section will extend to all the estates and interests of all the co-owners of the property provided the co-owners give their written consent to the CPF Board. In this way, it will enable any of the co-owners to withdraw his CPF moneys up to 80% of the value of the whole property without the co-owners having to execute a legal mortgage in favour of the CPF Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present section 14 any housing loan which is disbursed by a financial institution after the borrower has withdrawn his CPF moneys under the Scheme will rank, in terms of priority, after the CPF Board's charge for all the moneys withdrawn and authorized to be withdrawn as well as the interests that would \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have accrued to the member's account if the withdrawals had not been made. However, most financial institutions have no objections if the principal loan given by them ranks after the Board's charge in respect of the CPF moneys withdrawn. On the other hand, they are reluctant to give adequate housing loans to borrowers who also want to use their CPF moneys, if their principal loan or any part thereof ranks after the Board's charge in respect of the accrued interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board has no objections in allowing the full amount of the loan given by a financial institution to rank before the Board's charge in respect of the accrued interest. This will make it easier for members to obtain adequate housing loans. However, because the present section 14 does not allow the Board to postpone its rights, the Board had to require the financial institution and the member to execute certain legal documents to protect the Board's interest. This involves the payment of legal fees and costs and may also delay the processing of the application. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the new section 14 will allow the CPF Board to give another mortgagee's or chargee's rights priority over the charge created by the section if the Board deems fit. The other changes are technical improvements of meanings and clarification of interpretations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>6.02 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, ever since the Committee on Productivity published its report in 1981, there has been concern among workers over the proposal to hive off a part of the employee's CPF into some welfare fund. The Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill, when passed by the House, will allow employers to implement the COWEC scheme. Although the COWEC scheme has been discussed by the National Productivity Council, the workers are largely ignorant of the scheme. I must add that there are also many employers who are equally ignorant of the Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The COWEC scheme needs wider publicity and explanation to the workers at grassroots level. While the top union leadership understand that the objective of the Scheme is to promote a closer, stronger link between employers and employees, the rank and file members, the ordinary workers, have not quite grasped this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who is going to be affected by the Scheme should first know what it is about. What does it entail? How will they benefit? Therefore, before the COWEC Scheme is implemented, there must be an active effort to inform all workers, in a simple and straightforward way, so that they fully understand the Scheme. They should be assured that they will not lose out if they participate in the COWEC Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our workers know about CPF. They know what returns they can get out of the CPF contributions. Many of them also depend on CPF contributions to pay for their HDB flats. When we propose hiving off part of it to form COWEC, there will be concern among them over whether COWEC can be used to pay for their HDB flats. Since the number of workers who are paying for their HDB flats is not inconsiderable, it would be wise to give a categorical reassurance once again that COWEC will help workers pay for their homes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COWEC is something new and, naturally, workers will compare the new scheme with existing benefits that they enjoy. Some of the questions that our workers will ask include:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, how does COWEC affect the CPF Scheme? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what can workers expect to benefit from COWEC? Will these benefits be the same as existing benefits, but paid for by their own CPF funds? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, how does COWEC work? Are there examples of proposals that have been worked out which the Minister can reveal that would help explain this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, how will the workers' interests be safeguarded? Will workers have a say \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in the management of the COWEC Fund? Will the Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill that we are discussing contain safeguards? What happens if the COWEC Fund is mismanaged? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When details are made known, I am sure our workers will have more questions. If the COWEC Scheme is to be successful, we have to clear the doubts of the workers in the factories. It is only when they fully understand, can they be motivated by such a Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the COWEC Scheme is to strengthen the link between employers and employees. As such, the management must see the Scheme as beneficial. Yet, we find that at the moment some of them throw cold water on the Scheme. They regard administering the COWEC Scheme as an extra burden, extra responsibility. Such an attitude reflects their attitude towards their employees. Even if the Scheme were to be compulsory and handsome returns are gained from the COWEC Fund, there will not be any loyalty because the attitude of the employers does not merit loyalty. We must remember that the Scheme is meant to help strengthen the link between employers and employees, and this will only be achieved with the right management attitude. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the sceptical employers will change their attitude if they understand what COWEC is about. An active effort to explain it seems very necessary. \n  <br>6.08 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the Central Provident Fund Act provides for the introduction of the COWEC Scheme which allows the employers to retain part of its CPF contributions in a trust fund which can be used to provide welfare benefits to its employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, the objective of the Scheme is to strengthen the nexus between the company and its employees. It is hoped that through the COWEC Scheme, the employees would identify their well-being closely with their employer and this would help to inculcate a sense of commitment to their work and loyalty to the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I subscribe to the ideal of the Scheme and what it sets out to achieve, I wish to register the following points for the consideration and clarification by the Minister:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The selling point of this Scheme is that the benefits that an employee would enjoy should be better than what would be accrued to him if the money were to be left in the CPF. The COWEC Scheme requires that the principal sum retained in the trust fund be secured by a banker's guarantee. However, there is no guarantee required on the amount of interest the principal sum would generate. Presently, the CPF offers an interest return of 6 1/2%. If we wish to assure the employees who opt for COWEC Scheme that they have nothing to lose by joining the Scheme, and since the whole exercise is intended to generate benefits better than what would be derived by putting the money in CPF, I suggest it would be prudent to require that not only the principal sum retained in the trust fund be secured by a banker's guarantee, but the interest rate of 6 1/2% or any prevailing CPF interest rate must also be secured. I do not think it is wise to expose the employees to the risk of getting an interest return of less than what is being offered by CPF. I would, therefore, like to see companies operating the COWEC Scheme to include the guarantee on both the principal sum and the interest as a standard feature. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme is voluntary and the existing employees have the option of joining or not joining the Scheme. My view is that the Scheme should be open to all the employees of the company, right from the General Manager to the lowest graded staff. There should be no distinction between bargainable employees and non-bargainable employees. To demonstrate to the employees that the Scheme is indeed beneficial to them, the top management, and indeed all the managers and supervisors, should take the lead in opting for the Scheme. If the management staff themselves choose not to opt for the Scheme, I do not see how they can convince their subordinates and other employees to do so. If the managers themselves feel that it is safer to leave their money in CPF rather than to opt for the COWEC Scheme, then the effort to con- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> vince the employees to join the Scheme is doomed to fail right from the word \"go\". As a matter of fact, the credibility of such a Scheme would be seriously questioned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The COWEC Scheme is intended to provide benefits over and above those currently being provided by the employer. The company should not, subsequent to the introduction of the Scheme, seek to withdraw or reduce the existing welfare benefits. Let me bring to the attention of the Minister that with the introduction of the proposed Medisave Scheme, some employers are already talking about withdrawing, offsetting or adjusting the existing company medical benefits. Similarly, I am aware of at least one employer who has indicated that some existing service benefits should be replaced by the COWEC Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to seek the assurance of the Minister that in approving a company's COWEC Scheme, the Government should see to it that the company does not reduce or withdraw the existing welfare benefits. I am registering this point strongly for the very simple reason that the fund to be provided under the COWEC Scheme is the employees' money which is apportioned out from their CPF entitlement, notwithstanding the fact that the contributions come from the employers. Any attempt to replace the existing welfare benefits by COWEC will, on balance, place the employees in a worse-off situation. Unless the COWEC Scheme could offer something over and above the existing benefits, it is only natural to expect the employees to prefer to leave their money in the CPF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude my observations by saying that the COWEC Scheme is not the panacea to all the problems of staff morale, employees' motivation or labour-management relations. It would be naive to believe that by the mere mechanical introduction of a COWEC Scheme, the employee would feel obligated to the company and would be motivated to work hard. What is important is not so much the form, but the substance. Whether there be COWEC or no COWEC, the management must always have the interest and welfare of the employees at heart. They must be sincere \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in looking after the interest and welfare of the workers. COWEC provides a framework and mechanism for the company to practise some forms of company welfarism, but it is up to the employers to fill in. the substance and to make it work. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I propose to be brief. May I say that I share what has been said by the previous two speakers, and I wish to ask the Minister by way of clarification as to how the agreement of the workers is to be obtained to this approved employees' scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he has said and as it appears from the Bill, the worker is to be given an option whether he wishes to join in the scheme or not. Is the obtaining of the approval of the worker to be left to the company, or is it going to be obtained by a body outside the company, for example, the Registrar of Trade Unions or somebody in the Labour Ministry? Will the Board or the Ministry ensure, as has been pointed out quite adequately, that before any worker exercises his option whether to join the scheme or not he is adequately and truthfully informed of the whole scheme, what he stands to gain by it and what are the disadvantages, if any; a proper balance sheet, as it were, drawn up in simple language to explain to him so that he can fully understand and exercise his option in a meaningful way, so that he is not misled by the company or the employer who may be only too anxious to have his contributions to the Board reduced. \n  <br>6.15pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to make two points on the COWEC scheme. First, I agree with my colleague, the Member for Pasir Panjang, that there is an urgent need to provide more information to workers about this scheme and to explain carefully the implications of the scheme to them. It is important for the companies which propose to introduce the scheme to ensure that their employees clearly understand the scheme before it is implemented. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I feel that it is useful for the employees to be allowed to make suggestions on how the COWEC fund should be operated. More specifically, what types of benefits they want the company to provide out of this scheme? In this way, the benefits will be more relevant to their needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for management to demonstrate clearly that it has the employees' interest and welfare at heart. This should not be taken for granted even when a company operates a COWEC scheme. It will not be easy to develop the nexus between the employee and the employer in any company or organization, especially if the employer does not show sincerely its care and concern for the employee. While top management may be genuinely committed to the welfare and well-being of their employees, middle management may be not so enthusiastic and often are more task orientated than people orientated. Top management must always check their middle management officers and the supervisors to ensure that they will treat their subordinates with care and consideration. This will help create mutual trust and confidence. Unless they are able to motivate their subordinates, it will be difficult to increase productivity. The existence of a COWEC scheme in the company will be of no avail unless middle management and supervisors are properly trained and can perform their responsibilities properly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Members who have spoken on this Bill, in particular the Members for Pasir Panjang, Boon Lay and Geylang Serai, who have demonstrated their sincerity in the subject by staying behind to listen to my responses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleagues have made several points, I have made a note of the various points and comments which they have raised, all of which I take it to be in the direction of constructive suggestions. This is a new scheme. It is experimental in a sense, the success of which will be known in time to come. If it succeeds, it will trigger off other similar schemes. So we need as many constructive suggestions as possible. It may not be possible for me to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reply to each and every one of the various points mentioned, but I will endeavour to do my best now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general point made by all three hon. Members was the need for maximum publicity, information and knowledge about this scheme to be disseminated to all levels of workers, especially the grassroots level. This is a point which is well taken, for I would agree that the more that is known, the more will misconception be dispelled, and the greater the support will come forth from the workers. Considerable effort at publicity has, in fact, as Members will know, been already done - talks, seminars, symposiums, press articles and more recently a very simple brochure or pamphlet has been published. I take the hon. Members' point here to be whether more can be done and more should be done. The answer to that must, of course, be yes, and efforts will continue in that direction to disseminate as much information as possible to clarify as many questions as there are. So I wish to give my assurance on that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point raised by the Member for Pasir Panjang was that he attached importance to the need to give an assurance as to how this would impinge on existing home ownership schemes and whether they would be adversely affected. There, too, I should reassure hon. Members, and through them to those outside who will be interested in the scheme, that the employee in a COWEC scheme will not be adversely affected in respect of the housing scheme or any other approved scheme under the CPF. That is to say, if the balances in his CPF account are insufficient for him to participate in the housing programme, then his balances in the COWEC scheme will be used, and this is a condition under which the CPF Board will approve various COWEC schemes. This is a point which has been reiterated in all cases where proposals have come forth. So that assurance I gladly give. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one hon. Member have stressed that everything turns on employer/ employee relationship and positive cooperation between management and the employees - the necessity to consult. This again is very important. A funda- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mental feature of the scheme is the element of voluntariness both for the employer and for existing employees. Because it is voluntary, obviously both the employer and employees must be persuaded that it is in their interest to do so. This requires a fairly high level of collaboration and cooperation. So this point is also one which is valid and one which we in the Ministry of Labour as well as the National Productivity Board will not fail to bear uppermost in our minds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Lay asked whether this would in any way adversely affect existing benefits which are enjoyed by the employee. Here again, I need to stress that the scheme of COWEC emphasizes that all benefits under COWEC must be over and above current benefits. And this will be ensured by the approving authority in process of approving the scheme through a comparison of the proposed benefits with a list of existing benefits. So I can give him that assurance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Lay also asked this question that while under the COWEC scheme the employer is required to obtain a banker's guarantee for the 10% or principal sum which will be invested in a trust fund and whether a similar requirement can also be imposed in terms of a banker's guarantee for the interest. We have given thought to this. Theoretically, it will be possible to insist on a banker's guarantee for the interest on the principal sum. But the intention of the Government in implementing the COWEC scheme is to give considerable flexibility to the participating firms in devising as wide and varied a range of benefits under the COWEC scheme. If we imposed a requirement of a banker's guarantee, this could be done but it may reduce and constrict the flexibility and the range of benefits that would be provided. But I think the Member for Boon Lay would be pleased to hear that of the 10 companies which are participating in the scheme, nearly all of them, in their tentative proposals sent up for approval, have not only provided for banker's guarantee for the 10% principal but have also provided for guarantee for the CPF interest. So I think that those 10 companies have set a pattern which will be very difficult for other companies to depart from. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang and I believe the Member for Geylang Serai also, stressed the importance of managerial staff and middle management staff being well versed in the scheme. This is a point which has not escaped us and several workshops have been conducted by the NPB, precisely to ensure not only the letter but also the spirit of the scheme will be thoroughly understood by those in charge of implementing it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Pasir Panjang asked for some indication as to the types of benefits or schemes which may be covered by the COWEC concept. There are basically two types of schemes. One type is a scheme whereby the investment income from the principal sum is devoted exclusively for retirement. Under this scheme, in addition to the 10% principal sum, all incomes will be kept for retirement. To give you one illustration which is interesting: one of the companies under this scheme has a proposal whereby if the employee resigns within five years of employment, he would not only have the 10% returned to his CPF account but also the interest. But if he serves more than five years in the company, then he will enjoy increasingly a proportion of net investment income. This will serve to encourage the employee to remain loyal and to foster a link between the employer and employee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other type or category of benefits involves retirement benefit plus various other benefits. For example, in addition to the retirement funds based on the 10%, the investment income could be used for various benefits such as educational allowances, scholarships, medical benefits, various group activities, recreational activities, life insurance premiums, long service cash withdrawal and similar benefits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I apologize to the Members if I have not dealt with all the other points but I hope this covers the main points that they have raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof S.

The recent steep increases in road taxes, additional registration fees (ARF) and preferential additional registration fees (PARF) have generated a great deal of unhappiness among car owners, potential car owners and the non-car owning public as well. Car owners became even more aggrieved when the increase in petrol prices followed the road tax increase. With effect from 1st January 1984, car parking charges will also be increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Ag Minister for Communications owes the public a full and clear explanation of his Ministry's land transport policy, particularly on private car ownership, traffic management measures to ensure a smooth flowing traffic on our roads, even during peak hours, and the upgrading of the taxi and bus services. Statements such as, \"it is not the Government's intention to prevent people from owning cars\" and \"the problem is not car ownership, but traffic congestion\", need to be more clearly explained. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in land-scarce Singapore, there is indeed the obvious need to control the car population, as we need our premium land for our housing and industries. Having said that, I feel that the Ministry of Communications should work out a total or comprehensive solution to tackle this problem. Fiscal measures work on the assumption that they will be adequate enough to discourage potential car owners as well as encourage existing car owners to give up their cars by making it expensive to own and maintain private cars. However, the car owners value the mobility and freedom of movement which a car can give them and may well make sacrifices of other needs and pleasures to continue to be able to own cars. Their cars make travelling convenient for them. Besides not all areas in Singapore are easily accessible by public transport services. These factors should be carefully weighed in the formulation of the land transport policy and particularly the question of private car ownership. Sharp increases in road taxes and other fiscal measures increase the financial burden of the car owners to maintain their cars but by itself it is rather doubtful whether it will eventually help curb the car population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1972, fiscal measures were introduced from time to time to curb the increase in the private car population. Yet the number of cars brought into our roads continue to increase. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would be grateful if the Acting Minister for Communications will give this House his considered assessment of how confident he is on the effectiveness of the recently imposed fiscal measures to check private car ownership increase. Could he also enlighten the House on other measures which he has considered but were kept in reserve. It was reported that he has a repertoire of some 35 ways to check the increase in car ownership. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my discussions with my community leaders and constituents on this issue, they have expressed the view that the Government should first look at other ways to curb car population. They have asked why a system of quotas for purchase of new cars cannot be introduced. They pointed out that the easy availability of car loans on attractive terms for car \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> purchases have encouraged or persuaded many to purchase cars. Why has the Government not tighten this availability of soft loans up to the full purchase price as a way to discourage purchase of cars? They have also asked why the Government has not considered restricting purchases on replacement basis only, that is, on a one-for-one basis. In this connection, is the present PARF system effective and, if not, how could it be improved so that car purchases will be mainly on the PARF basis of replacement only? These are some of the more common measures which have been raised, and I hope the Minister for Communications will explain why they are not considered feasible or appropriate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal measures have affected both car owners as well as non-car owners. It came during a period when there are increases in the charges or rates administered by other Ministries as well. We have just heard today that hospital charges will be revised from the 1st January 1984. Could the Acting Minister for Communications enlighten the House whether he has assessed the inflationary impact of the fiscal measures introduced to control the car population? In my discussions with my constituents, some have pointed out that the increase in the maintenance cost of a car brought about by road taxes and petrol price increases will start a chain reaction leading to increases in the prices of essential goods and services. This will make life difficult for the workers, particularly the low wage earners. Why should they suffer because of the need to control the car population? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned above, it was said that car ownership is not the problem. Rather it is the traffic congestion on our roads. The Acting Minister has stated that the current private car population is large enough to cause severe traffic congestion on 12% of our key roads during the peak periods. Yet the Acting Minister has not come out with any traffic management proposals to solve this traffic congestion problem. The fiscal measures will not be able to do much to clear the traffic congestion quickly. It is crucial that the Ministry of Communications work out a plan to alleviate the traffic congestion which is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> counter productive and causes unnecessary lengthening of travelling time to and from work and fuel wastage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can explain how much land we can afford to set aside for road space, car parks and related facilities. What are his Ministry's plans to maximize the utilization of the existing road space? This may require more innovative measures like the Areas Licensing Scheme (ALS) and there is the speculation that this Scheme will be extended if the road congestion does not improve. The Acting Minister has hinted of more drastic measures if the fiscal measures do not work. It will be better if the traffic management measures could be considered together with the fiscal measures so as to give those who want to buy cars and those who can be persuaded to give up their cars ample notice of what is in the future for car owners and the price which they would have to pay to maintain their cars. The fiscal measures, traffic management measures and improvements in public transport systems must be taken together, not separately. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private car population amounts to 42% of our motor vehicles and the other vehicles also contribute to the congestion. What steps are being taken to regulate their usage on the road? There is the general feeling that while the increase in car population has to be firmly controlled, the measures to do so should only be taken after improving the existing transport modes. Car owners and potential car owners can be persuaded to give up their cars if they see the taxi and bus services improving. There is already a new transportation mode which is now being built, i.e. the MRT, which will be in operation (at least the first phase) in 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions have been asked regarding what measures have been taken to upgrade the existing taxi and bus services. For taxis, the usual complaint is that it is difficult to obtain them during the peak hours. At present 38% of taxis are equipped with radio phones. More of our taxis should have radio phones. It will help the taxi service to be run more efficiently and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> it will cut down aimless plying and bring taxis directly and quickly to the commuters. What the public wants is a taxi service which is reliable, comfortable and available at a reasonable price. At the same time, ta)%i drivers must be given incentives to go on the road. The Ministry of Communications has set up a Taxi Task Force to look into the taxi service. It should work towards upgrading the service to make it more reliable, more comfortable and easily available, especially during peak hours, at a reasonable price. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus service, besides being comprehensive in its route coverage, must be able to meet the high expectation of a comfortable ride at reasonable prices. Would the Minister enlighten the House on measures which are in hand to improve the bus service? Is there sufficient competition for the Singapore Bus Service to push it to provide a better service? It may be necessary to give the buses more road space, like the introduction of dual bus lanes, but this will also contribute to the traffic congestion. There must be a judicious balance of road space usage among public transport vehicles, private vehicles and commercial vehicles. Unless the bus service is modernized to provide fast and comfortable service at reasonable prices, it will be difficult to encourage those who are presently using their cars to take buses instead, because of the convenience of driving their cars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, the MRT will come on stream and it is geared to cater for Singapore's long term transportation needs. What will be the position of private car ownership when the MRT is operational? Will more stringent measures to control private car ownership be introduced then? Will traffic management measures, like the extension of the ALS, be imposed to curb car usage on our roads also? Will the questiOn of ownership of private cars then be left as an individual's choice based on his ability to pay? Could the Minister paint the scenario on the future of private car ownership when the MRT is fully operational? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Acting Minister for Communications to prepare a comprehensive report on the land transport policy for public debate. Let the report \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be available for public discussions in the same way as the Medisave Scheme. I feel that in this way we can get the public to examine thoroughly the implication of private car ownership on our limited area of land. The question is whether we should set aside so much of our premium land for roads, car parks and related facilities. We have other critical uses for our limited land - housing, industries, catchment areas, to name a few. As our economy develops and incomes increase, our people will look forward to purchase their own cars. They must clearly understand why the car population must be controlled. Fiscal measures merely frustrate them but the message is not clearly conveyed to them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, there must be a total and comprehensive solution to curb the car population. Ad hoc measures, fiscal or otherwise, will not be sufficient enough to lead to a slowing down of car population growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Acting Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Communications (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Member for Geylang Serai for his very thorough analysis of the problems confronted by us in Singapore regarding land transportation. He has raised a total of about 25 points and in the 10 minutes allotted to me I shall attempt to reply to him, not on a point-by-point basis, because I do not think it will be possible. But I hope, in the 10 minutes available, to outline the principles that govern the policies on land transportation and traffic management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member is right in putting his finger on the nub of the problem. The so-called car problem in Singapore is not really a car problem at all. It is really a problem of shortage of land. In Singapore, we all know that we have a very limited amount of land, some 620 sq km. On this limited amount of land we must provide homes for our people, factories and offices to generate jobs, open space and greenery for recreational purposes, army camps, naval and air bases, training areas for security and defence, catchment areas and reservoirs for collection and storage of water and so on. To this very long list of competitive economic uses of land must \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be added roads and car parks for transportation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have been very fortunate that over the last two and a half decades of good government, we have rapid increases in disposable incomes for all Singaporeans. Our Government policy is to make easily available subsidized HDB flats to our citizens and this has added and reinforced what we have already noticed, which is, the rising expectations of our people as well as the rapid increase of disposable incomes. As a result of these factors, large numbers of people are now able to afford cars. Just over the last five years alone, there has been an increase of 42%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government can and has undertaken to make easily available homes for everybody, it cannot undertake to make easily available cars for everybody. This is because the car is a very land-intensive mode of transportation. A car requires approximately 150 square metres of roads to service it. That is the amount of land required for a terrace house. Just for comparison, at peak hours, the bus with a capacity of up to 100 passengers, is about 50 to 70 times more efficient in the utilization of roads than the average car with an occupancy of one or two. Imagine instead of having one bus, we have 50 to 70 cars on the road carrying approximately the same number of people, with the same passenger capacity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has reached a stage of development where rapid increases in cars are no longer possible. Our roads cannot accommodate the increases. As a result, serious traffic congestion occurs regularly on our roads, especially during the peak hours. Many Singaporeans realize it as they encounter traffic jams every day. What many Singaporeans do not realize is that we have twice as many vehicles per square kilometre of land as Hong Kong and four times as many vehicles per square kilometre as Japan. And both Japan and Hong Kong are considered landscarce countries. Furthermore, we have about one-third more roads per square kilometre of land in Singapore compared to Japan and about four times as many kilometres of roads compared to Hong Kong. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our projections over the next five years indicate that our increase in roads will be approximately 1% per year. So just a matter of simple arithmetic, any increase in the number of vehicles over and above that percentage increase can only add to the already severe congestion we are currently experiencing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two months, after the announcement of the increases in road tax, I have met hundreds of Singaporeans at every level - from the hawkers all the way to the managing directors - and I have found Singaporeans to be practical and realistic in their understanding and appraisal of the problem. This speaks well for us in Singapore. It speaks well for the intelligence and the sense of reality of the typical Singaporean. Except for a handful of people with a vested interest in the motor-car industry and who are totally unconcerned about the national consequences of severe traffic congestion, Singaporeans, by and large, do not dispute the need to slow down the increase of cars. Anybody on a bus or in a car, caught in a traffic jam which occurs daily, knows that the situation cannot be allowed to deteriorate. Where there has been a difference of opinion, they have centred round how this growth rate can be reduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry welcomes suggestions from all quarters. Various suggestions have been made by our Members of Parliament as well as members of the public. Many of the suggestions are useful. They have been considered by our Ministry and will be implemented in due course at the appropriate time. Other suggestions, however, are not practical because they do not take full account of the total problem. Still, other suggestions are biased, extremely so, particularly towards a certain sector of the population, namely, the existing car owners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has worked out detailed explanations on the various suggestions made. In the coming weeks, they will be made public to give Singaporeans a better understanding of the pros and cons, the advantages and disadvantages of each of the many suggestions made. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Yeo, you have exactly five minutes to wind up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Thank you, Sir, My Ministry has always taken a comprehensive approach in working out the problems of land transportation, liaising with the other relevant ministries and taking full account of the implications of policies made. Such comprehensive studies of the problems will continue. However, I must stress that having a comprehensive plan does not mean that all the measures must be implemented together at one and the same time, on a once-and-for-all basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent measures on ARF, PARF, road tax, parking fees, petrol tax as well as the streamlining of the bus routes, the increases in the number of taxis, the widening of our roads and the increased computerization of our traffic junctions, all these plus many others reflect the comprehensive approach that we are taking towards traffic management. Other measures will be implemented at the appropriate time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stressed that land transportation is a constantly evolving problem. It is not a static problem. There are therefore no solutions or combinations of solutions that will give it a permanent effect. Therefore, the management of the problem must be dynamic. It must adapt and respond to the changing circumstances and demands. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to assure the House that my Ministry is carefully studying the problem of land transportation in Singapore not just for the near future but for the longer term future. We will continue to make improvements in public transportation, to make it as cheap, as convenient and as comfortable as possible for users of public transport, be it the bus or the MRT. On the other hand, the cost of ownership and usage of cars must eventually take into account the social and economic costs of such land-intensive mode of transportation, Singaporeans are free to choose and will always be free to choose their preferred mode of transportation. If they prefer to use the bus, they would save themselves a lot of money which they can spend on themselves, on their children, on their home or even on their holidays. If \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they choose to own a car, then they must be prepared to pay the economic cost of the extra convenience and comfort that comes with owning a car. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai raised the possibility of the use of the Area Licensing Scheme. Sir, this scheme has been found to be effective after implementation, and it is indeed the intention of my Ministry to extend the ALS both in time and boundary as and when the need for such extension arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked if tax measures to-date have been effective. Our records over the last decade indicate that together with other measures implemented progressively in a comprehensive manner, the increases in road tax and ARF have indeed been very effective. Following the tax increases in 1975 the number of cars com- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ing on to the roads in 1976 and 1977 showed a decrease of 5.6% and 0.4% respectively. The recent increases have also reduced the rate of increase by about 30% and this has been achieved in spite of the strenuous efforts by car dealers to get rid of their old and existing stock during this pre-festive season. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at thirty-one minutes past Six o'clock pm and the Debate having continued for half an hour, Mr Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at One\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   minute past Seven o'clock pm\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN STATUTORY BOARDS AND GOVERNMENT-OWNED COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

Generally, an enlightened policy is adopted towards convicted persons who apply for jobs. However, each case has to be considered on its individual merits. In considering for employment an applicant who has been convicted of a criminal offence, the Public Service Commission will, in consultation with Permanent Secretaries and Heads of Departments, take into account the seriousness and nature of the offence as well as the likelihood of recidivism. This is necessary because civil servants, especially those in the higher Divisions, have access to sensitive information. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>USE OF FOREIGN-REGISTERED VEHICLES IN SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> It is undesirable to divulge the quantum of compensation as the person involved may wish to have this information kept confidential. In deciding on the quantum of compensation, the circumstances of each case are considered carefully and the factors taken into account by the Ministry of Labour include the length of employment, the work attitude of the employee, prospects of finding alternate employment with similar salary and service condition, apportionment of blame for the dismissal and gravity of the employee's misconduct, if any. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of compensation awarded to the dismissed employee in the case mentioned by the MP for Anson did take into account the abovementioned factors. The quantum of compensation is deemed adequate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act does not prescribe the quantum of compensation which the Minister can order. Section 14(4) of the Employment Act allows the Minister either to order compensation for the unfairly dismissed employee or the employer to reinstate him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case, my Ministry did not consider reinstatement as an appropriate remedy.

Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> There was a sudden upsurge in crimes, particularly robberies, housebreakings and thefts of motor-vehicles for the first 10 months of this year as compared to the same period in 1982. In recent months, the situation had been aggravated by the occurrence of several violent crimes in which firearms were used. A feeling of insecurity and unease among the public was developing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police therefore had to respond, and decided to launch a series of intensive island-wide anti-crime operation code-named 'Operation Senjata'. This was timed for the festive season, when crime could be expected to increase. The overall objective was to keep up pressure on potentially criminal groups, to emphasise our efforts to maintain law and order and to serve as a reminder to criminal elements that tough action will be taken against them. The specific objectives were: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to increase police presence on the ground and thereby help strengthen the feeling of public security and order; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to intensify discreet checks in locations which have been found to have habitually attracted criminals, and thereby deter crime; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to intensify efforts in apprehending specific targets wanted in connection with major offences committed in recent months. The operation was certainly a success in meeting these objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the operation which deployed uniformed officers drawn from the Divisional Police, Police Task Force, Volunteer Special Constabulary and non-operational Commands, had increased public perception of Police presence and enhanced public confidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a comparison of crime figures for the 3 weeks before and after the launching of Operation Senjata, showed that the operation had deterred criminals from committing various offences. For example, the number of robberies was down by 9%, housebreakings by 29%, thefts of motor-vehicle by 16% and molestation cases by 44%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, out of 384 persons who were detained or prosecuted for various criminal offences, several were, in fact, persons wanted by the Police in connection with serious offences including firearm offences, robbery, housebreaking, rape, secret society activities and drug offences. Arrests were also made for offences discovered during the operations. Weapons, including 3 firearms, were also recovered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity through the mass media was essential. First, the Police were seen to be effective through intensive patrols and checks. Secondly, in a major operation like this, it was desirable to inform the public of the operation so that they would fully understand the rationale and would not be alarmed by the increased police presence. Such awareness through publicity helped the Police to gain the unprecedented cooperation and understanding of the public when they were subjected to checks or were delayed at a roadblock. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BOYS' CLUBS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Progress Report)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will give a progress report on the Boys' Clubs which have been established, setting out the reasons for the establishment, the extent of membership and his Ministry's assessment of the usefulness of these Clubs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Since June 1982, eight Boys' Clubs have been formed in eight constituencies, namely, MacPherson, Bedok, Tanjong Pagar, Kuo Chuan, Kim Seng, Ang Mo Kio, Jurong and Bukit Merah. Each Club has a Management Committee comprising civic group leaders, police representatives, representatives of People's Association and representatives of the boys. The day-to-day activities of each Boys' Club are organised and controlled by 5 Police officers - one Sergeant and 4 others who are either Corporals or Constables. These 5 officers are engaged in these duties on a full-time basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reasons for the establishment of Boys' Clubs by the Singapore Police Force are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to help channel the energy of youths towards healthy sports, recreational and social activities which will inculcate correct values, develop character and leadership qualities, protect them from undesirable peer group influences and thereby pre-empt them from indulging in delinquency; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to identify youths with problems that could potentially lead them into delinquency and to ensure that such youths receive help and counselling from police officers and volunteer social workers with the objective of preventing alienation from the mainstream of society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a close link between juvenile delinquency and crime. By helping society tackle the problem of juvenile delinquency, the Police will also achieve another primary objective - that of reducing crime. It also serves to forge closer links and rapport between the community and the police. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response to the Boys' Clubs has been overwhelming. To date, 6,575 boys have joined the clubs. This is an increase of 80% from the initial membership of 3,658 when the clubs were formed. 72% of them are between the age group of 12 and 15 years. A number of them are premature school-leavers, an important group of young people who need proper guidance so that they are not led astray in their crucial formative years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities organised include regular games such as badminton, soccer, roller skating, table-tennis, carroms, swimming, jogging, hiking, Tae-Kwon-Do and boxing. There are also coordinated joint activities involving all clubs such as a Boys' Club Military Band and a Police Boys' Club Camp. The clubs also organise educational and cultural activities and participate in community and constituency projects, such as visits to the Singapore Science Centre, visits to Homes for the Aged to help in their cleaning and maintenance, and participation in Civil Defence projects and in various activities of Residents' Committees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early to assess the usefulness of the clubs as six of the 8 clubs are less than a year old. The early indications are that the clubs are useful. The police officers in all clubs are respected by the boys and a close relationship and trust between them has developed. A number of cases of indiscipline and potential delinquency involving the members were brought to the attention of the police and remedial action was taken promptly. Many parents have also on their own accord brought their sons to enrol in the clubs which demonstrates their confidence in the clubs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>KANDANG KERBAU HOSPITAL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Upgrading of services and facilities)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for Health what are the plans to upgrade the services and facilities of Kandang Kerbau Hospital for the convenience of both the public and the staff and is he aware that the condition of the consultation rooms of the specialists clinics is poor and that the current renovations of the hospital wards are disruptive to the services as well as inconvenient to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Upgrading of hospital services and facilities.</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever feasible continuous efforts are being made by my Ministry to improve the physical environment of all government hospitals and to upgrade their services and facilities. The Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH) is no exception. There are however many physical constraints to the extent these improvements can be successful given the existing conditions in the old buildings. Short of demolishing and rebuilding the whole hospital, we cannot expect to upgrade KKH to a standard of accommodation equivalent for instance to the new Singapore General Hospital (SGH). We may therefore have to live with what by modern yardsticks are considered out-of-date and inconvenient services and facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last 4 years, we spent a total of $1.1 million improving the facilities in KKH, particularly in the following areas:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) conversion of 4 open Class C wards into Class 62 wards which offer better privacy to the patients. This is in line with patients' rising expectations for better ward accommodation and privacy; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) extending patients' waiting areas in the specialist outpatient clinics to accommodate larger numbers of patients; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) upgrading the kitchen; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) providing aluminium sun screens for the ward blocks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, the hospital plans to improve the following facilities:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) rebuilding the Boiler House and replacing the old oil-fired boilers with more efficient gas-fired boilers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) upgrading the consultation rooms of the specialists' clinics; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) renovation to the nurseries for premature babies to relieve the present congestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also plans to convert 2 more Class C wards into Class A and B2 wards to meet increasing demand for better ward accommodation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Consultation Rooms of the Specialist Clinics</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 14 consultation rooms in KKH. In April this year the Honourable Member for Telok Blangah brought to my Ministry's attention the poor conditions in two of the consultation rooms (Rooms No. 57 and 58). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two airconditioned rooms on Level 1 of Block I are used by the University O &amp; G Department. Condensation and fungus growth on the ceilings of these rooms were caused by the sterilizers of the Labour Ward which were located immediately above these rooms in Level 2. PWD attempted to solve the problem by applying anti-fungus paint on the ceilings. But the problem recurs and presently repainting is done every other month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a long term solution, the University O &amp; G Department will create more consultation rooms for its staff. These will be ready soon and the staff presently occupying Rooms 57 and 58 will move to enable these 2 rooms to be renovated by PWD contractors who will instal suspended false ceilings and provide new furniture which will improve the conditions in these consultation rooms. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Renovation of Hospital Wards</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 3 ward blocks in KKH. Block 11 has 4 levels and houses 272 beds. Many of the pillars in Levels 1, 2 and 3 in Block 11 show signs of cracking. Early this year PWD engineers ascertained that some 52 pillars in all were defective. Though they did not pose structural risks or danger to patients and staff, nevertheless PWD decided that these defective pillars should be reinforced and strengthened with concrete. In the process the utility services had first to be diverted and then put back again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remedial works began in August and the contractors were given 15 months to complete the whole job. They have however to do their work level by level starting from the lowest. In the process the wards at each level must be closed down before work could begin. Inevitably these repairs caused much inconvenience to both the patients and the hospital staff. To minimise such inconvenience the hospital diverted as many patients as vacancies could permit in the 0 &amp; G units in Toa Payoh Hospital and Alexandra Hospital. The PWD has also been asked to urge the contractors to expedite their work. But in the interim the disruption and inconvenience to patients and hospital staff alike must be borne with equanimity and tolerance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB APARTMENT BLOCKS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Additional R.F. amplifiers and antennae for Channel 12)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he will request the Housing and Development Board to consider installing additional R.F. amplifiers and antennae in all existing HDB apartment blocks having common antenna systems to cater for the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation's new Channel 12 which is due to operate in February 1984; and (b) whether this facility will be incorporated in the common antenna systems in all HDB apartment blocks that are now under construction. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> (a) The HDB will embark on a programme to upgrade the common antenna systems of all existing HDB blocks for the reception of SBC's new Channel 12.

Based on recent trends in tenancy terminations, the estimated waiting period for rental flats is 2 years for 1-room flats and 4 1/2 years for 2-room flats. This means that existing 1-room applicants will get their flats by 1985 while 2-room applicants will get theirs by 1987 or 1988. The waiting period could be much longer if the rate of terminations decreases. Applicants on the rental waiting list, especially those applying for 2-room units, are urged to switch to the sales register where they can be sure of a flat within a reasonable waiting period. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The present estimated waiting period for new applicants of 3-, 4- and 5-room sale flats is 3 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BEDOK NORTH ESTATE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Neighbourhood Park)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Saidi Haji Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Encik Saidi Haji Shariff</b> asked the Minister for National Development what is the progress of the development of the open space in front of Blocks 551, 552 and 554 of Bedok North Estate into a neighbourhood park; what facilities will be available; when will the project be completed and what will be the cost involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> The open space in front of Blocks 551, 552 and 554 of Bedok North Estate has been developed into a neighbourhood park for residents of Neighbourhood 5.

To alleviate this problem, the People's Association and Residents' Committees have set up 60 recreational centres in community centres and HDB void decks. It is intended to open more such centres and to involve the inactive senior citizens themselves in the management of the centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, my Ministry introduced a \"Befrienders' Service\" in the Tiong Bahru constituency as a pilot project to cater to the needs of senior citizens who are single and living alone or are home-bound and unable to cope with the demands of living in the community.

Firstly, the number of buses during the short \"peak within the peak\" period in the mornings and evenings can be increased slightly. This can be done either by SBS putting more buses on the road or introducing more Scheme B services to help take some of the load off SBS during these peak hours. Secondly, we will also consider the use of more bus lanes to help speed up travel by bus and improve its regularity. Thirdly, for those who would like a higher level of comfort and convenience and are prepared to pay more, we are examining the possibility of encouraging taxi pools, to carry commuters to work and back on a fixed monthly contract basis. Our preliminary assessment indicates that both car owners and taxi-drivers might find this to be of mutual advantage. Such a service would be very much like that provided by the school mini-buses which provide door-to-door service for school children for a fixed monthly sum. The difference will be that the taxi provides an air-conditioned ride, with a shorter waiting period because it carries 4 passengers only. For the taxi driver there is the assurance of a basic monthly revenue from this fixed morning and evening service leaving him free to earn more during the rest of the day. The ROV can provide a central processing facility to match operators and commuters who are interested in joining the scheme. Details are now being worked out. This scheme can also be extended to air-conditioned mini-buses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the number of taxis will be increased gradually to match increasing demand. A Taxi Task Force has also been set up by my Ministry to carry out a thorough review to improve the taxi service. The recommendations can be expected early next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CAR POPULATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Measures to ensure manageable growth)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Acting Minister for Communications (a) whether, as a result of the recent increases in road taxes, ARF and PARF as well as petrol pump prices, car growth will become more manageable; (b) what other measures his Ministry intends to take to ensure that there will be manageable growth in the car population, bearing in mind that the private car today is more of a basic necessity than a luxury; (c) will he also not consider removing the ARF altogether and retaining only the PARF, i.e., a new car may only be registered in exchange for an old one; and (d) will he also consider allowing new increases in the number of cars to be balloted for and made non-transferable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> The measures taken have begun to produce results.

But we must be careful about solutions which will severely distort the economy and result in the inefficient use of our limited land. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term answer for us must lie in the more efficient means of transportation like buses and the MRT. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion to remove ARF altogether and make car buyers scrap an old car whenever they buy a new car is a very attractive idea superficially. It is very effective and will put an immediate lid on the car population. However, there are severe consequences. The immediate outcome would be that second-hand car prices will increase dramatically overnight. When this happens, the cost will be beyond those who may need to own a car in future. Such an approach gives a windfall gain to existing car owners at the expense of the rest of the population and penalises our younger workers and professionals. These are some of the considerations we have to bear in mind before we introduce new measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that we allow some increase in the car population through a ballot is not satisfactory. The ballot, which is really a lucky draw in disguise, will result in a windfall benefit for the lucky applicants and we will be swamped with tens of thousands of applicants. The allocation of cars in this manner would be unrelated to the optimum economic use of our roads. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NO REDUCTION OF BUS FARES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Reasons)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Liew Kok Pun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. \n  <b>Mr Liew Kok Pun</b> asked the Acting Minister for Communications why bus fares cannot be lowered even though (i) the price of diesel has dropped; (ii) manpower costs have also gone down because of the use of the more efficient OMO system; and (iii) the prices of vehicles and their accessories are lower owing to the strength of the Singapore dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> There has been no increase in bus fares for the past 2 1/2 years. However, over the same period the average wage in SBS has increased by about 32%. As wages account for half of SBS operating costs, the effect of higher wages is acutely felt in SBS. In 1982, even though there was a nett decrease of 806 in manpower, the wage cost went up by $13.4 m. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the price of diesel remained relatively stable for more than 2 years and has fallen slightly since the middle of this year. The strengthening of the Singapore dollar has also kept the price of spare-parts from rising with overseas inflation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, determined efforts by SBS to cut costs and improve productivity has led to more cost savings primarily through more extensive use of OMO services. 45% of SBS buses are now rostered on OMO services, up from 35% at the beginning of this year. Savings have also been achieved through computerisation and mechanisation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts have enabled the SBS to hold its fares for the past 2 1/2 years in spite of increased labour cost. By increasing its productivity further, SBS hopes that future fare increases can be kept to the minimum. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAXI SERVICE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Measures to improve)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Saidi Haji Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. \n  <b>Encik Saidi Haji Shariff</b> asked the Acting Minister for Communications if he will provide details of plans or measures that have been or will be carried out to further improve the taxi service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> The Taxi Task Force which was set up in my Ministry is now in the middle of a thorough and comprehensive review of the taxi service and will make its recommendations early next year. It has undertaken several surveys to find out in detail the demand and supply characteristics of travel by taxis, the driving pattern of taxi drivers and the opinion of the general public on the taxi service. This information will enable it to draw up a long term plan to improve the service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime we have taken steps to increase the supply of taxis next year. Two new taxi companies - SBS Taxi Pte Ltd and Singapore Commuter (Pte) Ltd - have been formed and will, between them, add about 500 new taxis on the roads. In addition the Singapore Airport Bus Service (Pte) Ltd (SABS) has plans to increase its fleet from 300 to 500 taxis. All these \"company\" taxis will operate in 2 shifts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi drivers will be better trained. The ROV has recently revised and improved its training course and extended it from 2 weeks to 2 months. It is also planning to introduce refresher training courses for existing taxi drivers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that we view the taxi service as an important and integral part of public transportation and will continually strive to improve its quality. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BUKIT MERAH INTERCHANGE/ANG MO KIO INTERCHANGE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Introduction of direct bus service)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Acting Minister for Communications what is the progress of the study made earlier this year into the possibility of introducing a direct bus service between the Bukit Merah Interchange and the Ang Mo Kio Interchange for the convenience of residents of Telok Blangah and the surrounding estates and when this service can be expected. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> I am glad to inform the Honourable Member for Telok Blangah that residents in Telok Blangah and the surrounding estates will get a direct bus service to Ang Mo Kio next month.

The MRT Corporation was officially inaugurated on 22 October 1983 to take over the functions of constructing and operating the MRT from the Provisional MRT Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All 7 tunnelling contracts for the Phase I system have been awarded at highly competitive prices. The remaining civil contracts for the 5 civil defence stations, the Bishan Depot and the elevated section will be awarded sometime next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local contractors have been active in the MRT project. Four of the 7 civil contracts awarded were given to joint ventures between local contractors and their foreign partners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the E &amp; M contracts are scheduled to be awarded during the first half of next year. Tenders for the rolling stock contract to supply our MRT trains are scheduled to be closed on January 9 and awarded by mid-April next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One main problem faced by the MRT Corporation is the lack of local expertise in tunnelling work and railway engineering. The Corporation is therefore recruiting the necessary experienced engineers and workers from Hong Kong and other countries. To increase the pool of local expertise, the Corporation requires all contractors to make a firm commitment in training of local personnel and transfer of technology. All contractors will be required to submit monthly statements listing their local staff and full details of the training received by them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soil investigations have revealed that difficult soil conditions will be encountered. The MRTC has therefore chosen contractors with direct relevant tunnelling experience. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resettlement and land acquisition have been progressing smoothly. No serious problems are expected. There are also no serious engineering, organisational or financial problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is anticipated that construction will create disturbances and disruptions to the public as traffic will have to be diverted and the noise level may increase. To alleviate such problems, contractors are required to plan their work carefully. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be close liaison with interested organisations and open communications with members of the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19831220/19831220-HA-0430295.htm\">REVISION OF HOSPITAL, OUTPATIENT AND DENTAL CHARGES, MAXIMUM FEES PAYABLE BY CLASS B2 AND C PATIENTS PER ADMISSION OR SPECIALIST OUTPATIENT ATTENDANCE (Cols. 295 - 304)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
