That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last week, as we debated Budget 2011 and in the various </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3845</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Committee of Supply discussions, the focus has been on productivity and building capability.&nbsp; As Minister Tharman has said, we are stepping up investments to transform Singapore into a high-capability economy and a global city that stands out for its liveability.&nbsp; So can Minister share how effective public agencies have been in achieving productivity gains?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 2010, in the Singapore Public Sector outcome review, the Government outlined six broad strategies to take Singapore forward and how public agencies can work together to achieve these goals.&nbsp; The report recognised the need for the whole-of-Government approach to tackle issues rather than having each agency deal with a specific area.&nbsp; While agencies are effective and efficient in each of the areas of responsibility and competency, there is an increasing need to work across agencies to address the complexity of situations and scenarios that face us at the national and at the citizen level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister share the progress that the Government has made to drive the whole-of-Government approach to achieve the strategic outcomes for effective citizen services and national issues?&nbsp; What measures have been put in place to ensure accountability across agencies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Budget debate, I had raised a question on our fiscal position given the several large projects in the pipeline: projects announced by the Government from our transport infrastructure, upgrading projects to rejuvenating our heartlands, our lifestyle projects and investments to further&nbsp;improve our health and educational systems to serve the need of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our expenditures have increased to 14.5% of GDP in the last five years.&nbsp; As</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3846</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minister had shared in the&nbsp;Budget Statement, our expenditures are expected to increase further to 16.5% of GDP over the next five years.&nbsp; These projects are large and complex requiring sizeable financial commitments over the next five years.&nbsp; Can Minister share&nbsp;the measures put in place to ensure strong management of these projects&nbsp;to achieve intended outcomes and meeting fiscal accountabilities?&nbsp; How will fiscal disciplines be maintained while allowing for flexibility in the approach?&nbsp; Many of these projects are&nbsp;multi-year and, as we all know, the requirements will change and will need to be incorporated while managed effectively to ensure that the intended outcomes are achieved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these projects will also require the whole-of-Government approach as they will involve multi-agencies to achieve the outcome.&nbsp; For example, the Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) projects will involve HDB, LTA, NParks, PUB, NEA, the Sports Council and even the Heritage Board, to name a few.&nbsp;

Prof. Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, it is widely known that our Civil Service is held in high regard by both the public as well as its counterparts in the region and other parts of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one feedback from the citizenry we hear from time to time has been on occasions, public funds have not been well accounted for in some of the Ministries with procedures that can be further improved.&nbsp; There were also occasions when Ministries have overspent their</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3847</p>\r\n\r\n<p>budget&nbsp;for projects, such as the recent Youth Olympic Games, and evidence of wastage has been detected during audit exercises.&nbsp; When such incidents are reported in the press, it affects public confidence in our processes.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, I would like to ask the Minister, what are the initiatives&nbsp;for instilling discipline within public agencies?&nbsp; What measures are taken when there are instances of over expenditure from the amount budgeted for?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another related issue is with regards to the management of mega projects.&nbsp; In recent years, I can see that public development projects are getting larger and more complex.&nbsp; These include the development of the new MRT lines which may need to go deeper underground and are more complex.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if there is a framework in place to ensure proper and prudent management of these mega projects.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can also share with the House examples of such measures.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Rightly so, because this would translate to greater opportunities to develop more industries on home ground which in turn promotes&nbsp;a flourishing business economy.&nbsp; In recent years, the Government has also been encouraging more people to take the journey to entrepreneurship by equipping them with the know-how and making loans more accessible to them.&nbsp; In running a business, the annual income tax payable</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3849</p>\r\n\r\n<p>is one item that must not be overlooked as it can&nbsp;add up to quite a significant figure.&nbsp; For Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) companies, profits are distributed among partners and tax based on each partner's personal income tax rates.&nbsp; The current income tax rate for top bracket income is 20%.&nbsp; A private limited company, on the other hand, is taxed at corporate tax rate which is currently capped at 17%.&nbsp; In addition, they enjoy various other tax exemptions where applicable.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that they invariably pay lower taxes than successful sole proprietors and limited liability partners.&nbsp; This may impose an undue burden on sole proprietors and limited liability companies which are receiving less Government support and yet are exposed to&nbsp;the same risks and turbulence of a market economy as any private limited company.&nbsp; Also, sole proprietorship and LLPs are less expensive to set up compared to a private limited company.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is precisely for this reason that some budding entrepreneurs are attracted to set up their companies under LLP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I urge the Minister to make the income tax system fairer and more equitable for sole proprietors and LLP companies.&nbsp; An example of how this could be done, perhaps, is to subject sole proprietors and LLP partners to be taxed not higher than the corporate tax rates.&nbsp; I hope Minister can give a favourable review on the tax system.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2010/2011 has also recognised Singapore as the third most competitive economy in the world, after Switzerland and Sweden, and Asia's most competitive economy&nbsp;with our strong institutional environment, market efficiencies and quality infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Switzerland's economy, which is ranked first, is characterised by an&nbsp;excellent capacity for innovation and very sophisticated business culture.&nbsp; It has high spending on R&amp;D and its scientific research institutions are among the world's best.&nbsp;

The notion of an EXIM Bank for cross-border financing was brought up&nbsp;by the Economic Strategies Committee&nbsp;and then again in Budget 2010.&nbsp; Since then, the business community, especially the SMEs, had been looking forward to good news on the setting up of such a specialised institution.&nbsp; The setting up of an EXIM Bank would be highly useful in serving the needs of SMEs intending to spread their wings into emerging markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the 2011 Budget Statement, SMEs cannot help but feel disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak on behalf of SME owners who expressed dismay upon learning that the Government has decided against setting up&nbsp;a dedicated trade finance institution.&nbsp;

I note that the Government plans to work with commercial players to set up this specialised institution for cross-border financing.&nbsp; This is likely to work at cross </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3852</p>\r\n\r\n<p>purposes.&nbsp; Existing specialist providers are driven by commercial considerations and are reluctant to provide financing for overseas projects bearing a higher element of risk.&nbsp; Currently, SMEs with the resolve and intention to embark on viable projects in emerging markets find themselves in a dilemma.&nbsp; They are strapped by the inability to secure financing from risk-averse commercial banks.&nbsp; Having no track record is viewed as a major constraint by the banks.&nbsp; Thus, the prospect of an independent EXIM Bank to support their overseas ventures seems to provide a glimmer of hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, let me cite the case of WEC Engineers &amp; Constructors Pte Ltd, which I brought up in the Budget debate last year.&nbsp; WEC&rsquo;s core business is in the aviation and jet fuel system.&nbsp; The company had applied for IE Singapore&rsquo;s Internationalisation Finance Scheme, where IE Singapore&rsquo;s portion of risk sharing is 70% while the participating financial institution's (PFI) portion is 30%.&nbsp; However, because WEC is an SME, the PFI demanded that the company should undertake additional co-sharing of default risks.&nbsp; Overseas ventures require a&nbsp;healthy cash flow, and this additional co-sharing ties up their liquidity funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEC also heeded the Government&rsquo;s call to develop overseas markets, and are currently bidding for&nbsp;two projects in Indo-China. Overseas projects are far larger in scope than those&nbsp;in Singapore&rsquo;s small domestic market, and thus, require additional financial assistance. This is extremely difficult to secure through commercially-driven financial institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Venturing overseas is not for the faint-hearted.&nbsp; Businessmen and entrepreneurs need to have big dreams.&nbsp; At the same time, substantial financial resources need to be invested before these dreams can be a reality.&nbsp; The ideal scenario would be to combine private enterprise with Government support.&nbsp; In this case, Government support</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3853</p>\r\n<p>in the form of an EXIM bank was considered essential and important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I raised this same concern during the Budget debate last year, and continued to ask for an update on the setting up of an EXIM bank in a subsequent Parliament session in May last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are experiencing increasing volatility in various regions today.&nbsp; As Minister had mentioned at the beginning of his Budget speech, the external condition has become more complex.&nbsp; Last year, the concerns were on the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. This year, the Middle East and North Africa are being affected by revolts and toppled regimes.&nbsp; This would definitely affect the cost of borrowing in private financial institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If SMEs were to rely on traditional banking channels, they are unlikely to make any headway in the current market.&nbsp; A full-fledged, dedicated EXIM bank to support cross-border financing would have addressed this need.&nbsp; This vehicle would then take a long-term view of overseas investments instead of shying away from financial support to fuel business expansion.&nbsp; We are concerned that further delays on setting up such a financial vehicle would become a precious opportunity cost for SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to discuss how an EXIM Bank could help to develop the maritime sector, which has been identified as one of Singapore&rsquo;s strategic business sectors.&nbsp; Based on industry feedback, shipping banks in Singapore are not as competitive as EXIM banks.&nbsp; They rarely lend to companies beyond a five-year tenure and often require vessels as mortgages and collateral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Export-Import institutions in China and South Korea are more willing to lend on commercial terms and provide liquidity to</p> \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3854</p>\r\n\r\n<p>shipowners.&nbsp; Even though there are certain strings attached to the loans, such as building the vessels at their yards, they can provide up to 70% financing. In fact, it was just reported on the 4th&nbsp;of March that the EXIM Bank of Korea, the state-run lender known as Kexim, will be boosting its 2011 fund-raising target by about 10%, to finance more shipbuilding orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banks in Singapore might be uncomfortable with taking up such exposures, especically for financing of rigs and FPSOs.&nbsp; Banks tend to shy away from financing due to the huge amount of money involved and the risk deemed involved with the oil businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If such an EXIM bank were to be set up in Singapore, it could be tied to activities like building rigs and FPSOs at yards in Singapore, which is a booming sector here.&nbsp; By doing so, we can not only develop Singapore as a ship financing centre, but truly become a one-stop International Maritime Centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the topic of financing for SMEs, I would also like to touch upon the Co-Investment Programme for SMEs.&nbsp; Under Phase&nbsp;One of this programme launched in December last year, the Government will provide up to $250 million in capital to grow local firms into globally competitive players.&nbsp; This would be matched by private equity fund managers.&nbsp; It is envisaged that about $200 million will go to promising SMEs with annual revenues of less than $100 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Co-Investment Programme will be administered by private equity fund managers.&nbsp; In order to ensure that promising SMEs benefit from this programme, I hope the Government would provide special consideration or added incentives to encourage these fund managers to assist new and innovative SMEs.&nbsp; These new and innovative SMEs are likely to venture into fast-growing new</p> \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3855</p>\r\n\r\n<p>industries or traditional industries with new growth potential.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, SMEs should find faster and easier access to capital, so that they could survive, thrive and contribute even more to our economy.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Members for their comments and suggestions. &nbsp;Given the time constraints, I shall highlight the key intent of the relevant policies and address specific comments whenever possible.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The questions that Members have raised centered on three areas which I shall address in turn.&nbsp; First, leading a high-performance and accountable Government.&nbsp; Secondly, fostering a favourable environment for business.&nbsp; Thirdly, building capabilities in the accountancy sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my Ministry will continue with our efforts to build a high-performance Government that is accountable to</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3859</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singaporeans.&nbsp; We adopt a three-pronged approach.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;we will&nbsp;promote whole-of-Government strategic outcomes, by addressing important challenges and opportunities that cut across agencies or Ministry boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will&nbsp;inculcate a mindset of&nbsp;fiscal prudence amongst all our agencies to various measures to promote value-for-money practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will&nbsp;build a collaborative Government in the delivering of e-services, so as to tap the potential technology to improve government service delivery with the&nbsp;Government working hand-in-hand with the private and people sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan asked about the progress&nbsp;the Government has made in driving strategic outcomes&nbsp;through the whole-of-Government approach. As policy issues become increasingly complex and cut across traditional&nbsp;Ministry boundaries, the need to augment the current approach to inter-agency&nbsp;collaboration has become even more&nbsp;pressing.&nbsp; Our public agencies have increasingly to work together as one networked&nbsp;Government to address strategic challenges.&nbsp; For the Ministry of Finance, this means that we have to access&nbsp;outcomes holistically from the whole-of-Government's perspective, and not&nbsp;compartmentalised by individual Ministries in order to allocate funds to achieve the best outcomes for Singapore.&nbsp; The Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR) which was published by the Ministry in December last year captures this intent.&nbsp; It takes stock of the collective efforts by the different Government Ministries acting together beyond the individual Ministry remit&nbsp;to address strategic challenges facing our nation and assess the progress that has been made thus far. This collective effort to monitor current and emerging policy issues guides our&nbsp;strategies and resource allocation for the future.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3860</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the inherent difficulty of coordinating efforts across agencies, the report shows that Singapore has done well overall.&nbsp; How do we assess this?&nbsp; We look at the outcomes.&nbsp; Our economy remains internationally competitive, more people are satisfied with the local living and working environment and Singaporeans are proud of our nation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now illustrate with three examples of what is meant by promoting whole-of-Government outcomes.&nbsp; The first example relates to public satisfaction with Singapore's living environment over the years.&nbsp; In 2003, 70% of the public was satisfied with Singapore's living, working and leisure environment.&nbsp; In 2009, this rose to more than 83%.&nbsp; This achievement was a result of collective efforts made by a number of our agencies to enhance the quality of life in Singapore in very much the same way that Ms Jessica Tan has described.&nbsp; Some of these initiatives include the renewal of our public and private housing estates, the development of surrounding recreational areas such as the Southern Ridges and the Changi Waterfront, the beautifying and landscaping of the waterways and reservoirs under the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters programme, and the promotion of arts and culture such as the building of the National Art Gallery.&nbsp; Singapore is now well regarded internationally as a more vibrant city to live, work and play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is an example of Ministries working to jointly address issues relating to youth offenders through the Central Youth Guidance Office (CYGO).&nbsp; The Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) are partners of the CYGO which was set up in June 2010 to maintain an overview of the entire spectrum of youth offending issues.&nbsp; The </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3861</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CYGO was also established to provide a platform where cross-cutting issues can be discussed, analysed and resolved in a more holistic fashion.&nbsp; Members can hear more about this under the MCYS' Committee of Supply (COS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third example has been well discussed but it is one which remains a challenge &ndash; that of sustaining our population in the face of our low fertility rate which has remained well below the 2.1 replacement rate in recent years.&nbsp; The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD), which was set up in the Prime Minister's office in January 2011, is to formulate and coordinate policies related to population and talent.&nbsp; Overseen by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng, the Division's responsibilities encompass policy areas previously under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, to ensure that these inter-related policies come under one centre of responsibility to enable policy responses to be addressed, again, more holistically.&nbsp; Sir, MOF will continue to push for better public sector performance through more coordinated efforts across agency boundaries so as to reach our collective goal of building a better Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to Assoc. Prof. Dr Muhammad&nbsp;Faishal's question on the efforts made by MOF to instil fiscal discipline in public agencies.&nbsp; Fiscal discipline and prudence are hallmarks of the Singapore Government.&nbsp; We have put in place a two-pronged approach to ensure that public servants utilise resources prudently.&nbsp; Allow me to explain how.&nbsp; First, is the block allocation of budgets within which agencies have autonomy.&nbsp; MOF uses the block budget framework to instil discipline in Ministries' approach to budgeting while also </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3862</p>\r\n\r\n<p>providing Ministries with flexibility in their allocation of their funds.&nbsp; Each Ministry's budget is allocated after a rigorous evaluation of the funding requirements by MOF.&nbsp; The budget is then allowed to grow annually at the rate pegged to GDP growth.&nbsp; Periodic reviews are carried out to ensure that the block budgets remain appropriate over time.&nbsp; Ministries take responsibility for optimising the budgets within the allocated amounts.&nbsp; The block budget system ensures that the Government remains lean and keeps a tight rein on expenditure within the overall GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a complement to funding allocations under the block budgeting framework, MOF uses their manpower management framework to allocate manpower resources prudently.&nbsp; Under this framework, public sector agencies have been allowed limited headcount growth to meet our growing challenges but at the rate no more than Singapore's resident labour force growth rate.&nbsp; This establishes discipline in the use of manpower resources and encourages productivity improvements across Government.&nbsp; At the same time, we also ensure that the framework is dynamic enough for the Government to respond to the changing environment effectively.&nbsp; For example, we have provided additional headcounts to MCYS for FY2009 to 2011 for new programmes, such as the Wellness Programme, as well as temporary increases to support the overseeing of the recently concluded Youth Olympic Games.&nbsp; In this way, we ensure that Government remains lean while remaining responsive to changes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second prong in our approach to ensuring fiscal discipline is to build a value-for-money mindset.&nbsp; The value-for-money (VFM) review office, under the Accountant General's department, takes the lead in this.&nbsp; The value-for-money office complements the block budget framework by conducting regular reviews</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3863</p>\r\n\r\n<p>of Government projects and processes to ensure accountability in spending, value for money and fiscal discipline within the public sector.&nbsp; For example, the VFM office found, in one of those reviews, that there was scope for better utilisation of common facilities, such as carparks and training facilities, by some agencies.&nbsp; MOF has since been working with the relevant agencies to promote higher utilisation of such common facilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cite another example, the VFM office noted that&nbsp;a significant number of statutory boards was producing hard-copy annual reports.&nbsp; Some had added costly design features, such as hard covers, art papers and embossing.&nbsp; Following the review, MOF issued a circular to remind agencies to produce their annual reports in a cost-effective manner.&nbsp; A basic template was also provided for reference.&nbsp; As a result, agencies have taken creative steps to cut costs for publishing annual reports.&nbsp; For instance, IE Singapore now publishes its annual report entirely online, saving 30% of its production cost.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Assoc. Prof. Dr Muhammad Faishal asked&nbsp;how&nbsp;we can prevent over expenditure on large-scale projects, as was the case for our hosting of the Youth Olympic Games (YOG), while Ms Jessica Tan has emphasised and asked how we are ensuring the strong management of large public projects.&nbsp; The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, had previously elaborated in this House on the cost escalation of the budget for the YOG, hence, I will not repeat his detailed explanation except to reiterate that this was the first of its kind.&nbsp; In fact, both the International Olympic Committee and ourselves started from scratch.&nbsp; It was a challenge to arrive at accurate estimates.&nbsp; In this case, the Government would have proceeded with the YOG even if the full cost had been known upfront as the benefits exceeded the costs.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we agree it is important for us to derive</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3864</p>\r\n\r\n<p>as accurate an estimate of the costs of major projects as possible.&nbsp; MOF will continue to improve our projections and processes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to inform Members that in June 2010, MOF introduced a new measure to further strengthen the financial management of large public sector development projects.&nbsp; Under the MOF gateway process, projects above $500 million are subject to stage approvals for concept, design and implementation.&nbsp; A new panel, the Development Projects Advisory Panel comprising members with extensive expertise and experience in project management and development, will examine the specifications and design of the projects at the early stage of project conceptualisation.&nbsp; This process optimises the project's design and provides the most up-to-date cost estimates at the point of project approval.&nbsp; These measures will help reduce the likelihood of downstream cost over-runs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, MOF has set up a new centre for public project management in January 2011 to provide advisory services on project design and management to public sector agencies.&nbsp; This centre will also help to enhance the coordination of the pipeline of public sector development projects.&nbsp; Through our many measures to ensure fiscal discipline and value for money in our public spending, we will continue to make sure that public expenditure is allocated and made wisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now go on to address MP Zaqy Mohamad's question on how we are building a collaborative Government that uses the Internet to share ideas, engage and work hand in hand with Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past three decades, Singapore's e-Government programmes have successfully leveraged advancements in technology to deliver convenient e-services for citizens and businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3865</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These efforts have not gone unnoticed.&nbsp; We are encouraged that today, Singapore is recognised as an e-Government leader internationally.&nbsp; Having said that, rapid technological advances have led to significant changes in our operating environment over the last few years.&nbsp; Singaporeans are becoming more Net-savvy and are increasingly making use of the Internet to interact with one another and to share our resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NCMP Ms Sylvia Lim, during the Budget debate, had asked about web accessibility for people with disabilities.&nbsp; Sir, we adopt an inclusive approach to our e-Government efforts.&nbsp; Our web standards have incorporated key aspects of the worldwide web consortium's web content accessibility guidelines, which is an internationally adopted standard developed for persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Some examples are the inclusion of captions for pre-recorded audio content and allowing users to resize text by up to 200% without assistive technology, and all Government corporate websites will need to comply with these requirements by June 2012, and all other Government websites and e-services by December 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is constantly tapping on new media to reach out to and connect with both citizens and businesses.&nbsp; This year, MOF worked with REACH to develop a Budget 2011 microsite to garner public feedback.&nbsp; Members of the public could follow and respond to real-time discussions posted on the website.&nbsp; Since it was started in December last year, we recorded more than 67,000 page views.&nbsp; Our MOF Facebook page also saw a three-fold spike in activity on Budget Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, looking ahead, citizens and businesses can expect to enjoy more</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3866</p>\r\n\r\n<p>convenient services and new platforms to collaborate with Government as part of the new e-Government masterplan which will be launched in June this year.&nbsp; Let me just preview two new initiatives.&nbsp; The first is the \"One Inbox\", an electronic mailbox where subscribers can receive electronic correspondences from participating Government agencies in place of hard copies.&nbsp; This not only helps to reduce the time taken to receive the letters but also it is especially useful for those who need to access the mail when travelling overseas.&nbsp; Singaporeans can look forward to having the \"One Inbox\" in 2012.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second half of this year, we will also launch a first-stop portal called \"data.gov.sg\".&nbsp; This initiative will facilitate the sharing of Government data with the public and to promote the co-creation of applications and services with individuals and companies by tapping on Government data.&nbsp; We are already seeing some of these co-creations happening today.&nbsp; For example, Quantum Inventions has developed a customised dynamic navigation system which pools together real-time traffic information from LTA and road users on current road conditions.&nbsp; Users can search, save and share routes and locations with friends over Facebook.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, within the Government, we have been leveraging technology to improve productivity and reap cost savings.&nbsp; To date, we have launched 31 integrated Government projects resulting in an estimated cost savings of some $140 million.&nbsp; On the issue of training and development, public officers involved in new media communications and engagement are sent for relevant training courses organised by both the Civil Service College and other private sector providers.&nbsp; These courses help officers better understand the new media landscape and leverage new media in the organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3867</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad has also raised a question on the SOEasy project.&nbsp; Sir, we are in the process of rolling out SOEasy to Government agencies progressively, and MOF and IDA are working with Government agencies to verify the ICT expenditure pre- and post- the SOEasy project.&nbsp; Besides cost savings, there are also intangible benefits, such as new collaborative tools like instant messaging for public officers across multiple agencies, smooth and swift delivery of new ICT services for all agencies as well as more regular and non-intrusive security updates for the entire public service.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of IT procurement, the key consideration for best sourcing is value-for-money and not cost alone.&nbsp; This is true for any other Government procurement.&nbsp; Public agencies must state the evaluation criteria upfront in the invitation to tender and quote which will include other considerations besides price, such as quality and innovation.&nbsp; Agencies will evaluate based on these criteria, and award the contract to the proposal that offers the best value-for-money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to add that there are ample opportunities for the SMEs to compete. When IDA announced that 350 IT projects worth $1 billion were lined up for FY2010, the majority of these projects were smaller scale initiatives worth less than $500,000 in value.&nbsp; These projects would provide opportunities for SMEs to participate in the tender process.&nbsp; SMEs can also come together as a consortium to bid for larger projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now turn to the issues raised by Members on how we can ensure that Singapore remains a good place to do business. Although we have done well in building a pro-business environment and have been ranked favourably by the World Bank's&nbsp;<I>Doing Business</I> report, our challenge is to maintain this well-earned track record into the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3868</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our key planks is building a competitive tax system.&nbsp; Er Lee Bee Wah has asked if we should review the income tax of sole proprietors and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) to be in line with companies. Sir, today, sole proprietorships or partnerships are not taxable entities.&nbsp; Instead, we levy personal income tax on the sole proprietor or the individual partners.&nbsp; This means the sole proprietor is subject to the progressive schedule of personal income tax rates, ranging from 0% to 20% and enjoys personal income tax relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;a sole proprietor or individual partner with $20,000 of taxable income, after deducting personal income tax relief, would not have to pay personal income tax,&nbsp;whereas a company with the same taxable income will have to pay corporate taxes of $1,275.&nbsp; Our tax treatment of sole proprietorships or partnerships is consistent with the practice in many other tax jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and United Kingdom.&nbsp; What the Member has suggested is effectively to align&nbsp;the top personal tax rate of 20% with the corporate tax rate of 17%. Sir, there is no pressing competitive need and, therefore, little policy reason to do so.&nbsp; Indeed, most countries do not align their personal and corporate income tax rates.&nbsp; More importantly, the decision to adjust the top personal income tax rate should be evaluated based on its merit rather than its relativity to the corporate income tax rates.&nbsp; Ultimately, the decision to organise a business as a sole proprietorship, partnership or company is a commercial one that needs to take into account various tax and non-tax factors.&nbsp; So, businesses will need to decide for themselves what legal form best suits their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would like to assure the Member and other Members that MOF takes a long-term view of the tax system. We look ahead to identify future trends,</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3869</p>\r\n\r\n<p>challenges and threats, and shape our tax system accordingly.&nbsp; Towards this end, we have developed a whole-of-Government tax masterplan which lays out strategic themes to better guide public agencies in formulating tax proposals.&nbsp; These long-term changes to our tax structure reinforce our need for a diversified, competitive and progressive fiscal system that will strengthen Singapore as both a business hub and an inclusive society.&nbsp; The changes could not have taken place over just one budget cycle, or even two or three.&nbsp; They require long-term planning and gradual implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now turn to Ms Jessica Tan's question on the measures put in place by the Ministry to support businesses given Government's focus on productivity.&nbsp; Government plays multiple roles in helping businesses become more productive.&nbsp; One such role is that of a policy-maker, putting in place right incentives, such as the Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme, to encourage businesses to take the transition to productivity-driven role.&nbsp; Equally important is our role as facilitator where we aim to ensure that Government's interface with businesses remains efficient and user-friendly, thereby helping our businesses become more productive themselves.&nbsp; We would do more to facilitate business processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just quickly run through two initiatives.&nbsp; The first is Singapore Customs' Trade Facilitation and Integrated Risk-based System (TradeFIRST).&nbsp; This system integrates trade facilitation, risk management and compliance elements into a single holistic platform.&nbsp; Instead of going through multiple assessments by different officers for different schemes, each company will have an appointed account manager responsible for conducting a single holistic assessment for that company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3870</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second example relates to the introduction of a simplified income tax Return Form C&nbsp;for small corporations with annual turnover of not more than $500,000.&nbsp; This is because smaller companies tend to have more straightforward business transactions and tax deductions and, therefore, the majority of the items in the current form do not apply to them.&nbsp; IRAS targets to implement this from Year of Assessment 2012.&nbsp; About 60% of the company base will benefit from this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now take a few minutes to explain how we are strengthening the market for cross-border finance and improving access to growth finance to develop globally competitive local enterprises.&nbsp; These are the areas that NMP Teo Siong Seng has touched upon.&nbsp; The Government shares Mr Teo's sentiments on the need to boost availability of cross-border financing and access to patient growth capital to further support the growth of a vibrant SME sector.&nbsp; In addressing the gaps in this area, Government has adopted a market-based approach to ensure that the solutions, firstly, complement existing private sector players and, secondly, are sustainable and subject to commercial discipline.&nbsp; We are also inclined to take a more measured and considered approach because we want our intervention to&nbsp;be efficient and customised to meet the unique needs of our corporates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, SMEs face hurdles for two main types of cross-border financing needs.&nbsp; First, there is inadequate access to trade and internationlisation finance, especially for emerging markets. Secondly, there is limited capacity in the market for long-tenure budget finance.&nbsp; Let me just touch briefly how we are&nbsp;addressing these structural constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we currently have several trade and internationalisation financing schemes&nbsp;with IE Singapore partnering private </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3871</p>\r\n\r\n<p>financial institutions to provide&nbsp;Government support.&nbsp; These schemes have catalysed export-related loans worth about $4.7 billion over the past five years and have benefited more than 2,200 SMEs.&nbsp; However, we recognise the current schemes are constrained by the relatively under-developed export credit insurance market and the reduced risk appetite of the financial institutions post the financial crisis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Risk-sharing is less effective in facilitating financing where existing market players lack capabilities to underwrite the risk.&nbsp; Also, our SMEs who typically have to internationalise at a relatively early stage as compared to&nbsp;their counterparts often do not have sufficiently diversified portfolios to obtain insurance or individual transactions.&nbsp; We have conducted a detailed feasibility study on the possibility of setting up a full-fledged institution to address the trade and internationalisation finance gaps in Singapore.&nbsp; However, we found that there are insufficient economies to do so.&nbsp; Such an institution will crowd out commercial financing institutions from a significant part of the market base that they are already serving. We are therefore inclined towards improving on the current scheme-based approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One possibility is an outsourced approach to target the delivery of the trade financing schemes to better meet the needs of SMEs.&nbsp; Under this model, we will engage private providers to administer a trade and internationalisation finance programme for the Government in return for a fee.&nbsp; These providers were the expertise in risk assessment and underwriting and can customise finance terms to match the risk profiles of transactions.&nbsp; The approach will be company-centric and it will be an improvement from the current approach of a fixed set of schemes and conditions for all firms.&nbsp; Companies will benefit from support that is better tailored to their </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3872</p>\r\n\r\n<p>financing needs and more responsive to market conditions.&nbsp; Under the outsourced approach, the Government will continue to provide support in the form of risk-sharing and premium subsidies which are also currently being provided under the internationalisation finance schemes and loan insurance schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would like to assure Mr Teo that there is scope for new products that may be relevant to SMEs but not available currently, such as single-name credit insurance and guarantees for overseas investments.&nbsp; We will provide an update of the study of the outsourced approach by the second half of this year.&nbsp; In the interim, companies can continue to tap on the existing trade financing schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to project financing which was also brought up by Mr Teo.&nbsp; As he has observed, locally-based banks shy away from cross-border financing, including ship financing due to their capital-intensive nature and the perceived high risk of the shipping industry.&nbsp; The Government recognises that shipping is a capital-intensive industry requiring financing support.&nbsp; And therefore, as part of Budget 2011, the maritime sector incentive wordings, companies will be exempted from paying withholding tax on the interest payments on loans that they take for the construction and purchase of ships.&nbsp; This will help reduce the cost of financing the ship construction and purchase of ships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is currently limited capacity for a large-ticket, long-tenure project finance especially in emerging markets.&nbsp; As mentioned by the Minister for Finance in the Budget speech, let me reiterate that Temasek Holdings is in discussion with potential partners on establishing a project finance institution that is financially and commercially viable and sustainable.&nbsp; This initiative will benefit many sectors that require project financing, including the maritime sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3873</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo has also touched on investment capital for SMEs.&nbsp; Raising capital by smaller companies is inherently challenging.&nbsp; Hence, in December last year, the Government launched the Core Investment Programme (CIP) with the aim to nurture globally competitive companies by catalysing the supply of patient growth capital to such companies.&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa has also raised a similar question during the Budget debate.&nbsp; Under Phase one of CIP, we expect about $200 million or about 40% of the total capital to be catalysed to be channelled to SMEs with annual revenues below $100 million.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I should add that it is not the intent of the Government to pick winners through the CIP by providing special consideration or added incentives for SMEs in certain industries.&nbsp; The selection of the investee companies will be left to the private fund managers to decide.&nbsp; But I foresee that innovative and growth-oriented enterprises across all sectors will naturally be investment targets under this programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang also suggested for part of it to be set aside to nurture and support young entrepreneurs, in particular, those with innovative and creative ideas.&nbsp; I would like to clarify that the CIP is primarily targeted to provide longer term equity capital for growth-staged companies that already have revenue streams and are&nbsp;poised for the next stage of growth.&nbsp; There are currently sufficient Government schemes that support entrepreneurship and early stage start-ups, such as SPRING's SEEDS scheme, where the Government co-invests with the private sector in high-growth start-ups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now address the cuts raised by MPs Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Dr Muhammad Faishal, Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Teo Ser Luck relating to the Government's</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3874</p>\r\n\r\n<p>efforts to develop&nbsp;capabilities in the accountancy sector.&nbsp; The Committee to&nbsp;Develop the Accountancy Sector (CDAS)&nbsp;was convened to review the accountancy sector and submitted its final report in April 2010.&nbsp; One of the key recommendations was the establishment of the Singapore Accountancy Council (SAC).&nbsp; This will&nbsp;be a high-level council tasked to develop and implement a holistic strategy to transform Singapore into a global accountancy hub.&nbsp; The SAC will coordinate and synergise the efforts of all stakeholders in the accountancy sector, including professional accountancy bodies such as the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS), the universities, polytechnics and private institutions, accounting services firms, businesses and accounting professionals.&nbsp; The SAC is expected to be established in early 2012 once the requisite legislation is in place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to this, we have established the protem SAC in September 2010 to set up the governing framework and implementation roadmap for the CDAS recommendations.&nbsp; Four sub-committees have&nbsp;been formed.&nbsp; These are namely, firstly, the Singapore Accountancy Qualification Programme;&nbsp;secondly, the Accountancy Services Research Centre and accountancy sector development fund; thirdly, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Institute and, fourthly, other sectors of excellence.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

A deep talent pool is critical to the development of Singapore into a leading global accountancy hub in Asia.&nbsp; Therefore, we need to develop the Singapore-branded, post-university professional accountancy programme.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new qualification programme (QP)&nbsp;will be an additional option for accountancy graduates.&nbsp; And the QP will be&nbsp;comparable to other internationally recognised programmes.&nbsp; More importantly, the QP will also provide a pathway for graduates from non-accountancy back</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3876</p>\r\n\r\n<p>grounds to enter the profession.&nbsp;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One weekend last year, two boy scouts from Raffles Institution came to my home to offer their services during the annual Job Week.&nbsp;While chatting, I found out that one of them had a doctor father and homemaker mother.&nbsp; The family lived in a house in Cairnhill.&nbsp; They were quite well to do.&nbsp; The other boy lived in a HDB flat in Jurong West.&nbsp; Both his parents work but he was not sure as what.&nbsp; They were not poor but clearly of more modest means.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without even asking, we know that both of the boys made it to RI on the basis of their outstanding PSLE performance.&nbsp; In many other countries, we would not have been able to make such an assumption because entry to so-called &ldquo;top&rdquo; schools is not always by merit.&nbsp; Instead, it would depend on the size of your father&rsquo;s wallet or scope of his influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most Singaporeans, I am very proud that our education system is like that.&nbsp; The message to students is that all you need to do is to work hard, because the system will let you go as far as you are capable of, regardless of your family background and circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this message continue to hold true today?&nbsp;&nbsp;To a large extent, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.&nbsp; Whether you live in a bungalow or rental flat, it is the same PSLE examinations that you have to clear, same &ldquo;O&rdquo; levels that you have to take to determine which Junior College or polytechnic you can be enrolled in, the same &ldquo;A&rdquo; levels that will decide how much choice you have for university and course selection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All teachers are NIE-trained and paid competitively.&nbsp; All schools enjoy substantial funding and good facilities.&nbsp; Furthermore, there are financial schemes to help students from poorer homes.&nbsp; Self-help groups run many programmes to give them a further leg up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3879</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our education system is as equitable as it gets.&nbsp; In that sense, it provides all Singaporeans equal opportunities to excel.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one would be so na&iuml;ve to think that students from higher-income families do not enjoy some advantages, such as access to enrichment and tuition, information and exposure. For primary school enrolment, the parents&rsquo; income levels have a greater influence.&nbsp; It is not uncommon to hear of successful Singaporeans moving, buying or renting a home to be near a primary school of choice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key question is whether these advantages are so significant that Singaporeans from poorer backgrounds cannot do better than those from richer backgrounds.&nbsp; In particular, does the parent&rsquo;s ability to get his child into a primary school give him or her an unfair advantage at the all-important PSLE examinations and thereafter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Britain, parents who are able to pay send their children to private schools like Eton and Westminster.&nbsp; Prime Minister David Cameron noted that Oxford and Cambridge Universities take in&nbsp;more students each year from just these two schools than from among the 80,000 pupils who are eligible for free school meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about Singapore?&nbsp; Do enough pupils&nbsp;who start at the bottom move&nbsp;up and out?&nbsp; I think this is a very important question for the MOE to address.&nbsp; Certainly, what would reassure Singaporeans is not one or two individuals who overcome the odds, but empirical evidence that good numbers of students from low-income households are making it to top secondary schools, making it to tertiary institutions and winning scholarships.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are also concerned about declining mobility.&nbsp; A recent article by Assistant Professor Irene Ng of the </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3880</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Univeristy of Singapore has suggested that our education system may be perpetuating social immobility.&nbsp; In other words, somehow because of design, we have made it more difficult today for students from poorer backgrounds to do better than those from richer backgrounds.&nbsp; I would like to know if this is&nbsp;true.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the MOE share any trend data and analyses that would shed light on this issue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One specific concern I have is the use of PSLE scores for secondary school posting.&nbsp; While it is fair and meritocratic, there are a number of undesirable consequences.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;it is a very high-stakes examination for 12-year-olds when, in fact, it should serve mainly as a milestone check on a child&rsquo;s progress in his education journey.&nbsp; Should we allow, for example, some shifting around after&nbsp;Secondary Two&nbsp;to give some allowance for late bloomers?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, there is certain value in putting students of comparable abilities together to facilitate teaching.&nbsp; But we have to be careful not to give young Singaporeans, especially the very bright ones, the idea that everyone else is like them in terms of intellectual abilities.&nbsp; For many people, lifelong friendships are formed in secondary schools.&nbsp; For this reason, I wonder if we should tolerate some &ldquo;untidiness&rdquo; in secondary school posting, perhaps a combination of PSLE scores and some other criteria&nbsp;to have more mixing of people of different abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the policy of Direct Schools Admissions (DSA) was introduced so that students with other gifts can gain admission to popular schools even if their PSLE results might not have allowed them to.&nbsp; However, I have the impression that many DSA places are taken up by&nbsp;Gifted Education Programme students or those who have taken the trouble to prepare for the&nbsp;many admission tests.&nbsp; It sounds to me </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3881</p>\r\n\r\n<p>like it is a&nbsp;pre-PSLE and it makes me wonder how could poorer students have the resources to keep up.&nbsp; Is it time for us to refine the DSA?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another concern is that of cost.&nbsp; How does MOE ensure that quality education, especially at the tertiary level, remains accessible and affordable to all Singaporeans regardless of financial background?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, what more can be done beyond financial assistance to boost the chances of students from low-income families?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One practical issue, for example, is how CCA schedules and remedial classes are organised.&nbsp; I discovered to my horror that having three children in primary school at the same time means three different sets of after-school timetables to deal with.&nbsp; Some of my homemaker friends say they are no different from taxi-drivers, ferrying kids around, including the fact that they also do not&nbsp;get CPF!&nbsp;&nbsp; Not many people can afford to have a stay-at-home spouse to handle non-standard transport arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other programmes which are very good but which could also impose burdens on lower-income families, for example,&nbsp;when schools arrange overseas trips to places like Europe.&nbsp; I feel that as a system, we should become more sensitised to the needs of lower-income families, and to be as inclusive as possible when giving opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education is the single most important means of providing social mobility in Singapore.&nbsp; It is core to our national value of meritocracy.&nbsp; So I hope to hear the MOE&rsquo;s views and commitment to strengthen all aspects of our system to promote and not erode social mobility.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t<p align=\"left\">Column: 3882</p>\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

At home, no lesser a person than the Minister Mentor had said that children whose parents are graduates perform better in school. Some primary schools are so popular that the applications far exceed the number of places available because parents believe that these schools would give their children a headstart in our education system.&nbsp; As priority is given to those whose siblings or parents are studying or have studied in the school, this means that the better educated, higher income parents &ndash; usually alumni of the popular schools &ndash; could more easily get places for their children. To increase their chances, such parents could buy houses around popular schools because of the&nbsp;1-km rule, thus pushing up prices and making them even more inaccessible to the low income.&nbsp; Many MPs have come across&nbsp;frantic parents who want us to appeal for a place in popular schools because they think that it makes a difference to their children.&nbsp; I know even of a professional who has decided to volunteer his services once his newborn turns two years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens then to children from low-income families with no connections and less resources?&nbsp; Will social mobility through education be a thing of the past?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3883</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will we see a greater stratification of our society?&nbsp; If this were to happen, will we have a permanent underclass with serious ramifications on our One People, One Singapore ideal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are important questions because social mobility through education has been the greatest leveller in our society. &nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, how does our education system ensure social mobility?&nbsp; Does the Ministry track social mobility?

We know that teachers are also stretched with the school's other academic and non-academic KPIs.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if there are plans to strengthen moral and values education in schools.&nbsp; Will there be more resources set aside to prepare students for their life</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3894</p>\r\n\r\n<p>journey and to be socially responsible citizens?&nbsp; How can schools better work with parents and the community, including the Police, on early intervention for potential at-risk students?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation is not getting any better now with more dual-income families.&nbsp; Many of the teenage students grow up as latch-key kids. Without close parental guidance, whether a kid stays on mainstream or becomes wayward depends very much on the company he or she mixes with.&nbsp; I believe the school and teachers can play a more pivotal role here to develop a&nbsp;stronger relationship with the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The community can also play a part and organise more activities to engage the youths so that their hyper energy can be channelled to healthier activities.&nbsp; For example just yesterday, I was with about 100&nbsp;youths from our neighbourhood schools at my constituency.&nbsp; We had what we called the&nbsp;Super Sunday event for the youths&nbsp;where they&nbsp;formed teams&nbsp;to do a Vertical Relay&nbsp;at one of the HDB flats. It was&nbsp;a 30-storey block of flats.&nbsp; In the process, the students appreciated that the staircase at our HDB flats could be used for other healthier&nbsp;activities rather than just congregating there to do some of those anti-social activities.&nbsp;Sir, I hope that MOE can do more in this area and work with the schools and the community, as well as&nbsp;with the Police.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Youth Sports and CCA</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;I would like to focus on a specific section of CCAs &ndash; sports.&nbsp; We should strongly encourage students to take up sports because it will assist immensely in developing tenacity and strength of character among youths.&nbsp; They learnt the meaning of perseverance and endurance, and develop a spirit of competitiveness and also humility and to lose with grace.&nbsp; These life skills&nbsp;will stay</p> \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3895</p>\r\n\r\n<p>with them long after any equation, formula or hypothesis.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Parliament, I have been appealing for MOE to encourage and put in resources for our children to have sports as CCA. I thought MOE has indeed made some changes and it is getting more students into sports&nbsp;on a larger scale.&nbsp; However recently, I was alarmed again when&nbsp;my daughter, who is now in&nbsp;Pre-University, was told that there&nbsp;was no recreation CCA for Tennis, and that only&nbsp;about 12 players were needed&nbsp;through selection for competitive team.&nbsp; Sports should be an integral part of school life.&nbsp; I would like to call for sports CCA to be made compulsory for all children from primary to tertiary levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister can share with the House, the number of school children who has sports CCA in primary school.&nbsp; What is being done to encourage participation in sports among students in schools?&nbsp; We often hear from schools that there are not enough teachers or sport facilities to cater to all who want to take up sports.&nbsp; Do we have enough resources to have every child take up sports as CCA?&nbsp; I firmly believe that a child who has taken up a sport&nbsp;CCA&nbsp;in his primary school, will continue with sports in the secondary school and then into adult life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, with youth crime on the rise, can the Minister look into the schedule of the school hours for the secondary school?&nbsp; Many parents are&nbsp;working when the children are in secondary school.&nbsp; As a result, teenage students&nbsp;are left at home in the afternoon without proper guidance.&nbsp; As all the secondary schools now operate single sessions, can the&nbsp;Minister look into the possibility of extending the school&nbsp;hours, incorporating&nbsp;CCAs, tuition or extra classes for the weaker students in the afternoon and let the children leave for home at about 5.00 pm on a daily basis?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Last year, MOE laid out plans to strengthen our students&rsquo; 21st century competencies.&nbsp; Can MOE provide an update on efforts to develop our students holistically, in particular, the emphasis on non-academic aspects of the curricula?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two suggestions for the MOE to consider for the future:&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recently published \"<I>Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going</I>\", journalists asked Minister Mentor about his \"carbon footprint\".&nbsp; I noted his simple, down-to-earth lifestyle.&nbsp; The jacket he wore, for instance, was nearly two decades old.&nbsp; Increasingly, our world will have to deal with the profligate ways in which we consume resources and the consequences of such behaviours.&nbsp; One \"competency\" we may need to cultivate is \"Awareness of Sustainable Living\".&nbsp; Cultivating this awareness early could help our students develop an affinity and edge in the many \"green\" jobs to be,</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3897</p>\r\n<p>created in the future, and to themselves live more sustainably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, last November and December&rsquo;s series of youth violence incidents had led to media editorials attributing teen violence to the prevalence of&nbsp;computer games, particularly those with many violent actions.&nbsp; There were also reports on youth gaming addiction, which analysts opined, affected youths&rsquo; mental development and interpersonal relations.&nbsp; Gaming addiction is just one example of the many socially-risky types of behaviour youths could develop.&nbsp; We cannot prevent them from trying out everything but perhaps we need to grow a \"Risk Management\" competency so that&nbsp;young Singaporeans can learn to spot risks in their lives and have the skills to manage them.&nbsp; Sir, I do not think that schools can teach everything nor can&nbsp;they replace the role of parents in character development, but I do think that we can equip our students with competencies to deal better with future uncertainties.&nbsp; Therefore, these suggestions need to be studied further.&nbsp; I hope the MOE will do so in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to teachers.&nbsp; MOE had announced plans to expand the teaching force.&nbsp;Given the stiff competition for talents in our tight labour market,&nbsp;how does MOE intend to do so while maintaining the quality of the teaching service?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, one important advantage for Singapore to retain for the future is our bilingual and bicultural edge.&nbsp; A thorough review of the teaching of mother tongue was recently concluded.&nbsp; One of the Mother Tongue Language Review Committee&rsquo;s recommendations identified the community as a key partner to promote learning and usage of Mother Tongue Language as a living language.&nbsp; Can MOE provide more details on how the $45 million would be made available for </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3898</p>\r\n<p>schools and the MTL Learning Promotion Committee to do so?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let the hearing-impaired and the&nbsp;visually impaired students of these two small special schools integrate, physically and socially, in a mainstream school setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would also urge MOE to continue to provide more structured support for&nbsp;services for special-needs students in post-secondary&nbsp;tertiary institutions like the ITE, polytechnics and universities.&nbsp; Sim Zi Ling, a top Raffles Institution alumnus who works with me, returned after obtaining her degree at UC Berkeley.&nbsp; Zi Ling shared how impressed she was by the college-based Disabled Students' Programme (DSP) at Berkeley.&nbsp; When students are determined to have disabilities impairing educational access, DSP specialists plan a programme of services with them, ranging from buddy note-takers, sign language interpreters, Braille textbooks and the like.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, I have heard&nbsp;of very good and kind teachers in ITE West who&nbsp;are very&nbsp;accommodating to special-needs students.&nbsp; However, in the micro level, support is neither consistent, systemic nor hard-coded for sustainability.&nbsp; MOE has done very well in support for special-needs students at primary and secondary schools.&nbsp; Why deprive the students when they move on to the tertiary level?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, doing more for lower-functioning students in special schools.&nbsp; Sir, I recall with mixed feelings when I attended the 2010 graduation ceremony of students&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Delta Senior School.&nbsp; Some 40 graduates, whose education was funded by MOE till age 21, received WSQ certification and found jobs.&nbsp; However, I notice at the sideline another batch of younger graduates who had to leave school younger&nbsp;at age 18 because they are slower,&nbsp;and&nbsp;do not qualify for WSQ certification. They have to exit school even if they are not ready into a bleak</p> \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3901</p>\r\n\r\n<p>future.&nbsp; Sir, I ask MOE to allow and fund even these lower-functioning students to continue schooling till age 21 so that the school has more time to prepare them for adulthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in my work with special-needs students of all abilities, I find a group of them, usually about 5%, with high needs, for example, behavioural challenges, and they require higher than normal teacher-student ratio.&nbsp; Some of them are cause for disruptions in classes and even lead to resignations of teachers and face a longer waitlist.&nbsp; Sir, I ask for more support for this small group of students so that they can continue to stay on in school and teacher turnover can be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, at the&nbsp;macro level, the Ministry has ably crafted the 21st Century Competencies Framework for students in the mainstream schools.&nbsp; But what are the 21st century skills and attributes required of teachers and leaders who will guide these students?&nbsp; What kind of changes does MOE need to make in future education workforce, taking into account the strong reliance on tuition to supplement its work; students who speak digital as their first language and the need to build more resilience in our young who are afflicted by an upward trend of mental health problems such as depression and eating disorders?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank the MOE for the great work done and I look forward to their help to plug these gaps that&nbsp;I have observed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Sir, let me&nbsp;thank the many MPs who have spoken passionately about education during the Budget debate and this COS.&nbsp; I have enjoyed all their accounts, whether it&nbsp;was Ms Irene Ng's students in Changkat or the various ceremonies that Members attended.&nbsp;&nbsp;These tell me that as&nbsp;leaders of&nbsp;society, our Members of&nbsp;Parliament are</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3902</p>\r\n\r\n<p>very concerned and watch education very carefully.&nbsp; We recognise this trust&nbsp;placed upon&nbsp;MOE.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many issues raised but there was one particular issue which I thought deserved a complete response, rather than just&nbsp;a tangential response.&nbsp; This is social mobility.&nbsp; Today, it was&nbsp;raised&nbsp;by Mrs Josephine Teo, Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Christopher de Souza and Ms Irene Ng, and&nbsp;others during the Budget debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social&nbsp;mobility&nbsp;stands at the heart of our education processes, and indeed, our whole-of-Government policies.&nbsp; My colleagues will deal with specific issues later but I would like to deal with this squarely.&nbsp; I think it is important enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1960 to 2010, Singapore's per capita nominal GDP rose 100-fold, from US$400 to more than US$40,000 today.&nbsp; Nice number to remember.&nbsp; This remarkable achievement has been variously depicted.&nbsp; Monikers abound, and Members would be familiar with them: \"sleepy fishing village to world-class hub\", \"colonial backwater to economic powerhouse\", \"Third World to First\", etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for me, \"The Singapore Story\" probably best captures this economic transformation.&nbsp; It was a massive rising tide that lifted all boats, with a reach that extended deep into the heartlands.&nbsp; Stagnant pools turned into thriving waterways as the tidal rise was sustained over 40-odd years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, social mobility occurred <I>en masse</I> &nbsp;&ndash; and this is important&nbsp;&ndash; both of Singapore compared to other countries and within the society.&nbsp; Both elements&nbsp;are important &ndash; of the entire country and the people within it.&nbsp; There were&nbsp;remarkable improvements in almost all conventional measures of living standards, indeed, we were&nbsp;physically transformed &ndash; not only</p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3903</p>\r\n\r\n <p>the city landscape but its people too, literally!&nbsp; What do I mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I witnessed this profound change, this phenomenon,&nbsp;on our people physically as a young doctor.&nbsp; Due to better nutrition, children grew taller and heavier.&nbsp; When we started out as medical students, we referred to&nbsp;height-weight charts and as we went to the wards, we realised they were no longer applicable because our children were already way off the charts.&nbsp; Height-weight charts&nbsp;based on&nbsp;older cohorts became obsolete and had to be revised and adjusted periodically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With widespread public sanitation and vaccination programmes, disease patterns changed.&nbsp; I started as a medical student seeing some infectious diseases which were typical of poorly developed countries but as I aged and progressed in my training, they changed to diabetes and heart diseases associated with affluent societies.&nbsp; Infant mortality rates, which represent&nbsp;a very useful indicator of general healthcare standards, dived to one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp; In short, more babies lived, grew taller and bigger; adults acquired affluent diseases born of richer lifestyles even as they lived longer &ndash; a profound change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rising home ownership, wealth across the belt of heartlanders increased.&nbsp; Families moved from <I>kampongs</I> and slums to HDB flats.&nbsp; Many MPs would be familiar&nbsp;&ndash; if we asked the 1- to 3-roomers when they bought the flats, they would say, \"in the 1960s, 1970s\", and at least in Queenstown and Toa Payoh: \"$6,200 for a flat\".&nbsp; Some of them cost a thousand dollars more if it was a corner unit.&nbsp; That was in the 1960s. &nbsp;By 1990, almost 90% of households owned their homes, which was a dramatic increase from 30% in 1970.&nbsp; Not only more owned homes but the homes were bigger.&nbsp; The percentage of households who&nbsp;lived in 1- to 3-room flats fell too &ndash; from 80% in 1970,&nbsp;it dropped to 25% in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3904</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rise in educational attainments was equally impressive. Steady jobs, better incomes, bigger homes provided a more conducive social environment for academic achievement all round.&nbsp; We will take just one metric&nbsp;&ndash; in 1980, only a quarter of those aged 25 to 39 years had completed secondary school or above.&nbsp; That is the chart* [<I>indicating&nbsp;a chart shown to Members</I> ].&nbsp; Members would see that&nbsp;three quarters had primary school education.&nbsp; In other words, a quarter had secondary school education or higher.&nbsp; This jumped four-fold to 96% in 2010: those who had secondary school education or above.&nbsp; What this means is that most Singaporeans born in the 1970s and 1980s would have attained educational qualifications of at least one if not two or more levels above those of their parents.&nbsp; It cannot be that they got smarter.&nbsp; Genetic changes take longer.&nbsp; It is just that they had more opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us aged 50 or older today, born before 1960, do not need these statistics to convince us about the Singapore Story.&nbsp; There are many MPs here, and I have heard the&nbsp;stories they have shared across the years.&nbsp; We experienced this rising tide first-hand.&nbsp; My parents had six children.&nbsp; My first home as a young boy was a rental flat in Zion Road.&nbsp; We shared it as tenants with other families.&nbsp; It never occurred to me that I was poor then, or that it was not the norm to share abodes.&nbsp; This rental flat overlooked the Alexandra Canal, which was a far cry from what it is today after MEWR&rsquo;s ABC Waters programme.&nbsp; But we had our own Version 1 of the ABC programme&nbsp;&ndash; Active but Be Careful because you could fall into the <I>longkang</I>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The canal flooded often, to the delight of kids living there.&nbsp; Every time it rained and got flooded, that was play time!&nbsp; I can still hear my mother&rsquo;s clarion warning to be careful lest we got swept away by the currents.&nbsp; She spoke in vernacular&nbsp;&ndash; \"<I>Ler&nbsp;um zai si</I>!\"</p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4041-4042.<BR></div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3905</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrading meant moving to a 3-room flat in Queenstown.&nbsp; This time we did not have to share and we could own it.&nbsp; But there were still hard times with bills unpaid and my mother had to do odd jobs, sewing and cooking at home to earn extra income.&nbsp; I am thankful that my parents believed in a good education for me and my siblings.&nbsp; That changed our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;am also grateful that I could become a doctor after studying at the National University of Singapore.&nbsp; I know it was heavily subsidised as my family could never have afforded the full costs.

These are important questions that need to be addressed for all Singaporeans about our future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n2.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure this House that enabling social mobility will continue to be a hallmark of our education system.&nbsp; MOE believes that education can and should uplift individuals and families. I agree with MPs too that in doing so, we cannot aim for equality of outcomes.&nbsp; That is not what we are asking for.&nbsp; Not equality of outcomes because students are inherently different.&nbsp; Neither can we stop parents who can afford it, from spending large sums on pre-school or private tuition for their children, as Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Joscelin Yeo pointed out.&nbsp; What we must ensure is that opportunities abound for all students and that no student is denied a high quality education because he or she cannot afford it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we achieve this?&nbsp; How do we ensure that no student is denied a high quality education because he or she cannot afford it?&nbsp; As always, through good schools that students can have access to, wherever they live.&nbsp; It does not matter if we have one or two brand name schools or many such schools.&nbsp; Sure, parents compete.&nbsp; It happens all over the world.&nbsp; What we must ensure is that we have good schools everywhere&nbsp;that students can have access to wherever they live.&nbsp; To&nbsp;achieve this, we must therefore resource all schools well, not just some.&nbsp; We must</p> \r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3907</p>\r\n \r\n <p>ensure that good teachers are spread out across the system, not only to the&nbsp;few top schools. We must ensure that all students have enrichment programmes or CCAs&nbsp;&ndash; which is what Ms Joscelin Yeo and Mdm Cynthia Phua were asking for&nbsp;&ndash; that can develop them to their full potential.&nbsp; This, indeed, is exactly what MOE has been doing, especially in the past two decades or so.&nbsp; Let me give you some specifics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we have increased our investments into education significantly over the years.&nbsp; I have distributed a chart* [<I>the handout was distributed to Members</I>]. Over the last decade, it has risen steadily, even during economic downturns.&nbsp; That is the first important point. Our budget this year is $10.9 billion, almost double from a decade ago and 10% more than last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, the increase in spending has benefited all students and not only a select few.&nbsp; We deliver a consistently high standard of education across all our schools, ITE, polytechnics and universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last 10 years, annual recurrent funding per student in primary schools saw the largest increase, more than double&nbsp;&mdash; up 110% to almost $7,000 in 2010.&nbsp; In the same period, funding for secondary schools and JCs grew almost 75%; ITE, 50%; polytechnics, 55%; universities, 35%.&nbsp; The bulk of the increase has been on general education in the primary, secondary and JC sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scale of increases in funding per student in primary and secondary schools has allowed us to increase significantly the number and quality of teachers, and to start more programmes to meet specific needs of children.&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua talked about special education,&nbsp;or whether it was for slower learners.&nbsp; It allowed us to customise, to differentiate and to meet different needs.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3908</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last decade, MOE invested some $25 billion to deliver a first-class, highly educated and well-trained teaching service.&nbsp; We spent five times more on teachers than we did on buildings.&nbsp; Twenty-five&nbsp;billion dollars&nbsp;for teachers and about $5 billion for upgrading the facilities of 125 primary schools and 75 secondary schools.&nbsp; This is as it should be because good teachers make the bigger difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give Members some numbers so they can have a feel of what the increased spending translated to.&nbsp; Compared to 10 years ago, each school today, not just some, has on average 30% to 50% more staff&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp; that means&nbsp;20 more new teachers on average and, in addition, new allied educators and support staff.&nbsp; As a result, the pupil-teacher ratio has improved from 26:1 to 19:1 &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; nearly a 30% improvement in our primary schools.&nbsp; For secondary schools and JCs, the increase is less&nbsp;&ndash; about 16%.&nbsp; The quality of our teachers is spread across the system.&nbsp; We deploy our teachers based on the level and subject they teach, and the needs of the school students &ndash; something which Ms Irene Ng brought up. Every school has its fair share of experienced and qualified teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost all primary schools have at least one in three teachers with more than 10 years of experience, and at least half of the teachers in each primary school are graduates.&nbsp; At the secondary level, every school has more than eight in 10 teachers who are graduates.&nbsp; We have teachers who are scholars or award holders in all our secondary schools and JCs.&nbsp; Take any school, there will be a teacher there who is a scholar or an award-holder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also expanded the range of programmes, in particular, those catering to slower learners.&nbsp; That has seen the largest ramp-up in the last decade.&nbsp; These include: the Learning Support Programmes for both English and Mathematics at</p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4043-4044.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3909</p>\r\n\r\n<P>primary schools; the&nbsp;Elective Modules&nbsp;for Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students; and the establishment of NorthLight School and the Assumption Pathway School to help students who fail PSLE and have difficulties handling the mainstream curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These investments have indeed translated to better educational outcomes.&nbsp; Today we have almost 100% participation rate of Singaporeans in our primary schools.&nbsp; Close to 99% of each cohort complete 10 years of primary and secondary&nbsp;education.&nbsp; This is one of the highest completion rates in the world&nbsp;&ndash; close to 99%.&nbsp; This builds a strong foundation for progression to our ITE, polytechnics and/or universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty percent&nbsp;more students are now progressing to our universities compared to a decade ago, 40% more to our polytechnics and 30% more to ITEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our education system creates opportunities for all our students. Regardless of which school they are in or what background they come from, our students are able to learn at their own pace, and develop in areas they are passionate about and can excel in, and achieve their maximum potential. Customisation and differentiation of educational pathways are key reasons for our robust and responsive education system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key question the MPs are asking is has it worked to ensure social mobility?&nbsp; Has it help lower-income students?&nbsp; Gratifyingly, our data affirm that the Singapore Story continues for this generation.&nbsp; Students of all socio-economic backgrounds have been able to achieve good outcomes.&nbsp; Let me provide specific information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a lot of talk about the PSLE so let me start there.&nbsp; If I take the</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3910</p>\r\n\r\n<p>top 5% of PSLE students and I ask, \"From what schools do they come?\"&nbsp; If someone says \"50% comes from the top 10&nbsp;schools\" or&nbsp;\"the top 80% comes from 20 schools\", it may not be so surprising; but&nbsp;the top 5% of PSLE students come from 95% of primary schools and across all socio-economic backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me flip this around.&nbsp; Every primary school&nbsp;&ndash; just name any primary school in Singapore in your neighbourhood&nbsp;&ndash; would have at least 10 students who had scored in the top one-third of the PSLE cohort.&nbsp; So, when Ms Irene Ng mentioned her story, I was not surprised.&nbsp; Members will be able to find the top students within the top one-third in any primary school.&nbsp; Not one or two.&nbsp; At least 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coupled with merit-based entry into secondary schools, it means that every student has a good chance of success regardless of which primary school they attend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look specifically at students who start from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the students who are in the bottom third by socio-economic status and we track them and we ask, \"how did they do at PSLE?\"&nbsp; Half of the students from the bottom one-third by socio-economic background&nbsp;score within the top two-thirds in the PSLE.&nbsp; One in six from this group scores within the top one-third.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can&nbsp;look at the trend curve as&nbsp;these figures are tracked over 10 years [<I>indicating to a chart* distributed to Members</I>].&nbsp; These figures have remained stable over the past decade even though the bottom one-third may be different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we look at those who lived in 1- to 3-room HDB flats at Primary 1, we find that one in five of these students score in the top-third in the PSLE and the same proportion, one in five, score within the top 30% of every \"O\"- and \"A\"-Level cohort.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if we track children who stay in&nbsp;1- to 3-room flats, about half&nbsp;eventually</p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4045-4046.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3911</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>progress to our universities and polytechnics.&nbsp; More importantly, these outcomes have remained unchanged since the 1980s &ndash;&nbsp; we have tracked it since the 1980s &ndash; even though&nbsp;the proportion&nbsp;that lived in 1- to 3-room flats has been coming down.&nbsp; This is as if we had a football league that&nbsp;has&nbsp;\"A\" Division, \"B\" Division and the \"C\" Division as the weakest.&nbsp; And the \"C\" Division has become smaller because \"A\" and \"B\" Divisions are more organised.&nbsp; Yet, players from \"C\" Division are still able to move up to \"A\" and \"B\" Divisions,&nbsp;even though the numbers in the \"C\" Division is coming down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1980s, almost 60% of our Primary 1 students lived in 1- to 3-room flats.&nbsp; This had fallen to 30% by 1995 and yet half of those children progressed to our polytechnics and universities. &nbsp;Those who lived in 1- to 3-room flats only made up 15% of the 2005 Primary 1 cohort who took their PSLE in 2010 and yet about half of those did well &ndash; as the numbers showed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International experts have also analysed our progress and given us a sound basis for comparisons with other countries.&nbsp; Most&nbsp;Members know we recently published our results in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).&nbsp; They&nbsp;conducted assessments for 65&nbsp;countries and they have a very interesting construct called the&nbsp;Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS) index.&nbsp; Basically, they took detailed information&nbsp;and constructed a socio-economic background of students across 65 countries in the world.&nbsp; Quite a massive task and very rigorous, so it provided a very good basis for comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, they showed that in most countries, there was a general positive relationship &ndash;&nbsp; the higher the ESCS, the higher the PISA scores.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what we are</p> \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3912</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>observing in Singapore is no different everywhere else.&nbsp; Members are quite right.&nbsp; Family background makes a difference and has&nbsp;impact all across the world in terms of academic scores attained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was something else that we were interested in.&nbsp; They found that in some education systems, among them Singapore, China, Korea and Finland, a larger proportion of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds performed better than predicted.&nbsp; OECD called them \"resilient students\", students who excelled despite having come from less favourable circumstances. We were ranked fifth out of 65 countries for the proportion of resilient students.&nbsp; Almost one in two of our students were resilient, compared to one in three in the OECD.&nbsp; The PISA average was one in four.&nbsp; Singapore was one in two.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These figures are not mere numbers but translate to hope for many students in real life here.&nbsp; Many Members know about NorthLight School.&nbsp; The first cohort&nbsp;graduated in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourteen percent&nbsp;did not stay on to complete their education.&nbsp; This is a remarkable achievement because before NorthLight, which took over Geylang Serai Vocational Training Centre&nbsp;&ndash; 60% dropped out.&nbsp; For the 86% who did graduate from NorthLight, a third (32%) of them&nbsp;had already exceeded both their parents in terms of educational qualifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-one percent&nbsp;passed all their modules and obtained an ITE skills certificate, and about a third (31%) went on to ITE.&nbsp; For this group of students who have failed their PSLE repeatedly, it is a remarkable achievement for their teachers and principal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What of the future?&nbsp; Can we ensure the Singapore Story for the next generation?&nbsp; Here, I want to caution what social mobility should not be about.&nbsp; It cannot be about neglecting those with </p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3913</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n <p>abilities just because they come from middle-income homes or are rich.</p>\r\n</span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It cannot mean holding back those who are able, so others&nbsp;can catch up.&nbsp; This would be detrimental to&nbsp;the whole society.&nbsp; I was quite happy,&nbsp;when&nbsp;PISA included Shanghai and they beat&nbsp;everybody.&nbsp; They set a new standard.&nbsp; More Chinese cities will be included and&nbsp;Members will be startled by how well the Chinese cities' students are performing.&nbsp; If we look only within ourselves and think&nbsp;that we have arrived,&nbsp;it will be detrimental&nbsp;to the whole society.&nbsp; We can and must provide opportunities to all and develop all students&nbsp;to their full potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, ensuring social mobility, as MPs have said, cannot mean equal outcomes&nbsp;because&nbsp;students are inherently different.

He or she decides if opportunities are to be squandered or seized. We need to complete the messaging because&nbsp;otherwise you make people believe that you did not succeed because you were born in the wrong house, that you were not given enough tuition, you went to the wrong school &ndash; how&nbsp;many of you really believe that?&nbsp; Honestly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are the one who can determine your own success.

They&nbsp;are impressive increases over a short time but&nbsp;MOE will still need more.&nbsp; We want to expand our teaching force to 33,000 by 2015 so that students and schools benefit from more customised learning. We are moving towards an all-graduate recruitment.&nbsp; We want to continue a high quality bar for recruitment, even though we want more.&nbsp; Yes, it would be a hard act but we will keep the standards there. We also want to promote a teacher-led culture of professional development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo and Ms Denise Phua asked how MOE is&nbsp;going to expand the teaching force while maintaining quality. That is an excellent question.&nbsp; Today,&nbsp;we have about 18,000 applicants for teachers but recruit only about 14%.&nbsp; We will continue to ensure stringent selection standards because we want teaching to be a career of choice.&nbsp; We&nbsp;envision teachers staying for many decades.&nbsp; I agree with MPs that an experienced&nbsp;teacher can help a lot of students.&nbsp; We want them to help many generations of children, if we can, for a few decades.&nbsp; But to get these passionate teachers, we must offer attractive prospects.&nbsp; Our professionals have evolved a TEACH framework for teachers &ndash; \"T\" is for&nbsp;Teacher professionalism, \"E\" for Engagement, \"A\" for Aspirations, \"C\" for Career and \"H\" for Harmony between work and life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But core to this is teacher professionalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be an ethos&nbsp;&ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3917</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and this will be a ground-up initiative&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;as what MPs have said, about teachers articulating their values and beliefs, something that Mr Liang Eng Hwa talked about &ndash; so that they can guide and inspire future generations of teachers.&nbsp; We have set up the Academy of Singapore Teachers&nbsp;to provide them the platform to share their expertise across Singapore.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;doing this&nbsp;not only just to benefit the teachers but because it benefits the students.&nbsp; Deep professional expertise can have profound leavening effects&nbsp;for the entire system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us know that \"Singapore&nbsp;Maths\" today is a brand name used by many countries&nbsp;that I travel to.&nbsp; They said, \"Singapore Maths is very good\".&nbsp; Many teachers were responsible for this.&nbsp; Dr Kho Teck Hong is one of them.&nbsp; He was&nbsp;the project director of the primary mathematics project team which was&nbsp;set up&nbsp;in the early&nbsp;1980s.&nbsp; The Committee&nbsp;was tasked to teach Maths better.&nbsp; It was his team&nbsp;that introduced the Model&nbsp;Method.&nbsp; I know that&nbsp;many older MPs do not understand what the Model Method is, cannot do the sums using&nbsp;a Model Method, but our children are very adept [<I>Laughter</I> ].&nbsp; It helped many cohorts of primary school children solve simple word problems, and understand algebraic ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp;seeding and leavening effect of deep&nbsp;profession expertise continues today. &nbsp;Let us take the example of Dr Elizabeth Pang.&nbsp; Dr Pang obtained a PhD in&nbsp;Educational Linguistics from Stanford.&nbsp; When she returned, she led a team of fellow curriculum specialists in developing STELLAR.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;Members&nbsp;are familiar with STELLAR programme &ndash; STELLAR stands for Strategies for English Language, Learning and Reading.&nbsp; It started as a pilot programme in 2006 and all primary schools have now adopted STELLAR.&nbsp; It has changed the way of students learn English.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Members go to </p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3918</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the English classes now, it is very different from the way&nbsp;Members and I were taught.&nbsp; They&nbsp;no longer do just textbooks,&nbsp;they do drama, music lessons, read to one another, use big books, move from stations to stations, interact, use audio-visual aids.&nbsp; It has raised the standards of English in&nbsp;our neighbourhood schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we have about 500 teachers who are pursuing their post-graduate studies, mostly through part-time studying.&nbsp; Another 200 non-graduate teachers obtained undergraduate degrees each year.&nbsp; I recognise that there&nbsp;are opportunity costs&nbsp;when&nbsp;they upgrade,&nbsp;so the new TEACH package will give teachers, pursuing part-time Master's degrees, the option to take up part-time teaching.&nbsp; In other words, teachers can do part-time teaching and part-time upgrading, and we will also introduce a cash award upon completion of their part-time Masters degree to recognise their efforts.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;MOE will offer more scholarships as well as new post-graduate awards for full-time post-graduate studies.&nbsp; Non-graduate teachers will also have a wider range of upgrading avenues.&nbsp; There will be full-time advanced diploma courses that will be developed by NIE and a new award for in-service teachers who pursue full-time undergraduate studies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to also&nbsp;provide more flexibility and additional resources to schools to allow teachers to go on for further studies and&nbsp;fulfil other social roles as parents or caregivers.&nbsp; Many of the MPs have spoken about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy percent of our teachers are female, with more than&nbsp;half of them married with young children or&nbsp;of child-bearing&nbsp;age.&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE&nbsp;wants to provide more flexible work arrangements to allow them to raise the family and do post-graduate studies&nbsp;so that it becomes a career of choice.&nbsp; When teachers can opt for part-time or no-pay leave instead of leaving the service,&nbsp;MOE </p>\r\n\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3919</p>\r\n\r\n<p>can keep more teachers.&nbsp; It is a long-term career option for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second prong:&nbsp;affordable education for&nbsp;all.&nbsp; Sir, we will increase the subsidies for students from lower and middle-income&nbsp;household substantially.&nbsp; Let me emphasise that these are not one-off&nbsp;measures &ndash; they are recurrent subsidies. &nbsp;This is in keeping&nbsp;with our pledge that no&nbsp;Singaporean&nbsp;should be denied an education because he or she cannot afford it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start with primary and secondary schools. They&nbsp;are already&nbsp;heavily&nbsp;subsidised but&nbsp;MOE will provide extra funding to help needy students.&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;already announced, on top of&nbsp;MOE's financial assistance schemes (FAS),&nbsp;there will be a one-off top-up between&nbsp;$10,000 and $15,000 to the school advisory committee and the school management committee's funds.&nbsp; They&nbsp;can target students who do&nbsp;not meet&nbsp;the&nbsp;FAS criteria&nbsp;for financial assistance.&nbsp; Earlier, I have announced a one-off top-up of&nbsp;$130 to Edusave accounts to primary and secondary students, and the one-off injection of $100 million to the Edusave grants for schools to purchase&nbsp;additional IT equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have two more funds that help some of the students that MPs have brought up.&nbsp; These&nbsp;are called the Opportunity Fund and Trips for International Experience Fund.&nbsp; Members&nbsp;must have met some of the students in&nbsp;neighbourhood schools, especially, who may not&nbsp;be able to afford it when the school wants to bring their&nbsp;students elsewhere.&nbsp; We&nbsp;do want&nbsp;some co-payment to&nbsp;exercise some discipline and make sure that it is worth it.&nbsp; Such needy students can receive further help through the Opportunity Fund and the Trips for International Experience Fund.&nbsp; As long as the school can justify that the&nbsp;overseas trip adds to the development&nbsp;of students, the&nbsp;funds can be&nbsp;used to help these&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3920</p>\r\n<p>students embark on overseas&nbsp;learning programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also substantially enhance existing bursaries to help more students from both lower and middle-income&nbsp;families cope with the cost of post-secondary education.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Minister&nbsp;for Finance has already announced&nbsp;the increase in&nbsp;bursaries&nbsp;for university and polytechnic students.&nbsp; Today, I am happy to announce that&nbsp;MOE&nbsp;will further expand the bursary&nbsp;support for ITE students [<I>chart</I> *].&nbsp; With these increases, students from the lowest&nbsp;15%&nbsp;percentile will receive $1,000 a year.&nbsp; The extra amount received will help&nbsp;these students with other costs related to the ITE education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*4047-4048.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of this change, we will now extend bursaries to include households up to the 66th percentile.&nbsp; Students from two-thirds of all households will now receive bursaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me summarise all that the Minister for Finance and myself now have announced in terms of the impact on the household.&nbsp; Bursary support will now be extended to all students in our post-secondary education institutions who are in the bottom two-thirds of households by per capita household income.&nbsp; Bursary quanta have also been increased.&nbsp; If you are a student from the bottom one-third of households, this means that those in ITE will have their education costs entirely covered while those enrolled in polytechnic and undergraduate courses will have their education cost covered by as much as 97% and 85% respectively. Polytechnic students from the lowest one-third, 97% of costs; universities, 85% of costs.&nbsp; All in all, the enhanced bursary scheme will benefit students from both local and middle-income households.&nbsp; It will cost MOE up to an extra $134 million per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extension in the capabilities of our teachers will allow us to expand the</p> \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4047-4048.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3921\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>offerings within our educational landscape, to offer a more holistic education and create new pathways to cater to varying aspirations and abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs asked for this.

We have revamped&nbsp;ITE.&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE College East has been operational since 2005;&nbsp;ITE West since last year and ITE College Central will be ready in 2013.&nbsp; We are expanding the polytechnics as well as university places.&nbsp; Polytechnic intake will increase by another 20%.&nbsp; The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) will increase its intake to 1,000 students and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) will open in 2012 which will make sure we reach our cohort participation rate of 30% by 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Government's overall effort in&nbsp;upgrading our workers, MOE will step up the role of our post-secondary education institutions in delivering continued education.&nbsp; We will tap on our polytechnics and ITE.&nbsp; We will grow the current CET training capacity by 60%.&nbsp; This is for adults.&nbsp; We will raise more spaces, funding and subsidies for advanced diplomas and specialist </p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4049-4050.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3923</p>\r\n<p>diplomas from 70% to 85% which will bring fees down significantly.&nbsp; MOE will also increase fee subsidies for part-time undergraduate programmes at UNiSIM and public universities to 55% of published fees.&nbsp; Senior Minister of State Iswaran will provide further details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been calls to do more for preschools.

MOE has invested $150 million in the preschool sector over the last five years and we have seen good results.&nbsp; We plan to invest another $290 million over the next five years, about double of what we have&nbsp;invested in the last five years, so that this can continue to uplift the quality of the preschool sector.&nbsp; Minister of State Masagos will provide these details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua asked that we do more for special needs students.&nbsp; As announced, MOE in partnership with NCSS, will introduce a special education financial assistance scheme.&nbsp; The financial assistance scheme was only for mainstream schools but now we are extending it to the special education (SPED) schools. We will work out the details later but it will be&nbsp;a form which subsidises school fees, uniforms, textbooks and examination fees.&nbsp; Obviously, it may not be completely comparable because some of the expenses in SPED schools are different but we will work out an equitable model.&nbsp; Basically, we are extending the&nbsp;coverage to SPED schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also provide more customised support for students with higher needs in the SPED schools. I am pleased to announce that MOE will work with NCSS to increase the resources &ndash; called a High Needs Grant &ndash; from April this year. &nbsp;We recognise that some schools are dealing with children with, say, multiple disabilities and they really need a lot of effort.&nbsp; We recognise that not all SPED schools are the same.&nbsp; Up to $2.3 million per year will be set aside for schools to hire additional teacher aides to support </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3924</p>\r\n<p>this group of students.&nbsp; Senior Minister of State Grace Fu will give you the details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo asked about mother tongue language (MTL) and how we are going to spend the $45 million in&nbsp;the community.&nbsp; Around $29 million will&nbsp;be disbursed through our schools to support the programmes.&nbsp; I think that is a better way to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We go through the schools so that they can engage the community groups.&nbsp; If it is the other way round, there will not be&nbsp;ownership of the programmes.&nbsp; They can do, for example, the MTL Fortnights.&nbsp; On top of this, a combined total of $16.6 million will directly support each of the promotion committees.&nbsp; This represents a 20% increase in funding available for each of these committees.&nbsp; Again, Senior Minister of State Grace&nbsp;Fu will provide details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, the array of efforts aims to improve the entire educational landscape.&nbsp; We are doing more for students in lower-income households but our strategy to uplift Singapore through education must be focused on providing opportunities to all Singaporeans of diverse needs, talents and abilities.&nbsp; We are realistic that the extent of social mobility&nbsp;experienced in the past cannot be repeated in the future.&nbsp; It is just not possible.&nbsp; We started from such a low base and now Singapore has the highest per capita GDP in Asia today.&nbsp; I have always been used to the figure in the news that we were second in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I have good news for all Members.&nbsp; We surpassed Japan last year to take top spot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be sad if increasing affluence results in smaller dreams for Singapore and Singaporeans.&nbsp; We must not lose the vibrancy and resolve of our founding generations.&nbsp; We must and can aim higher for everyone.&nbsp; In doing so, we must provide more resources to the poor to ensure that that no one is denied access to education because of financial</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3925</p>\r\n\r\n<p>difficulties.&nbsp; Each child should have the opportunity to be the best&nbsp;that he or she can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will we succeed?&nbsp; I am optimistic because the Singapore Story continues to surface today across our island.&nbsp; I will give one example&nbsp;&ndash; Mr Hong Siang Huat.&nbsp; Siang Huat is doing relief teaching in Raffles Institution (RI) after completing his National Service (NS).&nbsp; He comes from a single-parent family and his mother used to be a factory worker.&nbsp; He did very well in his PSLE.&nbsp; At first, he was not sure whether his mother could afford the fees at RI.&nbsp; But RI offered him a scholarship.&nbsp; During the six years in RI and then Raffles Junior College (RJC), he did well academically and he was vice-captain of the RI hockey team.&nbsp; I am using him as an example because later this year, Siang Huat will leave for Warwick University on an MOE teaching scholarship to&nbsp;study psychology.&nbsp; If all goes well, he will be in our classrooms teaching the next generations of Singaporeans as a living example of social mobility and a firm believer in helping&nbsp;students live out&nbsp;their dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this new decade, we will continue to ensure that Singapore Education remains at the forefront of excellence so that our children are prepared for the challenges in the next decade.&nbsp; More importantly, we will continue to ensure that education is the best way to level up all Singaporeans.

The last report was published in January this year. The key of this Mother Tongue Review was to enable students to apply what they have learnt in classroom in daily lives. Proficiency descriptors are used as benchmarks for Mother Tongue education. The descriptors emphasise the use of communication as a tool to improve the ability to interact between students and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4057-4058.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3927</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Director-General of Education, Ms Ho Peng, admitted that two rounds of review in six years was not a small challenge for teachers.&nbsp; People are most concerned with the following:&nbsp; Do current mother tongue teachers have enough training in their teaching of interactive communication and oral dialogues?

This is to show respect to Mr Hu and to demonstrate that they are studying Chinese culture and language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3928</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their enthusiasm in studying Chinese is worth our attention.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rise of China has provided them business opportunities.&nbsp; Therefore, they are studying Chinese very hard, hoping to get into contact with the Chinese directly and do business with them. In Singapore, we have made good progress in our bilingual education in the past decades. However, if we do not keep up with our good work, the Americans will catch up and speak better Chinese than we do. We will then lose our bilingual advantage. I urge all Chinese students to study their Mother Tongue&nbsp;&ndash; Chinese&nbsp;&ndash; very diligently. To learn Chinese, you must read more, see more, write more and use more. Only when you do all these four aspects of learning can you truly master the language and be able to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See more and read more: We should read more Chinese newspapers and writings. Students who study Higher Chinese should read <I>Zaobao's</I> editorial every day. The daily editorial comments on important events and is written with good skills. We should read it several times and read it out loud as well.&nbsp; Only by doing this can you learn both the shape and pronunciation of the characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write more. Writing more essays will improve thinking ability. Chen Zhixiang from Lihua Secondary School, the top student in the recent \"A\" level examinations, said that he beat others because he got A1 for his Higher Chinese. He is especially thankful for his teacher for forcing him to write Chinese essays, enabling him to achieve such great result.&nbsp; Lihua is also my alma mater.&nbsp; I am very proud that Chen Zhixiang became the top student in Singapore in the \"A\" level examinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use more. &nbsp;Parents should speak Chinese more with their children at home.

All those who spoke in Mandarin in the competition were foreigners and the winner was a girl from Russia. If I closed my eyes and listened to her, I would have thought that she was from Beijing. She spoke Mandarin so well that she put me to shame.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, when I was in China for a business trip, I kept hearing foreigners speaking Mandarin, and more of them are getting better and better at Mandarin. Although their pronunciation may be a little odd, their intonation is not bad. The Chinese understand them and have a great deal of respect for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, I went to the National University of Singapore to attend a Chinese Song Writing Competition for students. The standard of the competition was very high. However, at the prize presentation ceremony, I found out that all the prize winners&nbsp;were either Malaysians or mainland Chinese, and very few are Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like Mr Ang Mong Seng, I am very worried that we will lose our bilingual competitive edge. We must have a group of truly bicultural elites, and this elite group's bicultural standard must be comparable to the best in China. I am aware that with the rise of China, there </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3930</p>\r\n\r\n<p>will be greater interest in learning Chinese among Singaporeans. I have no doubt that under the tremendous efforts of the Ministry of Education, the average standard of Chinese here will improve gradually. I am not talking about the average standard, but the highest standard.&nbsp; Do we have high peaks, so that we can have a group of&nbsp; elites who are genuinely bicultural, able to communicate with the best in China at the same level?<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I propose that the Ministry of Education consider implementing a Special Chinese Elite programme. If necessary, establish a Special Chinese Language Centre and peg the standard to the highest level.&nbsp; When our Singaporean students graduate from the centre, their standard will be comparable to that of Peking University and Qinghua University students. I am specifically referring to students who are Singapore citizens. Malaysian-born or China-born students can also be included, so long as they are Singapore citizens. Their presence can be an inspiration to other Singapore students.&nbsp; Hence, everyone will improve in the face of competition, reaching the highest peak.</p>\r\n</P></span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Under the old population policy, \"Stop at Two\", between 1966 and 1983, priority for Primary&nbsp;1 registration was given to&nbsp;children of parents who were sterilised after the first or second child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1984 to 1986, children of university-educated women who had three or more children received priority.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1987 and 1999, under a new&nbsp;policy, \"Have Three Or More Children If You Can Afford It\", priority in primary school registration was extended to the third child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, I note MOE's response to a parliamentary&nbsp;question in 2008 to delink Primary 1 registration from population </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3932</p>\r\n<p>policies since 1992.&nbsp; However, there are good reasons to review this after almost 20 years given that parents naturally and should be interested in their children's education after giving birth to them.&nbsp; As the&nbsp;Minister mentioned, education brings about social mobility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition for places in certain primary schools is fierce.&nbsp; We all know of parents who move within one or two kilometres of desired schools or serve as school or grassroots volunteers to get priority.&nbsp; May I suggest then, to encourage procreation, that we consider giving more chances, not priority but&nbsp;chances, more chances&nbsp;to a child with more siblings?&nbsp; Of course, the child must be&nbsp;a Singapore citizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, should the number of applications exceed the number of vacancies in any phase, places will be balloted according to the proximity of the child's home to the school.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that, in addition to this criterion, for each phase, except for phase 1 where a child with a sibling in the school will automatically get priority, a child be given chances based on the number of siblings he or she has.&nbsp; The more siblings, the&nbsp;more chances.&nbsp; May I emphasise not higher&nbsp;priority but more chances.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in support of intact and healthy families, the child and his or her&nbsp;siblings must have the same parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Primary 1 registration takes place when a child is six years old, this will also encourage parents to have more children in quick succession in order to avail the child of more chances to enter a school of choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; With this in mind, perhaps such a change should also be effected giving six years' advance notice.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study which the Minister referred to earlier, Singapore was ranked well in Reading, Mathematics and Science.&nbsp; Sir, let me say that I am very proud of the many achievements of our education system.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, despite&nbsp;this excellent education system, I receive frequent feedback from parents that our students in primary schools are simply working too hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents question whether it is necessary for the primary school curriculum to cover so many topics; whether it was wise for children at that young and tender age to be drilled in so many subjects day in and day out. &nbsp;As a parent of&nbsp;two primary school children, I can testify that some of the topics that my children are learning in school surprised me. Recently, there was a hue and cry about some primary schools conducting near \"compulsory\" supplementary lessons for lower primary school after school hours.&nbsp; Parents asked whether we are stripping away the joy of learning from young primary school children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3934</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst MOE may impose guidelines for formal school hours, what about the homework given out by the schools which take up the child's leisure hours?&nbsp; By giving young school children homework everyday, are we really preparing them for life? &nbsp;Where is the joy of learning by playing?&nbsp; Do children have time to develop other interests outside the school curriculum?&nbsp; Is there time for parents to bring their children out to the park for a walk, for a game of soccer, for young children to learn to clean the dishes at home?&nbsp; Or is it the intent of the school to keep the students busy with homework or preparing for tests the next day such that they have no other time to relax or learn life skills elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether MOE reviews the curriculum of each subject in primary school on a regular basis; whether it is necessary to cover such a wide range of topics bearing in mind the \"Teach Less Learn More\" policy?&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister explain the reasons why schools feel the need to teach school subjects outside school hours instead of concentrating on character development of the child like learning to say \"thank you\" after receiving an award?&nbsp; Could the schools teach more life skills to equip the young children on how to cope with life?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B> I would like to join Mr Lim Biow Chuan in asking should after-class hours be kept free of classes.&nbsp; This was a hotly debated&nbsp;and emotive issue recently.&nbsp; The vast majority of parents accept that the extra lessons organised after school and during school holidays to prepare Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils for the PSLE would be beneficial.&nbsp; However, parents just cannot agree on whether schools should give compulsory lessons after school for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students.&nbsp; Many parents consider as \"compulsory\" any extra lessons that cover an integral part of the syllabus even though these may be </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3935</p>\r\n\r\n<P>labelled as \"optional\".&nbsp; Letting their child miss learning any part of the syllabus cannot be an option.&nbsp; On the one hand, there are parents who are grateful for the additional after-hours teaching and, on the other hand, there are those who strongly feel that their children should make better use of their time.&nbsp; I strongly urge schools to conduct extra lessons for only supplemental or remedial purposes for levels not preparing for major national examinations.&nbsp; This will be boon to students who require the extra attention as well as those whose parents do not have the time or means to send them for private tuition.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, on the topic of school holiday homework. &nbsp;Some, such as writing essays and reading specific materials, can be done within a few hours at home, while others like group projects require an enormous amount of time, research, travel and coordination.&nbsp; Most students and parents would recognise that the March and September breaks are short breathers which give students a break from travelling to school for more formal lessons, allowing them some space to do as they wish.&nbsp; However, the long semestral holidays in June or December should be regarded as much deserved breaks after a demanding half year that culminates in gruelling examinations.&nbsp; For this reason, students and parents &ndash; parents who also need a break from checking on their child's schoolwork &ndash; are understandably resistant to holiday homework for the semestral vacations except, perhaps, for when a national examination looms ahead.&nbsp; Hence, I hope that schools can be more sympathetic and judicious in handing out holiday homework for the mid-year and year-end school holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By organising extra after-hours classes and giving holiday homework, I am sure that schools have the sincerest intentions to produce good results, give students the best future they deserve and assure </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3936</p>\r\n\r\n<p>concerned parents.&nbsp; However, bearing in mind the goal of our school system to provide a holistic education, we must give our students leeway to enjoy their own space and have some say in how they would like to use that space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you confine students for long hours in school engaging in similar types of activities like curriculum Mathematics or Science, we will create products who are academically sound, each one able to answer almost every conceivable examination question.&nbsp; If we set them standard tasks and assignments that give them no other space to be unique, they will indeed produce the reports and make the requisite presentations.&nbsp; The skills developed are valuable but the room to explore and do something different becomes more crowded.&nbsp; We certainly do not want students to be as alike as the uniforms they wear.&nbsp; If we allow students some time on their hands, they can use that time for activities of their own choice, whether in school at CCAs or out of school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need people of different talents, different ideas, different inspirations and different expertise to make up our society and our children need the space to become these people.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan (Nominated Member):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;to facilitate a healthy work-family life balance for staff and students, will the MOE consider specifying school operating hours? &nbsp;Based on anecdotal evidence and informal observations, schools tend to stretch for almost 12 hours each day. &nbsp;Typically, a secondary school student reports to school at 7.10 am-7.15am, and usually for about&nbsp;two to four&nbsp;days a week, depending on the CCAs he or she&nbsp;is involved in, the child will only leave school at about&nbsp;6.30 pm or maybe even </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3937</p>\r\n\r\n<p>later, especially they if are in performing arts or when preparing for competitions.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think CCAs are the main culprit as schools are caught up with the numerous competitions that, if done well, can add value to the credentials of the school. &nbsp;I am certainly not against encouraging students to strive for the best in both academia and CCAs.&nbsp; But I do think that as responsible society, we should set some parameters for healthy competition. &nbsp;I think it is reasonable to expect the MOE to mandate schools to stop CCAs by 6.00 pm.&nbsp; This will ensure that even on CCA days, students and staff can go home in time for dinner with the family.&nbsp; They will have time to complete preparation and homework, reflect on lessons learnt that day and recharge for the next day, and perhaps with a healthy work-life balance, the Minister would be able to reduce the singlehood rate among his staff as well.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien):</B> Sir,&nbsp;let&nbsp;me address specific issues raised by Members and elaborate on two key areas. First, our efforts to create a student-centric learning environment and,&nbsp;second, providing more support for students with special needs.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, student-centric education.&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo and Mdm Halimah Yacob asked for an update on the Primary Education Review and Implementation Committee's (PERI) recommendations.&nbsp; We are upgrading 40 more primary schools in Phase 3.&nbsp; This will facilitate primary schools to transit to single session and allow strengthening of non-academic aspects of education like PE, Art and Music.&nbsp; These upgraded schools will have newer and better facilities to support more innovative and engaging lessons.&nbsp; Allow me to cite a few examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first slide [<I>indicating a slide shown to hon. Members</I>] shows a PE lesson at </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3938</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hougang Primary School.&nbsp; To support a more holistic education, indoor sports halls such as this will allow PE lessons and CCAs to be conducted throughout the day, rain or shine.&nbsp; All schools that need it will be equipped with synthetic turf which is cheaper to maintain and can be used immediately after it rains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Performing and Visual Arts, schools will have band rooms, dance studios and performing arts studios.&nbsp; Here we show Members&nbsp;a slide [<I>indicating a slide shown to hon. Members</I>] of a Performing Arts Studio at Lianhua Primary School.&nbsp; This is integrated into the library to maximise the use of space.&nbsp; We see pupils performing a skit as part of the Programme for Active Learning&nbsp;(PAL), which helps Primary 1 and Primary&nbsp;2 students develop character and life skills as well as discover their talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last year's Committee of Supply, I mentioned that MOE was prototyping PAL in 12 schools.&nbsp; I am pleased to update that PAL has been extended to another 24 schools this year.&nbsp; We will re-design classrooms to encourage greater interaction and group learning, and develop 21st century skills such as effective communication and teamwork.&nbsp; We will also provide more out-of-classroom learning facilities, such as eco-ponds and science gardens.&nbsp; This slide [<I>indicating a slide shown to hon. Members</I>]&nbsp;shows East Spring Primary students learning about pulleys as part of their Science lesson. How I wished I had something like that to teach me about pulleys during my days, I am sure I would have done better in my Physics then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next slide [<I>indicating a slide shown to hon. Members</I>]&nbsp;shows Tampines Primary's eco-garden where a teacher is conducting a lesson outdoors.&nbsp; Again, you see the engaged faces of the children.&nbsp; It is very encouraging to see them taking their lessons with such enthusiasm. &nbsp;This allows students to learn from the&nbsp;first-</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3939</p>\r\n<p>hand experience rather than just through pictures or books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For schools undergoing upgrading, we will provide additional space so that VWOs can provide student care services after school hours as Ms Denise Phua suggested.&nbsp; However, we will leave it to the school to decide depending on their pupils' needs.&nbsp; There are currently Student Care Centres in 36 of our primary schools. MCYS also has financial assistance schemes for lower-income households to cater to this group of students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, almost half of our primary schools have already become single session. &nbsp;As we push ahead with upgrading, almost all Government primary schools should be able to transit to single session by 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we upgrade schools, we have been experimenting with new and innovative models to improve land efficiency and facilitate community sharing.&nbsp; Today, I am glad to share an upcoming project to co-locate Pek Kio Community Centre with the Indoor Sports Hall of Farrer Park Primary. &nbsp;This will allow the school and CC to share facilities and collaborate on programmes.&nbsp; Details will be announced by People's Association (PA)&nbsp;later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we are not investing in infrastructure alone. Arising from PERI's recommendations, we will make learning even more engaging. &nbsp;For instance, MOE has developed additional Mathematics resources for Primary 1 to Primary 6 to support a more customised approach to teaching&nbsp;Mathematics concepts.&nbsp; The aim is to give pupils a strong foundation in Mathematics.&nbsp; The resources include manipulatives, game sets, picture cards and posters.&nbsp; Here you can see [<I>indicating a slide shown to hon.

Each week, during the Form Teacher&nbsp;Guidance Period, she bonds with the class through games, interactive activities and role play.&nbsp; Ms Mohan meets her pupils one-to-one and she meets each pupil at least twice a year.&nbsp; Such interactions are used to discuss the reflections that pupils have captured in their Learning Journals.&nbsp; These allow Ms Mohan to build trust and rapport with the pupils, better track their development and provide more detailed feedback to their parents. Such good practices to strengthen individual pupil development are also being introduced to other schools.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that since 2009, more than half of the primary schools have already implemented these practices.&nbsp; MOE will continue to support schools to implement PERI's recommendations by providing the necessary expertise and resource support, for instance, by recruiting more PE, Art and Music teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will next touch on the teaching and learning of mother tongue languages, which Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Chan Soo Sen, Mr Low Thia Khiang had spoken about. Sir, in Mandarin, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110307/20110307VS_164532.pdf\"\">Appendix A*</a></I>.] MOE's educational goal remains to support and</p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4063-4066.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3941</p>\r\n<p>enable every student to learn MTL to the fullest of his or her potential. To achieve this, the recent MTL Review articulated the objective of nurturing active learners and proficient users of MTL. The Review Committee also recommended that the goals for MTL learning be centred on three \"Cs\"&ndash;Communication, Culture and Connection. It further recognised that language is best learnt when students are taught to use the language in an active and interactive manner in real-life settings. In order to help students achieve proficiency in usage, teaching methods and national examinations will be better aligned. Contrary to what Mr Low has suggested, nurturing active learners and proficient users do not mean that transmission of culture and values will no longer be important in the teaching of MTL. Mr Low may not have seen a video clip that was shown at the recent MTL Review press conference which featured a reunion dinner. It is an example of what students will watch in the classroom to trigger further discussion. Not only will such activities strengthen their oracy, it also reinforces understanding of their culture and values. Therefore, as pointed out by the Review Committee, students who use MTL as a living language are more likely to better appreciate their cultures and traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MTL Review Committee recognised that students have different starting points because of different home language environments. As such, a more customised student&ndash;centric approach in the teaching of MTL will be taken. Teachers will be equipped with a range of appropriate pedagogies to cater to different learner profiles. For example, these include motivational strategies to build a positive affirmative learning environment and adopt a more systematic approach to build oracy foundation through contextual learning. Teachers will also be equipped with a variety of classroom strategies,</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3942</p>\r\n\r\n<p>such as the use of group work to encourage interaction, and the use of songs, rhymes and videos as well as role-play to strengthen oral interaction and make learning more engaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way of customising MTL instruction would be through information and communication technology&nbsp;(ICT). To support teachers to better use ICT in teaching, learning and assessment, and multimedia resources such as videos, flash animations and interactive games will be provided. In addition, a web&ndash;based interactive portal will be provided to all schools to facilitate students' learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To effectively implement these changes, teachers will play an instrumental role. Over the years, our MTL teachers have made significant contributions in improving teaching approaches. Their efforts are commendable. As teachers are key to whatever we do in education, we will need to first enhance our teacher training, so that teachers can in turn cater to varying student abilities and starting points. In 2008, the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL) surveyed 2,200 Chinese Language teachers to identify their training needs and develop courses according to the level that they are teaching, eg, lower primary and secondary; language skills needed, eg, composition or comprehension; and teaching pedagogies, eg, use of ICT or storybook. Going forward, to guide training, a teacher-competency framework will be developed. MOE will work with the National Institute of Education (NIE) and SCCL to provide training and support to Chinese Language teachers. MOE will also deploy an additional 500 MTL teachers by 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chan Soo Sen asked how we can produce \"high peaks\" in Chinese Language. In fact, the development of even higher levels of language proficiency for students with the ability and interest is </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3943</p>\r\n\r\n<p>also an important part of the more customised approach to MTL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have provided for Special Assistance Plan Schools &ndash; in fact, we are adding Nan Chiau High next year. We also have the Bicultural Studies Programme and the Chinese Language Elective Programme. On top of this, we will be introducing a new Chinese Linguistics and Translation subject at the \"A\" Levels. This subject will provide students with a fundamental understanding of the constructs of the Chinese Language, so as to groom future bilingual professionals with mastery in both English and Chinese languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the enhancements made in past reviews have resulted in a larger proportion of \"O\" Level students offering Higher Chinese Language (HCL). The percentage of the \"O\" Level cohort offering HCL has increased from 19% in 2004 to 28% in 2010. This shows that our students increasingly see the importance of the Chinese Language and are developing a deeper interest in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with Mr Ang Mong Seng that we need a conducive environment for students to learn and use the language outside of school.&nbsp; The Minister has announced additional funding to the Language Promotion Committees, which will support meaningful programmes.&nbsp; For instance, the Committee to promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) has launched a Cultural Performance Exposures Scheme, &nbsp;&#25991;&#21270;&#38543;&#24847;&#38376;, to engage youths from different home language backgrounds.&nbsp; Take up has been positive, increasing from 20 schools when it started in 2009, to more than 70 schools this year, benefiting&nbsp;10,000 students.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Malay Language&nbsp;Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) organises an annual Malay Language Quiz &ndash; <I>Kuiz&nbsp;Cepat Tepat</I>, in collaboration with MediaCorp, attracting participants from 110 schools and capturing&nbsp;some 100,000 viewers.&nbsp; The Tamil Language Learning </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3944</p>\r\n<p>and Promotion Committee (TLLPC) co-organises with the Tamil Language Council a range of activities for the Tamil Language Festival, which include a debate series, forums and drama festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents,&nbsp;too,&nbsp;play an important part, by giving their children early exposure and creating opportunities to use their mother tongue.&nbsp; It is heartening&nbsp;that the MTL Survey 2010 revealed that the majority of parents, regardless of language spoken at home, acknowledged the importance of learning MTL.&nbsp; Sir, I am glad to take note that public feedback on the recommendations of the MTL review committee has been largely positive.&nbsp; Many parents and committee groups agree with the rationale for the changes and affirmed our bilingual policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now address specific issues raised by Members in general.&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Ong Kian Min and Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan touched on school curriculum&nbsp;and hours.&nbsp; Some Members also spoke about private tuition earlier.&nbsp; Let me take these issues together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE believes in a balanced and holistic education for our children. We are rebalancing the system to focus more on 21st century skills and values as well as non-cognitive&nbsp;aspects of development.&nbsp; We also review the curriculum regularly.&nbsp; As part of the \"Teach Less, Learn More\" initiative, curriculum content in recent years has been reduced by as much as 30%.&nbsp; Guidelines have been provided to school leaders to ensure careful consideration goes into setting schools' start and end times as well as holiday homework.&nbsp; The curriculum is also designed to allow schools to complete the syllabus within school hours and prepare students adequately for examinations.&nbsp; To help the weaker students&nbsp;learn better, teachers may conduct remedial lessons out of their good intention.&nbsp; Such lessons are not compulsory.&nbsp; Parents will be informed in advance and have the choice</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3945</p>\r\n\r\n<p>to opt&nbsp;their children out.&nbsp; When holiday homework is given, teachers typically do so judiciously and purposefully.&nbsp; Beyond what schools provide, some parents choose to provide their children more support through tuition.&nbsp; This is a choice for parents to make.&nbsp; They will need to assess whether this&nbsp;will overburden the child and whether the child will benefit more by spending the time in other ways, like Members have said, take a stroll, outdoor activities, reading or exercising.&nbsp; While some students find it helpful, it could lead to undue stress if students have too much tuition, and under-performance for others.&nbsp; There are also many students who succeeded without tuition by paying attention in class, consulting teachers and working consistently throughout the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to quote you an example.&nbsp; Ms Sharanya Pillai from Riverside Secondary is a case in point.&nbsp; She scored nine A1s during last year's \"O\" Levels and was one of the top students without the help of tuition.&nbsp; She comes from humble background.&nbsp; According to the <I>Straits Times</I> report, her father is a security guard&nbsp;and her mother is a part-time retail assistant.&nbsp; With the monthly household income of $1,300, it is no surprise that tuition was something she did not even consider.&nbsp; But she managed her time well and minimised travelling time by attending a secondary school 10 minutes away from her home.&nbsp; She had more time to study and rest.&nbsp; She even did the Chinese Special Programme, which she got an A1.&nbsp; She aspires to be a doctor someday, and we wish her well.&nbsp; This is just one example of a student who excelled through the&nbsp;support of her school teachers, family, her own hard work and determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools also conduct Co-Curriculum Activities (CCAs)&nbsp;to offer students from holistic and broad-based development.&nbsp; For secondary schools and junior colleges,</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3946</p>\r\n\r\n<p>some CCAs might start later in the day when it is cooler or in the evenings for valid reasons, for example, camps and concerts.&nbsp; Our approach is to give our schools autonomy to vary the hours of instruction time, based on what is best in the educational interest of their pupils.&nbsp; Specifying that all activities should end by 6.00 pm, as Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan has suggested, could curtail meaningful activities.&nbsp; Nevertheless, MOE will continue to promote the importance of healthy, work, family-life balance for teachers and pupils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to primary schools in particular, MOE's guidelines for single-session schools are that Primary 1 and 2 pupils could have a slightly extended-curriculum day ending at 1.30 pm.</p>\r\n</span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is taking into account the increased emphasis on non-academic aspects of the curriculum.&nbsp; Primary 3&nbsp;to 6 pupils could have two longer days in a week to include enrichment or CCA activities though these are entirely optional.&nbsp; Since primary schools have gone single session, we note that school hours have remained within these specified guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning now to special education, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested a central agency to provide information to parents.&nbsp; Currently, MOE's website provides information on special education (SPED) schools and the programmes that they offer as well as educational pathways for special needs students.&nbsp; In addition, the Centre of Enabled Living (CEL) was set up in 2009 to be such a first-stop information and referral centre for eldercare and disability services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lim also asked about means-testing for SPED school fees. Allow me to clarify that Government's funding to SPED schools is not based on any means-tested formula.&nbsp; Rather, MOE provides SPED schools an annual per capita grant of two-</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3947</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and-a-half times that of primary education in the mainstream schools.&nbsp; On average, MOE invest $17,000 annually in each SPED school student, much more than the $7,000 per student in the primary mainstream schools.&nbsp; This significantly subsidises the cost of education for special needs students.&nbsp; Parents pay school fees charged by the individual SPED schools, which are run by voluntary welfare organisations.&nbsp; The schools have various financial assistance schemes to&nbsp;help those in need.&nbsp; With the extension of the financial assistance scheme to SPED schools, those in need will get even more support.&nbsp; That was what my Minister has announced earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For low-income family with a child with multiple disabilities attending the AWWA School, for instance, this can be about an additional&nbsp;$1,000 or so in assistance a year on top of the $17,000 MOE is already investing.&nbsp; This also means that SPED schools can re-position their own assistance schemes to support more students.&nbsp; Currently, most SPED schools have sufficient places to meet the demands for admission.&nbsp; Students who are unable to enrol in SPED schools of their choice are currently enrolled in other SPED or mainstream schools depending on their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has also enhanced the capability of mainstream schools to cater to students with mild special needs.&nbsp; We agree with Ms Denise Phua that our educational institutions need to be inclusive and we thank her for her suggestions.&nbsp; Ms Phua would be glad to note that we are doing more to support those who are hearing or physically-impaired or are visually-handicapped in our mainstream schools.&nbsp; MOE collaborates with VWOs to support the learning needs of these students.&nbsp; We are similarly extending support at the post-secondary education institutes (PSEI).&nbsp; Such support is provided through a three-step process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3948</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step involves the identification of students and their special needs. For instance, the universities identify any special needs students during the admission process that could include medical examinations.&nbsp; Second, these students are then put in touch with counsellors who customise appropriate arrangements such as facilitating physical access.&nbsp; Academic faculty may also modify teaching and examination methods appropriately, such as through providing extra notes, scripts with larger fonts or additional time for examinations.&nbsp; Third, teachers and faculty are trained to provide learning&nbsp;support and pastoral care to these students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have outlined the efforts MOE will be making to enhance the learning experience of our students.&nbsp; Our focus will be to equip our students for the 21st century through a holistic education, providing them with the necessary skills, values and knowledge to succeed.&nbsp; MOE is committed to ensure opportunities for all Singaporeans to realise their full potential regardless of their background.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Tertiary and continuing education</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo:</B> Sir, I wish to declare my interest as a member of the Boards of the Nanyang Polytechnic and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has announced many new additions to the higher education landscape.&nbsp; What changes can students look forward to in the university, polytechnic and ITE sectors in the next five to 10 years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can MOE provide an update on the SUTD and SIT and how they are benefiting Singaporeans?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has also been an increasing number of collaborations between local universities and foreign institutions.&nbsp; The</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3949</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NUS has collaborations with&nbsp;Duke University Medical School, with Boston University for a law degree and is about to have an agreement with Yale for a liberal arts college.&nbsp; NTU has a tie-up with Imperial College London for a medical school also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents tout the benefits of tapping the partner institutions' branding, expertise of the faculty and experience of its administrators.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detractors, such as Pankaj Jain, former director of the University of Leeds, are less enthusiastic.&nbsp; He says institutes in the United States and the United Kingdom are bankrupt right now.

Yesterday, a <I>Sunday Times'</I> article highlighted high-flying students from SIM Global Education (GE), who achieved excellence in academic, arts and sports.&nbsp; In another example, SIM GE's tie-up with the University of Manchester ranked 30 in the QS World University Rankings and the most recent batch of 64 graduands have achieved three first-class, 21 second upper-class, 36 second-lower and four third-class honours.&nbsp; Graduates from the programme have proven themselves in their careers.&nbsp; One of them, Ms Dulcie&nbsp;Cheong&nbsp;graduated from the programme and was recently promoted from executive secretary to assistant manager at the National University Heart Centre.&nbsp; She improved her income and social mobility through the&nbsp;PEIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans may enrol in PEIs for many reasons.&nbsp; It could be that the family is poor and needs the student to help with family expenses or at least earn enough to</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3952</p>\r\n<p>fund themselves through the university.&nbsp; Or it could be that the student's subjects of preference are not offered or not offered to him or her at public universities.&nbsp; Or quite simply, the person was a late-boomer.&nbsp; Private university degrees are expensive and the demand is great.&nbsp; At a rough estimate, there are more than 30,000 students enrolled in recent PEIs in Singapore who receive no Government subsidies.&nbsp; Students in PEIs form an integral part of our scarce human capital.&nbsp; For many, PEIs are also a route to social mobility.&nbsp; Can we invest in them as well?&nbsp; Conversely, what is the academic and social cost for not investing in them?&nbsp; Most certainly, not all PEIs are made the same and I agree that there should be clear distinction between the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE, through the Council for Private Education (CPE) has set up a quality framework for PEIs.&nbsp; Can MOE go further to do a comprehensive review of the sector, set up clear eligibility criteria for PEIs students who are Singaporeans?&nbsp; And, further, these guidelines can help students to be more discerning in their choice of studies and, at the same time, send a positive signal to PEIs to move towards high quality university education.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

According to a Singapore Children's Society survey recently, 25% of young respondents said that they were bullied in school.&nbsp; This matched&nbsp;its survey on secondary school students who reported that they were bullied in school when they were asked in 2006.&nbsp; The larger picture, provided by the bulk of respondents, suggests that, whether they reported being affected or not, there was definitely a relationship between being bullied and lessened well-being.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other longitudinal studies following the subjects into adulthood found that former victims of school bullying had significantly higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem than those who are not.&nbsp; Studies have also shown that school bullies were more at long-term risk of violent conducts and anti-social behaviour when they became adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The possible negative effects of bullying are low psychological well-being, poor social adjustment, psychological</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3957</p>\r\n\r\n<p>distress and physical ill-health symptoms.&nbsp; Our schools should pay more emphasis on student welfare and well-being to help reverse the negative and pressured atmosphere that leads both to student misbehaviour and bullying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UK has adopted a tough no-tolerance policy on bullying in schools and since 1999, UK schools are mandated to implement anti-bullying policies.&nbsp; Inspections are conducted regularly to evaluate and suggest improvements to anti-bullying measures.&nbsp; The topic of bullying has&nbsp;also been integrated into the national curriculum.&nbsp; All teachers are also trained to handle bullying cases during regular in-service training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that there are different forms of school bullying in our schools and they can be physical, verbal, relational and cyber.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether MOE takes a serious approach on anti-bullying and is making it clear from the very start that bullying is unacceptable and warrants heavy punishment?&nbsp; What are the policies in place and how successful have they been?&nbsp; Are our teachers adequately trained to deal with bullying?&nbsp; Can there be more information on bullying made available to students, parents and schools?&nbsp; Is MOE also cooperating with the NGOs in enhancing outcome?&nbsp; Could MOE implement an active early intervention programme on anti-bullying for all our schools, involving the teachers, parents and students to successfully tackle this issue?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I am a firm believer that every child, every student has the potential to be successful in their own way and to do well in life.&nbsp; Whilst we celebrate and rejoice with the top scholars, we must not forget or leave behind the group of students who may not be academically inclined, or who may be slow developers, or who, due to family circumstances, are unable to perform to their best.&nbsp; Hence, I am very glad that schools like NorthLight School and Assumption Pathway School exist to help weaker students complete their secondary education.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Principal of NorthLight School, Mrs Chua Yuan Ching, gave me a book when I visited her school, \"<I>Transformed by the Mission</I> \", a very nice book.&nbsp; One quote from the book touched me: \"as educators, we need to look out constantly for the jewel in every student who comes our way\".&nbsp; Another quote is from Ms Angeline Tan, a Mathematics senior teacher, who said that \"NorthLight had taught me to see the value in each child, unique and special, in his or her own way\".&nbsp; Thus, Sir, this school does not have any bright superstar who will score lots of As to make the school shine. Nevertheless, the school devotes its attention to ensure that every child is not left behind and to provide education to the child to prepare them for the workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister, what else is MOE doing for our weaker students so that the jewel in these students can be polished to shine through?&nbsp; Does MOE devote enough resources, for example, could MOE consider having more teachers, allied educators, more counsellors, or motivators in&nbsp;the schools to ensure that all students who are keen to learn, can complete their secondary education and have adequate opportunities to progress to either ITE or polytechnic or other </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3959</p>\r\n\r\n<p>educational institutions?&nbsp; Is there any possibility of MOE providing specialised tuition programmes for the weaker students so that we can try to help them overcome their fear of academic work and examinations as early as possible?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Sir, I take a contrary view to Members on school hours, at least for weaker students.&nbsp; The Government has created more paths for those who are not academically inclined. &nbsp;But the question is, whether we are doing enough to help weaker students before they go down those paths?&nbsp; There are programmes out there which help them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendaki, SINDA, CDAC conduct tuition classes.&nbsp; The problem is that many of these programmes are voluntary and some parents do not send their kids to them.&nbsp; Teachers tell me that they conduct home visits when a student is performing poorly or is absent or&nbsp;has discipline issues, only to be confronted by parents who do not know what to do or, worse, do not care.&nbsp; The reality is that many kids who struggle in schools come from poor or dysfunctional families, but for them, an education is the only way out of poverty.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we do more to help those who are falling behind?

The SUTD has made good progress on curriculum development and has successfully recruited an initial core of quality faculty and high calibre students. It has also launched a Dual Masters Programme with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) which will commence&nbsp;in September 2011; students will spend a year each in MIT and SUTD and graduate with a Degree from each of these institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef has asked about our plans and approach for the establishment of the Liberal Arts College. NUS signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with Yale University last September to explore further collaboration. They are now discussing the final details. The intent is for the College to offer a curriculum that preserves the best features of a liberal arts education&nbsp;&ndash; smaller class sizes, residential living, and a broad-based education experience&nbsp;&ndash; while being adapted and contextualised for Singapore and Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo asked about the value of such foreign collaborations for Singapore.&nbsp; This is a pertinent question and one that&nbsp;we are seized with. Let me see how we go about trying to ensure that we&nbsp;get the most out of these relationships. First is, of course, partnership selection.&nbsp; I think the Member would agree that, in general, the&nbsp;partners that MOE has selected have been of&nbsp;highest quality and do not fall into the categories that she described.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we try&nbsp;and structure these partnerships to be mutually beneficial so that both parties have the strong incentive to make it work and derive benefits.&nbsp;The third is&nbsp;to ensure that capabilities are </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3962</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>transferred to and embedded in our institutions, so that the benefits are not just for the duration of the partnership but are embedded in Singapore for the long run.&nbsp; And, fourthly, we calibrate the resources we allocate by ensuring that funding for each&nbsp;collaboration is commensurate with its scope and scale.&nbsp; It is also tied to milestones which meet the objectives of the collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all that, is there a risk that some of these&nbsp;collaborations will not yield all the benefits&nbsp;we seek? The answer must be yes. But the question then to ask is, does that&nbsp;mean&nbsp;we do not embark on such ventures? I think the overall benefits outweigh the costs and the risks, so we should meticulously structure these arrangements to mitigate downside risks and maximise the benefits to our system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another&nbsp;institution which has commenced operations last year is the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). It works closely with our polytechnics and also partners&nbsp;overseas universities to offer degree programmes for polytechnic upgraders.&nbsp; SIT's student intake will double to 1,000 this year. At SIT's open house last Saturday, prospective students for the August 2011 intake could choose from 17 degree programmes with seven overseas university partners. This is up from eight programmes last year and this will continue to grow as SIT works towards a&nbsp;steady state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next five years, MOE will spend $7 billion on polytechnic education. About $1 billion will be used to increase the capacity of our polytechnics by 20%, and to rejuvenate the campuses with state-of-the-art facilities (like laboratories), and these will ensure that our students are exposed to authentic industry-standard working environments. The polytechnics will also continue to offer new courses such as animation and 3-D arts, and digital forensics.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3963</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar transformation is underway at the ITE. International visitors, industry leaders and alumni are struck by the quality of facilities at ITE's new regional campuses. With a critical mass of students in each College, ITE can optimise its resources and provide an enhanced educational experience for its students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, at ITE's Centre for Healthcare Simulation Training, Nursing NITEC students are able to practise their skills on high-fidelity manikins that actually breathe, speak and provide a range of other physiological responses. I suppose if we had a video we could get a better sense of the capabilities of the manikins. Opportunities for sports and the aesthetics have also been improved with the provision of dedicated facilities like a running track, gymnasium, swimming pool and a performing arts centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next five years, MOE will spend $2 billion on ITE. It is an important investment that yields and&nbsp;continues to yield productive outcomes for our ITE graduates. Almost 90% of ITE students are employed within six months of graduation. And 90% of the employers confirm and affirm that they possess not just the requisite skills but also good work attitudes. Today, a fifth of ITE students move on to polytechnics to further their education and we will take steps over the next few years to increase that proportion to one quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Teo has also asked about MOE's role in Continuing Education and Training (CET). &nbsp;In 2008, the National CET Masterplan was launched by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Development Agency (WDA) to increase the national CET capacity. It was implemented through private and public service providers, including the polytechnics and ITE. MOE started to subsidise fees for part-time undergraduate programmes at the public universities and UniSIM in 2008.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3964</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE also funds academic CET programmes like Diplomas;&nbsp;Advanced Diplomas and Specialist Diplomas.&nbsp; In the academic year ending March 2010, MOE funded over 18,300 CET training places at the polytechnics and ITE, of which 6,400 were for diploma-level programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our polytechnics and ITE are held in very high regard by industry for their high-quality, market-relevant courses. Similarly, our polytechnics and ITE will leverage on their high-quality&nbsp;training facilities and curricula, which are co-developed with industry partners, to deliver well recognised and quality CET programmes that meet the needs of the Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) on the one hand and also the industry on the other hand, to ensure that the demand and supply match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will do even more to grow the current CET training capacity in our post-secondary education institutions. We will increase the number of training places in part-time Diplomas, Advanced Diplomas and Specialist Diplomas at the polytechnics from 6,400 to 10,100 by 2015. This will include courses in key sectors that are identified by the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council and include sectors like precision engineering, hospitality and logistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enhanced subsidies for Advanced Diploma and Specialist Diploma Programmes which is raised from 70% to 85%, as the Minister mentioned earlier, will reduce fees significantly. The table* there elaborates and gives very specific amounts of how much the students would save.&nbsp; Student's fees for a year-long Specialist Diploma in Logistics Management will be just under $700 which is less than half a month's salary for a PMET.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In keeping with the philosophy of lifelong learning and employability, MOE will lift its current \"no double-bite\" </p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4051-4052.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3965</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>subsidy policy for Advanced and Specialist&nbsp;Diplomas. We know that PMETs cannot rely&nbsp;on&nbsp;formal qualification acquired at the start of their working lives to sustain them for the duration of their careers. They need to constantly up-skill and occasionally even re-skill in order to switch tracks. By subsidising those who acquire another Advanced or Specialist Diploma&nbsp;five or more years after their first Diploma, we will help PMETs stay employable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will also increase the fee subsidies for part-time undergraduate programmes at UniSIM and public universities to 55% of published fees, in line with the subsidy for full-time undergraduate programmes. This will reduce programme fees by a quarter, and for the students, it&nbsp;means the&nbsp;savings of between $4,000 and $6,500 per programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to encourage upgraders to attain full qualifications, we will give first-time trainees in a part-time polytechnic diploma a completion award of $1,000. First-time trainees in ITE NITEC/Higher NITEC certificates will receive $200 when they complete the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all, $350 million will be invested in CET over the next five years, up from the $80 million that we spent in the past three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond funding, our CET programmes must be structured to meet the needs of working adults. MOE will, therefore, re-design diploma-level CET in two ways. First, we will make CET courses more modular so that trainees will be able to earn a full diploma qualification by accumulating a number of certificate-level qualifications within a certain validity period. We will also leverage more on e-learning platforms. This will help adult learners learn at their own pace and in a </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3966</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>manner that is compatible with their family and work commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, CET courses will be condensed for adult learners in recognition of their work experience. For example, Nanyang Polytechnic's part-time Diploma in Precision Engineering, which is a 1500-hour course, will be adapted into a 900-hour programme without compromising standards. How do we do that? By doing away with&nbsp;general education modules; moving some classroom training onto self-directed and e-learning platforms; and by specialising in disciplines, for instance,&nbsp;Plastic Moulding or Machining Technology in order to streamline the curriculum. The students can pursue such courses at their own pace by accumulating a number of certificate-level qualifications [<I>chart</I> *].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also committed to ensuring that no deserving student will be denied a quality tertiary education for want of funds. The Minister for Education spoke about the enhanced bursaries for ITE students. Let me now elaborate on the enhancements for diploma and undergraduate students.&nbsp;&nbsp; Diploma students will receive significantly higher bursaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those from the lowest third of households in terms of per capita income (that is, per capita income of up to $850 per month) will now receive bursaries of $1,800, which is an increase from&nbsp;the $1,200 they received previously. This will cover 80% of their tuition fees. Put it another way, this bursary together with the&nbsp;subsidies that the Government in general provides for the education means that&nbsp;97% of the cost of the education will be covered and the students will&nbsp;only have to come up with&nbsp;3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next group of students, for the 33rd up to the 50th percentile with per capita income of up to $1,200 per month, will receive a 70% increase in bursaries to $1,350&nbsp;&ndash; that is, 60% of tuition fees and,</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4051-4052; 4053-4054.<BR></div>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3967</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>in total, 94% of the cost of education will be covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also extend a $450 bursary to diploma students from households from the 50th to the 66th percentile with a per capita income of $1,700 per month and this will help pay about 20% of their fees [<I>chart</I> *].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; University students will also benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those from the lowest one-third of households in terms of per capita income will receive an 80% increase in bursaries&nbsp;&ndash; from $1,600 to $2,900. This will cover 40% of fees for a typical degree and in terms of the cost of coverage including the Government's subsidy for overall education will be 85% of&nbsp;cost.&nbsp; So, again, the students are only coming up with 15%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Undergraduates from the 33rd up to the 50th percentile will receive $950 more, that is about&nbsp;30% of the fees.&nbsp; And&nbsp;all university students can also supplement their bursaries with Government-subsidised loans [<I>chart</I> *].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, 55% of students in ITE, polytechnics and universities eligible for bursaries will benefit from significant increases in the help they receive. By extending the bursaries to a larger proportion of households, the percentage of institutions of higher learning students eligible for subsidies will increase to 75%.&nbsp; In other words, three out of four students in our institutions of higher learning&nbsp;will be eligible for these subsidies.&nbsp; These enhancements will cost MOE up to an extra $134 million a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may&nbsp;now turn to private education. To uplift the quality of the private education sector, we established the Council for Private Education (CPE) in December 2009. As of last month, CPE had completed the registration of 239 Private Education Institutions (PEIs) and more than a quarter of them obtained either one or four-year EduTrust certification.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3968</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low and Mr Chiam have&nbsp;asked if MOE intends to extend Government funding to Private Education Institutions and their students. And I think&nbsp;to answer that, we need to just take a step back. MOE plans for university places based on Singapore's manpower demand, while taking into account the need to preserve the high standards of our autonomous universities. In other words, even as we seek to increase the Cohort Participation Rate for universities, we must ensure that the quality and value of university education is maintained, and that our graduates continue to find good employment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I will further elaborate on MOE&rsquo;s efforts in ensuring quality and accessibility for pre-school education, and highlight some of the targeted support that MOE provides for our learners.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE recognises that pre-school education is important.&nbsp; MOE discussed this at length during the debate on the parliamentary Motion raised by Nominated MP Viswa Sadasivan.&nbsp; I will therefore refrain from repeating myself and highlight only the key points.&nbsp; Let me use the&nbsp;opportunity arising from the cuts raised by Mrs Josephine Teo, Dr Mohamad Maliki and Mr Christopher de Souza to briefly provide a progress update on some of&nbsp;MOE's initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a recap of raising teacher quality.&nbsp; From January 2009, MOE and MCYS require all new teachers to have minimum entry academic qualifications of&nbsp;five \"O\"-Level credits, including a B4 in</p>\r\n\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3970</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n <p>English.&nbsp; Incumbent teachers are also required to attain a basic level of English proficiency.&nbsp; Before this, in 2006, the minimum requirement for pre-school teachers was only three \"O\"-Level credits,&nbsp;including English.&nbsp; On top of the academic requirements, all pre-school teachers are required to attain the Diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education-Teaching (DECCE-T).&nbsp; As of January 2011, 86% of kindergarten teachers and 70% of childcare teachers have attained the DECCE-T or are undergoing training for it, as compared to 55% of kindergarten teachers and 46% of childcare teachers just five years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help boost the overall quality of teachers over time, we set a target for all pre-schools to have at least 75% of all its teachers meeting the new requirements by January 2013.&nbsp; I am happy to update that&nbsp;MOE&nbsp;is well on&nbsp;the way to meeting the 2013 target. Latest figures show that 77.4% of kindergartens and 69.6% of childcare centres have already achieved this target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Ms Indranee Rajah) in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.32 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on enhancing accessibility and affordability of pre-school education.&nbsp; MOE and&nbsp;their partners have been painstakingly knocking on doors to ensure that no child, especially those from lower-income families, is deprived of a pre-school education. MOE's&nbsp;commitment and persistence have paid off. I &nbsp;am happy to update that the percentage of Primary 1-going age children who did not attend pre-school in 2010 was 1.1%&nbsp;&ndash; down from 5% just five years ago in 2006.&nbsp; Let me thank all the grassroots partners, MCYS and the Singapore Children&rsquo;s Society for their continued support in the annual exercise to reach out to our children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS and the community groups provide financial assistance to the lower-</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3971</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>income families.&nbsp; This year, the Minister for Finance announced additional support for MCYS&rsquo; financial assistance schemes for pre-school education and childcare fees.&nbsp; He also announced a new Child Development Credit Scheme, where the credit can be used for pre-school fees for all Singaporean children aged six and below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of these targeted financial assistance, MOE has invested $150 million in the pre-school sector over the last five years to support the pre-school initiatives that MOE has introduced. &nbsp;We have seen good progress as outlined earlier.&nbsp; We plan to double MOE&rsquo;s investment in pre-school education over the next five years to $290 million, to continue to uplift the quality of the pre-school sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, investing in high quality teachers and school leaders is an imperative for MOE.&nbsp; MOE and MCYS have disbursed a total of $5.08 million for 311 scholarships, teaching awards and bursaries since 2008.&nbsp; These are tenable for incumbent teachers, principals, and pre-service teachers from childcare centres and not-for-profit kindergartens to upgrade themselves professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE and MCYS will do more.&nbsp; Starting from 2011, MOE and MCYS will provide up to 1,400 scholarships, bursaries and teaching awards over three years.&nbsp; This will cost up to $21 million over the next three years and, if fully awarded, will represent more than a four-fold increase when compared to the amount we have awarded in the previous three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This additional support will help grow a pool of well-qualified pre-school educators through attracting new entrants into the sector, as well as providing opportunities for professional upgrading for existing educators.&nbsp; Some educators may wish to consider developing their</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3972</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>leadership skills to take on leadership positions, in which case the leadership courses would be appropriate; while others may opt to deepen their skills in&nbsp;the teaching area, and hence pursue certificate courses in areas such as Music and Movement, Drama, or Chinese Education.&nbsp; These awards are, therefore, tenable at different Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) courses to meet the various upgrading needs of pre-school educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo asked if a NIE type of pre-school education set-up could be considered for the training of early childhood educators.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mrs Teo that MOE and MCYS are putting in place such a system.&nbsp; But unlike the school sector which has only one main employer, which is MOE, and one pre-service training provider, which is NIE, the pre-school sector is more diverse and&nbsp;MOE's quality assurance structures must reflect this difference.&nbsp; The Pre-school Qualification Accreditation Committee (PQAC), jointly steered by MOE and MCYS, sets standards for certificate and diploma level pre-school teacher preparation courses, and accredits courses that have met these standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from investing in teacher quality, MOE launched the new Singapore Pre-school Accreditation Framework (SPARK) in November 2010, to help kindergartens and childcare centres improve the quality of their programmes and to learn to benchmark themselves against recognised quality standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information on pre-schools that participated in SPARK and have attained accreditation will be listed on the MOE website. Since January 2011, pre-schools have started applying for quality assessments by MOE&rsquo;s SPARK assessors.&nbsp; MOE hopes that with the widespread adoption of SPARK over the next few years, the quality rating of pre-schools will help parents make informed and objective</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3973</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>choices about the right pre-school for their children, a concern raised by Mrs Josephine Teo.&nbsp; An update on the accreditation outcomes of SPARK will be provided later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo also pointed out that innovation is one way to uplift the quality of the pre-school sector.&nbsp; Indeed, kindergartens are encouraged to engage in innovative practices, and to experiment with new ideas to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in pre-school.&nbsp; More than half a million dollars have been awarded by MOE to 144 kindergartens through the Kindergarten Innovation Grant since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also announced the Experimental Kindergarten at Temasek Polytechnic at the Committee of Supply (COS) last year.&nbsp; They have&nbsp;commenced operations this year.&nbsp; I visited the centre and am convinced that they will&nbsp;contribute to this innovation drive.&nbsp; Temasek Polytechnic will bring into the Experimental Kindergarten, the whole eco-system of its various departments and complemencies.&nbsp; Together, they will serve both as a centre for research in curriculum and pedagogy in early childhood education &ndash; and as a test bed for research to be applied to Singapore's local context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensuring that our children start early in pre-school is one of the many effective means to level up society through education.&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Hri Kumar are correct to say that even then,&nbsp;MOE should be concerned about students who continue to require additional support to help them level up, especially if these students are less able to afford external assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar talked about a school model which starts at 7.00 am and ends at 7.00 pm, with two to three hours homework after school.&nbsp; This is even</p> \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3974</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>longer than the working hours of adults.&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar then suggested making it compulsory for students to attend extra classes after school, and to even restrict students&rsquo; choices of CCAs, so that they will not spend too much time on CCAs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Hri Kumar admitted himself, such an approach is indeed \"draconian\".&nbsp; This is not the approach that MOE takes. CCAs are an important part of school life and play a key role in the holistic development of our students, which no student should be deprived of.&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-organised and well-implemented CCA can inculcate values and develop qualities, such as resilience, fair play, discipline and team spirit.&nbsp; These qualities are equally important to all students, and especially so for students from less privileged backgrounds. Specifying that weaker students be excused from CCA would curtail many meaningful activities and developmental opportunities for our students.&nbsp; Over-imposing curriculum on our students also does not address the fact that some children learn better through different means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we are on the issue of CCAs, Nominated MP Joscelin Yeo makes an assertion that, deprived of a choice of a CCA, a student committed suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be sympathetic to any family that has suffered a suicide within, and acknowledge that the reasons for suicides are multi-faceted, complex and, many times, very personal.&nbsp; What the Member should really show is that there is evidence that for every or many suicides, the victim had the first choice of CCA deprived, instead of picking up a single and local report to make her case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to Mr Hri Kumar's point,&nbsp;MOE's approach is to ensure that targeted programmes are put in place at various levels to ensure that our learners receive appropriate help. This is precisely what Mr Lim Biow Chuan suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3975</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because almost all our children attend pre-school, a targeted programme called&nbsp;Focused Language Assistance in Reading (FLAiR) is provided to children found to require additional assistance in English.&nbsp; As some children lack exposure at home, FLAiR provides the opportunity to be exposed to reading materials, writing experiences, and speaking and listening to English Language in an engaging and fun way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example of a child who has benefited from FLAiR is Prathira d/o Palanivelu from PCF Jalan Besar Blk 106. &nbsp;Initially a very quiet and reserved girl, she blossomed under the FLAiR programme to show great progress in her reading, writing and listening skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FLAiR seeks to develop at an early age, important communication skills and their love for acquiring knowledge through reading books, writing, speaking and listening.&nbsp; But proper reading, writing and numeracy skills may not be as developed for some.&nbsp; For these students, MOE has instituted additional programmes to help students level up when they first enter Primary Schools.&nbsp; The Learning Support Programmes for English and Mathematics are administered by additional teachers to help students who had less prior exposure and require more support.&nbsp; These programmes help students acquire a stronger foundation of the English Language and Mathematics especially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the secondary school level, innovations are introduced to customise to the learning needs of students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MOE also recognises that some students are more technically inclined and prefer a more hands-on pedagogical approach. Since 2005, schools can offer 20 to 30-hour elective modules (EMs) to enrich the learning experience of their Normal (Academic), or Normal (Technical) students.&nbsp; These modules are intended to</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3976</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>develop students&rsquo; interests and strengths in specific areas, as well as introduce students to a course of study in post-secondary education institutes.&nbsp; Some of the EMs also provide credit points for advanced standing for any NITEC courses at ITE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2007, MOE has also worked with three secondary schools, termed \"N(T) Mark II schools\", to pilot innovations in the N(T) course.&nbsp; These schools work closely with MOE and ITE to customise their curricula to bring about a greater focus on practice-oriented skills.&nbsp; Students also have the opportunity to do industrial attachments and internships, as an integral part of the schools' programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope these approaches will allow our secondary students to enjoy their learning and acknowledge its relevance in a real-life context.

Active participation in school activities, such as CCAs, is another effective way of engaging students.&nbsp; In addition, MOE collaborates with other Ministries, such as MCYS, MOH, MHA, and the community, such as Family Service Centres and self-help groups.&nbsp; I will elaborate more on the early intervention efforts for youths at-risk at MHA&rsquo;s COS debate.&nbsp; But I must stress the critical role that parents play in creating a nurturing home environment and help youths build social skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo quoted a Singapore Children's Society's survey that 25% of young respondents said that they were bullied in school.&nbsp; The prevalence of school bullying can be misleading when it is just taken at face value, without a deeper understanding of how the figure was derived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must qualify to say that the figures represent an entire spectrum of bullying behaviours, which range from \"teasing\" and \"being excluded\" to the more severe forms of bullying.&nbsp; Where bullying involves hurting, frightening or intimidating others using power or strength, MOE would like to clarify that these incidents are indeed infrequent and the numbers have so far remained low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I want to assure Dr Lily Neo that MOE regards bullying in schools as a serious matter.&nbsp; We will take the necessary measures to ensure that schools provide a safe and conducive learning environment for all our students.&nbsp; Schools are provided with comprehensive guidelines to manage discipline issues, and this includes bullying.&nbsp; Teachers also </p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3978</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>educate their students on what bullying is and its negative repercussions, how they should effectively seek help in the event they encounter bullying and enable them to help themselves and support their peers if affected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;will now conclude.&nbsp; It is MOE's commitment that the education system allows every child to be provided with the opportunity to achieve the best he can be. We are doing the right things &ndash; by focusing on the educators to improve quality, affordability and accessibility of pre-school education.&nbsp; We have also rolled out targeted programmes at the pre-school, primary school and secondary school levels to support the students who need additional help, and to keep our youths engaged in schools.&nbsp; We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders, including parents, the community and other agencies, to ensure that educational opportunities are available for all.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If I am not mistaken, universities and polytechnics have expanded enrolment over time, and so cohort participation in tertiary education has also gone up.&nbsp; Given that as a backdrop, would the Minister not agree that there is room for us to improve further, in the sense that for our overall population, we expect about 70% to go through tertiary education, should we not aim to do the same for students from the lower-income households?&nbsp; That is the first clarification.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second clarification is for the Senior Minister of State, Mr Iswaran.&nbsp; He has given very comprehensive responses on SUTD, SIT, ITE, and also on PMETs and MOE's role.&nbsp;

The Member is quite right that the particular figure she cited was that half of our children who live in 1- to 3-room flats progress to polytechnics and universities.&nbsp; Her question is: if, for example,&nbsp;the proportion of polytechnics and university students are 60% across the board, should we not aim for that?&nbsp; If that is her argument, then only 60% of middle income students can go to polytechnics and universities, and only 60% of high income students can&nbsp;go to universities.&nbsp; The point of my speech was that that is a very wrong starting point&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that in our attempt to focus on one group,&nbsp;we actually try to conscribe other groups.&nbsp; It becomes a win-lose mathematical game.&nbsp; What we really ought to be doing is to say how Singapore as a whole is moving up first.&nbsp; I gave examples of how indeed we moved up.&nbsp; Because we really do not know where the next bright child comes from&nbsp;&ndash; whether it is low, whether it is middle or whether it is high income &ndash; what we need to do as a system is to ensure that everyone has the opportunities to enter a good school wherever they live, whatever background they come from, and to be able to access the programmes that fit their talents and aptitudes.&nbsp; The only way to do that is to resource all schools to make sure that teachers are spread across all schools.&nbsp; And Mr Chiam subsequently asked, do we indeed do that, and I gave figures that all secondary schools can claim to have scholars, teaching award&nbsp;

I just want the&nbsp;Minister's comments on that.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> Madam,&nbsp;that is a multi-faceted question, but I would like to take the first question&nbsp;on&nbsp;the number of teachers that we are recruiting.&nbsp; I think it is very important for us to basically take note of what the Member has just said.&nbsp; The fact is&nbsp;that we are already recruiting one in&nbsp;eight graduates.&nbsp;There is a limit for</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3981</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>us to increase that number, beyond which I think it will affect the rest of the economy.&nbsp; For that reason, we have increased, for example, the number of allied educators.&nbsp; That really, first of all, augments the number of staff within the school system, but also allows Singaporeans, who have not gotten the chance to have a tertiary education and university degree, to have a career opportunity in&nbsp;education.&nbsp; So the allied educators are very helpful.&nbsp; They provide our teachers with very good support, not just in teaching but also in specialised areas, eg, like counselling and&nbsp;in special needs.&nbsp; We do provide&nbsp;good career progression for them, which is very structured, including training.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her first part of the question really is: how do we equip our teachers to prepare&nbsp;them to be the teaching force of the future?&nbsp; Because we do want our students to be ready for the 21st century and therefore our teachers must equally have those skills to do so.&nbsp; I think there are three levels again.&nbsp; First of all, we like to see an increase in the number of graduate teachers.&nbsp; Secondly, we are improving our&nbsp;in-service training,&nbsp;in other words, after they are in the teaching force, we are going to give them more structured training opportunity as well as giving them the leeway to dictate how they would like to improve their professional skills themselves. So the setting up of the Academy of Singapore Teachers,&nbsp;the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA)&nbsp;and the style which deals with areas such as PE and Arts, these are really to allow the profession greater opportunity while they are in-service to pick up specialised training opportunity in areas of their choice.&nbsp; So there are a lot more opportunities for training, and they&nbsp;themselves doing their own training roadmap.&nbsp; The master teachers&nbsp;&ndash; those who are experienced&nbsp;&ndash; will then&nbsp;pass on their&nbsp;skills to the more</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3982</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>junior ones, probably including more mentoring as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of that, there is always a continuous need to upgrade our teachers because of developments in pedagogy and technology.&nbsp; We know that there are many changes that are going on as well as studies going on as to&nbsp;how we could teach and learn more effectively.&nbsp; That is going on not just in the sciences,&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;humanities, it is happening in the languages as well.&nbsp; What the Minister has described earlier about Stellar, about mother tongue languages&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that really shows a continuous effort on MOE's part to upgrade and move our teaching standards as knowledge increases and&nbsp;technology improves.&nbsp; It is a never ending journey, and we really like our teachers to&nbsp;take control of their profession, direct their own training paths and&nbsp;basically develop their sense of professional pride, knowing that in Singapore teachers are well respected and&nbsp;well equipped.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Member had cited some examples where partnerships have failed and others have succeeded, and that is exactly why the outcomes vary.&nbsp; Because the real test is in the details.&nbsp; It is not in how well we&nbsp;conceive the idea but it is also in how we then work out specific programmes to achieve some of the clear objectives we set for ourselves.&nbsp; For example, in our set-up, the brand value is clear.&nbsp;The association with a certain institution of</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3983</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>international reputation has certain value but in itself does not yield much because people will see through it unless it translates into content value, in other words, pedagogical approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at SUTD, and&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;will be familiar with it, the infusion of MIT's approach was engineering, an infusion of that sensibility into our system.&nbsp; It would be a welcome addition.&nbsp; If we look at the Imperial College&nbsp;alliance, a&nbsp;different approach to the teaching of medicine is something that we are hoping to accomplish.&nbsp; If we look at our experience with SMU, it is a case in point, how it has differentiated and added variety to our tertiary education landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without going into nuts and bolts, the way I would describe it is this: we need to be clear to&nbsp;choose the right partners to the best of our abilities.&nbsp; We structure the arrangement with them so that we are clear what our long-term goals are and that they are aligned and mutually beneficial.&nbsp; From the Singapore's perspective, we look to ensure that there is a clear systematic transfer of capabilities which we want for our system and then the rest of it is really in execution, and we work at it and we&nbsp;ensure that through the milestones we set, we track this closely to ensure that we are getting value-for-money.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Perhaps I did not make myself quite clear.&nbsp; I am not talking about higher Chinese, I am talking about peak Chinese&nbsp;&ndash; Chinese at the highest level that can be comparable with the students who go into <I>Beida</I> and <I>Qinghua</I>.&nbsp; Therefore, the concept is perhaps to get the students, who are particularly gifted in Chinese </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3984</p>\r\n\r\n<p>language all over Singapore, and get our resources from NUS, NTU or even our foreign network, get them together and shoot for the stars so that we can have graduands who have got a command of Chinese good enough for the best in China so that we can derive our good diplomats, business leaders or even songwriters&nbsp;to continue our interaction with Chinese and not lose our competitive advantage because more and more in other&nbsp;countries are also learning Chinese.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Madam, indeed, MOE has some experience in that because as a Ministry, we send the largest number of Singaporean students to the Chinese universities &ndash; <I>Beida</I> and <I>Qinghua</I> as mentioned by Mr Chan.&nbsp; More to <I>Beida</I> because they are training to be Chinese teachers.&nbsp; <I>Qinghua</I> is more engineering and sometimes international studies.&nbsp; But the ones that are enrolled in <I>Beida</I> to become Chinese teachers are, indeed, going through the lessons as the Chinese students are.&nbsp; I visit them quite often, and when I go there and sometimes I have meals with them, I ask them, \"Are you sure you can compete?\"&nbsp; They say \"&#36824;&#21487;&#20197;\", or \"we can still do it, we are on par\".\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are producing, as the Member calls it, that group of bicultural elite.&nbsp; Honestly, can we compete with their best?&nbsp; We encourage them to.&nbsp; But even if we could, I want us to be realistic that when we offer scholarships and opportunities, parents advise their children accordingly.&nbsp; Some would still feel that studying elsewhere in established Ivy League universities, Oxbridge is the better choice, because if they are bright in languages often they are bright in many areas and they really have the choice&nbsp;of whether they want to do law, medicine, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can offer these as a choice and I would say that the opportunities exist if, indeed, someone feels that he is going to focus primarily on the&nbsp;Chinese language, there are opportunities but beyond these incentives, I feel a bit </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 3985</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>reluctant&nbsp;to push them that way only &ndash; but to just offer them the choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to respond to Mrs Josephine Teo about cost, and she is quite right, some of these tie-ups are costly.&nbsp; They are costly because they require a different pedagogy.&nbsp; If we look at the Singapore University of Technology and Design that we did together with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I cannot remember the scale of it but I would think what it compares to some of our courses, they are resource-intensive, so that they may be 50% or even 100% more&nbsp;than what we spend.&nbsp; That was the reason, if Members remember, we said that we did not want to deny students a good opportunity and that&nbsp;Singaporeans can benefit,&nbsp;yet at the same time, we charge very much higher fees.&nbsp; The second point is that we want to move towards an endowment model so that it is really up to the stakeholders, all Singaporeans, to say I am willing to fund this so&nbsp;that it helps some&nbsp;Singaporeans but to the&nbsp;Singaporean himself, he will bear more of&nbsp;the fees.&nbsp; But obviously, we cannot charge beyond a certain limit.&nbsp; The Member is quite right, some of these are costly &ndash; the&nbsp;Medical School of Imperial College costs as much if not a little bit more than what it does cost to train our own medical student, but that is because it is a young university with a&nbsp;young faculty.&nbsp; Duke costs more and that is why we charge them higher fees.&nbsp; Some of these do come at a price.&nbsp; I want to make it clear to Members that yes, indeed, the education model costs more.&nbsp; We feel that it will add not only to those students but to the entire system, and that is the reason we charge higher fees and move towards an endowment model.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We take into consideration factors such as the distance to the school, the presence&nbsp;of siblings &ndash; whether the sibling is studying in the same school and also whether the parents are, for example, involved in the community that is supporting the schools.&nbsp; The current framework actually is a result of a lot of discussions and a lot of&nbsp;evolution from past considerations.&nbsp; At the moment, we do not have any intention to change the way that we have been handling our Primary 1 registration but should there be a need to review the priority as well as chances given to parents with more children, we will definitely take Mr Baey's recommendation into consideration.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

It is a surer way, in most parents' view.&nbsp; Can we, in a way, outlaw tuition?&nbsp; We probably cannot do that.&nbsp; Can we ask the parents to pay less attention to their children's education?&nbsp; It is probably not a good idea to do so.&nbsp; But what we could do is to show parents that in school we do provide adequate support.&nbsp; In fact, if your child is not doing so well, we do have support programmes to help your children.&nbsp; There are parents who like to have a more balanced education would agree that to leave the academic side to the school and, perhaps, concentrate in other areas of bringing up their children such as bonding with them, reading with them and so forth.&nbsp; By understanding the way that they have been getting an education and the way that they have&nbsp;progressed,&nbsp; knowing their needs,&nbsp;knowing their strengths,&nbsp;knowing the weaknesses of the child and&nbsp;we should know how to balance, and&nbsp;I know of many parents who have done so as well.&nbsp; I think Member Baey Yam Keng's wife&nbsp;has just written a wonderful article in <I>Zaobao</I> talking about how she has actually focused on other areas of bringing up, supporting the child, instead of spending the time in tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They get investments like any other schools, both in terms of hardware and software and in teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the assurance that we will give parents that there are many more pathways now besides just the typical academic part of it, and that they&nbsp;should really give the opportunity to&nbsp;their children to&nbsp;explore their strengths in various areas and we would like to assure parents that there are many more pathways for their children to success.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Joscelin Yeo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our programmes give access to slower learners.&nbsp; We have learning support programmes for English, as I have mentioned, and also&nbsp;learning support programme for Mathematics.&nbsp; They basically gauge the child's ability at Primary 1, and&nbsp;in small groups sometimes five, eight or three, depending on each school &ndash;

Many Members of Parliament said it was a good idea to have before and after-school programmes.&nbsp; Indeed, that was the reason why we put it as part of the new specifications for new schools to have a space.&nbsp; I have visited many schools who have&nbsp;on their own engaged a VWO to come in to take care of these students.&nbsp; Another&nbsp;school outsourced it to a private firm.&nbsp; The private firm does it because of its Corporate Social Responsibility, so it charges certain rates which the school subsidises.&nbsp; There are these programmes that are taking place.&nbsp; At the end of the day, you need to engage principals and teachers because we have varied needs and&nbsp;different environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members would have remembered the article by Tom Friedman in the <I>New York Times</I>.&nbsp; He mentioned this wonderful science class at Gan Eng Seng Primary School.&nbsp; What the article did not say was that Gan Eng Seng School has 50% of students from 1- to 3-roomers.&nbsp; It is one of our schools with the largest percentages.&nbsp; Nobody in MOE told the principal or the Science teacher to do this.&nbsp; This is why the most powerful and enabling factor in any system is dedicated and committed teachers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have the specifics of 1- to 2-roomers.&nbsp; We will give it&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Member if she files a Parliamentary Question.&nbsp; As I have said, for the 1- to 3-roomers, 50% of them progress to polytechnics and universities, and that is quite a remarkable achievement for any system.&nbsp; I did mention about resilient students.&nbsp; PISA showed that we are the 5th out of 65 countries.&nbsp; Resilient students are the ones that perform better than predicted which</p>\r\n\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3992</p>\r\n\r\n<p> shows that our system does help students over-reach, even given their socio-economic status.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We do have programmes which keep them in.&nbsp; But I want to articulate a principle, that we should not ask our schools to do what is primarily the responsibility of parents.&nbsp; Neither do we push them and pressure them because I have seen that happen.&nbsp; It is not wrong in itself, but it does dilute the attention of your teachers, and it does not place squarely&nbsp;where the responsibility should be placed.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to work with parents and the community in order to address these issues.&nbsp; In other words, I am not going to keep students because they want to be somewhere else.&nbsp; I am not going to create programmes because basically, that will just create disinterested students who will be antagonistic,&nbsp;rebellious at school and may even affect their real programmes when there&nbsp;are real classes to be held.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will do what we can but I would like that for these matters, we work with community groups&nbsp;to engage students and their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;My teachers have gone out of their way to do that, but I have never asked them to be solely responsible for that, and they are clear on that.&nbsp;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I&nbsp;wish to speak about two bridges that need to be built.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;between the rich and the poor and, second, between the different races and&nbsp;between old and new citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me share some perspectives on the cost of living in Singapore. There are some definitions of income which uses the amount needed to meet the 2,200 calorie diet as the minimum income </p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3994</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>needed.&nbsp; My colleagues at NTUC FairPrice gave me the following figures.&nbsp; For meeting the basic nutritional needs for a family of four, ie, two adults and two teenagers, the cost is about $370 a month.&nbsp; This is based on the nutritional requirements of the Health Promotion Board, and we take the simplest food plan. We have <I>tofu</I> for lunch and chicken for dinner.&nbsp; We then added some frills,&nbsp;eg, <I>kaya</I>,&nbsp;coffee,&nbsp;soya&nbsp;sauce,&nbsp;biscuits, things like that.&nbsp; This comes up to another $20 a month.&nbsp; Hence, on&nbsp;a subsistence level, I think $400 will probably feed a family of four a balanced diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight that this is really subsistence&nbsp;&ndash; white rice, <I>tofu</I>, one vegetable and one fruit for a meal. Even for the meal with chicken,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;half a chicken for the family.&nbsp; The average middle class of Singapore will probably have&nbsp;Royal Umbrella rice with prawns, salmon and so on.&nbsp; And most middle-class families have more than one protein and one vegetable for their meals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the data, we have on what Singapore families eat. They will go for a $15 or $20 meal.&nbsp; So you can probably say that food for such an average middle-class family will cost about $1,000 a month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I did this experiment to show what we all know already through personal experience that happiness, contentment or richness if you will, they are all relative. For many people in the world, what we call subsistence diet&nbsp;&ndash; <I>kaya</I>, half a chicken, rice, it is already complete contentment.&nbsp; It is something that they have been striving and working for all their lives.&nbsp; But this is not what the average Singapore family wants.&nbsp;I thank the Minister for giving us an assurance that even the very poor amongst&nbsp; us, they can have enough for the $400 subsistence meals.&nbsp; No one need go hungry here if he does not turn up his nose at housebrand rice and half a chicken for his whole family to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3995</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, I&nbsp; note there is a gap between the $400 meal that we can afford and the $1,000 meal that we aspire to. This budget holds out that promise, ie, if we want to have any help with education and job training, there are enough schemes out there to give us a leg-up.&nbsp; And with these, our family can have a $1,000 meal plan&nbsp;by our own work and effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the broad strokes of the budget paint a good picture. I would just like to ask the Minister to fill in the following points. &nbsp;One, what are we doing to help those too poor even to afford the $400 meal plan?&nbsp; What are we doing in terms of infrastructure, for example?&nbsp; Do we have plans for a new welfare home?&nbsp; Can the Minister give an update on the current&nbsp;Boys Complex? What are we doing for persons with disabilities, in particular, those covered under the Enabling Masterplan?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I move on to the second bridge that&nbsp;we ought to build.&nbsp; Under Community 2015 Masterplan, the People's Association (PA), through its grassroots organisations, aims to reach out to one in two residents by 2015.&nbsp; This is up from the current one in three.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; how does PA intend to build on this very high base and whether they have the resources to do so?&nbsp; PA is an organisation that coordinates the work of grassroots leaders. These volunteers are supported by paid staff who worked very hard and often very long hours because volunteers only worked during non-office hours.&nbsp; So what is the turnover rate for PA staff in&nbsp;recent years?&nbsp; How do their salaries match up to the private sector?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to say that our efforts and those of the grassroots leaders have seen some success only because the residents themselves see each other as being part of the same community, regardless of race, language or religion. Recently, Prime Minister Lee commented </p>\r\n\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3996</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>that our Malay-Muslim community, and I quote, \"has made great efforts to integrate with the other communities and with Singapore society to join the mainstream.\"&nbsp; I certainly share Prime Minister's view.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, my Malay friends eat with me, shake hands with me and we speak in the same mix of English, Malay, <I>Hokkien</I> and Singlish too, that we do with all races.&nbsp; We have had four decades of National Service (NS), economic ups and downs and our children have been schooled in the same language and, by and large, they share the same world view. One of my best primary school friends is a Malay and our recent class reunion was a memorable one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the six Malay Activity ExCo (MAEC) in the Marine Parade GRC, we have Chinese, Indian and Eurasian members, jointly organising various programmes for the residents.&nbsp; That we have non-Malays in the MAEC speak of the openness of the community.&nbsp; My Youth ExCo&nbsp;&nbsp; (YEC) organised the screening of live matches during last year's World Cup in our Community Club.&nbsp; At wee hours of the morning, there were large&nbsp;crowds of residents of all races and ages, chatting with their neighbours, people whom may have stayed next door for years but they&nbsp;have never met.&nbsp; It was a great success. In fact, Senior Minister Goh came to join me and my grassroots leaders and residents for one of the quarter-final matches.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the team I supported lost that quarter-final match.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have digressed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music is another fine example to bond people.

They organise community</p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3998</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>events to increase community bonding among HDB dwellers.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we have more and more private estates. PA started to set up&nbsp;Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) from 1998 to organise events for private estate dwellers. There are 110 NCs currently.&nbsp; Usually, people think private estate dwellers are not interested in community bonding. That is not true. Recently, five NCs in Bukit Gombak jointly organised a Chinese New Year event at Hillview Avenue. Over 1,000 residents actively participated in the event. All the skits were produced and performed by residents themselves. The atmosphere was very jovial.&nbsp; This photo [<I>indicating</I> ] shows that the residents in private estates are equally involved in community activities for the purpose of community bonding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage NCs to organise events more proactively, I hope PA can assist them in the following three areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Provide funds to NCs so they can rent commercial space as their office; or to allocate some space in the CCs to be used as&nbsp; NCs' office;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Provide administrative staff to the NCs to handle administrative and financial issues; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Set aside more community activity fund to encourage NCs to organise more community events for private estate residents.</p>\r\n</P></span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Integration in HDB estates</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Madam, the social landscape in HDB estates has been changing over the last decade, with more foreigners and Permanent Residents (PRs)&nbsp;making their way into our heartlands and also foreign workers renting rooms or entire flats from HDB residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;While this introduces</p> \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4067-4068.<BR></div>\r\n <p align=\"left\">Column: 3999</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>culture diversity into our HDB neighbourhoods and may provide more opportunities for cross-cultural exchanges, it could potentially also be the source of tension should misunderstanding arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether there is a dispute resolution framework and mechanism in place to specially deal with neighbourhood disputes or culture misunderstanding involving Singaporeans and foreigners, or PRs in HDB estates should they arise.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, as we know, social integration can be a complex idea as it means different things to different people.

Now that we have foreigners entering into our heartlands equation, I believe we can extend the favourable experience we have enjoyed over the years to this new category of HDB dwellers as well.&nbsp; Ideally, it should behove us&nbsp;to prevent such misunderstanding from happening by implementing programmes at grassroots level to foster good neighbourly relations and deliberately involve them in our grassroots activities.&nbsp; Programmes such as culture evenings and savouring exotic dishes, which my constituency has organised several times in the past, proved beneficial and popular amongst the residents. The participants were proudly spoilt and present their national attires, the mainland Chinese would tell stories about the differences in their culture and practices from ours and the Indians would cook their best sumptuous dishes for us.&nbsp; When the concept of social integration is paid attention to and promoted, it enhances harmonious interaction and solidarity at all levels of society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, the opposite of integration is exclusion.

There is, however, a formal definition which will help to frame what I am going to say&nbsp;in my speech later. One American scholar, Prof. Robert Putnam, has used the term \"social capital\" to refer to features of social organisation such as networks, norms and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in Singapore, the Government firmly believes that racial and religious harmony is the foundation of our nation building, and we have made considerable progress in building a harmonious society since independence.&nbsp; The Prime Minister has recently reaffirmed the Government's position on this principle and acknowledged the good efforts by the various communities in building a cohesive and inclusive society.&nbsp; People's Association (PA) is a key builder of social capital since its formation in 1960.&nbsp;</p>\r\n \r\n <p  align=\"left\">Column: 4001</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Through nationwide Community Clubs, Community Centres and Residents' Committees,&nbsp;PA has been providing a common meeting place for every stock of Singaporeans to meet and mingle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;I know that&nbsp;PA already has a wide range&nbsp;of programmes and activities and, yet, each place and each ward has its own special stories to tell and showcase.&nbsp; We can take the lead in using PA to facilitate and also for the people themselves to decide the forms and shapes of their own community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in Radin Mas, where I serve, we have found great success in our&nbsp;educational tours. One concentrates on our heritage in Radin Mas,&nbsp;another on&nbsp;our environment, one more on our food, and the last one will take residents to places of interest in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents in Radin Mas learn about Kampong Radin Mas which is located&nbsp;at the foot of Mount Faber. We learn about the black and white bungalows, some of which exist in&nbsp;my ward.&nbsp; There are also places of worship such as temples, mosques and the Carmelite Monastery.&nbsp; So far, a few thousand people of different races and different faiths have joined these tours.&nbsp; Through them, we have had a better appreciation of each other's culture and history as well as the place we live in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;the People's Association is a vital part of this purpose because the organisation, the structure and the volunteers all come from the grassroots. At the same time, however, the idea for the heritage tour, the energy, the passion and the participation all come from the community itself.&nbsp; The gains in social capital, too, accrue almost totally to the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building social capital does not only confine to heritage, food and the environment.&nbsp; Arts and cultures are </p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4002</p>\r\n\r\n<p>additional conduits for such social bonding.&nbsp;Over the years, we have seen many parents sending their children to CCs&nbsp;and RCs to attend drawing classes, music lessons, ballet, dancing, etc.&nbsp; All these activities are themselves melting pots to make a Singaporean whole out of different races, languages and religions.&nbsp; The epitome of this is perhaps found in the lion dance troupe in the T-Net Club in my Radin Mas Constituency.&nbsp; For those who do not know what is T-Net Club, actually, they are set up under the People's Association.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, this T-Net Club forms a lion dance troupe for the children living in Henderson and Redhill&nbsp;areas.&nbsp; When I first attended its function in 2006, I was greeted by a children&nbsp;dance troupe.&nbsp; What made this&nbsp;dance troupe distinctive was that the drummer was a Chinese boy, the cymbal was played by a Malay girl.&nbsp; After the lion dance had completed its welcome routine, the two performers took down the lion head and the body to bow to the audience.&nbsp; It was then that I realised that the lion head was performed by an Indian boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, we know that it is quite an undertaking to perform a lion dance where the drum, the cymbals, the lion head and the lion body have to coordinate and synchronise in perfect harmony.&nbsp; It is difficult for the performers from the same race to achieve this unison, let alone a group of people from different ethnic origins.&nbsp; Yet, these youngsters, average of 10-15 years old, could master the delicate and complicated footwork and rhythm so seamlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;I see the much bigger promise of the future beyond the drawing lessons, music lessons and lion dances.&nbsp; In these young people,&nbsp;we see a new generation of Singaporeans less conscious of themselves through arts and cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association&nbsp;can be said to be the mother of social fusions for the new breed of <p  align=\"left\">Column: 4003</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Singaporeans.&nbsp; I, therefore, believe that more resources should be given to&nbsp;the People's Association&nbsp;so that it can play a more active and an effective role in building stronger social capital through arts, culture and heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I would like to make my final point and conclusion in Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110307/20110307VS_171252.pdf\"\">Appendix A*</a></I>.]&nbsp;In the past 40 years, racial relations in Singapore have undergone dramatic changes. In the 1960s, when I was still a child, I witnessed first-hand the racial riots. However, by the 1970s, as a teenager,&nbsp; I was serving National Service with Singaporeans of different races, training along with them. In the 1980s, when I was working in the community centres, I saw people of different races using the facilities of community centres and taking part in many activities organised by grassroots organisations.&nbsp; In the 1990s, we begin to see people of different races dining at the same table in food centres.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the year 2000, Singaporeans of different races not only take part in community activities and dine together, but also celebrate traditional festivals together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that many of my Parliamentary colleagues here have attended Gongxi-Raya or Deepa-Raya celebrations. These are not festivals originating from new races or newly-invented festivals, but the way two different cultures, different racial groups celebrate festivals together. Gongxi-Raya refers to the Chinese and Malays' joint celebration of Chinese New Year and Hari Raya while Deepa-Raya refers to the joint celebration of Indians' Deepavali and Malays' Hari Raya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this practice where people of different races celebrate festivals together</p>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4004</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>under the same roof, within the same space and time is not unique to Singapore, it is rarely seen in the rest of the world.

This is a \"heartware\" project and we must preserve and work for it tirelessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the beginning, the People's Association has always been an important catalyst in promoting racial and religious harmony. The community centres and Residents Committees under the People's Association have been hotbeds for nurturing community ties. Hence, I hope the People's Association can tell us what new plans they will be implementing in the next five years to further strengthen racial and religious harmony, to allow more residents to deepen their friendship through community centres and Residents Committees, so that Singapore, as a melting pot for different cultures, religion and traditions, can continue to shine even brighter.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower and Minister for Health (Mr Hawazi Daipi)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Building social capital</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower and Minister for Health (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> Madam, the network of grassroots leaders and organisations in the community is absolutely essential in building collective confidence, trust and strong relationship among people of diverse ethnic, religious and social interests.

When residents meet regularly, they make friends with their neighbours, grow their social network and build mutual trust and understanding.&nbsp; Through interest groups, courses and activities, we aim to bring residents from different backgrounds together to become friends.&nbsp; RCs and NCs are the basic building blocks of grassroots network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we visualise the desired outcome?&nbsp; Imagine a community where&nbsp;the more able&nbsp;helps the less well-off, a community where almost everyone knows each other.&nbsp; Imagine an entire street becoming a gathering space where neighbours and families interact and bond regularly over home-cooked food.&nbsp; An example of this is Springleaf Estate.&nbsp; Over the years, the Springleaf Neighbourhood Committee under its Chairman, Mr Wilson Zhuang, helped many of its residents become friends through a variety of activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraged by this, the Springleaf Neighbourhood Committee decided to marshal the residents to do something together.&nbsp; Through this combined effort, they set up two Ren Ai Traditional Medicine Centres (TCM) for the needy, </p>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4009</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>and run a monthly hot meal programme for the elderly and needy in collaboration with six RCs in Nee Soon South.&nbsp; They have inspired three other NCs to do the same.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Pasir Ris (West) Zone 12 RC, residents come together through regular activities and common interests.&nbsp; Over time, more and more residents and neighbours join in the community activities, and friendships deepened.&nbsp; For instance, a group of residents with a common interest in traditional food get together regularly to share recipes and prepare food for community events, such as floor parties, residents' pot luck gatherings and monthly free breakfast sessions for residents.&nbsp; The RC's Senior Executive Committee has also built up a membership of more than 2,500 seniors and a group of seniors who help to keep a look out for one another and for any seniors in need of help.&nbsp; Events and activities are often a family affair as the seniors bring along their family members, including their grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, over the years, RCs and NCs have adapted their programmes to better meet the needs and demographics of residents.&nbsp; With greater social diversity, the work of the RCs and NCs has expanded and has also become more challenging.&nbsp; With more residents living in private estates, NCs play an increasingly important role.&nbsp; But NCs cannot use the same strategies as those of RCs as these are somewhat different.&nbsp; To better support NCs, PA has formed a new NC Coordinating Unit to focus on this area, in addition to the existing RC Coordinating Unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng asked for more support for NCs.&nbsp; But we are engaging the NCs in continuous dialogue, and where the ideas are practical and doable, we will implement them.&nbsp; So we are listening to</p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the NCs and will take into account their requests and implement those that we think can be done.&nbsp; Having said that, just the other day in Parliament, I mentioned one active seniors' group in Helsinki, Finland, which gets together regularly to organise activities for themselves.&nbsp; The leader of that association complained to me that they received no government help, they do not have a centre but, yet, they are able to organise so many activities.&nbsp; So, when I reflected on it, I thought it is because of the lack of support from their government that this group has built up so much social capital amongst themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

So I think we ought to make better use of existing facilities in our work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, we are aware of the hard work that our grassroots leaders do and the hard work which the staff of PA do on the ground.&nbsp; The PA is&nbsp;piloting a new RC/NC Manager&nbsp;Scheme to better support RCs and NCs in their outreach efforts.&nbsp; They are also looking &nbsp;into expanding and upgrading RC centres to enhance them as common spaces for residents to interact and&nbsp;bond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from bringing Singaporeans together, our grassroots leaders have also been integrating newcomers. We have about 870 Integration and Naturalisation Champions (INCs) who organise activities to welcome new citizens and Permanent Residents&nbsp;(PRs) and encourage them to participate in activities so that they get to know their neighbours better.&nbsp; Last year, the INCs engaged 20,000 PRs and new citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some new&nbsp;immigrants have become activists themselves. A good example is Mr Zhang Chun Hua, aged 40, an IT analyst who came to Singapore from </p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4011</p>\r\n<p>China in 1996, and in 2007 he became a Singapore citizen.&nbsp; Through participation in&nbsp;grassroots activities, his social circle expanded.&nbsp; Having experienced the grassroots&nbsp;integration efforts&nbsp;first-hand, he offered to set up the Kampong Chai Chee Linear Green RC in 2009 to help others widen their social network and discover the joy of volunteer work.&nbsp; Through his&nbsp;outreach, several new members, both Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, have joined the RC.&nbsp; Some of these new immigrants&nbsp;also became INCs, organising programmes and activities to welcome other new immigrants and helping them integrate into the community.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;20% of INCs today are new citizens or Permanent Residents.&nbsp; Many of them find grassroots work meaningful and enjoy contributing to the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr&nbsp;Ahmad Magad asked about the tensions between neighbours, locals and newcomers.&nbsp; He said that we should take pre-emptive steps to prevent disputes and mentioned how his own grassroots leaders do&nbsp;so.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;the work that our grassroots leaders do will keep such disputes in check.&nbsp; Our RCs have organised many activities to bring people together, and one example&nbsp;are the floor parties. &nbsp;I have attended many of these.&nbsp; At these parties, it is often&nbsp;the new immigrants who bring along their traditional dish and that&nbsp;in itself becomes a conversation piece.&nbsp; So we need more activities like that to bring people of different backgrounds, including our new residents, together to mix with Singaporeans so as to&nbsp;dispel the misunderstanding that may arise between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second&nbsp;thrust is about connecting youth and the community.&nbsp;We aim&nbsp;to engage our youths and connect them with the community early, getting the youths to reach out and attract more youths; and encourage them not to just to do things for youths but also contribute to the wider community.&nbsp; We&nbsp;engage youths through</p> \r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the PA's Youth Movement, and it&nbsp;has 307,000 members and a network of CC Youth Executive Committees, the&nbsp;PA's Youth Movement&nbsp;Service Learning Clubs, and the Friends of&nbsp;the PA's Youth Movement with&nbsp;the Institutes of Higher Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; PA is also actively forming Youth Chapters at the RCs and NCs, to encourage more youths to step forward as leaders and volunteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there are about 5,400 youths serving as grassroots leaders.&nbsp; Last year, over a thousand youths joined.&nbsp; Many more served as volunteers and project leaders.&nbsp; More young professionals are serving in the grassroots organisations despite their busy schedules.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;Ms Regina Chong Puay Ling,&nbsp;Assistant Vice President of a financial services&nbsp;firm, who&nbsp;helped&nbsp;to integrate environmental initiatives with local elderly programmes at Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Constituency. They have a project called \"Project Switch\", which teaches the seniors to learn how to read their electricity bills and&nbsp;reduce their electricity consumption. And through this activity, the seniors make friends with one another. Ms Regina Chong also mentors members of a&nbsp;school-based PA's Youth Movement Service Learning Club.&nbsp; One of them, Mr&nbsp;Dion Lim Huan Xiang, who&nbsp;joined the Outram Secondary School Service Learning Club in 2006 and has since progressed to become an active grassroots leader serving in the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng YEC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third thrust is about building an active community.&nbsp; We want to strengthen our community of volunteers and work with more partners.&nbsp; PA has developed a leadership development framework for our pool of 31,000 grassroots leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The framework is based on&nbsp;three key pillars. First, to inspire, motivate and fuel the passion of our grassroots leaders and volunteers in building social capital. Second, to align them with the community's vision, grassroots' mission and national policies, so that they</p>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4013</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>understand their role in the wider context. Third, to develop their capabilities and equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out their role effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on this framework, PA offers a range of training and development programmes through its two training arms, namely, the National Community Leadership Institute and the Outward Bound Singapore.&nbsp; PA is also reviewing the competencies of grassroots leaders and will be updating&nbsp;its programmes to further strengthen the capabilities of our grassroots leaders and volunteers.&nbsp; And there are also programmes specifically tailored for youth leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, Members have said that we should do more to recognise and reward the efforts of grassroots leaders. Indeed, we should commend them for their sacrifices and contributions. From my experience,&nbsp;grassroots leaders join the grassroots out of the desire to serve and contribute to the community. They derive satisfaction from the volunteer work itself, and the sense of fulfilment when they see the difference that they make in the community.&nbsp; They derive satisfaction also from seeing Government services improve after their feedback.&nbsp; PA can never offer anything to match that. We have some recognition schemes which the Members know very well.&nbsp; And these are tokens of our appreciation for them, and I do not think I need to detail them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the constituency level, I would urge the advisors to commend the grassroots volunteers for their service through local awards, or simply a word of thanks.&nbsp; Today, the PA and its grassroots organisations reach out to&nbsp;one in&nbsp;three residents. Under the Community 2015 Masterplan, we aim to reach out to&nbsp;one in&nbsp;two residents by 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Seah Kian Peng asked if the Community 2015 Masterplan is an achievable one because of the high target that is set.&nbsp; These are early days but our grassroots leaders now have a very clear target to work on.&nbsp; They will widen our outreach and deepen resident engagement through&nbsp;a wide variety of programmes, platforms and interests.&nbsp; These include small scale activities such as&nbsp;floor parties and interest groups as well as in mass scale&nbsp;high point events and programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, our grassroots leaders need to realise that their role is to help people do things for themselves. Grassroots leaders are volunteers and cannot be the only ones organising activities for the residents. The bigger role of grassroots leaders is that of a facilitator&nbsp;&ndash; helping residents to organise activities for themselves&nbsp;&ndash; and residents can organise activities in collaboration with their RCs and NCs. And the RCs and NCs should also work with other organisations in their neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that sports, arts and culture and heritage are good platforms to help us build social capital.&nbsp; Apart from helping residents stay active and healthy, community sports provide opportunities for residents to widen their network of friends and be socially connected.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2010, about 600,000 participants took part in Constituency Sports Club activities.&nbsp; The World Cup 2010 screening at community clubs and activities related to the Singapore Youth Olympic Games attracted some 200,000 residents.&nbsp; And&nbsp;the popularity of brisk walking and <I>qiqong</I> clubs, where small groups of residents come together to exercise and to bond, also demonstrates&nbsp;the potential of community sports as a way to bring people together and to make friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen very encouraging success when community clubs are developed together with sports and recreation centres, such as the Senja-</p>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cashew CC and the Anchorvale CC with the sports and recreation club. There is much higher participation. We are developing the Tampines Town Hub CC, which is on a bigger scale, and we are likely to see a few such Town Hub CCs built in the future.&nbsp; And this is&nbsp;a place where the entire family can come and participate in activities, either separately or jointly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of arts and culture, our grassroots organisations and the CDCs have done a great job so far.&nbsp; Not only have CCs and RCs run thousands of classes in the arts, several groups have achieved high standards.&nbsp; For example, the Mus'Art&nbsp;Youth Wind&nbsp;Orchestra&nbsp;from Jurong Green CC.&nbsp; In 2009, the Orchestra&nbsp;emerged first in the first division of the 16th World Music Contest in&nbsp;Holland. My grassroots leaders and I are very proud of them.&nbsp; There are many other excellent performing groups in the CCs, such as the Marine Parade CC Cantonese Opera&nbsp;Group, Pasir Ris Elias CC Chinese Orchestra, Sembawang CC Wind Orchestra and the&nbsp;Braddell Heights CC Symphonic Orchestra, just to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the national level, the Chingay Parade organised by PA&nbsp;is an important high point event in our annual calendar.&nbsp; The parade provides a platform for people of different races and backgrounds to come together to perform, express their artistic talents and&nbsp;celebrate cultures, contributing to&nbsp;building of social capital. This year's Chingay Parade involved more than 8,000 passionate volunteer performers from&nbsp;over 100 organisations, including CCs, grassroots organisations, CDCs, athlete and religious groups, schools and tertiary institutions. They also include participants from foreign communities here, like the Japanese, Mexican and German&nbsp;communities.&nbsp;The parade featured the largest ever Malay, Indian and youth contingents led by their respective PA grassroots councils. &nbsp;Many other segments of the community, including women and</p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>seniors, also took part, showcasing Chingay as a truly community and people's parade.&nbsp; By&nbsp;the way, the Malay contingent won the top Chingay award this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, PA is working with MICA, NAC and other partners to bring arts, culture and heritage to the community, and to better leverage on arts, culture and heritage as a means to build social capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked how we measure social capital and a national identity. They are&nbsp;two different concepts. I believe that&nbsp;a community with high social capital and strong sense of belonging ultimately contributes to a stronger national identity. PA will be conducting regular social capital surveys beginning 2010, based on the four components of social capital. We hope to build on our understanding of the state of social capital in Singapore through these surveys.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The Singapore Muslim community is special, self-confident and is always calm and rational in the face of any issues, even those that shake the community.&nbsp; This was evident in the face of the 9/11 incident and the detention of the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) members.

And this has brought benefits to nearby residents, regardless of race or religion.&nbsp; The Malay community has spent years building trust with the Government.

These have helped our Singapore society to become more cohesive.&nbsp; Singapore stands out as an icon of integration and harmonious living. That is one of the reasons why Malay/Muslim Singaporeans feel hurt when they are seen as not doing enough for integration. It hurts even more when their religion, Islam, is said to be the cause. While they acknowledge that there are those who see Islam through a narrow interpretation and might not facilitate better mixing and integration, Islam should not be blamed. That was why Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's position was well-received when he welcomed the positive role of the Malay/Muslim community towards progress and integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, more than just the question of integration, there are still Malay/Muslim Singaporeans who fear that when the economy shrinks, they would be the first to be affected.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B> Madam, the Malay/Muslim community of today lives in a fast-changing environment. Despite the challenges, Members would be pleased to know that our community has achieved significant progress on many fronts.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mr Masagos Zulkifli and Mr Zaqy Mohamad&nbsp;have asked about this progress. 2010 saw strong economic growth of 14.5%. Just as our community bore the earlier recession with resilience, so have we reaped the benefits of the recovery. Better job opportunities are available to those who are willing to undergo training.&nbsp; About 12,700 training places under MENDAKI's Job Steady Programme were taken up in 2010. MENDAKI's Job Ready programme also assisted about 3,700 jobseekers in re-employment.&nbsp; I am also happy to note that <I>Zakat</I> collection grew by 7% from 2009 to 2010, with a total of $22.7 million collected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our community has also done well in education. The proportion of Malays aged 15 and over with at least post-secondary qualification has doubled from 18% in 2000 to 36% in 2010. And the statistics released by MOE showed Malay students had shown the greatest improvement over the past 10 years in their performance at the GCE \"A\" Level examinations. Better academic results will give our youth&nbsp;a good head start to career-development and family-life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed asked about keeping the Malay/Muslim community competitive. Overall, Madam, we are </p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4091-4092.<BR></div>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4029</p>\r\n\r\n<p>progressing well. However, there are still challenges. Education and the family will always be&nbsp;our priority. Skills upgrading for greater competitiveness should be a continuous endeavour. We will continue to listen to feedback and work together in the spirit of <I>gotong-royong</I> to achieve even greater heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stable and resilient families are crucial in preventing wider social problems arising. I am pleased to report that Muslim divorces have gone down by about 17% over the last five years. The preliminary figure for 2010 is 1,626 divorces, down from 1,944 in 2006.&nbsp; But we must not rest on our laurels. In a recent study on Muslim marriages, MCYS found that about half of the divorces involved couples who were 21 to 29 years old&nbsp;at the point of marriage. Twenty-five percent of female divorcees and 8% of male divorcees were below 21 years at the point of marriage. Those who were previously divorced or did not attend marriage preparation courses were also more prone to divorce. Such findings help shape our constant efforts to foster strong marriages and families in the Malay/Muslim community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Dr Mohamad Faishal asked about efforts to strengthen Malay/Muslim families in recent times. In 2010, more than 2,000 participants attended <I>Bersama Mu</I> (\"With You\"), a course aimed at helping couples transit smoothly into marriage and parenthood that has received positive feedback. A series of customised marriage enrichment programmes rolled out in 2010 as an extension to <I>Bersama Mu</I> was also well received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To underscore the importance of marriage preparation, MCYS launched a public education campaign in May 2010 featuring a two-episode drama entitled \"Mr Pakar\" (\"Mr Expert\"). The five \"Mr </p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4030</p>\r\n<p>Pakar\" episodes subsequently uploaded on Facebook generated many \"likes\", indicating that young couples can relate to the marriage and parenting issues facing Mr Pakar's family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef asked about disadvantaged families. Among these, minor marriages especially continue to be a source of concern. Since 2006, the number of minor marriages and divorces involving minor marriages have dropped by 35%, and 26% respectively. While the situation is improving, we must not let up&nbsp;on our efforts.&nbsp; The INSPIRASI hubs operated by PPIS Family Service Centre (West) and the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) help minor couples.&nbsp; In 2010, more than 40% of the 307 couples who attended premarital counselling at the INSPIRASI hubs either delayed or cancelled their marriage. Strengthening existing minor marriages is also a focus. As the first five years of marriage are often the most vulnerable, Club INSPIRASI in 2010 handheld 447 such minor couples through structured&nbsp;activities to sustain their marriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconstituted families, too, are vulnerable as remarriages involving divorcees are more likely to end up in divorce. Such families now have access to a range of related social services in PPIS Vista Sakinah's permanent premises at Woodlands Drive 44, officially opened on 15th January&nbsp;this year. Vista Sakinah runs a programme to help remarrying couples' children transit into the new family. During its one year of operation as an interim centre, 680 families benefited from its services and 247 remarrying couples attended Program Memupuk Kasih (PMK), a specialised course to help them handle the stressors in a remarriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial difficulties often affect disadvantaged families. To manage these challenges, families can tap on nationwide social service programmes, such as the Healthy Start Programme for low-income</p>\r\n <p  align=\"left\">Column: 4031</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n <p>families with children of age six and below. &nbsp;A social assistance project will be piloted this year in the MacPherson neighbourhood to help low-income Malay/Muslim residents in a more targeted manner. MENDAKI, the South East Community Development Council (SE CDC), and South East Enhanced Mosque Cluster under MUIS will work with social service professionals on a collaborative model based on MENDAKI's Enhanced Wrap Around Care concept. The team will undertake structured case consultations to effectively uplift the lives of the needy. A similar project in the North East involving MENDAKI, North East CDC and the Tampines Family Service Centre will also be launched this April to serve the residents there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultivating a strong sense of community spirit is another way to buttress support for families in need. Mr Zainudin&nbsp;Nordin asked about the Community Leaders' Forum Labs&nbsp;(CLF Labs). Madam, CLF Labs will be piloting the Mobile Hub for Community Learning in partnership with MENDAKI in three neighbourhoods in the north. The 20 families involved will be introduced to resources that promote learning and building resilient families. With heightened neighbourliness through the Mobile Hub, it is possible for us to revive the \"urban kampong spirit\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institutional efforts to help the Malay/Muslim community build stable, resilient and nurturing families have seen positive results. But we also need greater moral courage to bring attention to cases that otherwise fall through the cracks, such as the child abuse cases that Dr Ahmad Magad noted in his speech at the Budget debate. Families should not hesitate nor be embarrassed to seek help when necessary. I am confident that with more feedback, further public outreach and improvement of existing hardware, we can continue to bring down the</p> \r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4032</p>\r\n\r\n<p>number of divorces, minor marriages and dysfunctional families. &nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the age profile of the Malay/Muslim community is the youngest among the main ethnic groups in Singapore, with 32% below 19 years of age.&nbsp; Our youth are a valuable talent pool whose educational attainment has been steadily improving.&nbsp; I urge more young people to step forward to bring the community to greater heights. Besides developing young talents, it is also crucial to reach out to vulnerable youth before they succumb to negative influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Mohamad Maliki asked about the empowerment of Malay boys and girls. MENDAKI's Empowerment Programme for Girls (EPG) has reached out to Secondary&nbsp;2 girls in the Normal stream since 2008.&nbsp; Madam, I am&nbsp;happy to report that 95% of our EPG girls are progressing into post-secondary education, surpassing&nbsp;our anticipated target of 75%.&nbsp; The 317 girls in EPG were involved in dialogue sessions, interest groups and community projects. Women professionals volunteered as role models for these girls to set future career aspirations. The girls emerged with clearer purposes in life and higher self-esteem. Sarah (not her real name) is one EPG girl who transformed from a rebellious teenager to a motivated young lady.&nbsp; Now, she finds meaning in committing time to family, school, dance, part-time work and EPG activities.&nbsp; She and others in the pioneer batch are encouraged to return and volunteer in MENDAKI's programmes.&nbsp; We will continue to evaluate the programme's outcomes to ensure that the girls take away valuable life skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the EPG's positive experience, I am pleased to announce that MENDAKI will be officially launching a parallel programme for boys known as the Engagement Programme for Boys (EPB) in March 2011. &nbsp;The EPB will pilot with 100</p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4033</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>secondary boys from various schools, providing them with a platform to continue their education, engage in enriching activities, and develop wholesome values.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of youth development, experienced leaders should also help guide younger leaders in order to facilitate smoother leadership transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zaqy Mohamad&nbsp;talked about MUIS leadership renewal.&nbsp; The former Mufti, Shaikh Syed Isa Semait, is a good example of a leader who has focused on developing talent, such as through inviting more young people to be associate members of the <I>Fatwa</I> Committee. Shaikh Syed Isa also helped mentor our current Mufti, Dr Mohamad Fatris Bakaram, over the last seven years before the official changeover this year. The synergy between old and new leaders can help an organisation move with the times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is heartening to see more younger leaders taking the helm in mosques and other Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs).&nbsp; Ain Society is a good example. It is now led by a new President, 37-year-old Mr Abdul Malek Osman, and a new management committee whose members are between 22 and 35 years of age.&nbsp; So I urge leaders of various sectors to engage the young and make them committed stakeholders of our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I now&nbsp;turn to our community's religious institutions.&nbsp; Mosques, as noted by several speakers, are important support pillars and we will continue to ensure that they cater to our religious needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I announced that there will be two new mosques in Jurong West and Woodlands.&nbsp; Since then, MUIS and MCYS have been working with MND and URA to secure suitable sites.&nbsp; In response to Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mr Hawazi Daipi's&nbsp</p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4034</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>queries on mosque building plans, today, I am happy to provide more details on the two new mosques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Jurong West mosque will be located near the junction of Jurong West Avenue 2 and Jalan Bahar, easily accessible from PIE and Boon Lay MRT station.&nbsp; It will serve residents in Jurong West and Pioneer, workers from the Jurong Industrial Estate and the planned Wenya Industrial Estate, and students from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), thereby easing crowds at Assaykirin mosque.&nbsp; This mosque is expected to be built in 2014/2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the new mosque in Woodlands, the advisors and I have agreed on the area to the south of Woodlands Avenue 5 and bounded by Woodlands Avenue 2 and Avenue 12, based on ground feedback from MUIS that this would best serve the residents of Woodlands. This mosque is also expected to be built within 2014/2015.&nbsp; MUIS will continue to work with technical agencies, advisors and grassroots leaders on the exact site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi&nbsp;asked about our efforts to strengthen religious institutions. Under the Enhanced Mosque Clusters (EMCs), the South East cluster and North East cluster were set up in 2008 to decentralise the social assistance function previously done by MUIS.&nbsp; Assistance through EMCs is holistically improving the lives of <I>zakat</I> recipients, helping them to become self-reliant. I am pleased to report that both clusters have achieved good progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Befrienders play a key role in guiding <I>zakat</I>-receiving families towards self-reliance. A total of 344 active Befrienders are helping 500 such families, with 50 of them trained under a programme started in 2010.&nbsp; MUIS will also introduce a Befrienders Management Framework for improved effectiveness. Our volunteers </p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4035</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>complement the extensive partnership between the EMCs and national and community agencies to ensure that needy families receive appropriate assistance.&nbsp; I hope more people will step forward to volunteer with the EMCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the EMCs' journey has not always been smooth.&nbsp; However, MUIS has continuously refined their approach based on ground concerns and mosque leaders have also seen the benefits brought about by the EMCs.&nbsp; Hence, at the Mosque Convention 2011, we will consolidate the feedback for further improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, Mr Masagos Zulkifli and Mr Zaqy Mohamad&nbsp;have raised issues of integration.&nbsp; Earlier, Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Sam Tan have also touched on the issue of integration. These are sensitive but important issues, and I thank Members for raising them.&nbsp; Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious nation where integration is a continuous process.&nbsp; Progress by all communities, including Malay/Muslims, has been good. There will occasionally be hiccups and sometimes, feelings are hurt when perspectives differ on sensitive issues that we hold dear.&nbsp; But we should not let such hiccups hold us back.&nbsp; As the Malay proverb goes, \"<I>Bulat air kerana pembentung, Bulat masyarakat kerana muafakat</I> \", the Malay/Muslim community will remain together with fellow Singaporeans, through thick and thin, as one people and nation committed to peace and progress.&nbsp; Indeed, there is much for our community to be proud of which we have achieved together.&nbsp; And we redoubled outreach efforts following 9/11 to forge even stronger ties with fellow communities.&nbsp;Under MUIS' leadership, our mosques are active members of the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs), hosting many inter-faith dialogues on mosque grounds.&nbsp; These sessions have helped build understanding and respect among various religious </p>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4036</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>communities.&nbsp; As a result, in my considered view, today, our integration and mutual confidence between races and religions is stronger, more resilient and more mature than it was a decade ago, before 9/11.&nbsp; In pursuing integration, we affirm our Singaporean Muslim Identity which encapsulates our way of life, and our aspirations to be an open, forward-looking and&nbsp;successful community.&nbsp; Our Prime Minister has stated clearly the Government's appreciation for the Malay/Muslim community's efforts, and its strong support for these efforts.&nbsp; I am therefore confident that the community will continue to work closely with the Government and other communities to strengthen our national cohesion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in closing, let me thank the Members for their questions. I would like to emphasise that the Malay/Muslim community is doing well in areas such as education and employment. The community's untiring efforts are bearing fruit.&nbsp; Mr Masagos Zulkifli asked about plans to enhance and strengthen the Malay Muslim Organisations (MMOs).&nbsp; MMOs like MENDAKI, which is turning 30 in 2012, have played a key role in helping the community achieve the good results so far.&nbsp; Ahead of this anniversary, it would be timely for MENDAKI, together with the community, to reflect on the areas that MENDAKI has done well in, the challenges facing our community that many years of work have yet to solve and the new global developments to adapt to.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from the community on this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, now allow me to address the House in Malay.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Dr Yaacob, before you proceed in Malay, let me extend the time for sitting so that you will not be interrupted and we can have time for clarifications, if any.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->\r\n\r\n <p  align=\"left\">Column: 4037</p>\r\n     \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:EXTENSION OF A SITTING-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EXTENSION OF A SITTING<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Committee of Supply-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Committee of Supply)<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Order.&nbsp; Pursuant to Standing Order No. 2(5)(d), I propose to extend the time of this day's Committee sitting for a period of up to 30 minutes.

This performance has been achieved through hard work and the desire to gain knowledge and pursue progress. These concerted efforts have placed our community on the right track for further progress.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In working towards sustained and comprehensive progress at all levels of the community, Malay/Muslim families continue to place emphasis on education and reducing our school dropout rates. Initiatives such as the Empowerment Programme for Girls (EPG) run by MENDAKI have succeeded in reducing the dropout rate. Resulting from the success of EPG, MENDAKI will introduce an </p>\r\n\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4038</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engagement Programme for Boys (EPB), beginning March this year. This programme is intended to help male students to be more diligent in education and to imbibe positive values in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, besides education, the Malay/Muslim community is also concerned about the importance of efforts to strengthen the institution of the family. To help this group get out of its vicious circle, MENDAKI will be introducing a programme called Enhanced Wrap-Around Care together with the Southeast CDC and Northeast CDC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On religious institution matters, MUIS will continue to ensure that all the religious needs are taken care of.&nbsp; Last year, I announced that two additional mosques will be built in Woodlands and Jurong West.&nbsp; The new mosque in Jurong West will be built at the junction of Jurong West Avenue 2 and Jalan Bahar.&nbsp; It is expected to be built in 2014/2015. The new mosque in Woodlands is expected to be built in the area bounded by Woodlands Avenue 2 and Woodlands Avenue 12 and it is also expected to be built in 2014/2015. The two mosques are expected to offer synergy in terms of facilities and collaboration with community bodies in their respective neighbourhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Malay/Muslim community has, for so long, built close ties with the other communities.&nbsp; Indeed, since the 9/11 tragedy, we have further enhanced our relationship with other communities through programmes conducted by MUIS, Malay/Muslim organisations and the mosques. The Malay/Muslim community is able to practise the teachings of Islam and at the same time, be open and respectful of the other communities.&nbsp; Our efforts towards integration are affirmed by our Prime Minister.&nbsp; I am confident that the Malay/Muslim community will step up their efforts together with the Government and the other communities to further strengthen national solidarity.</p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 4093-4096.<BR></div>\r\n<p  align=\"left\">Column: 4039</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Malay/Muslim community has always worked hard to overcome any issue or challenge and to raise its level of achievement.&nbsp; We carry out these efforts together as one big family.&nbsp; I am touched by the commitment shown by community leaders, parents, workers and students to further their achievements and to build a stronger foundation for the sake of the future of our children.
