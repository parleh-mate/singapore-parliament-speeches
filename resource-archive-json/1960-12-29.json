Member for Hong Lim drew my attention\r\n\r\nto  that  day's  Straits Times  containing  what  he\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  an account of that day's proceedings,\r\n\r\nthat is to say, the proceedings in the matter of the\r\n\r\nmotion  moved  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   in\r\n\r\nrelation to that Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article in question was captioned. \"Ong must\r\n\r\ncite law to back his motion\". The Member referred to\r\n\r\ntwo paragraphs therein and invited my opinion as  to\r\n\r\nwhether - to  quote  his words - \"any  of  the  passages\r\n\r\nreferred to is a matter which is sub judice\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then expressed the opinion that there was no\r\n\r\nmatter which could be considered sub judice at  that\r\n\r\nmoment, the expression \"sub judice\" being used  with\r\n\r\nreference  to a court of law. Hon. Members  will  of\r\n\r\ncourse know, for example, that under Standing  Order\r\n\r\nNo.  19  relating to the contents of  questions,  no\r\n\r\nquestion may be asked which reflects on the decision\r\n\r\nof  a court of law and no question shall be asked on\r\n\r\nany  matter  which is sub judice;  and  again  under\r\n\r\nStanding  Order No. 46 relating to the  contents  of\r\n\r\nspeeches,  reference cannot be made  to  any  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  is  sub judice except by means of or  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of consideration of a Bill when reference may\r\n\r\nbe  made, but only in such a way as will not, in the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  the Speaker or Chairman, prejudice  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of parties thereto. I might add  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  application of those Standing Orders  the  term\r\n\r\n\"sub judice\" has been construed to have reference to\r\n\r\nmatters  pending  in  a  court  of  law  and  in   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then Member for Hong Lim, however, in response\r\n\r\nto  my  enquiry, stated that he wished to raise  his\r\n\r\npoint as a matter of privilege, drawing my attention\r\n\r\nto  the fact that the report was contained not  only\r\n\r\nin the Straits Times but also in other newspapers. I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that the fact that the same report or\r\n\r\narticle  is  contained in more  than  one  newspaper\r\n\r\ncould  make any difference to a ruling as to whether\r\n\r\nthere has been any breach of privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passages quoted by the then Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim as being in breach of privilege of this Assembly\r\n\r\nare-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This right has been admitted in the case of the\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Commons and in all Legislatures patterned\r\n\r\nafter it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  right  referred to has reference to  the  right\r\n\r\nmentioned in the article in the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassages immediately preceding the passage quoted.\r\n\r\nThese two passages read as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Ong's motion not only asks the House to\r\n\r\nrescind the Speaker's ruling but also claims that\r\n\r\nthe Assembly has no powers either to condemn him or\r\n\r\nseek his suspension if he does not apologise or\r\n\r\nrepeat outside the Assembly the \"malicious\r\n\r\nfalsehoods\" he is accused of having made in the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It, in effect, challenges the constitutional\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  the Legislature  has  the  inherent\r\n\r\nright,   as   stated  in  Standing  Order   56,   of\r\n\r\n\"proceeding  against  any member  according  to  any\r\n\r\nresolution of the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that is to say, the second passage\r\n\r\nquoted  by  the  then  Member for  Hong  Lim  is  as\r\n\r\nfollows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Last Monday, the Speaker ruled that under Standing\r\n\r\nOrders the Assembly had powers to discuss the motion\r\n\r\nand,  if  the  evidence warranted it,  to  find  the\r\n\r\nmember guilty of `dishonourable conduct'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that the Assembly had inherent powers,\r\n\r\nshould a member be found guilty, to suspend or  even\r\n\r\nexpel him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the first passage, it is apparent that\r\n\r\nit  merely purported to be an analysis of the  legal\r\n\r\nposition which in fact had been urged by the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister in his speech delivered when he moved\r\n\r\nthe  motion, as is apparent in the next  passage  in\r\n\r\nthe article in question which reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Dr Toh, in his speech on Monday, had cited cases\r\n\r\nto show that the Singapore Assembly had these rights\r\n\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second passage, it appears to be\r\n\r\na  paraphrase  of  what I myself  said,  albeit  not\r\n\r\nexactly  a  complete  or  accurate  paraphrase.  The\r\n\r\npassage  has been taken out of context and  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in the light of the following  paragraph\r\n\r\nwhich reads:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"However, he expressed doubts as to what extent the\r\n\r\nextreme powers of expulsion and suspension could  be\r\n\r\nexercised by the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the then Member for Hong Lim in drawing my\r\n\r\nattention to the passages quoted by him and by using\r\n\r\nthe  term  \"sub  judice\" sought to  infer  that  the\r\n\r\npassages are in the nature of comment calculated  to\r\n\r\nprejudice  the proceedings pending on the motion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister, then I am bound  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  disagree;  I take the view  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing in those passages, more especially when  not\r\n\r\nread  out of context, which can be said to have that\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must not be taken to mean that I am ruling\r\n\r\nthat  any  person who publishes any matter which  is\r\n\r\nprejudicial  to proceedings pending in the  Assembly\r\n\r\nmust  necessarily be in breach of the privileges  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. Such a publication must, to my  mind,\r\n\r\nfirst  fall  within the mischief of the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  (Powers  and Privileges) Ordinance,  1955,\r\n\r\nwhich   in   section  24  specifically   makes   the\r\n\r\npublication  of certain statements and  writings  an\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, therefore, I cannot say that there\r\n\r\nhas  been  prima  facie any breach of  privilege  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the matters raised by the then  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim and do not therefore propose  to  take\r\n\r\nany further action in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRESS PUBLICATION STATEMENT BY WORKERS PARTY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> My attention has been drawn to a\r\n\r\nstatement purported to be issued by the chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Workers Party and published in the Straits Times\r\n\r\nof  Saturday,  December 24th, 1960.

I went\r\n\r\non  to say that if the House was satisfied that  the\r\n\r\nconduct of the hon. Member for Hong Lim was such  as\r\n\r\nto  be an affront to its own dignity and prestige in\r\n\r\nthe  sense inter alia that that conduct had  brought\r\n\r\ndiscredit  to  the  House as a whole - not  merely  to\r\n\r\nindividual  Members of the Government  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nParty or indeed to any other Member of the House  or\r\n\r\nto  persons  outside the House - then the House  might\r\n\r\nfeel itself justified in condemning or censuring the\r\n\r\nhon.   Member   for  Hong  Lim  and  thereafter   in\r\n\r\nproceeding  to  consider what punishment,  consonant\r\n\r\nwith  its  powers,  it should mete  out  to  him.

The consolidated rate  payable\r\n\r\nin  respect of properties in the City area is now 36\r\n\r\nper cent and section 7 of the Property Tax Ordinance\r\n\r\nlays  down  that the property tax payable each  year\r\n\r\nshall be at this same rate of 36 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some areas outside the City limits are, however,\r\n\r\npaying rates at less than 36 per cent applicable  to\r\n\r\nthe  City  area.  It is intended  to  continue  this\r\n\r\npractice of charging lower rates for rural areas and\r\n\r\nthe  first proviso to section 7 enables the Minister\r\n\r\nto  direct that the rate or tax in such areas  shall\r\n\r\nbe such rate or rate less than 36 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax proposals for 1961 are briefly as\r\n\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, properties within City limits are\r\n\r\nassessed at 36 per cent and properties in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  are assessed at 14 per cent, 18 per cent,  20\r\n\r\nper cent, 23 per cent, or 36 per cent consolidated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrates. Instead of this multiplicity of rates,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  only  three  rates  of  Property  Tax  for\r\n\r\noccupied  lands, which will be 36 per cent,  27  per\r\n\r\ncent and 18 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properties at present paying 36 per cent rates\r\n\r\nwill continue to pay 36 per cent Property Tax on the\r\n\r\nannual  value  ascribed to the property.  There  are\r\n\r\ncertain areas which previously were outside the City\r\n\r\nlimits  but  which have been brought into  the  City\r\n\r\narea  by  the Local Government Ordinance,  1957,  as\r\n\r\ndefined in the First Schedule to the Ordinance. They\r\n\r\ncomprise  largely the areas at Pasir Panjang,  Buona\r\n\r\nVista,  Ulu  Pandan, Holland Road and  Ulu  Kallang.\r\n\r\nThese  areas were assessed at 23 per cent when  they\r\n\r\nwere in the rural areas and the assessment of 23 per\r\n\r\ncent  was continued, although they were brought into\r\n\r\nthe  City limits with the coming into force  of  the\r\n\r\nLocal Government Ordinance. These areas will now pay\r\n\r\nthe rate of 36 per cent instead of 23 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a number of housing estates in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas which pay 23 per cent assessment.  They\r\n\r\nare  Adelphi  Park,  Sembawang Hill,  Thomson  Rise,\r\n\r\nWindsor Park, Serangoon Garden, Seletar Hill,  Opera\r\n\r\nEstate,  Spring  and Bedok Estates,  Hongkong  Park,\r\n\r\nBukit Timah Park and King Albert Park. These housing\r\n\r\nestates  have enjoyed urban facilities as  lighting,\r\n\r\nwater, roads and so forth, and will therefore pay 36\r\n\r\nper cent rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 27 per cent rate areas will include areas at\r\n\r\npresent paying 19 per cent, 20 per cent and  23  per\r\n\r\ncent.

The rate for vacant  lands  is  at\r\n\r\npresent 36 per cent for properties in the City  area\r\n\r\nand this 36 per cent for vacant lands will apply  to\r\n\r\nthe 36 per cent areas for 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate for vacant lands in the 27 per cent and\r\n\r\n18  per cent areas will be at 18 per cent and 12 per\r\n\r\ncent respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the proposals will be gazetted shortly\r\n\r\nand  a  plan  will be made available for  inspection\r\n\r\nshowing the rates applicable to the whole Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals are not final and the public will\r\n\r\nbe  given an opportunity up to 31st March, 1961,  to\r\n\r\nmake representations regarding the inclusion of  any\r\n\r\nparticular  area  or locality in one  of  the  three\r\n\r\nrates of tax proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated in my Budget Statement that the\r\n\r\npresent   practice   of   assessing   owner-occupied\r\n\r\nproperties on favourable terms is irregular and that\r\n\r\nit  is  intended to stop this practice. However,  in\r\n\r\norder  not  to  penalise  owner-occupiers  of  small\r\n\r\nproperties, the rates of taxation will be  fixed  at\r\n\r\nless  than the general rate. It will obviously  take\r\n\r\nsome  time for the owner-occupied houses to  be \r\n\r\nre-valued  at the proper values. Until the re-valuation\r\n\r\nof  these  properties  has  been  completed, \r\n\r\nowner-occupiers will continue to pay property rates at the\r\n\r\nproposed   rates   on  present  values.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nprovision  is  also  made in respect  of  industrial\r\n\r\npremises   in   order  to  ensure  that   industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings are not hampered through the  operation\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to withdraw the exemption of land\r\n\r\nand  buildings  used  as public burial  and  burning\r\n\r\ngrounds and certain institutions fostering the  arts\r\n\r\nand  sciences  which  are at present  exempted  from\r\n\r\npayment   of   rates  under  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance or the Municipal Ordinance on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat these organisations are run on commercial lines\r\n\r\nand  they  charge fees or levies for their services.\r\n\r\nHowever,   provision  is  made  for   exemption   of\r\n\r\ndeserving cases of this nature and of buildings used\r\n\r\nexclusively   for  purposes  conducive   to   social\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Provision  is  also  made   to   allow\r\n\r\nstatutory   bodies   to  pay  half-yearly   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment an equitable sum in lieu of property tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to make it mandatory for any\r\n\r\nperson who owns property which has not been assessed\r\n\r\nto  give  notice thereof to the Chief  Assessor.  It\r\n\r\nwill  also be mandatory for him to notify the  Chief\r\n\r\nAssessor  when a building ceases to be  occupied  by\r\n\r\nthe  owner thereof and is let. Because the tax is  a\r\n\r\ntax  on  the  ownership of property irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether  it is occupied or not, refunds of  tax  for\r\n\r\n\"letted\"  buildings  which  have  become  unoccupied\r\n\r\nduring the tax year will cease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special provisions have been made for assessment\r\n\r\nof taxes on new buildings, buildings which have been\r\n\r\nrebuilt  or  enlarged, properties assessed  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time, and properties which should  have  been\r\n\r\nassessed for rates under the Municipal Ordinance  or\r\n\r\nthe  Local Government Ordinance prior to the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  operation of this Ordinance but have not  been\r\n\r\nso  assessed. It is provided that in all these cases\r\n\r\nthe tax shall be payable from the date of completion\r\n\r\nof  the  building or in the case of land  from  such\r\n\r\ndate,  not  being more than six years prior  to  the\r\n\r\ndate on which the property is first assessed, as may\r\n\r\nbe  determined by the Comptroller. In cases where  a\r\n\r\nbuilding ceases to be occupied by the owner  and  is\r\n\r\nlet  or where the rent thereof is increased, the tax\r\n\r\npayable from the date of such letting or increase of\r\n\r\nrent  is  to be calculated on the basis of a revised\r\n\r\nvalue  which  may subsequently be ascribed  to  such\r\n\r\nbuilding.

P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are one or two aspects of the Bill upon which\r\n\r\nI  wish to touch. The first, Mr Speaker, Sir, which\r\n\r\nI  think  is  a very serious one, is the  Minister's\r\n\r\nstatement that in future it is not proposed to  give\r\n\r\nrefunds  in respect of unoccupied property. And  the\r\n\r\nbasis  for  the  change  in law,  it  would  appear,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  Minister, is  that  as  this  is\r\n\r\nconsidered to be a property tax, therefore the  mere\r\n\r\nowning  of  the  property should  attract  the  tax,\r\n\r\nwhether  or not the property, in fact, produces  any\r\n\r\nincome.  That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a  very  serious\r\n\r\nstatement  for the Minister for Finance to  make.  I\r\n\r\npersonally  cannot  see  any  difference,  from  the\r\n\r\ntaxing  point of view, whether property is immovable\r\n\r\nor  movable. The Minister for Finance says  that  if\r\n\r\nanybody in Singapore should be so foolish as to  put\r\n\r\nhis surplus money which is lying in the bank without\r\n\r\nearning  any  income,  on a  piece  of  land  which,\r\n\r\nthrough circumstances beyond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis control, ceases to produce any income, then that\r\n\r\nproperty is still liable to tax. Contra - if he  keeps\r\n\r\nhis  money  lying idle in the bank not  earning  any\r\n\r\nincome,  as  the  Minister has not  yet  decided  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  capital tax, he would be  exempt  from\r\n\r\ntaxation  in so far as his idle money is  concerned.\r\n\r\nWhat  then is the difference between tile two! If  a\r\n\r\nman  shakes a leg a bit and wants to help  me  State\r\n\r\nand himself, anti invests his money anti puts it  to\r\n\r\nsome profitable use, then me Minister says, \"Because\r\n\r\nit is a property tax, I must tax you on the property\r\n\r\neven  though it does not earn any income.\" Supposing\r\n\r\na  person owns 10 houses in, say, North Bridge Road,\r\n\r\nand if a slump were to come - it might yet come within\r\n\r\nthe  time of the present Government, some say it  is\r\n\r\nalready  here - then  that person who  has  10  houses\r\n\r\nunlet  would  have to pay tax at 36 per cent.  Where\r\n\r\ndoes  he get his money from to pay this 36 per cent?\r\n\r\nHe  will  end  up  in ruination,  and  so  will  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market.  And  it the  property  market  is\r\n\r\nbrought  to ruination, Mr Speaker, Sir, me  economy\r\n\r\nof Singapore also would to a large extent be ruined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would ask the Government to reconsider this\r\n\r\nproposition  very seriously; even the  principle  is\r\n\r\nunacceptable. I can see no justification for  saying\r\n\r\nthat merely because you own property, you should pay\r\n\r\ntax  on  it. I think the property should be  put  to\r\n\r\nsome  use in respect of which the State is providing\r\n\r\nservices.  That  is the basic proposition  on  which\r\n\r\nmunicipal assessments are levied, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nand not because you own property. The mere owning of\r\n\r\nproperty, from a municipal point of view,  does  not\r\n\r\nattract  rates. But if the property  is  of  such  a\r\n\r\nnature  that  it  attracts  municipal  services   to\r\n\r\nitself, or the preservation of which depends on  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of adequate municipal services,  then  in\r\n\r\nreturn for those services a rate is levied. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  basis on which municipal rates are levied.  The\r\n\r\nProperty Tax says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An Ordinance to provide for the levy of a tax on\r\n\r\nimmovable properties in lieu of the rates previously\r\n\r\nleviable ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently the Government has forgotten the basis on\r\n\r\nwhich  this rate was levied by the City Council  and\r\n\r\nrural authorities. All they are interested in is the\r\n\r\nmonies  which they can collect, not the purpose  for\r\n\r\nwhich the monies are collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a house falls vacant, Mr Speaker, Sir, then it\r\n\r\nis  not  using municipal services -it is  not  using\r\n\r\nwater;  it  is  not using light;  it  is  not  using\r\n\r\nsewerage  facilities. What are the facilities  which\r\n\r\nthe Government is providing in respect of that house\r\n\r\non  which  they  claim  a 36 per  cent  tax?  It  is\r\n\r\ninequitable; it is scandalous. If that sort of thing\r\n\r\nis  allowed  to come about, Mr Speaker, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nwill be no building estates built in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  already  stated,  in  the  building\r\n\r\nsector anyway, that it is both an enterprise between\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the private sector in order that\r\n\r\nadequate housing might be provided for Singapore  in\r\n\r\nfuture years. Government hopes to build 9,000 houses\r\n\r\nnext year. I do not think they will, but if they  do\r\n\r\nbuild,  it will be a very good effort. But according\r\n\r\nto  plans, we need at least 15,000 to 20,000  houses\r\n\r\nper  year  if we want to provide for the  increasing\r\n\r\npopulation, not to catch up, but merely  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor   the   increasing  population.  If   Government\r\n\r\nintroduces  legislation which is going to  not  only\r\n\r\ndiscourage but also stop private development then  I\r\n\r\ncannot see how it is going to bring adequate housing\r\n\r\naccommodation   to  Singapore.  My   experience   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  is that they say one thing and  they  do\r\n\r\nanother.  They  say they want to encourage  housing.\r\n\r\nThey  say,  \"We  want to encourage people  to  build\r\n\r\nhouses.\" I ask the Minister for Finance: does he, in\r\n\r\nall  seriousness, think that this  omission  of  the\r\n\r\nrefund   of   tax  now  possible  under  the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ordinance, whereby a person whose  house\r\n\r\nis  unoccupied can go to him and claim a refund,  is\r\n\r\ngoing to help housing projects in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a person, or a company, who has 20\r\n\r\nacres  of  land and who wants to develop  it.  Under\r\n\r\npresent  conditions it is very difficult to envisage\r\n\r\nor to forecast  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  all those houses built  on  the  land\r\n\r\nwould  be bought or taken up by persons who want  to\r\n\r\nbuy  houses.  Let us assume that that  person  is  a\r\n\r\nventuresome  sort of developer, and he develops.  If\r\n\r\nhe  sells  as much as 50 per cent of the  houses  to\r\n\r\nbegin with he is lucky, Mr Speaker; the rest of the\r\n\r\n50  per  cent  lie vacant and idle. As  soon  as  he\r\n\r\nreceives  a  certificate  of  occupation  from   the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authority, the vacant houses will  attract\r\n\r\nproperty  tax.  What happens to  the  developer?  He\r\n\r\nfaces  ruination. He is paying a tax of 36 per  cent\r\n\r\non  the balance of the developed property. And  what\r\n\r\nis  the  annual  value under the Property  Tax?  The\r\n\r\nannual value, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the rent at which\r\n\r\nit  may  reasonably be expected to let from year  to\r\n\r\nyear. So it attracts tax at once and the position is\r\n\r\nthat  he will have to contribute 36 per cent to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment by way of tax until such time as  he  has\r\n\r\ndisposed of his property. This is not the Ordinance,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, that is going to  help  bring  a\r\n\r\nbuilding boom to Singapore. If anything it is  going\r\n\r\nto  help  kill it. The P.A.P. Government has  nearly\r\n\r\nkilled  the  building industry, and this  Bill  will\r\n\r\nsurely  help to put the industry into a  coffin  and\r\n\r\nplace it well and truly seven feet under the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Six or seven?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> An extra one foot for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment! So that is the position which will ensue\r\n\r\nif  this Bill is passed without the provision  which\r\n\r\nis  now  already  contained in the Local  Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Other  than that,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is\r\n\r\nmerely  a duplication of the existing provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Government Ordinance and  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance, except that it gives the Minister  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  powers  personally, which the  Local  Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance did not give to the City Council as  such.\r\n\r\nIf  the powers are used wisely by the Minister, well\r\n\r\nand  good.  But if the Minister does not  use  those\r\n\r\npowers  wisely, but uses them in an oppressive  sort\r\n\r\nof  way,  then there again it is going to be  a  bad\r\n\r\nthing.  Mr  Speaker, I am against the policy -  that\r\n\r\nMinisters  should be allowed wide powers in  respect\r\n\r\nof which the public at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge  do  not  know what line each  Minister  would\r\n\r\nadopt.  The  provisions should be  embodied  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, immovable property and investments, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  are  matters  in  respect  of  which   the\r\n\r\ninvesting public must be satisfied that the position\r\n\r\nwill  be stable for a number of years. If exemptions\r\n\r\nof  this  nature  are to be left to  the  individual\r\n\r\ndiscretion of the Minister, I am suggesting  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance that that is not the best  way\r\n\r\nto inspire confidence in the investing public. Under\r\n\r\nthe  Municipal  Ordinance, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  there\r\n\r\nwere  circumstances where areas which were not given\r\n\r\nall  the municipal services were not liable  to  the\r\n\r\ncomplete 36 per cent rates. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nkeep  that  in mind when he considers these  various\r\n\r\nareas  from  the point of view of the varying  rates\r\n\r\nwhich he intends to tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain areas in Singapore, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  which  do  not have a supply  of  electricity.\r\n\r\nThere are other areas which do not have a supply  of\r\n\r\nwater.  There are yet other areas which do not  have\r\n\r\nthe   sewerage  system  installed.  These  are   all\r\n\r\nmunicipal facilities in respect of which this 36 per\r\n\r\ncent  is  being  levied by the Government.  How  the\r\n\r\nMinister is going to sort out these things  area  by\r\n\r\narea,  I  do not know. But I do hope that  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister does make these levies, he will see that he\r\n\r\nholds  a balance between all the areas, and that  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of each of those areas which does not  have\r\n\r\nall  the municipal facilities, an adequately reduced\r\n\r\ntax is imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other innovation to the Property Tax Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  was not in the Local Government Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nthe provision whereby industrial premises could also\r\n\r\nbe exempt from the 36 per cent taxation as envisaged\r\n\r\nfor the rest of the properties. I do not propose  to\r\n\r\ntouch  upon  this matter, because my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill, will deal with it. But  I  do\r\n\r\nwish  to  press upon the Minister for  Finance  this\r\n\r\nposition: that I think this Bill, which proposes  to\r\n\r\nlevy   a  tax  on  unoccupied  property  which   had\r\n\r\npreviously been rented, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is going to have the certain effect of\r\n\r\nnot encouraging builders to build in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget speech, the Minister for Finance  stated\r\n\r\nthat  in  regard to rural areas, it was not proposed\r\n\r\nto  increase  the rates other than where  there  had\r\n\r\nbeen  improvements, such as roads,  lighting,  water\r\n\r\nand  electricity. But in his speech this  afternoon,\r\n\r\nhe  has  told us that at the present time there  are\r\n\r\nfive types of rates - 14 per cent, 18 per cent, 20 per\r\n\r\ncent,  23  per  cent  and 36 per  cent,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed to reduce this number to three - 36 per cent,\r\n\r\n27  per  cent and 18 per cent. Therefore, by a  mere\r\n\r\nmanipulation  of  reducing five types  of  rates  to\r\n\r\nthree,  those  that  are in the lower  rates  become\r\n\r\naffected.   In  the  case  of  14  per  cent   rate,\r\n\r\ntherefore, there is already a proposed increase of 4\r\n\r\nper  cent. In the case of the 20 per cent and 23 per\r\n\r\ncent  rates, there is therefore a proposed increased\r\n\r\nof  7 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Over and\r\n\r\nabove  that,  the Minister is proposing  that  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  housing estates developed in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas, these will be rated at 36 per cent. There is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an overall increase throughout all  rural\r\n\r\nareas  in Singapore. He has said, Sir, that  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  vacant land in the city area,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nproposed to reduce the present rate of 36 per  cent.\r\n\r\nThe  36 per cent will remain. But in the case of the\r\n\r\nother  areas, although the present rates are 27  per\r\n\r\ncent and 18 per cent, it is proposed, if I heard him\r\n\r\nrightly,  to  reduce it to 18 per cent  and  12  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to industrial premises, the Minister\r\n\r\nproposes  that  they  should be given  this  special\r\n\r\ninducement  in  order that there can  be  a  greater\r\n\r\ninducement  for the industrialisation of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir,  new  industries  can  come  in  under  pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus, and as a result of that, there is a sort  of\r\n\r\nmonopoly.  New industries can also claim a five-year\r\n\r\ntax  holiday.  These  are, in a way,  very  material\r\n\r\ninducements to capital to come and open up factories\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. But to suggest that by giving special\r\n\r\nrates in regard to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty  tax,  there  is  going  to  be  a  further\r\n\r\ninducement  is,  I  think,  not  quite  right.  What\r\n\r\ncapital  is more interested in is not the few  extra\r\n\r\ndollars  that  can  be saved by a reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nrates  of  the property tax, but rather in a  stable\r\n\r\npolitical climate and industrial peace in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Labour and Law is doing its best  to\r\n\r\nsecure  industrial peace, with the  co-operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C., although reports would appear that  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. and the Minister do not see eye  to  eye  on\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  merely wish to add to what the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  has  said about paying  assessment  on\r\n\r\nvacant  houses. Even at present, when  the  rule  is\r\n\r\nthat  you  can claim a refund of tax on houses  that\r\n\r\nare  vacant,  the  refund is not given  blindly  and\r\n\r\nhaphazardly.  The  assessor  will  have  to  satisfy\r\n\r\nhimself  that those houses that are vacant  are  not\r\n\r\nkept  vacant purposely for the benefit of the owner.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, some owners keep their houses vacant.\r\n\r\nThey purposely put up very high and impossible rents\r\n\r\nto  keep  them  vacant in order to  sell  them  with\r\n\r\nvacant  possession so that they would get  a  higher\r\n\r\nprice.  Cases like that do not get a refund. I  know\r\n\r\nthat.  I  have seen some people who have  claimed  a\r\n\r\nrefund,  and  I  have seen them  having  to  produce\r\n\r\nevidence of their attempt to get their house rented,\r\n\r\nand  at  a reasonable rate. So there is a precaution\r\n\r\nalready  existing. If it is in the  Minister's  mind\r\n\r\nthat  owners of houses could be working against  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the State for their own benefit,  that\r\n\r\nis,  by keeping houses vacant, then I would like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out that that is not so. Precautionary  steps\r\n\r\nare being taken by the assessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a\r\n\r\nsaying that when you scratch a Tartar you will still\r\n\r\nfind  a  Tartar. Here on the question  of  taxes  on\r\n\r\nproperty,  we  find the S.P.A. displaying  the  true\r\n\r\nnature of their political sympathies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park and the Member for Mountbatten that  it\r\n\r\nis iniquitous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  tax  on unoccupied houses. The Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  says that, in the past, services were provided\r\n\r\nwhen  houses were occupied, and when they  were  not\r\n\r\noccupied,     municipal    services     were     not\r\n\r\nenjoyed - services like water, light, gas and  so  on.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  such instances, when the  house  was\r\n\r\nvacant, there was no case for levying a rate.  There\r\n\r\nmay  be a point to that if it is a matter purely  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance. But I would  dispute  his\r\n\r\ncontention  that  the  State does  not  provide  any\r\n\r\nservice  whatsoever to the owners of vacant  houses.\r\n\r\nFor  one  thing, the police maintain law and  order.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  safeguard  the  owners   of   such\r\n\r\nproperty  from  being plundered.  But  this  is  the\r\n\r\npoint.  Today  we know that there is a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nhousing.  It  is very difficult to get accommodation\r\n\r\nat  reasonable rents. There is no excuse  whatsoever\r\n\r\nfor  any large number of houses to go vacant for any\r\n\r\nlong  period  of  time. If that happens,  it  merely\r\n\r\nmeans  that the land-owners are charging too high  a\r\n\r\nrent.  This being the case, it is only fair,  taking\r\n\r\nthe  long-term view of their net income,  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  pay  tax  during  the  periods  when   their\r\n\r\nproperty is vacant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that there is a slump - one does not\r\n\r\nknow,  of course, what the future governments  would\r\n\r\nbe  then,  of course, the situation may arise  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  a surplus of housing and many houses  are\r\n\r\nvacant,   although  the  rents  charged  are   quite\r\n\r\nreasonable. In that event of course, there would  be\r\n\r\na  case  for reconsidering the position. But in  the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances, where there is a shortage  of\r\n\r\nhousing, it is absolutely scandalous that any  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of houses should be vacant. If the  tax  on\r\n\r\nvacant  houses  will  have the  effect  of  inducing\r\n\r\nlandlords to lower their rent, then I think we  will\r\n\r\nhave achieved a very desirable social objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards stopping private development, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park is fully aware that  the\r\n\r\nlarge  housing estates which have been built in  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years have not been built to be let  out;\r\n\r\nthey have been built to be sold to individuals, very\r\n\r\noften on some instalment basis. So this question  of\r\n\r\nthe building estates being hard hit by this tax does\r\n\r\nnot arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill says that I promised\r\n\r\nduring  my Budget statement that there would  be  no\r\n\r\nincrease  in the rates of tax in the rural areas.  I\r\n\r\nsaid  nothing of that sort. In fact, I went to  some\r\n\r\nlengths to explain that the rates in the rural areas\r\n\r\nwere  low  in  the past for historical  reasons,  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  was then developing and there was  plenty\r\n\r\nof land then. But that is not the situation today. I\r\n\r\nclearly  hinted that there would be slight increases\r\n\r\nin the rates of tax in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards special treatment for industries, I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Cairnhill missed the point.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  merely that prospective investors will  get\r\n\r\nthe  benefit.  The principal beneficiaries  will  be\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  already running factories  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas today. They should be cushioned off from\r\n\r\nany increase in costs. Perhaps I should explain that\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas, rates may have been  increased\r\n\r\nanywhere between 5 possibly to 10 or 12 per cent  on\r\n\r\ngeneral  properties, and we intend to exempt  owners\r\n\r\nand  operators  of  industrial  establishments  from\r\n\r\nthese  increases, so as not to increase their  costs\r\n\r\nof production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also misunderstood the\r\n\r\npoint about tax on vacant land. In the city area the\r\n\r\ntax is 36 per cent. The tax on vacant land at 36 per\r\n\r\ncent  remains there. In the rural areas the tax  was\r\n\r\nformerly  9  per  cent, consisting  of  5  per  cent\r\n\r\nimprovement  rate  and  4 per cent  education  rate.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  what we are doing is not to  reduce  the\r\n\r\ntax  on  vacant  land  in the  rural  areas  but  to\r\n\r\nincrease  it.  I hope I have resolved satisfactorily\r\n\r\nthe various misunderstandings which have arisen over\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Unless any Member wishes to speak on\r\n\r\na particular clause, I propose to take the Bill Part\r\n\r\nby Part.

Because\r\n\r\nof   the   open  nature  of  its  coast  line,   its\r\n\r\ncomparative prosperity based on an entrepot  economy\r\n\r\nand  stable conditions and the proximity of numerous\r\n\r\nislands   in  its  neighbourhood,  the  problem   of\r\n\r\npreventing illegal immigration into Singapore is not\r\n\r\nan  easy  one.  The problem has been accentuated  by\r\n\r\nrecent  amendments to immigration laws,  which  have\r\n\r\ndrastically  reduced the number of  immigrants  into\r\n\r\nthe  country.  Active measures have  been  taken  to\r\n\r\nprevent  such  illegal immigration by  the  combined\r\n\r\nefforts  of the Customs, Immigration, Marine  Police\r\n\r\nand  the  M.R.N.V.R.  These measures  have  produced\r\n\r\nresults,  but it is felt that the Government  should\r\n\r\nbe  given more legal powers to have a better control\r\n\r\nof  the  situation and to deal more effectively  not\r\n\r\nonly  with  illegal immigrants who have entered  the\r\n\r\nState, but also persons who assist in bringing  them\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore.  It is with these objects  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  the  Immigration (Amendment)  Bill,  1960, is\r\n\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill now gives power to the\r\n\r\nController of Immigration to declare the presence of\r\n\r\na  person  unlawful at any time if he  is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  the person is a prohibited immigrant  or  that\r\n\r\nany material statement in the application\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   his   permit  or  certificate  was  false   or\r\n\r\nmisleading.  Under the existing law, the  Controller\r\n\r\ncan  only  declare  the presence of  such  a  person\r\n\r\nunlawful  within  two years after his  arrival.  The\r\n\r\neffect of such a declaration is that the person will\r\n\r\nbe liable for removal from the State by order of the\r\n\r\nController subject to appeal to the Minister. It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  an unsatisfactory position  whereby  the\r\n\r\nController  is only allowed to declare the  presence\r\n\r\nof  such  a  person unlawful within two years  after\r\n\r\narrival.  The  Controller should have  discretionary\r\n\r\npower to remove him from the State at any time after\r\n\r\nhis entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Immigration\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  authorise the seizure, detention  and\r\n\r\nforfeiture  of  any vessel below 75 tons  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  used or is about to be used for the commission\r\n\r\nof  an offence against the Immigration Ordinance  or\r\n\r\nany  regulations  made  thereunder.  This  amendment\r\n\r\ntherefore  covers  the  seizure  and  forfeiture  of\r\n\r\nvessels  used for the purpose of bringing in illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.  An order of forfeiture  of  vessels  is\r\n\r\nonly  made by the court and shall be made if  it  is\r\n\r\nproved  to its satisfaction that an offence  against\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance or any regulations made thereunder has\r\n\r\nbeen  committed and that the vessel was used in  the\r\n\r\ncommission of such offence, notwithstanding that  no\r\n\r\nperson  may have been convicted of such offence.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  seen  that forfeiture of a vessel  now  by\r\n\r\nvirtue of the new definition \"vessel\" in clause 2 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill includes everything found in it, and  this\r\n\r\namendment  is  made  with a view  to  deterring  the\r\n\r\nowners   of  small  craft  from  engaging   in   the\r\n\r\nprofitable   business   of  smuggling   in   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  into  Singapore. The majority  of  these\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants enter Singapore by means of small\r\n\r\ncraft  from the adjacent islands. Under the existing\r\n\r\nlaw,  a taikong of a small craft bringing in illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants can only be charged with the abetment  of\r\n\r\nthe  commission  of  an offence and  experience  has\r\n\r\nshown  that the punishment meted out to them  is  no\r\n\r\ndeterrent to prevent them using the same boats again\r\n\r\nand  again  to  bring in illegal immigrants.  It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that  this  amendment will  be  an  effective\r\n\r\ndeterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends the immigration\r\n\r\nOrdinance by putting the onus of proof on  a  person\r\n\r\nwho   is  charged  and  who  has  no  valid  permit,\r\n\r\ncertificate,  pass  or any other document  or  other\r\n\r\nevidence accepted by the Controller as evidence that\r\n\r\nhe  is a lawful resident, that he has entered or\r\n\r\nre-entered or remained in Singapore lawfully. Under the\r\n\r\nexisting  law, the Immigration Department  has  been\r\n\r\nhandicapped  in  its  work of prosecuting  in  court\r\n\r\nthose  illegal immigrants, who have already  entered\r\n\r\nthe  State, because it has to prove that  they  have\r\n\r\nactually  entered  Singapore  unlawfully  and  often\r\n\r\nunless  these  persons admit that they  had  entered\r\n\r\nillegally,  it  is not possible for the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment to prove that they had done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has given sufficient\r\n\r\nindication that it is doing and will do all  it  can\r\n\r\nlegally,   administratively  and  industrially   and\r\n\r\nthrough  its  encouragement of  trade  expansion  to\r\n\r\nsecure  the  social and economic well-being  of  its\r\n\r\ncitizens.

The\r\n\r\nNaib  Kathis will not be paid by the Government  but\r\n\r\nwill  be entitled to retain the prescribed fees  for\r\n\r\nthe solemnization and registration of the marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shariah Court will continue to deal with all\r\n\r\ncases of disputed applications for divorce.

For this reason,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  not  for  any  other, I welcome  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nproposal to commit the Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the first Muslims Ordinance, 1880, was\r\n\r\nintroduced in Singapore, the lawmakers then  had  in\r\n\r\nmind  not so much the desire to control the  way  of\r\n\r\nlife  as  a  whole of the Muslims of Singapore,  hut\r\n\r\nrather the object was to lay down certain principles\r\n\r\nof  Islamic  law  which  had  been  abused  by  some\r\n\r\nsections   of  the  Muslim  population   and   which\r\n\r\nconflicted  with  the  non-theocratic  laws  of  the\r\n\r\nState.  In fact, the provisions of the first Muslims\r\n\r\nOrdinance never went beyond that. The intention  was\r\n\r\nspecific  and  to  the point where,  in  effect,  it\r\n\r\nbecame  merely an accessory to the existing laws  of\r\n\r\nthe  country, although it was part and parcel of the\r\n\r\nStatute Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments were made to the Ordinance from time to\r\n\r\ntime,  but  even so the guiding principle was  never\r\n\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, goes beyond\r\n\r\nthe   original  Muslims  Ordinance,  1880,  and  the\r\n\r\nMuslims Ordinance, 1957, both of which, if I may say\r\n\r\nagain,  tended to accord certain principles  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  law  with  the existing civil  laws  of  the\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I welcome these new additions for the\r\n\r\neffect  it  would have in regularising the  code  of\r\n\r\nconduct of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  aspects of Muslim law. But,  Sir,  what  we\r\n\r\nagree  to  do  or not to do in this Assembly  is  not\r\n\r\nenough  if we do not carry the support of the people\r\n\r\nOutside.  Doubts have been raised by Muslim scholars\r\n\r\nas  to  whether this Assembly can introduce  such  a\r\n\r\nBill.  And  here,  Sir,  the  question  is  not  the\r\n\r\nacademic question, similar to the one we debated not\r\n\r\nso  long  ago, of whether this Assembly is competent\r\n\r\nto  debate the issue under our Standing Orders,  but\r\n\r\nrather   whether   in  a  non-secular   State   like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Islamic laws can be  enacted  to  govern\r\n\r\nMuslims   in   their  way  of  life.   Some   Muslim\r\n\r\ntheologians  hold  the view that under  Islamic  law\r\n\r\nonly a Muslim Government can enforce the laws of the\r\n\r\nKoran,  like  the  Government of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya whose State religion is Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, before I go any further, I would like to\r\n\r\nstress  for  the  purpose of clarification  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and also to the Press - The Malay Press  in\r\n\r\nparticular  - that I am not here giving my  views  on\r\n\r\nthe  Islamic law but rather expressing the views  of\r\n\r\nMuslim religious leaders outside this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, there is then again another group of Muslims who contend that the provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in this Bill are not enough to cover  all\r\n\r\naspects  of  Islamic  law, even  to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\ngaoling  a  Muslim for non-observance of  his  daily\r\n\r\nprayers  and  fast, both of which to  a  Muslim  and\r\n\r\nunder  Islamic laws are the pillars and two  of  the\r\n\r\nfive   fundamentals  upon  which  Islamic   religion\r\n\r\nstands.  Sir,  these are some of  the  thoughts  now\r\n\r\noccupying  the minds of some, if not all,  religious\r\n\r\nleaders since this Bill was published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Sir, to touch on some aspects of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill which I feel require re-thinking. The most\r\n\r\nimportant parts of the Bill, as I see it, are  Parts\r\n\r\nIV (dealing with financial problems), V (Mosques and\r\n\r\nReligious Schools), and IX (Offences). Under  clause\r\n\r\n59,  a  General  Endowment Fund will be  established\r\n\r\ninto  which  all zakat and fitrah collected  by  the\r\n\r\ncollectors will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  paid.  Clause  73 enables the Majlis,  with  the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  to  make\r\n\r\nrules \"to prescribe from time to time the amount  of\r\n\r\nzakat  and  fitrah  to be paid  by  all  Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\", and also the distribution of  the  zakat\r\n\r\nand fitrah to those eligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Mr Deputy Speaker, arise two points. The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  the  determination by the  Majlis  of  the\r\n\r\namount  of  zakat and fitrah. Now, how and  in  what\r\n\r\nmanner, and by what means, and by what yardstick  is\r\n\r\nthe Majlis to determine the amount? Is this going to\r\n\r\nbe  another Assessment Department of the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOffice?  For  all I know, it could be  an  arbitrary\r\n\r\ndecision  depending upon the whim and fancy  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers of the Majlis. Fitrah, of course, is not  so\r\n\r\ndifficult since the calculation is based upon a flat\r\n\r\namount,  whatever the means of the person concerned,\r\n\r\nthat is to say, those who are not exempted. But when\r\n\r\nit  comes  to  zakat, the question of determining  a\r\n\r\nperson's property upon which a tithe of 2\u00bd per  cent\r\n\r\nwill be imposed is a highly complex operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the method of distribution and\r\n\r\nentitlement  thereof. In Singapore  today,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave   public  assistance  by  the  Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment, which pays a mere subsistence  allowance\r\n\r\nto  those unemployed. Under Muslim law, the poor and\r\n\r\nthe  needy will be amongst those first eligible  for\r\n\r\nthe  distribution  of zakat and  fitrah,  and  these\r\n\r\npeople will probably be the same people who are also\r\n\r\neligible for public assistance. Now, Sir, is it  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention, once the Bill becomes  law,\r\n\r\nto  withdraw  public assistance from those  who  are\r\n\r\neligible for zakat and fitrah? It may well  be  that\r\n\r\nthe  individual  shares of zakat  and  fitrah  could\r\n\r\namount  to  more  than the pittance  they  get  from\r\n\r\npublic assistance. I hope it is not going to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Sir, we Muslims in Singapore (at least\r\n\r\nthe  good Muslims) pay two types of what we may call\r\n\r\ntaxes -  one to the Government in all forms, and  the\r\n\r\nother in the form of zakat and fitrah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to clause 77 which prohibits a person\r\n\r\nfrom erecting a mosque,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout the approval of the Majlis. Sir, this raises\r\n\r\na  very  serious  question. Since the  time  of  the\r\n\r\nProphet,  there  has  been,  to  my  knowledge,   no\r\n\r\nreligious restriction on the building of a mosque. I\r\n\r\nknow  this provision is taken from the Selangor  and\r\n\r\nPenang  Muslim enactments. But I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister: why introduce it here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the Offences section which is in\r\n\r\nPart IX. Part IX begins with clause 126 which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Save as is otherwise in this Ordinance expressly\r\n\r\nprovided  this  Part  of this Ordinance  shall  only\r\n\r\napply to Muslims.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  repeat,  Sir,  \"shall  only  apply  to  Muslims.\"\r\n\r\nFurther  on, under the same Part, clause 131  is  on\r\n\r\ncohabitation  Outside marriage. This  clause  states\r\n\r\nthat  any man or woman who cohabits outside marriage\r\n\r\nshall   be  guilty  of  an  offence  and  shall   be\r\n\r\npunishable  to a fine not exceeding $500  or  for  a\r\n\r\nterm of imprisonment not exceeding six months or  to\r\n\r\nboth.  Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, this means  that  if\r\n\r\nyou  (anonymously)  were to cohabit  with  a  Muslim\r\n\r\nwoman  outside  marriage, the Muslim  woman  can  be\r\n\r\nsentenced to six months' imprisonment and to a  fine\r\n\r\nof  $500,  but you will go scot-free. That  is  what\r\n\r\nthis  clause  means.  Where  is  the  equality   and\r\n\r\njustice,  Sir? My information is that  under  Muslim\r\n\r\nlaw  both  should  be punished.  I  would  seriously\r\n\r\nsuggest,  Sir,  to the Government that  this  clause\r\n\r\nshould be totally deleted. In fact, Sir, even in the\r\n\r\nMalay  States,  i.e. in the Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  State  religion is Islam,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision of this nature in the Muslim enactments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I know that both the Minister and\r\n\r\nthe State Advocate-General have put in hours of work\r\n\r\nin compiling the Bill. I hope their efforts have not\r\n\r\nbeen  wasted, but I would appeal to the  Government,\r\n\r\non  such  a  highly controversial subject,  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be better to go slow on the Bill and  not  to\r\n\r\nrush it even in Select Committee. No one. Sir, least\r\n\r\nof  all myself, can speak with any authority on  the\r\n\r\nMuslim religion. We have to seek outside advice, and\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee is the best place for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also appeal to all concerned that in\r\n\r\nmoulding this Bill into its final\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nform, both sides of this House should work as a team\r\n\r\nand  party politics should not be brought in, either\r\n\r\ninto this Assembly or into the Select Committee.  In\r\n\r\nthis connection, Sir, on a parting word of advice to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, I would advise him to print  as  many\r\n\r\ncopies as possible of the Malay version of this Bill\r\n\r\nfor distribution to Muslim leaders and organisations\r\n\r\nthroughout   Singapore  long   before   the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee begins its deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, the Administration of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Law  Bill,  which has  been  tabled  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law today, is a Bill  which\r\n\r\ncould, be described as creating a new chapter in the\r\n\r\nhistory of Singapore consonant with the Constitution\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  which enunciates the protection  and\r\n\r\nsafeguard of the islamic religion of the Malays  and\r\n\r\nIslamic people of Singapore. I do not wish to  dwell\r\n\r\nat  length  on  this  point because  this  Bill  was\r\n\r\nactually promulgated on the advice of many religious\r\n\r\nexperts,  and  it has received the blessing  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Advisory Board, and their views and findings\r\n\r\nhave been accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of zakat, we are adhering to the\r\n\r\nschool of thought called Shafei. On the distribution\r\n\r\nof  the  zakat, it will be distributed according  to\r\n\r\nthe provisos contained in the Muslims Ordinance. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  the Muslims Ordinance  the  tithe  is\r\n\r\ndivided  into  eight persons because  two  of  these\r\n\r\nconditions are absent in this law, and another  one,\r\n\r\nthe  ibni sabil  which  is  non-existant  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  There  are only six left.  So  only  those\r\n\r\npeople  who  qualify under those six conditions  are\r\n\r\neligible.  There  should be no  controversy  arising\r\n\r\nbecause there is provision for the mufti to give  it\r\n\r\nhis ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the question of building\r\n\r\nmosques.  This has never happened, but according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Shafei  school of thought,  if  there  are  two\r\n\r\nmosques  in  the  same area, then  they  should  set\r\n\r\ndifferent times of prayer. This is merely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  prevent  two  mosques in the same  kampong  from\r\n\r\nbeing  erected  which  will  eventually  result   in\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  among  the  people,  but   if   it\r\n\r\nhappens,  as  it  does  happen  because  of  certain\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings, a group decides to erect a mosque\r\n\r\nand  then  not  far  away, say, 10  feet,  there  is\r\n\r\nanother  surau built, then it is with this  in  view\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  made  provisions  to  restrict   the\r\n\r\nbuilding of mosques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the offences, we merely punish\r\n\r\npeople  of  Islamic faith who commit  the  offences.\r\n\r\nThere  are  other religions where, when you  are  in\r\n\r\nlove  with each other, no problem arises; it is  not\r\n\r\nan  offence. But in Islamic law, the marriage should\r\n\r\nbe  solemnized before a priest or imam and witnessed\r\n\r\nby witnesses. So it is necessary that the Muslim who\r\n\r\ncommits the offence should be punished. However  if\r\n\r\na  free  thinker  cohabits with  a  woman,  that  is\r\n\r\nanother  matter. On this aspect of  the  Bill,  too,\r\n\r\nthis  has  been  discussed at great  length  by  the\r\n\r\nreligious leaders. However, as a result of the  wise\r\n\r\ndecision of the Minister for Law to commit the  Bill\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee, it is hoped that many  more\r\n\r\nreligious leaders who are experts on Muslim law will\r\n\r\ncome  forward  to give their views and  opinions  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  incidents that took place with regard  to\r\n\r\nthe Muslims Ordinance will not happen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, as a Muslim, I\r\n\r\nsupport  this Bill in principle. Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthis  is an important Bill as it affects the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore  and  because  the   powers\r\n\r\ntherein  are wide, and are more closely  related  to\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim people in Singapore. I am of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat it is not for me to discuss this Bill. I am not\r\n\r\ncompetent to do so. It requires religious experts to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  discuss  this  Bill.  However,  as  my\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in  this Assembly  is  to  draft  an\r\n\r\nOrdinance in the interest of the State of Singapore,\r\n\r\nI will give this Bill my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration and careful study. However, as  stated\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Geylang Serai just now, as  this\r\n\r\nBill  should be given thorough consideration by  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Muslim  community, it is  proper,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  it should be translated into Malay and  copies\r\n\r\nof it distributed to all Muslim organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development  said  that  the\r\n\r\nAdministration  of Muslim Law Bill did  not  receive\r\n\r\nthe   response  as  should  be  expected  from   the\r\n\r\nreligious  experts. The reason why no  response  was\r\n\r\nforthcoming   was  that  they  were  not   able   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  provisions of the  Bill.  Moreover,\r\n\r\neven  those  who  have  a knowledge  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nreligion  do  not  have a proper  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language. So I support the suggestion by the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai that the Bill be translated\r\n\r\ninto  Malay  and  copies of it  distributed  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious Muslim organisations. Let us not accept this\r\n\r\nBill just because it has been approved by the Muslim\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Board. It is not enough,  because  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  although the Muslim Advisory Board is the body\r\n\r\nto  advise  the Government on religious matters,  it\r\n\r\ndoes   not  reflect  public  opinion.  So   at   the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of  the  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law\r\n\r\nhimself  to  commit the Bill to a Select  Committee,\r\n\r\nwhich is a commendable step, I welcome this Bill  in\r\n\r\nthe hope that it will be enforced in the interest of\r\n\r\nthe Muslim people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to remind the\r\n\r\nGovernment about is that the Bill can be modified to\r\n\r\nfit   in  with  our  wishes  but  the  question   of\r\n\r\nenforcement is a matter which must be given  careful\r\n\r\nthought. From the provisions of this Bill,  I  think\r\n\r\npowers  have  been vested in the Majlis Ugama  Islam\r\n\r\nwhich  will  issue rulings, administer finances  and\r\n\r\ndecide  on  administrative  matters  concerning  the\r\n\r\nerection of religious schools and so on. Members  of\r\n\r\nthe Majlis Ugama Islam will be nominated by the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara. I only wish to remind  that  this\r\n\r\nBoard should not be a place where people merely wish\r\n\r\nto  be nominated for the sake of being nominated. It\r\n\r\nmay well be that although they are of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  opinion  that a certain matter is contradictory\r\n\r\nto  the Muslim law, they, as nominated members,  may\r\n\r\nnot dare to voice their opinion openly. Because they\r\n\r\nare nominated members, therefore, their interest  is\r\n\r\nin being members of the Board and nothing else. What\r\n\r\nwe hope is that the members of this Board will serve\r\n\r\non the Board to discharge truly their responsibility\r\n\r\ntowards the religion of Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point which impresses me, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nis when the Parliamentary Secretary stated that when\r\n\r\npeople  cohabit, the punishment is imposed  only  on\r\n\r\nthe  Islamic  people. According to the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  this  is  because the  Islamic  man  has\r\n\r\ncommitted  the offence. If considered carefully,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  originally  that the aim of the  Bill  was  to\r\n\r\nabide  by the provisions of the Constitution.

The  allowances  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced  to $2,000 for an individual and $1,000  for\r\n\r\nhis wife. These deductions will bring our income tax\r\n\r\nrates  closer to those of the Federation. The impact\r\n\r\nof these reductions is diminished by the new \"earned\r\n\r\nincome  relief\"  which is provided  under  the  same\r\n\r\nclause  of  the Bill, and is set at 20 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nearned  income  subject to a limit  of  $1,000.  The\r\n\r\naverage  worker  will hardly be  affected  by  these\r\n\r\nchanges in the tax structure, because the 20,000  or\r\n\r\nso  new tax payers will only have to pay a total  of\r\n\r\n$750,000  per  annum or an average of $37  each  per\r\n\r\nyear. The maximum amount any new taxpayer will  have\r\n\r\nto  pay is $20 a year if he is a bachelor and $50  a\r\n\r\nyear  if he is married without children. The maximum\r\n\r\npayable by any new taxpayer with three children will\r\n\r\nbe  $12.50 a year. I am sure, Sir, that Members will\r\n\r\nagree that this is neither iniquitous nor a hardship\r\n\r\non   the  lower  income  groups.  As  I  have   said\r\n\r\npreviously, the average family in Singapore does not\r\n\r\npay  income  tax  until  their  earnings  from  work\r\n\r\nreaches the region of $500 per month, even with  the\r\n\r\nproposed  reductions of personal allowances.  It  is\r\n\r\nrelevant also to note that for a family of five with\r\n\r\nan  income  of less than $10,000, or for  a  married\r\n\r\ncouple without children, with an income of less than\r\n\r\n$9,000 or for a bachelor with an income of less than\r\n\r\n$8,000,  the tax in Singapore is lower than the  tax\r\n\r\nin  the Federation.

Every day, a large number\r\n\r\nof  vessels enter port and leave the harbour. It  is\r\n\r\nan  international custom for all vessels  to  fly  a\r\n\r\nflag  of  that  State which it is  visiting.  It  is\r\n\r\ndesirable,  therefore, that in Singapore  we  should\r\n\r\nhave the possibility of distinguishing vessels which\r\n\r\nare  owned by the Singapore Government from visiting\r\n\r\nvessels  and  other  trading vessels  which  may  be\r\n\r\nregistered in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Marine Ensign will be flown by all\r\n\r\nmarine craft in the service of the Government  or  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board, say, for example,  when  the  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority  is formed, light-houses, signal stations,\r\n\r\npiers   and  wharves  owned  or  operated   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment or statutory boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly adopts the State Marine Ensign\r\n\r\nas described and shown in Paper Misc. 6 of 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question\r\n\r\n-[19th December, 1960]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nfor  his  dishonourable  conduct  unbecoming  of  an\r\n\r\nelected  representative of the  people  in  that  he\r\n\r\nrepeatedly used his privilege in this Assembly as  a\r\n\r\ncloak for spreading malicious falsehoods to unjustly\r\n\r\ninjure innocent persons both inside and outside this\r\n\r\nAssembly;  that he be suspended from the service  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly until such time as (i) he  apologises\r\n\r\nto this Assembly for his dishonourable conduct; (ii)\r\n\r\nhe  unreservedly withdraws his unfounded allegations\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Prime Minister and  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law; and (iii) he assures the  Assembly\r\n\r\nthat he will not persist in abusing his privilege in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  by  uttering  malicious  falsehoods,\r\n\r\nunless  he  be  prepared when challenged  to  repeat\r\n\r\noutside  the  Assembly the charges he makes  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\"-(The Deputy Prime Minister).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the motion standing in my name\r\n\r\nbe adjourned sine die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, six days ago, the former Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nstated that he would substantiate all the things  he\r\n\r\nhad  said.  This  was reported in page  44  of  your\r\n\r\nunrevised transcript of proceedings on that day.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time, he begged for time to collect more facts\r\n\r\nso that he could prepare his case. This is quoted on\r\n\r\npage  45  of the unrevised transcript. He wanted  an\r\n\r\nadjournment  to give him a chance to  delve  further\r\n\r\ninto the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not in the Chamber, Mr Speaker, this\r\n\r\nafternoon when you made your announcement  that  the\r\n\r\nformer  Member  for  Hong Lim,  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan,\r\n\r\ntendered his resignation to you at 2.13 p.m. today.\r\n\r\nThis  last-minute reversal of stand,  after  stating\r\n\r\nexplicitly that he intended to substantiate  charges\r\n\r\nwhich  we believe to be false, speaks for itself.  I\r\n\r\nhad  expected  him,  honour  bound,  to  pursue  the\r\n\r\nallegations  he had made in this House. However,  in\r\n\r\nview of the fact that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  has  changed  his  mind 17  minutes  before  the\r\n\r\nsitting  of this Assembly, I have to move  that  the\r\n\r\nmotion  that is before the House should be adjourned\r\n\r\nsine die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this adjournment sine die is that\r\n\r\nsince  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, the man who has  made  the\r\n\r\nallegations, is no longer a Member of this House, it\r\n\r\nwill  be better to have the allegations investigated\r\n\r\nand  conducted outside this Chamber. It is intended,\r\n\r\ntherefore, to set up a Commission of Inquiry with  a\r\n\r\nHigh Court Judge as Commissioner to investigate  the\r\n\r\ntruth of the allegations that have been made against\r\n\r\ntwo  Ministers.  It is our hope that the  Commission\r\n\r\nwill  commence its hearing and complete its findings\r\n\r\nas  soon as possible so that they could be tabled in\r\n\r\nthis  House. Thereupon, I shall ask for this  motion\r\n\r\nto be put back on the Order Paper for debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Inquiry Report has been tabled in this\r\n\r\nHouse, steps will be taken to hold a by-election  in\r\n\r\nthe constituency of Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is really in two parts.\r\n\r\nThe Question is, \"That the debate be now adjourned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Resumption of debate, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sine die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn to\r\n\r\n11th January, 1961.\"-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">One Minute to Five o'clock p.m. to Wednesday, 11th January, 1961.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
