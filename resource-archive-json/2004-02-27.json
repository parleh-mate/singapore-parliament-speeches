the healthcare costs in the public sector.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, managing medical inflation&nbsp;so that healthcare costs do not run wild is one of my Ministry's priorities.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, however, not possible to eliminate medical inflation and keep healthcare cost constant.&nbsp; This is because healthcare is both labour and capital intensive and it will not be realistic to expect healthcare workers to have no wage increases.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 407<p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is possible to manage healthcare costs with a view to keep medical inflation within affordable limits.&nbsp; But it requires major and continuous efforts, from all the stakeholders in the healthcare sector: doctors, hospitals, patients and their loved ones.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To understand this phenomenon, we need to first know the key drivers behind medical inflation.&nbsp; There are several.&nbsp; But I will highlight three: shortage of skilled manpower, rapid introduction of new medical technology and rising expectation from patients.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While skilled manpower and new medical technology have led to significant improvements in medical outcome, the results come with a large price tag.&nbsp; At the same time, increasing affluence of Singaporeans and greater awareness of technological advances in medicine have led to higher expectations from patients in terms of the care and kind of treatment they should receive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop, the challenge is to keep pace with medical advancement, but at a rate which the society as a whole is willing to pay.&nbsp; Inevitably and realistically, some sort of rationing has to be done and patient expectations need to be managed.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is little wonder that rising healthcare cost is a global phenomenon.&nbsp; Indeed, relative to many other developed countries, Singapore has fared not too badly.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not be able to give a comprehensive account of all our steps in managing medical inflation.&nbsp; But broadly, I will group them into six major thrusts.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, emphasise personal responsibility in healthcare.&nbsp; Government can only provide healthcare services, but good health has to be attained by individuals.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 408<p> The most effective way to manage medical inflation is to keep Singaporeans healthy.&nbsp; That is why it is so important for all Singaporeans to lead a healthy lifestyle, thus avoiding illness and hospitalisation.&nbsp; On this score, as Members of Parliament, we have an important role to play.&nbsp; I think we should walk-the-talk and be shining examples of what healthy lifestyle is all about.&nbsp; Incidentally, this Sunday, I will be taking part in a 5-km run to raise money for SSO.&nbsp; Mr Speaker and our colleagues, especially those in the GPC on Health, are most welcome to join in the run.&nbsp; We will kill several birds with one stone - promote health and support the arts and sports.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, increase supply of skilled manpower, especially specialists and nurses, to match rising demand.&nbsp; Without this, any prolonged shortage must inevitably lead to excessive wage increases.&nbsp; We are thus expanding our training capacity, but meanwhile we will mount external recruitment to augment our local supply.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, our healthcare providers, especially the hospitals, must squeeze as much productivity as they can out of their resources.&nbsp; They must strive to produce more with less.&nbsp; This is a continuous endeavour.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples of their recent effort: the&nbsp;clusters have consolidated their IT systems management and support, reducing IT manpower requirements by 15%. TTSH and NUH have combined their Central Sterile Supplies Department (CSSD) services at TTSH.&nbsp; If I am not mistaken, I recall reading the <I>Hansard</I> record when a few years back, Dr Lily Neo indeed made such a suggestion about combining CSSD to reap the economies of scale.&nbsp; I am pleased to announce that her suggestion has been put into practice.&nbsp; This has saved $600,000 in capital expense and $130,000 a year in operating expense.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 409<p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other consolidations such as Finance are being explored. Further savings are expected from outsourcing of services, such as catering and maintenance/engineering.&nbsp; I also encourage them to consider cross-border outsourcing where it makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, I have urged the clusters to collaborate for mutual benefit. The objective is to avoid dysfunctional competition and costly duplication.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example.&nbsp; The clusters have derived significant savings&nbsp;in the procurement of medical supplies, drugs and services through group procurement. The aim is to source for lower cost alternatives and achieve better economies of scale through product standardisation and consolidation of purchase volumes.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, the doctors are reviewing their clinical practices. The aim is to maximise health outcome with minimum resources.&nbsp; This includes efforts to ensure that care is rendered at the most appropriate setting.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example. My Ministry has been working with the clusters to develop the Singapore National Asthma Programme that aims to reduce hospital admissions and move treatment to the primary care level.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clusters have also actively sought to decrease the length of stay in hospitals by promoting day surgery, same day admission for surgery as well as a seamless transition to step down care.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other examples.&nbsp; The clusters have introduced prescribing protocols that encourage the use of generic drugs.&nbsp; The increasing use of electronic medical records would further help to save costs by avoiding repeat tests being carried out on the same patient as the hospital doctor <p align=left>Column: 410<p>can then access test results already done in the polyclinic and vice versa.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, moderate public expectations.&nbsp; Patients and their loved ones quite naturally will demand the best possible care.&nbsp; While we will always do our best, we must be realistic about our ability to match rising expectations and demand, especially if the patients are unwilling to pay for the incremental cost of service enhancement.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way forward is to ensure a range of services available at different prices and to push out such information into the public domain.&nbsp; That is why my Ministry has since last year published hospital bill size statistics for common medical conditions on our website. By promoting greater transparency of hospital charges, hospitals are now able to compare the effectiveness of their cost management initiatives, not only against their own historical costs but also against that of other hospitals. As I explained to the House recently, this allows the hospitals to ask intelligent questions if their charges are significantly different from others, and take proactive steps to cut waste and reduce costs. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, we will continue to strive to cut inefficiency and frills without compromising the quality of medical care. &nbsp; We must, however, be realistic as to the extent to which hospitals can keep cost down while continuing to maintain healthcare standards. If we expect the best treatment and diagnostics, short queues and good service, costs will increase and patients must be prepared to bear part of the cost for it.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Singaporeans, however, for essential services, no Singaporean will be denied such care because of their financial status.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyTextIndent\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B>&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether our present policy of <p align=left>Column: 411<p>encouraging competition between hospital clusters and sectors is effective in controlling healthcare cost inflation?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I recall making a fairly extensive speech last year about this whole topic.&nbsp; Obviously, the solution is not the extreme - either complete centralisation, going back to the good old days of the Ministry of Health when I started my career as a young officer, or to go all the way to compete and duplicate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all things, take the middle path and pick the best of both worlds.&nbsp; There are values in centralisation but there are also values in competition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My challenge to the clusters is:&nbsp; compete by all means but compete to produce more with less.&nbsp; But where it makes sense to collaborate, please do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, when SingHealth cluster started a public cord blood bank, I sat tight to see what was the reaction.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; A few days later, I received an email from the other cluster saying that they would back this project, instead of duplicating a second cord blood bank.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Has this resulted in supply-induced demand for services in our public hospitals?&nbsp; Are public hospitals too focused on cost recovery and is it correct for public hospitals to spend money branding themselves to attract more patients?</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think I should send the speech to Dr Lily Neo.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 412<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The competition for market share has to be taken in its right spirit.&nbsp; I advised the clusters that, stretching the argument,&nbsp;I would clap hands if their workload shrinks, but not if their workload expands.&nbsp; Of course, provided they achieve this not because of lousy service or unsafe standards when everybody runs away from them, like SARS.&nbsp; But, if despite giving good service and, let us say, all the parliamentarians help me out in promoting healthy lifestyles and after a while, illnesses drop, so that patient load comes down or if good&nbsp;economic management&nbsp;leads to strong growth, and&nbsp;more and more people can afford unsubsidised private hospitals and would&nbsp;rather not spend&nbsp;time waiting in the queue of public hospitals,&nbsp;and our market share shrinks, I clap hands.&nbsp;

The communist countries tried to do that and, of course,&nbsp;they discovered that&nbsp;they could not achieve the desired outcome through that way.&nbsp; What we can do is to make sure that at the macro level, we have the right parameters in place.&nbsp; What are those parameters?&nbsp;&nbsp;How much subvention&nbsp;am&nbsp;I&nbsp; prepared to give to the hospitals?&nbsp;&nbsp;What are those expectations about fee increases?&nbsp; And, of course, as shareholders of both clusters, our expectations are that&nbsp;they must balance<p align=left>Column: 413<p> their accounts.&nbsp; You cannot chalk up&nbsp;and build up losses perennially.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why last year,&nbsp;I sat down with them and said&nbsp;that it was a bad time to raise fees, although I knew they were&nbsp;under a lot of pressure because&nbsp;they would otherwise be losing money.&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, \"No.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn to live within your means.&nbsp; Cut your costs.\"&nbsp; In any case, we are no longer providing them with very small sums.&nbsp; As you know, the Ministry of Health's budget is now more than $2 billion.&nbsp; I put out this&nbsp;paper last week where it showed a subsidy of more than&nbsp;$1 billion.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is not chicken-feed.&nbsp; So the question is, as a trustee of taxpayer's money,&nbsp;our job is to decide how best to stretch this budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to do so is to make sure they spend&nbsp;their money properly and if&nbsp;they can collaborate to bring their costs down, do so.&nbsp; If&nbsp;they can outsource to private players in Singapore or even outside of Singapore, do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day I met a pathologist from Tan Tock Seng and he was telling me that our storage cost for pathology samples cannot beat Johor Baru.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know exactly what he is talking about.&nbsp; But&nbsp;he seems to&nbsp;make sense.&nbsp; He said that we could store them in Johor Baru where&nbsp;land cost is low.&nbsp; So there are possibilities of that kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should let the players&nbsp;decide, they are paid to do so, to balance their accounts, provide the best possible service with the budget that they have, to stretch the budget as much as they can to produce the outcome that the society needs.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

&nbsp;This is the total quantum.&nbsp;&nbsp;As compared to volumes, I do&nbsp;not know.&nbsp; Healthcare is complicated because it is not just numbers.&nbsp; Every year, the case mix is different.&nbsp;

These guidelines set out the<p align=left>Column: 415<p> positive, proactive approach schools should adopt in handling discipline, as part of their broader efforts to help our young become responsible, thinking citizens.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; The guidelines recommend the development of a coherent, whole-school&nbsp;framework for managing discipline.&nbsp; This comprises measures ranging from the preventive to the corrective&nbsp; -&nbsp; in other words, from educating the students&nbsp;to counselling them and to taking disciplinary actions. The guidelines &nbsp;provide schools with examples of programmes and strategies that they can adopt&nbsp; to manage discipline in their schools.&nbsp; They also advise schools on how they can work in partnership with parents, and obtain the assistance of external agencies, such as the VWOs, self-help groups and the Police.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; While the MOE guidelines help achieve&nbsp; a broad consistency of principles and approaches in managing discipline amongst&nbsp; our schools, each school has to decide on&nbsp; its own specific&nbsp; approaches. This will depend on the nature of its student body&nbsp;and the history of student discipline in the school.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools also have to decide&nbsp; on the actions most appropriate in each situation, such as&nbsp; counselling the students involved, disciplining them within the school, referring them to other agencies for further counselling and help, or&nbsp;reporting the matter to the Police. In particular, a decision on whether to call in the Police has to be made by the principal,&nbsp; and that will depend on the severity of the offence, the scale of the problem,&nbsp; and the willingness of the students involved to cooperate. These are ground decisions that the principal is in the best position to make.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

We also provide the examples of the more serious matters which&nbsp;would be&nbsp;referred to external agencies, including the Police.&nbsp; I think we prepare our principals, including our young principals, quite well.&nbsp; They&nbsp;all go through not just training on how to be a good school leader, but we also engage them in a fair bit of sharing of best practices.&nbsp; They meet often with their cluster's Superintendent, and with the people in the Ministry.&nbsp; There is a fair bit of sharing within the community of principals themselves.&nbsp; Young principals&nbsp;do not come in totally fresh.&nbsp; They have already been acquainted with the ways of leadership in a school and once they are in leadership, they are able to tap on views and perspectives from others within the school leadership community.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr S Iswaran (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That is quite correct.&nbsp; But the corollary is that there will be some variability in the way that discretion is exercised across schools and we can accept that to a limit.&nbsp; But on matters as serious as Police reports, can the Ministry&nbsp;perhaps be more prescriptive as to the steps that the principals must take before taking such a serious decision which can have a lifelong impact on the students?</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 417<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Every school is different.&nbsp; Student population&nbsp;is different, the history of the problem is different and each instance is different.&nbsp; So I would not want to constrain schools with too prescriptive an approach.&nbsp; We already provide very useful guidelines, with lots of&nbsp;illustrations on how to handle the problems.&nbsp; But the principal is the person on the ground and he or she has to decide.&nbsp; The Ministry is not in a position to prescribe how each and every situation should be decided upon.&nbsp; It is just not possible.&nbsp; Not only is it&nbsp;not possible, it is not desirable either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want strong schools with strong leaders, we cannot have them referring to a detailed rule book each and every time something happens,&nbsp;we cannot have them second guessing the Ministry,&nbsp;we cannot have them calling up the Ministry to ask: what should I do in this instance?&nbsp; We do not get strong schools and strong principals if we do that.&nbsp; We now have strong schools and, by and large, we have very good principals.&nbsp; I think to keep it that way, we have got to leave the decisions on these matters with them.&nbsp; These are the ground decisions they are in the best position to make.&nbsp; If they make decisions that&nbsp;are quite unreasonable, then the Ministry will intervene.&nbsp; &nbsp;But in this instance,&nbsp;the decision was not unreasonable, and that is why the Ministry supported the decision of the principal.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is also, in the school context, about people who know what teaching is about,&nbsp;what nurturing students is really about, people with a certain sense of care and compassion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principals are basically people with a good sense of how young individuals grow.&nbsp; We take great pains to identify potential school leaders&nbsp;early in their careers and we check our assessments as they go through their careers.&nbsp; We&nbsp;go to great lengths to do so and put them through various projects and courses where we can also come up with further assessments as to who would make a good principal.&nbsp;

<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, yes, BCA has been considering legislation to deal with the problem of falling windows.&nbsp; Let me just emphasise to the House how serious this problem is.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We live in a very densely-populated high-rise environment.&nbsp; Over the last few years, and particularly in the last few months, the incidence of falling windows has risen quite sharply.&nbsp; In the last four months of 2003, for example, we had a total of between 12 and 15 cases, ie, about&nbsp;three cases a week.&nbsp; I do not need to tell the House how serious this problem can be.&nbsp; I shudder at the thought of what would happen if one of these windows were to fall on somebody's head.&nbsp; The consequence of such an incident would be horrendous.&nbsp; We have been lucky so far.&nbsp; There have only been three reported cases of somebody being hurt by falling windows over the last few years out of a&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 422<p>total of over 160&nbsp;cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;One was&nbsp;a boy who was hurt when he was&nbsp;hit by some glass fragments&nbsp;as the window fell down; another was a woman who was actually hit on the arm, but not very seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was&nbsp;brought to my attention that in Hong Kong, the same problem has arisen.&nbsp; Two people were killed in Hong Kong&nbsp;in January alone this year.&nbsp; One was a 70-year-old woman; another was an 87-year-old man.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this is a problem that we really need to treat very seriously.&nbsp; We ought to do something.&nbsp; BCA has been studying the problem.&nbsp; Essentially, the problem of falling windows is one that spans several areas of responsibility, starting from the design of the windows to the installation and, finally, of course, to the use of the windows, because it is something that residents use very frequently.&nbsp; So, wear and tear is also an issue.&nbsp; We have the upstream responsibility of designers, installers, manufacturers, and we have the downstream responsibility of residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this problem arising recently, BCA has decided that we have to do something and it is proposing several pieces of legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first one is to legislate to have a minimum standard of safety for design and installation of windows.&nbsp; So far, we do not have such legislation.&nbsp; HDB installs windows according to the minimum safety standards.&nbsp; But this is entirely an initiative on HDB's part.&nbsp; There is nothing in the legislation to force, say, a private contractor or a private developer to do the same.&nbsp; We intend to change that.&nbsp; We intend to enact legislation to make that a minimum safety standard, and&nbsp;not just&nbsp;for&nbsp;the design, but also the installation.&nbsp; So this will take care of the so-called upstream problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second aspect&nbsp;we are considering is&nbsp;whether we should mandate the retrofitting of existing windows, because while the existing windows are safe, they <p align=left>Column: 423<p>could be made safer.&nbsp; So, the question is whether we should make this mandatory, and this is also something that BCA is considering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third&nbsp;aspect that BCA is considering to ensure that there is a minimum standard of safety in the existing windows, is&nbsp;to require home owners to check their windows, and to have a periodic mandatory check.&nbsp; I think this is what the Member was referring to.&nbsp; The idea behind this really is to establish a certain minimum standard of safety for all the windows that have&nbsp;currently been installed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that some members of the public and also&nbsp;Members of this House have&nbsp;expressed some reservations about this,&nbsp;whether it is necessary to have this level of check at the downstream end.&nbsp; What I will do is I will ask BCA to consider whether there is another way of achieving that minimum standard of safety, say, self-checking on the part of the residents.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;want to emphasise that what we are looking for is a certain minimum standard, to allow us to have some assurance that home owners are accepting responsibility for keeping their windows in good condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yes, we will relook&nbsp;the need for such&nbsp;legislation and whether there is a necessity to mandate periodic inspections of windows.&nbsp; We will look at various other options as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of 50-50 cost sharing and, therefore, no need to inspect,&nbsp;I think there is a rationale behind doing away with the need to inspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA will take this into consideration when it enacts its legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be bringing legislation to the House to allow us to enact certain laws which will enhance the safety of windows, and I welcome all views from Members when we debate it in this House.On rental flats, yes, I can confirm that as HDB is the landlord for such rental <p align=left>Column: 424<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flats, the HDB will change the windows that need to be changed to comply with the new safety standards and&nbsp;will foot the cost of such retrofitting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, on the tender.&nbsp; Yes, HDB is now in the process of calling for tenders for retrofitting of windows and I will see whether we can shorten the period of retrofitting and we will expedite the exercise.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As regards&nbsp;compulsory checks, I read in the papers that a casement window is like a sail catching the wind.&nbsp; So, the wind load is probably heavier for those flats that are on the upper floors.&nbsp; Is the HDB considering&nbsp;banning casement windows, say, from the 10th floor and above, and replacing them with sliding windows?</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem of falling windows came to the notice of HDB and to the Ministry recently when the trend was, as I said, rising at an&nbsp;alarming rate.&nbsp; There have always been cases of windows falling, but to a very minimal extent.&nbsp; But in 2003, the number of cases shot up quite dramatically.&nbsp; For example, in 2003, there were 97 cases<p align=left>Column: 425<p> for HDB and nine cases for private flats, compared to, say, 2002 when there were 39 HDB cases and nine in private flats.&nbsp; In 2001, there were about an average of 17 to 18 cases.&nbsp; So, you can see that the trend has been increasing sharply.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, HDB mounted an exercise to zero in on this problem of maintenance, particularly of windows.&nbsp; In November 2003, the HDB launched a handbook which was distributed to all homes to educate residents on what to look out for and how to look after their windows.&nbsp; They also conducted roadshows at various housing estates.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the statistics since then show that there has been very minimal impact.&nbsp; After the launch of the handbook in November, there were about 15 cases in December,&nbsp;nine&nbsp;in January, and February up to now, so far there have been about three cases.&nbsp; After the press conference when there was massive publicity about falling windows, touch wood, so far there has been no case.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have been aware of this and this is what we have been doing about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say to members of the public that this is something that should be the responsibility of all of us.&nbsp; Residents should check their windows.&nbsp; They should not wait for legislation, they should not be caught up in this current debate, but they should&nbsp;act now, check their windows, make sure that they are safe and&nbsp;do not fall down and hurt somebody or, worse still, kill somebody.&nbsp; If they are in doubt about the safety of the windows, please call the HDB which&nbsp;will give them a list of the contractors who can fix the windows for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on whether we should replace casement windows with sliding windows, the casement windows have been installed in HDB flats for the last 20-odd years or more.&nbsp; Before that, there were <p align=left>Column: 426<p>also casement windows.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;they were not aluminium casement windows but mild steel casement windows.&nbsp; So I do not think that there is a case <I>per se</I> to say that casement windows are more dangerous than sliding windows, or louvred windows for that matter.&nbsp; In fact, our statistics show that there are sliding windows that have also fallen, although to a lesser extent.&nbsp; There, the problem is slightly different, but the point I want to make is that all windows, even the ones that are built according to the latest standards, are subject to wear and tear, need to be inspected, checked, maintained and, if they are not in good condition,&nbsp;changed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, there is no evidence to suggest that we should be changing all casement windows to sliding windows.</p></span></div>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:OUTSOURCING AND OFF-SHORING OF JOBS--><p align=left>Column: 426<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This makes good economic sense, as <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is home to a base of more than 6,000 MNCs or potential clients. Scandent has a business continuity centre in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to perform higher-end consulting such as business process analysis.&nbsp; Like the case of&nbsp; Tata, Scandent's operations here would complement those in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 428<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are hopeful that this trend would continue.&nbsp; To date, all of the top 20 Indian IT companies have set up offices in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. As their operations expand, Indian IT firms would provide more well-paying jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; While anti-globalists would try to stop outsourcing, competitive pressures would eventually force governments to open up because their companies would otherwise be at a disadvantage.&nbsp; Just earlier on, we have heard Mr Khaw Boon Wan saying that our hospitals should consider cross-border outsourcing in order to lower their costs.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor also asked what strategies we can pursue to counter the negative impact of this trend. While we cannot stop some lower-end processes in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> from being outsourced to lower cost destinations, we should compete to attract higher value-added business processes here. These include activities such as risk management, disaster recovery, content development, design and engineering. They require a stable political environment, good public administration, human capital, technology and infrastructure, all of which are available here in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We provide an attractive front end for BPO businesses.&nbsp; Our FTAs also provide some protection against protectionist pressures in other countries.&nbsp; For example, even if the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> were to legislate against the outsourcing of government work to foreign countries, under the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, companies with a substantial presence in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> will still be&nbsp;eligible for such work.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to ensure that our costs in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> are competitive. For software, in particular, we need to bring in more employment pass holders with the requisite skills. MTI is now working with MOM on this.&nbsp; Recent measures to lower employers' CPF contributions and promote a more flexible wage structure will also help to improve our cost structure.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ELECTRICITY VESTING PRICE FORMULA--><p align=left>Column: 429<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ELECTRICITY VESTING PRICE FORMULA</b></span></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Benefits to consumers--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Benefits to consumers)</b></span></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt\">7.&nbsp; <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin</b>&nbsp;asked the Minister for Trade and Industry as the wholesale electricity price has fallen some 30% and as the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has set the vesting price for the current quarter at $94/MWh and the competitive wholesale price at $64/MWh, a difference of some 27%, (a) how will consumers benefit from this pricing formula; (b)&nbsp; when can consumers expect the EMA vesting price to better reflect the competitive price; and (c)&nbsp; whether EMA will publish data showing how vesting price is&nbsp; calculated.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; I declare&nbsp;my interest as the CEO of Hyflux.&nbsp; Question No. 7, Sir.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</B>&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the three large generation companies control about 90% of the generation capacity.&nbsp; With their capacity, the generation companies have market power.

Generation companies receive the vesting price for these quantities.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vesting price is set at the Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of the most efficient generation technology in the system. Currently, this is the combined cycle gas turbine.&nbsp; By setting vesting price to LRMC, we allow the investor in the <p align=left>Column: 430<p>generation plant to recover the costs required to develop the plant, the costs to finance the investments and the costs to operate the plant, including fuel cost. The vesting price for the 1st quarter of 2004 is approximately $94/MWh.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member has also referred to \"the competitive wholesale price of $64/MWh\".&nbsp; For clarity, let me term&nbsp;this the \"pool price\".&nbsp; Before the vesting contracts were put in place, the wholesale price was the pool price. It was identical.&nbsp;&nbsp;The average pool and therefore the wholesale price last year was $93/MWh. However, after vesting, the wholesale price is now a weighted average of the vesting price and the pool price. For January 2004, the weighted average wholesale price was $84/MWh.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, vesting contracts have brought market power under control.&nbsp; With market power controlled and the presence of &nbsp;significant excess capacity in the market, competition between generation companies has caused pool prices and therefore, wholesale prices, to fall. Compared to the average wholesale price last year of around $93/MWh, the current wholesale price of electricity has fallen by about 10%.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lower wholesale price means it costs less to buy electricity at the wholesale market.&nbsp; Consumers who buy directly from the wholesale market would be better off today.&nbsp; However, they are exposed to price volatility as the wholesale price can fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Retailers who have bought on contracts with generation companies and consumers who have bought on contracts with retailers will continue to be governed by the existing contracts which they had entered into and signed.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long term, a competitive wholesale price will ensure that retailers<p align=left>Column: 431<p> offer competitive retail prices to consumers.&nbsp; If the retailers&nbsp;do not do so, they will risk losing market share since consumers can also buy from the wholesale market.&nbsp; However, consumers who buy from the wholesale market will have to take the risks of volatility in wholesale prices.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final part of the Member's question was on whether EMA&nbsp;will publish data showing how vesting price&nbsp;is calculated.&nbsp; The procedures for calculating the components of vesting price are published at EMA's website&nbsp;and the actual vesting price for each quarter is posted by SP Services on its website.&nbsp; For the Member's reference, that is&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=http://www.mssl.com.sg/\"\">www.mssl.com.sg</a>.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin</B>:&nbsp; I understand that the vesting contract price is used to protect the consumers, because 90% of the power is being generated by the four generation companies (gencos).&nbsp; But, at the same time, it is also used to protect the gencos because these vesting contracts are calculated based on their minimum cost of operation.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister of State whether, under this regime, there will be more incentives for the gencos to further improve their operations so that they can bring down these operating costs.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the vesting contract price is pegged at the long-term running costs of the most efficient technology&nbsp;currently available.&nbsp; If and when technology changes and there is more efficient technology&nbsp;in the system, the LRMC price will come down.&nbsp; Generation companies with less efficient technology will be at a disadvantage.&nbsp; Indeed, this has already&nbsp;happened to companies which have older technology, for instance, the steam plants which are not as cost-effective as the combined cycle gas turbines.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are&nbsp;strong financial pressures on companies to adopt <p align=left>Column: 432<p>the latest and most efficient technology available.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin:&nbsp;</B> From the website, we can only find the formula.&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to&nbsp;my third question, I would like to know whether EMA can publish the data showing how these vesting price formulas are derived.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I cannot make a definitive&nbsp;statement as to the extent of data which will be published because&nbsp;some of these are obviously&nbsp;commercially sensitive.&nbsp; However, let me give an assurance to Ms Lum, and indeed&nbsp;to all the big power consumers in Singapore, that if they need further advice,&nbsp;EMA will provide them with all the advice necessary, so long as we work within the rules of the system and we do not give any one party any unfair advantage.

No child has died among the cases reported to&nbsp;MCDS.&nbsp; However, according to the cases recorded by the Police, there was one death from physical abuse and one death from sexual abuse in year 2002. &nbsp;In year 2003, there were three deaths resulting from physical abuse.

This is to ascertain the risk to the child and, where necessary, to allow us intervention to safeguard the safety of the child. The<p align=left>Column: 437<p> care plan for the child is discussed by a Child Abuse Protection Team, comprising child protection officers, paediatricians, psychologists and the educational staff where appropriate.&nbsp; A Care and Protection Order is usually issued by the Court to ensure that family members receive assessments, support services as well as&nbsp;counselling.&nbsp; To prevent child abuse, MCDS carries out on-going training on detection and early intervention to ensure that professionals and those in regular contact with children can raise alert even on potential abuse and not wait till after abuse has taken place.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protection of our children requires a \"Many Helping Hands\" approach.

'tan wei ming' 20040225T0911\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, a decision on the appeal lodged by SingTel against the InfoComm Development Authority's ruling on the dispute between SingTel and Starhub Cable Vision (SCV) was reached in July 2003.&nbsp; This dispute arose from differences in interpretation of key terms in a contract between SingTel and SCV.&nbsp; The decision set out the principles for the resolution of the dispute in a way that fulfilled the consumers' need for cable connection while ensuring that the commercial interests of both parties to the private contract were not compromised.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Working Group comprising senior management from SingTel and SCV with the InfoComm Development Authority playing a facilitative role was formed to guide the implementation of the decision.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 445<p> The Group meets regularly to discuss details of implementation and to resolve the practical and other difficulties they encounter in carrying out their contractual commitments.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry closely monitors the developments at the Working Group and we are satisfied with the progress and results achieved by the Working Group, even if not all issues have been completely resolved at this stage.&nbsp; We note that the Working Group has enabled SingTel and SCV to exercise greater flexibility on operational procedures and interconnection matters. &nbsp; This collaborative approach adopted by the Working Group has enabled 30,800 homes to be connected.&nbsp; The Working Group will continue to ensure that the remaining unconnected homes can be cabled up in the most expeditious manner.&nbsp; The Group has updated my Ministry that this number is around 20,000 homes as at 30th January 2004.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the deadline for the completion of cable roll-out, the initial target of nationwide cable roll-out was attained by SCV in September 1999, as stated in its licence.&nbsp; Moving forward, stipulating a fixed deadline as a condition in SCV's licence is not practical as there will be a constant flow of new HDB and private developments being completed.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my Ministry's policy on fair competition and access to networks, it is important to take note that unlike in the past, our telecommunications licensees are now operating in a highly competitive environment.&nbsp; In line with the overarching goal of enhancing <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s economic competitiveness, pro-competition policies and approaches should be allowed to prevail whenever viable.&nbsp; Hence, we must bear in mind that the issue at hand is fundamentally a contractual dispute between two commercial firms.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 446<p>Therefore, ideally speaking, such disputes should be best left to the contracting parties and market dynamics to resolve.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we also acknowledge that competition alone does not always assure us efficient delivery of services.&nbsp; There are situations when Government regulatory intervention may be needed.&nbsp; But even then, it is imperative that the level of regulation used be judiciously calibrated to achieve policy objectives.&nbsp; In doing so, we must guard against tendencies to fall back on heavy handed regulatory intervention at the first instance.&nbsp; In the rapidly changing and still evolving infocomm sector, excessive regulation could distort commercial operations, stifle enterprise, and even undermine consumer interests in the long run.&nbsp; Hence, it is necessary to strike a balance between regulatory intervention and respect for private contractual arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, let me assure the House that my Ministry and the InfoComm Development Authority will continue to work with SingTel and SCV to ensure expeditious provision of cable services to residential properties.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But those households without access to cable vision had no access to such messages.&nbsp; How do we ensure that if there are other such national messages to be broadcast, that these currently 20,000 households will not be left out of such messages broadcast?</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In fact, homes that have no access to cable vision can still access free-to-air channels through the terrestrial broadcast.&nbsp; So, there is nothing&nbsp;to stop us from conveying important messages through the free-to-air television channels which are available to all Singaporean households.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the special SARS channel, it may well have&nbsp;been - I am not sure -&nbsp;put out as a free-to-air-channel which is accessible to anybody who is connected to cable vision.&nbsp; Those homes that do not have the connection may not have access, but the messages can also be conveyed through the other channels or free-to-air terrestrial broadcast, radio and, of course, the printed media, the newspapers.&nbsp; So, it is not as if cable vision is the only channel for us to communicate important public information and messages to our people.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I propose that a provision of $2,245,600 be supported for Class I expenditure for FY 2004.&nbsp; Class&nbsp;I expenditure would cover the President's salary, his entertainment allowance and the acting President's allowance.&nbsp; The lower provision is to cater for the wage cuts which have been applied to the Privy Purse since November 2001 with the agreement of the President and which are in line with the wage cuts for political appointments.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision for Class II&nbsp; expenditure is meant for the salaries of the Istana personnel.&nbsp; The provision is lower at $2,376,300 because of wage cuts and a further reduction in the CPF contribution rate for employers from FY 2004.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A provision of $941,600 is required for Class III expenditure to meet the expenses of the Istana's household.&nbsp; This provision is slightly lower than the amount required in FY 2003.&nbsp; A higher provision of $11,500 for IT-related expenses is required for Class IV expenditure.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; tab-stops: 36.0pt\">In the last six years, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> economy experienced more volatility and uncertainty than it had encountered over the previous 30 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning with the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, a series of external shocks buffeted our economy and ended a decade of uninterrupted growth.&nbsp; We were all hoping for a quick turnaround last year, as our economy had bounced back quickly from previous downturns.&nbsp; But SARS and the war in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> dashed our hopes.&nbsp; We had a very difficult first half.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 455<p><p class=\"PtIParaChar\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; tab-stops: 36.0pt\">But the economy showed clear signs of turning around towards the end of the year. In the fourth quarter, GDP expanded by 4.9% compared to the previous year.&nbsp; On an annualised quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP grew by 11%, with the manufacturing sector expanding by 17% and the services sector by 11%.&nbsp; This brought growth for the whole year to 1.1%.&nbsp; The recovery was reflected in increased exports, investments and employment.</p><p class=\"PtIParaChar\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; tab-stops: 36.0pt\">Both manufacturing and services benefited from an increasingly favourable external environment.&nbsp; As the recoveries in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> gained momentum, their appetite for imports increased. Our non-oil domestic exports grew by 15% in 2003, driven by pharmaceuticals, chemicals and semiconductors.&nbsp; Strong external demand also caused the wholesale and retail sector to grow by 6.7%.</p><p class=\"PtIParaChar\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; tab-stops: 36.0pt\">Foreign direct investments (FDIs) began to return to the region as the fears and uncertainties from SARS and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> war subsided.&nbsp; Last year, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> attracted $7.5 billion of fixed asset investments in the manufacturing sector and $1.9 billion of annual business spending in the services sector.&nbsp; These investments will generate $8.6&nbsp;billion in value-added each year for the economy. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"PtIParaChar\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; tab-stops: 36.0pt\">Employment also improved.&nbsp; More jobs opened up as companies regained the confidence to start hiring again.&nbsp; About 12,000 jobs were created in the second half of 2003, partially making up for the 30,000 jobs lost in the first half. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped from the peak of 5.5% in September to 4.5% in December 2003.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"PtIParaChar\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; tab-stops: 36.0pt\">Macroeconomic policies helped support the economy.&nbsp; MAS maintained a neutral policy stance for the trade-weighted exchange rate of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> <p align=left>Column: 456<p>dollar, after re-centering the policy band at a lower level.&nbsp; The Government introduced two off-budget fiscal packages to support the economy, and help households and businesses tide through a difficult period.&nbsp; We had a SARS relief package in May, and another package to accompany the CPF changes in September. These prompt measures helped to maintain confidence, buffer the shocks, and boost economic activity. In the absence of support from monetary and fiscal policies, GDP growth last year might have been flat instead of 1.1%.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595898\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568539\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486915\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425757\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122400\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437944\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865365\"><B><I>2004 - Gathering</I></B></a> <B><I>Momentum</I></B></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">Our recovery is picking up. There is a palpable optimism among Singaporeans and businesses. The December Straits Times Consumer Confidence Index surged 82 points to 294, bringing it close to its levels in 2000, when the economy was growing strongly.&nbsp; Retail sales in December rose by 21% month-on-month and 10% year-on-year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">We have revised our growth forecast for this year upwards to 3.5-5.5%.&nbsp; But we have to look beyond the cyclical pickup in our growth rate, and achieve sustained long-term growth by transforming our economy. That will depend on our ability to carry through our economic restructuring, upgrade our industries, and create new and better jobs to replace the old jobs that are being phased out.&nbsp; Our commitment to restructuring is a key reason why analysts and investors are confident about <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s long-term prospects, and why MNCs still want to put their projects in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">The Economic Review Committee's recommendations, the CPF changes, the cut in direct taxes, and wage reform lay the foundations for a globalised, diversified, and entrepreneurial economy.&nbsp; These fundamental changes reflect our <p align=left>Column: 457<p>resolve to stay relevant in an increasingly competitive world.&nbsp; Let me review our progress in restructuring, and what more needs to be done.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595899\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568540\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486916\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425758\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865366\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437945\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63771962\"><B><I>Growing Manufacturing and Services</I></B></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">First, we continue to grow the manufacturing and services sectors. We are strengthening our position as a global business hub and one of the most attractive places in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place> for investments and talent.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> remains competitive as a manufacturing location, especially for high-tech, high value-added activities. In the past year, many MNCs have either committed to expand their existing activities, or to establish regional headquarters in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; For example, Hewlett-Packard recently decided to invest another US$1&nbsp;billion in the next five years to expand its operations. ST Microelectronics has announced $425&nbsp;million of new investment commitments; Seagate Technologies announced a $200 million investment in recording media and $300&nbsp;million in high-end hard disk drives; and Agilent Technologies has committed to another $156 million of investments.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">However, overall the manufacturing sector is not likely to generate many more jobs.&nbsp; MNCs are shifting to higher value-added, less labour-intensive activities, and will increase output per worker rather than hire more workers. So to create jobs for Singa\u00adporeans, we also need to put strong emphasis on the services sector.&nbsp; We are developing established services such as trading and logistics, info-communications technology, financial services and tourism; while fostering emerging services such as education, healthcare and the creative sector.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">More so than manufacturing, a vibrant services sector depends on<p align=left>Column: 458<p> people - including foreign professionals, executives, businessmen, technicians, tourists and consumers - being able to travel in and out of Singapore with minimum hassle.&nbsp; In particular, we must facilitate travel for visitors from ASEAN, as well as from <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> does not require entry visas for visitors from most countries. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has reviewed our remaining visa requirements.&nbsp; As a result, we lifted visa requirements for visitors from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Laos</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> last year. &nbsp; We have also made it easier for businessmen to obtain long-term Multiple Journey Visas (MJVs), valid for up to five years. We will allow reputable Chinese and Indian companies to recommend their own staff for MJVs.&nbsp; Social visitors from the PRC are now granted visas valid for up to five weeks compared to three weeks before, while the period of stay granted is now up to 30 days, double the previous 14 days. &nbsp; Similar facilities are also granted for visitors from <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Myanmar</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the Commonwealth of Independent States. &nbsp; Since the beginning of this year, we have proliferated the visa application points for PRC travellers, from 67 branch offices operated by 3 appointed travel agents, to 322 branch offices operated by 43 appointed travel agents across <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; <st1:City><st1:place>ICA</st1:place></st1:City> is exploring other innovative measures, such as on-line visa applications, to facilitate the entry of bona fide visitors to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">The easier visa rules will attract more tourists here. &nbsp; Visitor arrivals have already recovered to pre-SARS levels.&nbsp; This year, STB expects 7.6&nbsp;million visitors, up from 6.1 million last year.&nbsp; STB is stepping up marketing efforts to regional countries such as <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and ASEAN.&nbsp; Last year saw the largest foreign direct investment in a visitor attraction in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> - the $200 million \"Singapore Flyer\".&nbsp; Sentosa Development Corporation has also drawn up a 10-year, $8 billion <p align=left>Column: 459<p>plan to revamp and refresh Sentosa.&nbsp; It has been aggressively drawing in projects and has already attracted about $500 million of new investments, half of them from the private sector.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">We have also done well promoting other service industries.&nbsp; Globally, many MNCs are centralising and outsourcing their corporate functions.&nbsp; To save costs and ensure business continuity, banks are relocating many functions, traditionally performed in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>, <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> and <st1:City><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:City>, elsewhere in the world.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is attracting many call centres and business process outsourcing (BPO) operations.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singa\u00adpore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is not a competitive location for call centres, but we are an attractive site for support centres hosting higher-end activities, particularly for financial institutions.&nbsp; Over the past year, 10 banks, including Credit Suisse First Boston and Barclays Capital, have centralised their regional and even global processing operations here.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">Outside the financial sector, we attracted over 30 shared services and BPO projects last year.&nbsp; For example, <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>'s largest software company SAP chose <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as the launch market for its Shared Services Centre in the Asia Pacific.&nbsp; Polaris and IBM have set up disaster recovery operations here.&nbsp; Toyota Tsusho, ExxonMobil and DFS are all using <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a centre for shared services and business continuity activities.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">In healthcare, EDB has launched the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Singapore Medicine</i> initiative to develop <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> into a leading destination for healthcare services.&nbsp; <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Singapore Medicine</i> will bring together the efforts of many public sector agencies, including MOH and STB.&nbsp; One pre-condition to make <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> a regional medical hub is to have enough doctors, particularly specialists, who can practise in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; To ensure this, MOH has expanded the list of recognised foreign universities and <p align=left>Column: 460<p>medical schools from 24 to 71.&nbsp; To alleviate the shortage of nurses, MOH will continue to recruit nurses from diverse sources, and streamline the recognition of nursing qualifications from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Myanmar</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; In addition, MOH will relax many current restrictions on advertising by healthcare institutions so that they can promote themselves in the region.&nbsp; A new set of Publicity Rules will be gazetted within the next few months.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595900\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568541\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486917\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425759\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122402\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865367\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437946\"><B><I>Labour</I></B></a><B><I>&nbsp;</I></B> <a name=\"_Toc64437946\"><a name=\"_Toc64437946\"><B><I>Market</I></B></a> <a name=\"_Toc64437946\"><B><I>Reforms</I></B></a></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">The second strategy we are pursuing is to reform our labour market so that companies and workers can respond to fast-changing business conditions. &nbsp; The CPF changes and the ongoing push for wage reform are important parts of this effort.&nbsp; They will help to preserve existing jobs and create new ones for Singaporeans.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595901\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568542\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486918\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425760\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122403\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865368\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437947\"><I>CPF Changes</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">We made major changes to our CPF scheme last year to maintain our cost competitiveness.&nbsp; Employer contribution rates were reduced, and the CPF salary ceiling will be brought down in steps.&nbsp; This has lightened the burden on employers and made <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> workers more competitive.&nbsp; At the same time, we are raising the CPF Minimum Sum and tightening withdrawal rules at age 55, so that Singaporeans will be better prepared for their retirement needs.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595902\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568543\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486919\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425761\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122404\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865369\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437948\"><I>Wage Flexibility</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">The CPF changes are long term structural adjustments, not tactical responses to transient conditions. &nbsp; They will strengthen our competitiveness, but we still cannot be sure that our wage levels will never become too high again one day. &nbsp; Should this happen, we should <p align=left>Column: 461<p>not bank on another large cut in CPF rates to restore our competitiveness, as we did in 1985 and 1998. &nbsp; The CPF is a blunt tool for cost reduction.&nbsp; And now that we have reduced the rate to 33%, there is less room for further reduction.&nbsp; This makes it more important to have flexible wage structures, so that companies can respond quickly to changes in the business environment.&nbsp; This will help companies stay viable and preserve jobs in a severe downturn, while giving them the confidence to reward workers and increase employment in good times.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">I am happy that the tripartite Taskforce on Wage Restructuring has given strong backing to wage reform. &nbsp; Its report explains clearly how companies can implement wage restructuring for greater flexibility and competitiveness. &nbsp; Achieving wage flexibility will require strong commitment from employers, unions and workers.&nbsp; Employers must put in place schemes that link remuneration to individual and company performances.&nbsp; Unions must take a broad long-term view of workers' interests, and persuade them of the benefits of these changes.&nbsp; Finally, workers must recognise that in a more volatile and competitive environment, flexible wage structures offer the best chance of job security.&nbsp; We must make a concerted effort to achieve our wage reform targets.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595903\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568544\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486920\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425762\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122405\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865370\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437949\"><I>Training and Upgrading</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">Even as the economy recovers, we must not let up on retraining and upgrading our workers.&nbsp; This will enable our workers to seize new opportunities and adapt to the changing needs of the economy.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">The Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will strive to upgrade the skills of workers, especially those with secondary education or less, so that they <p align=left>Column: 462<p>can stay employable and take on new, higher-skilled jobs.&nbsp; WDA will launch new training programmes, and make it easier for workers to enrol in them.&nbsp; There will also be programmes for professionals, managers and executives, so that they can support the upgrading of their industries.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">These programmes are partly financed by the Skills Development Fund (SDF), which employers contribute to through the Skills Development Levy (SDL).&nbsp; The 1% levy applies to all workers with a gross monthly salary of $1,500 or less.&nbsp; The current levy rate and salary ceiling are not enough for the SDF to cover its annual commitments. &nbsp; Had the Government not injected $500 million into the SDF in 2001, the fund might have been exhausted by now. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">Over the next five years, WDA estimates that the SDF's annual commitment will rise from $120 million for 600,000 training places in FY03 to $176 million for 766,000 places in FY08.&nbsp; MOM will therefore raise the SDL salary ceiling from $1,500 to $1,800 with effect from <st1:date Month=\"7\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2004\">1st July 2004</st1:date>.&nbsp; The levy rate will stay at 1%. &nbsp; This will increase SDF's income by $22&nbsp;million per year.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595904\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568545\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486921\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425763\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122406\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865371\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437950\"><I>Foreign Workers</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">When the Asian Crisis struck, the Govern\u00adment reduced foreign worker levy rates temporarily, to save costs for employers. &nbsp; As the economy recovers, the Government needs to progressively adjust levy rates to reflect the prevailing market conditions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">The levy for skilled Work Permit holders is currently $30, reduced from $100 previously.&nbsp; As part of the changes to the foreign worker scheme for the construction sector, MOM increased the construction skilled worker levy to $50 with effect from <st1:date Month=\"7\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2004\">1st July 2004</st1:date>.&nbsp; In line with this, MOM will also raise the skilled <p align=left>Column: 463<p>worker levy rate to $50 in all other sectors, with effect from <st1:date Month=\"7\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2004\">1st July 2004</st1:date>. &nbsp; The levy rates for unskilled workers will remain unchanged.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">For our economy to grow, companies must be able to recruit skilled workers.&nbsp; The higher value and skill-based industries we are attracting all depend heavily on skilled workers, technicians and professionals. &nbsp; A particular concern is manpower at the diploma and post-secondary level.&nbsp; If we lack these middle-tier skilled workers - whether local or foreign - we will choke off the growth of these industries or drive them elsewhere.&nbsp; The shortfalls are already evident in healthcare where there is an acute shortage of nurses, in the IT industry where we lack computer programmers and IT technicians, and in aerospace and pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">MOM will modify the current work pass system to meet this demand for middle-level skilled manpower. &nbsp; We will introduce a new category of work passes, called 'S' passes, to replace the current 'Q2' passes.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">The main criteria for an 'S' pass will be a minimum salary of $1,800 and an acceptable tertiary qualification.&nbsp; MOM will supplement these two criteria with a system of points, to take into account experience, skills and job type when assessing eligibility. &nbsp; The 'S' pass will be subject to a quota, to begin with 5%, as well as a levy, initially set at $50. &nbsp; The scheme will be implemented from <st1:date Month=\"7\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2004\">1st July 2004</st1:date>.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595905\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568546\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486922\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425764\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122407\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865372\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437951\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63771964\"><B><I>Encouraging Entrepreneurship</I></B></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">A third major strategy is to boost entrepreneurship.&nbsp; This process takes time, because we are not just changing Government rules, but seeking to shift mindsets.&nbsp; The Government is doing its utmost to foster a conducive environ<p align=left>Column: 464<p>ment for entrepreneurship.&nbsp; The Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE), chaired by Minister of State Mr Raymond Lim, is nurturing entrepreneurship, pursuing entrepreneurship promotion programmes, and acting as the interface between the private sector and Government.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">A key hurdle facing start-ups is financing. &nbsp; The Government is helping start-ups gain access to financing.&nbsp; EDB's Start-up EnterprisE Development Scheme (SEEDS) helps early-stage start-ups with equity financing.&nbsp; Every dollar raised by a start-up from third-party investors will be matched by EDB up to a maximum of $300,000.&nbsp; In two years SEEDS has raised nearly $59 million - $27.3 million from Government and $31.6 million from the private sector - to support 103 innovative start-ups. &nbsp; We also recently established Deal Flow Connection, an online portal that helps link up entrepreneurs with financial institutions, venture capitalists and angel investors.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto\">The Government is also helping our entrepreneurs to venture beyond our shores.&nbsp; We have negotiated many FTAs, including those with key economic partners like the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, to improve access to these markets.&nbsp; Our businessmen can now tender for projects contracted out by the governments of our FTA partners, on an equal footing with their local companies.&nbsp; IE Singapore actively promotes the development of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s external wing.&nbsp; It helps local enterprises take advantage of government-to-government agreements, such as air services agreements, investment guarantee agreements, and avoidance of double taxation agreements. &nbsp; IE Singapore also recently launched the iPartners Programme to encourage companies to band together when venturing overseas.&nbsp; Already, this programme has helped three consortia of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies to venture into <st1:place>East Asia</st1:place>, <st1:place>Africa</st1:place> and the <st1:place>Middle East</st1:place>.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 465<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">To bring in entrepreneurial talent, MOM launched the EntrePass Scheme. &nbsp; Entrepreneurs can set up operations in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> on the basis of their business plans, rather than academic qualifications or salary.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The Government is also reviewing its rules and licensing requirements to ensure that bureaucracy does not stifle enterprise in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; To date, the Pro-Enterprise Panel has reviewed 1,080 suggestions, of which it has accepted 57%.&nbsp; The Rules Review Panel is also making headway.&nbsp; In the past year, the Panel reviewed 2,913 rules, 23% of the total. &nbsp; It removed 373 rules, updated 772, and re-affirmed the remaining 1,818. &nbsp; By 2005, public agencies will have reviewed all their existing rules, to remove outdated ones and streamline the rest.&nbsp; It does not mean that the job is then done.&nbsp; Thereafter, it will be time to start reviewing all the rules again. &nbsp; Our plan is to review all rules regularly, on a rolling five-year cycle.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">However, the Government can only do so much to create a Best for Business environment. &nbsp; Ultimately, entrepreneurs need to take their own risks and develop their own ideas, in order to create and seize new opportunities in overseas markets.&nbsp; Entrepreneurship is, ultimately, a challenge for our whole society.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595906\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568547\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486923\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425765\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122408\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865373\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437952\"><B><I>Enhancing Competition</I></B></a></p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">A fourth major strategy is to promote competition and free markets in all sectors of the economy.&nbsp; Competition spurs firms to be more efficient and innovative, and more responsive to customer needs.&nbsp; It prepares our firms to be internationally competitive and to hold their own in the region. &nbsp; Consumers enjoy wider choice and better products and services, and often lower prices.&nbsp; The economy as a whole gains from higher productivity and more efficient allocation of resources and,<p align=left>Column: 466<p> in the longer term, also from more innovation and job creation.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">This is why our basic economic stance is pro-competition.&nbsp; Right from the start, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singa\u00adpore</st1:place></st1:country-region> was a free port. &nbsp; For trade in goods, when we first began industrialising in the 1960s, we did impose entry barriers and import tariffs to protect domestic industries, but we soon abandoned this infant industry argument and shifted to an open competitive regime.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">For services, we pursued the same policy of open competition in wholesale and retail trade, IT and business services. &nbsp; In other industries like telecommunications and power generation, we used to operate vertically integrated state-owned monopolies, like many other countries. &nbsp; But in the last 10 years, we have moved a long way from that model. &nbsp; We privatised statutory boards, deregulated the industries and opened them up to competition. &nbsp; In the financial sector too, we have liberalised and freed up, causing a major transformation of the industry.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">However, fostering competition is not always the same as taking a passive, hands-off approach. &nbsp; Sometimes, we need to intervene to structure the industry to allow competition. &nbsp; Otherwise, instead of healthy competition, we may end up with one or two players wielding monopoly power to the detriment of consumers.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">Take the telecommunications industry as an example, which is now fully liberalised. &nbsp; Competition in that market has increased significantly, especially in mobile and wholesale international call services. &nbsp; But IDA still needs to act as a referee, because several segments of the telecommunications market are not or cannot be effectively competitive, as in the case of \"last mile\" access infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp; IDA's role is to guard against abuses of market power, and to<p align=left>Column: 467<p> set rules which help smaller players connect to infrastructure provided by larger players.&nbsp; IDA's regulations seek to keep the market contestable, and ensure that competition produces benefits for consumers over the long-run.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto\">Or take the power industry. &nbsp; Singa\u00adpore Power was an integrated monopoly operator, generating, distributing and selling electricity and gas to every home and factory.&nbsp; To introduce competition, we first had to split up Singa\u00adpore Power into several different companies, create the right regulatory framework and set up the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to oversee the industry.&nbsp; We made each power plant a separate generating company (genco), competing against other plants. &nbsp; We created a sophisticated mechanism for the gencos to bid to sell electricity into the grid, called the pooling and settlement system. &nbsp; As for the power grid, which is a natural monopoly, we made it a separate, tightly regulated company. &nbsp; Only then were we ready to have different suppliers compete to sell electricity to consumers, starting with the large consumers. &nbsp; The process has taken eight years, and is still not quite complete.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;

So we have only three local banks, two media groups and two public transport operators. &nbsp; Our market simply cannot support more players. &nbsp; We cannot manage such industries in the same way as we would the retail trade with thousands of players.&nbsp; We have to accept that in these circumstances, limited competition or even sometimes a single operator is the best arrangement, and find other ways to prevent the companies from exploiting their position or becoming inefficient and uncompetitive.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">The container port business is such an industry. &nbsp; In this case, the relevant market <p align=left>Column: 468<p>extends beyond <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Today, transhipment is an international business.&nbsp; Within our neighbourhood alone, Tanjong Pelapas, Port Klang and Laem Chabang, are all vying to replace PSA as the hub port for <st1:place>Southeast Asia</st1:place>.&nbsp;

Only then can the private sector grow and create wealth for the people.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Fiscal prudence has been a hallmark of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singa\u00adpore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s economic management. &nbsp; Some people accuse us of being too prudent, but we must continue to maintain fiscal prudence, despite stronger spending pressures and tighter budgets.&nbsp; We will spend more in a downturn if we need to, even if it means going into temporary deficit, as we have done in the past two years. But we must never fall into the trap of structural budget deficits, with a permanent shortfall of revenue. On average, over the course of the business cycle, we aim to accumulate a modest surplus, putting aside something in good years so that we have some savings to draw upon in bad years.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595910\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568551\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486927\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425769\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122412\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865377\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437956\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63857794\"><B><I>Living Within Our</I></B></a>&nbsp;<B><I>Means</I></B></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">In order to live within our means, we must keep Government expenses in check.&nbsp; This means confining the Government to essential functions and preventing the bureaucracy from bloating up. This will also free up talent and resources for the private sector, and create space for private initiative and enterprise.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The Ministry of Finance (MOF) controls the budgets of Ministries by <p align=left>Column: 471<p>capping their spending as a percentage of GDP.&nbsp; To provide some stability in spending from year to year, the budgets are pegged to a six-year average of GDP growth.&nbsp; And to provide flexibility, MOF allows ministries to take advances from future years' budgets, and accumulate and carry forward unused funds to subsequent years.&nbsp; This way, ministries can plan on a multi-year basis instead of being limited by yearly expenditure limits.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">MOF will also extract 'productivity dividends' from the operating budgets of all ministries, with effect from FY04.&nbsp; Instead of allowing ministry budgets to grow at the same rate as GDP, MOF will reduce the ministry budgets by a percentage equal to the productivity growth rate, and collect the sums into a central pool. The aim is to encourage ministries to improve their productivity by at least as much as the private sector, and to free up resources to fund new priority projects.&nbsp; For example, MOE will receive additional funds for preschool education and special needs education, while MITA will receive funds to develop the creative industries.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595911\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568552\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486928\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425770\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122413\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865378\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437957\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63857795\"><B><I>Revised FY 2003 Budget Estimates</I></B></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">I will now review the FY03 Budget.

This was due to lower contract costs and construction delays, as well as cancellation or deferment of projects.&nbsp; The more significant items of under or deferred expenditure are MND's SERS programme ($59 million), the Singa\u00adpore Management University campus (about $60 million) and the new Supreme Court building ($58 million). While about $600 million worth of construction projects were brought forward in the September 2003 off-budget package, most will start only in FY04 and have thus not led to an increase in spending in FY03.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The revised FY03 budget estimates also include supplementary estimates of about $125 million for six Heads of Expenditure, the bulk of which goes to MTI ($61 million) for the Utilities Save scheme, which was extended in the September package.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595912\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568553\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486929\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425771\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122414\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865379\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437958\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63857796\"><B><I>Projected FY 2004 Fiscal Position</I></B></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The Government faces a very tight fiscal position in FY04.&nbsp; Operating revenues should rise, but so will spending needs. &nbsp; Despite the improved economy, we still project a budget deficit.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">To reduce the revenue shortfall, I am permanently cutting by 2% the budget caps of all ministries except MINDEF, from this financial year.&nbsp; This will save about $450 million a year. &nbsp; More importantly, it will instill financial discipline by encouraging ministries to reprioritise their projects and cut non-essential expenditures.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">I am treating MINDEF differently from the other ministries because defence<p align=left>Column: 473<p> provides the peace and security that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> needs for economic progress.&nbsp; Government has therefore for many years been prepared to spend up to 6% of GDP on defence.&nbsp; In practice, in recent years defence spending has been 4.5% to 5% of GDP.&nbsp; I will maintain this policy.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The 2% expenditure cut will trim the projected FY04 budget deficit to $700 million, smaller than the $1.8 billion deficit in FY03.&nbsp; This is not inappropriate, as the economic recovery is still in its early stages.&nbsp; But I intend to balance the budget by FY05, assuming the recovery continues on track.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">It would therefore be prudent for all ministries to assume that their budgets will continue to be tight, and that they will need to find more economies and do more with less.&nbsp; Barring exceptional conditions, next year (FY05) I intend to apply a further across-the-board cut of 2% on average in the budget cap of each ministry, except MINDEF.&nbsp; I am confident that ministries will make full use of this early notice to adjust their plans and work within the resources available.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Let me now present the FY04 Budget, which is summarised in the last column of the table.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Projected operating revenue is $28.3 billion or 16.6% of GDP.&nbsp; Receipts from GST are estimated to increase by $700 million as a result of the increase in the GST rate from 4% to 5%.&nbsp; Collection from property taxes is also projected to increase by $400 million because the concession period for rebates ended in December 2003, while statutory boards' contributions in lieu of tax are projected to increase by $776 million.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The total supported expenditure is $30.4 billion or 17.9% of GDP. &nbsp; This is an increase of $1.6 billion or 5.6% from the<p align=left>Column: 474<p>FY03 revised expenditure. &nbsp; Larger budgets for MINDEF and MOT account for two-thirds of this increase.&nbsp; MINDEF has to incur additional expenditure for new functions that need to be undertaken due to the current security situation. &nbsp; MOT requires additional funds to finance the construction of the Circle Line and the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sectoral distribution of the budget* remains largely unchanged, with the largest share of the budget still going to Social Development (44.0%), followed by Security and External Relations (37.0%), Economic Development (13.4%) and Government Administration (5.6%).</p><p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Last year, I announced that MOF would introduce Best Sourcing for new services. &nbsp; Best Sourcing requires public sector agencies to undertake \"market-testing\" so as to compare the cost of providing their services in-house against the cost of having private sector vendors provide the services.&nbsp; If the private sector vendor can deliver the services more economically, it will be engaged to do so. &nbsp; The public sector agency will then discontinue the function, and either redeploy or release the affected staff.</p><p align=left>Column: 475<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The services that are being market-tested include facilities management, IT services, business investigation, enforcement, and procurement functions.&nbsp; Agencies which have started Best Sourcing include MOH, URA and HDB. &nbsp; The functions that they have \"best sourced\" and subsequently contracted out in FY03 resulted in $17&nbsp;million worth of contracts for the private sector.&nbsp; The annual cost savings from outsourcing these functions are estimated to be $1.8 million per year. &nbsp; The numbers are still small, but it is an encouraging start.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">In FY04, we will extend the Best Sourcing programme to non-core functions. &nbsp; An overall target of 5% of the value of non-core functions will be market-tested this year by ministries, Organs of State and statutory boards.&nbsp; Public sector agencies are understandably cautious, but MOF will encourage them to be bolder and move faster, so as to benefit earlier from Best Sourcing, without affecting the smooth delivery of services to the public.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595915\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568556\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486932\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425774\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122417\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865382\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437961\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63857799\"><I>Cut Waste Panel</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">The Cut Waste Panel was established last year to seek feedback from the public on how the public sector can reduce wasteful practices, remove frills and reap savings in the delivery of public services. &nbsp; The response has been overwhelming.&nbsp; So far we have received more than 2,200 suggestions.&nbsp; I am not sure how many are from the MPs.&nbsp; The Panel, chaired by the Head of Civil Service, agreed with almost 85% of the suggestions and feedback. &nbsp; Many suggestions had already been implemented earlier though the public may not have been aware of them.&nbsp; But we also received valuable new suggestions. &nbsp; For example, one writer pointed out that even after late payments for foreign worker levy had been cleared, the Work Permit Department was still sending reminders via registered mail, which was a waste of money. &nbsp; The Department has<p align=left>Column: 476<p> responded to this suggestion by developing a more efficient tracking method to ensure that once a late payment is settled, reminders are no longer sent out.&nbsp; This has saved $187,000 a year.&nbsp; The Cut Waste Panel is an on-going effort and we look forward to more suggestions from the public.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595916\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568557\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486933\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425775\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122418\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865383\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437962\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63857800\"><I>Economy Drive</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm;

The proportion of each cohort entering local universities will increase from 21% today to 25% by 2010.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, good university education is not cheap.&nbsp; One-quarter (24%) of our education budget goes to the university sector. More students entering university, more good professors, and more overseas attachments for students can only mean more spending on university education. &nbsp; The Government's total spending (operating and development expenditure) on universities has already grown from $1.11&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $1.56 billion in 2002, a 41% increase in five years, mainly because of larger student enrolments.&nbsp; If this trend continues, we will be forced to squeeze resources from primary and secondary education in order to fund university education.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not desirable. &nbsp; From the economic point of view, universal primary and secondary education benefits society much more than it benefits individuals. &nbsp; Society as a whole is better off when everyone is literate, equipped with basic skills, and able to become a good citizen. &nbsp; He can be a good colleague, good neighbour, good fellow national serviceman.&nbsp; The whole society gains.&nbsp; Hence it is sound public policy to subsidise primary and secondary education heavily. &nbsp; In contrast, the benefit of a university education accrues mostly to the individual. &nbsp; A rigorous and relevant university degree will make the graduate more employable, and enable him to earn much more during his working life.&nbsp; Furthermore, only the top 25% of the cohort will make it to university, unlike schools, polytechnics or institutes of technical education. &nbsp; The argument for funding university education heavily from general taxation is therefore much weaker.</p><p align=left>Column: 483<p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the universities' perspective, it is better for them to be less reliant on the Government for funding. &nbsp; The more universities raise their own funds from fees and donations, the more autonomous they will be, the more flexibly they can respond to student needs and market demands, and the better placed they are to achieve academic excellence. &nbsp; This has been the experience all over the world.&nbsp; In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>, universities are funded mainly through Government grants, and the result has been mediocrity and declining standards.&nbsp; In contrast, US universities have to compete actively for both state and private funding, on the basis of quality. &nbsp; American students pay higher fees, and take student loans to a much larger extent than European students.&nbsp; The <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> universities have produced peaks of excellence unmatched in any other country, and higher standards overall.&nbsp; The <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a large country and its multi-tiered model of state and private universities cannot be replicated here. &nbsp; But we should move in the direction of greater competition and self-reliance to allow our universities to achieve excellence.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore fair to ask undergraduates to pay for a larger part of their university education themselves. They do not necessarily have to pay while studying, but can do so later when they are working and earning stable incomes.&nbsp; With this approach, no student should miss a university education because he cannot afford it. &nbsp; We will make sure of this through generous scholarships to outstanding under\u00adgraduates, bursaries for those from low-income homes, and student loans readily available to all who need them.&nbsp; That we can promise.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current formula is for undergraduates to pay 25% of the operating costs of university education. &nbsp; The Govern\u00adment pays for the remaining 75%, and also bears in full the <p align=left>Column: 484<p>infrastructure costs of our universities, which is substantial.&nbsp; Going forward, we need to establish a more sustainable and equitable cost-sharing formula between the state and university students.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be no university fee increases this academic year. &nbsp; However, MOE and the universities are reviewing the basis for setting university fees in future, and expect to reach some conclusions this year.&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65595923\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568564\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486940\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425781\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122424\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865389\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437968\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63857805\"><B><I>Keeping Healthcare</I></B></a><B><I>&nbsp;Affordable</I></B></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our publicly funded hospitals provide quality care to all Singaporeans, at an affordable cost. &nbsp; But advances in medical technology, while enhancing healthcare, continue to push up its cost. &nbsp; For example, in 1990, the standard treatment for blocked heart arteries was angioplasty.&nbsp; By 2000, it had progressed to angioplasty with stents.&nbsp; This has lowered the recurrence of blood vessel blockage but has tripled the cost of treatment from $1,300 to $3,500.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our ageing population will put further pressure on the healthcare system and on our ability to finance good healthcare for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; MOH will do its best to contain medical inflation. This requires cooperation and understanding from all stakeholders in the healthcare system.&nbsp; Providers have to cut out inefficiencies and frills.&nbsp; Patients have to be realistic in their expectations.&nbsp; And all Singaporeans should adopt healthy lifestyles.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, Singaporeans have to be responsible for themselves and not rely on the Government to provide for every need. &nbsp; Our healthcare financing framework, based on the 3Ms - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund - has fostered an ethic of self-reliance, kept healthcare spending down, and served us well. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 485<p><p><I><a name=\"_Toc65595924\">Medisave</a>&nbsp;<a name=\"_Toc65595924\"><a name=\"_Toc65595924\">for Self-Employed</a></a></I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally the self-employed did not fall within this 3M framework, because they did not contribute to Medisave. &nbsp; But in 1992 the Government amended the CPF Act to require self-employed individuals who earn above a certain salary - currently $6,000 a year - to make compulsory contributions to their Medisave accounts. &nbsp; We wanted to make sure that the self-employed regularly put aside savings for their health needs and not expose themselves to unnecessary financial risk when they or their families fall ill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, compliance has been patchy. &nbsp; Only 47% of self-employed CPF members have paid their full Medisave contributions. &nbsp; Another 36% have made partial payments, while 17% have not contributed at all, which means that about half of the self-employed are storing up bigger problems for themselves in future by not contributing fully to their Medisave.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henceforth, the CPF Board will enforce Medisave contributions more strictly for self-employed Singaporeans, just as it does with other employers and employees, to ensure that self-employed Singaporeans set aside enough for their health needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65595925\"><I>Health Insurance and MediShield</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With medical costs increasing, so will the risk that large healthcare expenses will exhaust one's own savings.&nbsp; Health insurance schemes can help stretch our Medisave dollars through better pooling of risks. &nbsp; We should therefore supplement Medisave with health insurance schemes which are properly designed to avoid the \"buffet-lunch abuses\" so common in other countries.&nbsp; This will help us to realise portable employer-provided medical <p align=left>Column: 486<p>benefits. &nbsp; MOH is also examining how we can enhance the coverage of MediShield, to give Singaporeans better protection against large bills from catastrophic illnesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65595926\"><I>Means Testing</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides relying more on medical insurance, we also need to target our healthcare subsidies more precisely, to reach those who need them most. &nbsp; Nationally, one-third of the total healthcare expenditure is financed by the Government.&nbsp; In hospitals, many services are subsidised even more.&nbsp; For example, all patients in Class C wards are subsidised 80% of the cost of their stay.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we link the level of subsidies to the class of ward. &nbsp; We do not take into account the patient's ability to pay.&nbsp; A poor patient in a Class C ward enjoys the same 80% subsidy as a high-income patient, even though he needs the subsidy much more.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we continue subsidising healthcare this way, one of two things will happen.&nbsp; Either the Government will have to spend a lot more on healthcare - which means raising taxes, or it must lower the quality of healthcare provided to all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Neither is desirable.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Feedback Group has proposed pegging the amount of subsidy to the financial status of the patient rather than the class of ward, in other words, means testing.&nbsp; It will be more difficult to implement, as we will have to assess the financial means of each patient.&nbsp; But means testing is ultimately more efficient and equitable as it will enable us to focus subsidies on those who need them, and so make the most of our healthcare budget.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Means testing is not new.&nbsp; We already practise it in the step-down care sector. &nbsp; In community hospitals, nursing homes <p align=left>Column: 487<p>and home nursing, patients' incomes are assessed to determine the subsidies they receive.&nbsp; Means testing is also used for primary care services for the elderly who seek treatment in private clinics, through the Primary Care Partnership Scheme.&nbsp; Eligible patients pay the same fees as they would if they had visited the polyclinics.&nbsp; These schemes have been well received and accepted.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH is studying how to extend means testing to general hospitals.&nbsp; MOH will proceed cautiously, so as to gain more experience with means testing and give patients time to adjust. &nbsp; It will need to determine where best to start, because hospital services span a wide range, from inpatient care to day surgery to specialist outpatient care.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with means testing, a high-income patient can opt for B2 or C class treatment, and pay less than for A or B1 class treatment. &nbsp; But when he does so, he will be subsidised less than a poorer patient getting B2 or C class treatment.&nbsp; And I think that is fair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><a name=\"_Toc65595927\">Medisave</a><a name=\"_Toc65595927\"></a>&nbsp;<a name=\"_Toc65595927\">and Medifund Top-ups</a></I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with means testing and enhanced medical insurance, some older Singaporeans will face difficulties in coping with increased medical expenditure and paying their MediShield and Eldershield premiums.&nbsp; Older Singaporeans were midway through their working lives when the Medisave Scheme started in 1984.&nbsp; As a result, they have lower Medisave balances than younger workers. &nbsp; Furthermore, workers aged 50 to 55 will face deeper CPF employer contribution rate cuts in the next two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have therefore decided to top up the Medisave accounts of Singaporeans aged 50 and above.&nbsp; The amount ranges from $50 to $200, and will vary based on age of the recipient and his existing Medisave balance, as shown on the screens*. &nbsp; This<p align=left>Column: 488<p> will cost the Government $104&nbsp;million.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is a serious problem. &nbsp; A declining birth rate will sap the vitality and resilience of our country.</p><p>Over the years, we have introduced many measures to encourage and support parenthood.&nbsp; After our first package in 1987, the total fertility rate (TFR), which reflects the number of children a woman is expected to have during her lifetime, jumped up to 1.96, as seen in the chart*.&nbsp; This was partly because 1988 was a \"Dragon\" year, but the impact of the package was felt through the first half of the 1990s. &nbsp; Unfortunately the effect seems to have worn off over time, and the underlying trend of a falling TFR has reasserted itself. &nbsp; By the next \"Dragon\" year in 2000, the TFR had declined to 1.60. &nbsp; I am not sure what the next dragon will be.&nbsp; It may be a lizard!&nbsp; The Baby Bonus scheme and further generous tax incentives introduced in 2000 have failed to reverse this trend.&nbsp; We give out over $200&nbsp;million annually in tax reliefs and rebates, and more than $100 million has been disbursed under the Baby Bonus scheme.&nbsp; Yet the TFR for 2003 dropped to a historic low of 1.26.&nbsp; This is one of the lowest birth rates in the world.&nbsp; Only 36,000 babies were born last year, far fewer than the 50,000 babies we need to replace ourselves.</p><p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But the underlying downtrend in birth rates is real and will continue unless we take decisive steps now.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Our existing measures are not enough.&nbsp; We must take a more comprehensive approach to solving this problem.&nbsp; We must encourage young people to marry and marry earlier, and make it easier for young couples to start and raise a family.&nbsp; And we have to take a long-term view.&nbsp; The impact of our policies on birth rates may not be felt immediately, because changing attitudes, mindsets and practices take time and patience.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">We need to shift social attitudes towards having children, even while we recognise that having children is a very personal decision which couples have to make for themselves.&nbsp; There is no single magic solution.&nbsp; The approach must be both holistic and coherent, addressing parents' concerns from childbirth through the years of bringing up their children.&nbsp; As these are complex issues that require thorough discussion and deliberation, the Government will study them in depth over the next few months, before deciding on the most effective set of measures.&nbsp; Today I shall set out the principles that will guide our thinking.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Firstly, the aim of our measures must be not just to produce more children, but to produce the next generation of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singa\u00adpore</st1:place></st1:country-region> citizens. &nbsp; We want to grow the total population of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singa\u00adpore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but equally important, we also have to reproduce and maintain the core group of citizens who will build and defend our country, and without whom we would not be a nation. &nbsp; Thus our measures must focus on encouraging more <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> citizen babies.</p><p align=left>Column: 490<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Secondly, the problem is more serious for the mothers who are more educated and earn higher incomes. &nbsp; The higher the woman's career attainment, the less likely she is to get married and the fewer children she is likely to have. &nbsp; This is true not just of graduates, but also of women with secondary education. &nbsp; It is understandable because the more a woman is able to earn a living, the heavier the opportunity cost to her of having children. &nbsp; Therefore while our measures must cover all families, we must especially make sure that the incentives are effective for the better qualified women.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Thirdly, while encouraging procreation is critical, realistically it will be very hard to raise our TFR back to the replacement level of 2.1.&nbsp; Even other countries which have managed to reverse falling birth rates have not achieved replacement fertility.&nbsp; We therefore need to boost our population through other ways. &nbsp; In particular, we need to open our doors to immigrants who can contribute to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singa\u00adpore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; After getting them here, we need to help them settle down and integrate into our society. &nbsp; We need the right policies to encourage them first to become permanent residents (PRs), and then to take up citizenship.&nbsp; This means treating PRs and citizens differently, so that PRs have incentives to take up the privileges and responsibilities of being Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">As for specific measures to encourage procreation, a comprehensive approach should include adequate support facilities such as infant and child care arrangements, better balance between work and family life, and of course financial help measures.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">To start with, we have to consider the issue of maternity leave. &nbsp; We have hitherto been reluctant to increase statutory maternity leave.&nbsp; But many working mothers feel that the current two <p align=left>Column: 491<p>months is too short. &nbsp; A major worry of working mothers is that they will have too little time with their children, particularly in the first few months after birth which are crucial to bonding mother and child.&nbsp; We may need to extend the period of maternity leave, but without overburdening employers with added costs.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Next, when the mother returns to work, she will often want to put her child in affordable and reliable child care facilities.&nbsp; The Government already subsidises child care, but infant care is more expensive.&nbsp; We will therefore look into providing more financial help for infant care.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Next, we need to strike a better balance between work and family life.&nbsp; Many couples cite the lack of family time and flexible working arrangements as an impediment to having more children.&nbsp; As an employer, the Government will review civil service work arrangements, without affecting essential public services. &nbsp;&nbsp; We will set a clear example to companies of how employers can create a work environment that is supportive of families.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Finally, while families should not have babies just because of financial incentives, tax reliefs and rebates for parents and working mothers appreciably lighten the financial burden of bringing up children. &nbsp; We need to simplify and enhance the existing tax incentives, to make them more accessible and attractive to couples.&nbsp; In fact, I find them quite hard to understand too.&nbsp; I think my wife has figured them out.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Two civil service teams visited <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> recently to study how other countries are tackling their falling birth rates. &nbsp; One went to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Netherlands</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and the other to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Sweden</st1:place></st1:country-region>. &nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Sweden</st1:place></st1:country-region> have one model.&nbsp; They are both welfare states and they have succeeded in bringing their birth <p align=left>Column: 492<p>rates up.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Netherlands</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region> have succeeded in bringing their birth rates up.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region> has not.&nbsp; We wanted to know why one worked and the other did not.&nbsp; We will study the lessons drawn and come up with our own measures. &nbsp; As several ministries are involved, I have tasked Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, to take charge and to make specific proposals. &nbsp; He will be assisted by an inter-ministry civil service Working Committee on Population chaired by Mr Eddie Teo, Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office. &nbsp; I have asked the committee to complete its work before National Day.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm\"><a name=\"_Toc65595929\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568566\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486942\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425783\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122426\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865391\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437970\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63857807\"><I><B>Adequate Finances for Retirement</B></I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">With the ageing of our population, we have to ensure that working people put aside enough resources to support themselves in their old age.&nbsp; Today, most of the elderly in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> receive some financial support from their children.&nbsp; But longer life spans, rising singlehood, and low fertility rates are making it harder for old people to rely on their children for support.&nbsp; There is a pressing need to make sure that Singaporeans are self-reliant and financially independent in their old age.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Under the CPF Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme, individuals are allowed to make top-ups to the CPF Retirement Accounts belonging to themselves, their spouses, parents and grandparents. &nbsp; They can make top-ups in cash or out of their CPF Ordinary Account, up to the Minimum Sum in the Retirement Account. &nbsp; Currently, individuals making such cash top-ups enjoy a tax relief of up to $6,000 per year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">With lower CPF contributions and the higher CPF Minimum Sum, we want to encourage more people to voluntarily top up their own or their family members' Retirement Accounts.&nbsp; I am therefore raising the tax relief ceiling on cash top-<p align=left>Column: 493<p>ups from $6,000 to $7,000, with effect from YA 2005.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">Non-working spouses, such as full-time housewives, may also be financially vulnerable in their later years.&nbsp; At present, individuals are not entitled to any tax relief when they make cash top-ups to the Retirement Accounts of their non-working spouses.&nbsp; We should encourage individuals who have the means to contribute to the financial security of their non-working spouses to do so.&nbsp; I will therefore be extending the tax relief to individuals making cash top-ups to non-working spouses who are 55 years old and older, and who earned not more than $2,000 in the preceding year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope these steps will help bolster the financial resilience of Singaporean families.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Lower direct taxes encourage businesses to make new investments and individuals to work hard and achieve.&nbsp; In 2002, Government accepted the ERC's recommendation to lower the corporate tax rate to 20% by Year of Assessment (YA) 2005 and as the first step, brought it down to 22%.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I have decided to reduce the corporate income tax rate to 20% with effect from YA 2005. &nbsp; This is expected to cost the Government $800 million annually. &nbsp; It will make <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> a more attractive business hub, encourage new investments, and spur entrepreneurship.&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65595934\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568571\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486947\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425788\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122433\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865398\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437977\"><I>Deferring the Reduction of Personal Income Tax</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Government had also set the target of lowering the top personal income tax rate to 20% by YA 2005.&nbsp; While this remains our target, the unexpectedly difficult economic conditions in the last two years have forced us to reconsider the timing of the reduction.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">First, our spending commitments have increased, as I explained earlier.&nbsp; To balance the budget by next year, we not only need to tighten our spending, but also to husband our tax revenues.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Second, the delay in raising the GST rate to 5% has dented Government revenues. &nbsp; The extra year taken to phase in the GST increase cost $700 million in revenue foregone, more than the $425 million that would be lost annually if we reduced the top personal income tax rate to 20%.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Third, while we expect stronger growth this year, we are not certain if this will be sustained into FY05 and FY06. &nbsp; Should the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> economy slow down after the Presidential election, our growth and fiscal position will be affected.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I have therefore decided to defer lowering personal income taxes for the<p align=left>Column: 495<p> time being. &nbsp; However, a 20% top personal income tax rate remains the Govern\u00adment's goal. &nbsp; The Government will watch the budgetary position and economic outlook carefully, and will reduce personal taxes as soon as conditions permit.</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65568572\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486948\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425789\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122434\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865399\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437978\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63048230\"></a><a name=\"_Toc62973595\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65595935\"><I>Exempting Individuals' Foreign-sourced Income</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Currently, foreign-sourced income received in Singapore by Singapore resident individuals is subject to tax unless specifically exempted.&nbsp; Last year, I announced a foreign-sourced income exemption regime under which foreign dividends, branch profits and service income are exempt from tax.&nbsp; This mainly benefits <u>companies</u>, with individuals benefiting only insofar as they earn dividends or service income from abroad.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The ERC had recommended that all foreign-sourced <I>personal</I> income remitted to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> be exempted from tax too.&nbsp; This would encourage <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> resident individuals to remit their offshore funds to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> for investment and management.&nbsp; This in turn would boost our private wealth management industry.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I have therefore decided to exempt from tax all foreign-sourced income received in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> by resident individuals from YA 2005.&nbsp; With this change, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> will now tax individuals on a purely territorial basis.&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65486949\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425790\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122435\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865400\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437979\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65595936\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568573\"><I>Exempting Individuals' Singapore-sourced Investment Income</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I have also decided to exempt from tax all Singapore-sourced investment income derived directly by individuals from financial instruments.&nbsp; This will help ensure that the exemption of foreign-sourced income does not bias individuals against investments in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singa\u00adpore</st1:place></st1:country-region><p align=left>Column: 496<p> instruments.&nbsp; More importantly, it will align the tax treatment of different kinds of investment income, and encourage individuals to save and plan for their retirement.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The tax exemption for all financial instruments other than standard deposits, for example bonds, annuities and unit trusts, will take effect from YA 2005. &nbsp; For standard deposits, last year I announced a partial tax exemption on interest income for YA 2005, to be followed by full exemption from YA 2006 onwards.&nbsp; These arrangements still stand.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">These two changes - exempting individuals' foreign-sourced income and exempting Singapore-sourced investment income derived by individuals - will cost the Government about $42 million each year. &nbsp; Details of the scope of both exemptions are set out in <I>Annex B</I>*<I>.</I></p><p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 527-30<BR></span></div><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Companies that have already been here for more than a year will now also be eligible for this scheme.&nbsp; This will strengthen <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s reputation as a prime location for HQ operations and attract more HQ companies to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65595939\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568576\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486952\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425793\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122438\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865403\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437982\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63048234\"></a>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"_Toc62973598\"><I>Pioneer Incentive</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also attract and root new MNC activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, to create <p align=left>Column: 497<p>new jobs and opportunities.&nbsp; This is why, even as we diversify our economy and build up our domestic sector, we must stay attractive to MNCs.&nbsp; But competition for MNC investments has increased in the last decade, making EDB's task more challenging than ever.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response is two-fold. &nbsp; First, our workforce must have the skills and expertise to undertake more knowledge-intensive and higher value-added activities.&nbsp; Second, the package of tax incentives that we offer to MNCs making large investments in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> must remain attractive.&nbsp; To this end, I have decided to extend the maximum duration for the pioneer incentive from <st1:time Hour=\"10\" Minute=\"0\">10</st1:time> to 15 years, with immediate effect.</p><p><a name=\"_Toc65595940\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65568577\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65486953\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65425794\"></a><a name=\"_Toc65122439\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64865404\"></a><a name=\"_Toc64437983\"></a><a name=\"_Toc63048235\"></a>&nbsp;</p><p><a name=\"_Toc62973599\"><I>Withholding Taxes on Royalty Payments</I></a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploiting new knowledge and ideas is important if <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies are to compete internationally. &nbsp; As our economy upgrades, more <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies will develop their business by exploiting Intellectual Property (IP).&nbsp; Much IP is held outside <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and our companies have to pay royalties to the IP owners to be licensed to use them.&nbsp; Withholding taxes on royalties is a business cost that will discourage <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies from exploiting IP.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have therefore decided to lower the withholding tax on royalty payments from 15% to 10% with effect from <st1:date Month=\"1\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2005\">1st January 2005</st1:date>.&nbsp; This will be of greatest help to smaller businesses that are not enjoying any of the existing incentives for royalty payments.&nbsp;

We must not seek to shield ourselves from competition but to meet it and excel.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 1cm\">We are on the right track.&nbsp; We are lowering taxes, spending only on essentials, and maintaining a prudent fiscal position.&nbsp;

About 96% of the units are currently occupied. The remaining units were returned to HDB by their former owners. HDB will re-offer them for sale to eligible applicants.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the favourable response to the pilot batch of SAs, HDB will be building new SAs to meet the housing needs of the elderly. These will be integrated with other HDB flat types in the same block to encourage more social interaction between the elderly and younger residents. 300 such units are being built at Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) replacement sites in Geylang, Bukit Merah and Queenstown. They are currently being offered for sale to SERS lessees and the balance units will be offered to the public at the end of 2004.&nbsp; HDB will gauge the response to these new integrated SAs before deciding on its future plans for SAs.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides SAs, the elderly in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> have other housing options. They can buy various types of HDB flats according to their preference and financial situation.&nbsp; Through HDB's upgrading programmes, HDB flats are made more elderly friendly to enable our elderly to remain in their own homes.&nbsp; Elderly households with lower incomes can apply to rent a flat from HDB at subsidised rates.&nbsp; We will continue to regularly review our housing policies for the elderly to ensure that they are relevant and sufficient to meet the needs of our ageing population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></span>\t<p align=left>Column: 505<p>\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TAXIS--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>TAXIS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong </B>asked the Minister for Transport what is being done by his Ministry to monitor and improve the service of taxi companies and taxis, especially the \"On Call\" taxis which pick and choose fares.</span></P>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has raised an issue which is close to the hearts of many taxi commuters. I can assure Members that taxi service quality is also a key concern of my Ministry and the Land Transport Authority (LTA).&nbsp;<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we have some 40,000 taxi drivers driving over 19,000 taxis on our roads. I am pleased to say that on the whole, our taxi drivers have upheld excellent service standards.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 507<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some commuters have complained that taxi drivers are abusing the \"On Call\" signs to pick and choose fares.&nbsp; To put this matter in perspective, let me explain that 62% of our taxis are fitted with automatic \"On Call\" signs.&nbsp; This means that the \"On Call\" signs of these taxis are controlled by a central dispatch system, and cannot be manipulated by taxi drivers themselves. As for the rest, we have strict measures to curb such possible errant behaviour by drivers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; Members would recall that last June, LTA put in place the Vocational Licence Points System (VLPS) to regulate the conduct of taxi drivers.&nbsp; Under the VLPS, the penalties (ie, fines and demerit points) for various offences are spelt out in a transparent manner, together with guidelines on suspending or revoking vocational licences arising from the offences. Abusing the \"On Call\" sign to refuse a customer is an offence that LTA views seriously.&nbsp; Under the VLPS, taxi drivers who refuse to pick up customers without a valid reason will be fined $100, and given 3 demerit points. A taxi driver's vocational licence will be suspended once he accumulates 6 or more demerit points.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to assure the Member that LTA will continue to monitor the Quality of Service (QoS) performance of the taxi companies closely, under the Taxi Operator Licensing regime, to ensure high standards of service to commuters.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me add that we should not judge all taxi drivers based on the errant behaviour of a few. There have been many reported instances of taxi drivers who have gone the extra mile to provide good service to their commuters.&nbsp; One example, which was published on the <I>Forum</I> page (19th December 2003), is of a taxi driver who drove all the way from Jurong to Pasir Ris to return a purse and a bag of groceries that a passenger had earlier left behind in his taxi.&nbsp; Many other grateful commuters have similarly written letters to the <I>Forum</I> page to commend taxi drivers for their service.&nbsp; I would like to urge commuters to come forward to compliment taxi drivers where this is due, as this is yet another way to spur service improvement in the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 507<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\">\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:FOREIGN WORKERS' COMPLAINTS--<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>FOREIGN WORKERS' COMPLAINTS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=\"left\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam </B>asked the Acting Minister for Manpower, in the last two years, (a) how many (i) foreign construction workers and (ii) foreign domestic workers have filed claims against their employers for non-payment of wages; (b) how many of these workers were successful in their claims; (c) what was the total amount owing to the workers; (d) how many dedicated Ministry officers are there to handle wage complaints pertaining to foreign workers; and (e) what steps has the Ministry put in place to protect workers against such abuse by employers.</span></P>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, a total of 4,034 foreign workers (excluding foreign domestic workers) filed salary claims against their employers, about half the number (7,424 foreign workers) in 2002.&nbsp; Most of these claims related to salaries owed to foreign workers in the construction industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NMP asked how many were successful in their claims. I will provide the outcome of those claims dealt with in 2003. As of December 2003, a total of 4,479 foreign workers, including those cases carried forward from 2002, had their claims dealt with by the Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 4,479 workers, 2,070 of them (46.2%) had successfully settled<p align=left>Column: 509<p> their claims with the assistance of the Ministry, and a total of $3.9 million was recovered for the workers. Another 591 workers (13.2%) were able to reach a private settlement with their employers following consultation with the Ministry, or withdrew their cases for various reasons such as their claims were not contractually provided for in their employment contracts or covered by the Employment Act.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigations revealed that 1,141 workers (25.5%) had no valid claims.&nbsp; Seven foreign workers (0.1%) referred their claims for adjudication by the Commissioner for Labour.&nbsp; The remaining 670&nbsp; workers (15%) had encountered difficulty in securing their payments either because their employers were facing cashflow problems due to irregular progress payments from the main contractors or&nbsp; their employers had ceased operations or had become insolvent.&nbsp; Most of these cases were from the construction industry which was badly affected by the economic downturn.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for foreign domestic workers, 231 filed salary claims with the Ministry against their employers, as compared to 214 cases in 2002.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 204 foreign domestic workers whose claims were dealt with in 2003, including those carried forward from 2002, 92 of them (45%) had their claims successfully resolved by the Ministry and some $132,000 in salary arrears was recovered.&nbsp; Sixty-five workers (32%) were either able to reach a private settlement with their employers following consultation with the Ministry or investigations revealed that they did not have valid claims.&nbsp; Another 35 workers (17%) did not pursue their cases further for various reasons, including some whose employers were facing severe financial hardship after losing their jobs or failing in their businesses and the amount claimed was small.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the remaining 6% (12 foreign domestic workers), the Ministry is still in the process of investigating their claims.&nbsp; In some cases, the process is protracted because the employers made counter claims against the domestic workers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As the complex was designed as an integrated mixed development with commercial, infrastructural and residential uses and since the major residential component has not been built, it is premature to estimate what the returns from this investment will be.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The intention was to position the mall as a \"one-stop learning hub\".&nbsp; The only bid received then was from one Hypermart.&nbsp; This bid was rejected because it was unable to comply with the use requirements to set aside 50% of the gross floor space for educational use.&nbsp; As such, the tender was not awarded.&nbsp; No bids were received for the second tender held in December last year.&nbsp; Based on feedback from interested parties from these earlier tenders, <st1:place>SLA</st1:place> is now finalising new, improved and more flexible terms and conditions for a tender to be launched by mid-2004 to meet market needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;
