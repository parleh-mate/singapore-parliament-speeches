FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp; on 1st August 2008, the media reported that the US nuclear-powered submarine USS Houston had been found to be leaking trace amounts of radioactive water.&nbsp; The leak had been discovered by the United States Navy during a routine dry dock maintenance of the submarine at Pearl Harbour Naval Shipyard in Hawaii in July 2008.&nbsp; The media noted that the US had informed Japan of the leak, as the United States Navy's investigations had determined that the USS Houston could have been leaking when the USS Houston made its port call in Sasebo, Japan in March 2008.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, there was no information to suggest that the leak went beyond the port visit that the USS Houston had made in Sasebo, Japan.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, we had asked the US on 4th August 2008 for information about the leak.&nbsp; The USS Houston had last called at Singapore nearly two years ago from 22nd to 26th September 2006.&nbsp; We also went through our own monitoring records for the period when the USS Houston was berthed in Singapore at Changi Naval Base.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 7th August 2008, the US informed MINDEF that the USS Houston had been leaking trace amounts of radioactive water since June 2006.&nbsp; This suggested that the USS Houston could have been leaking during her port call at Changi Naval Base in September 2006.&nbsp; During this period, the USS Houston had also called on other ports in the region, besides&nbsp;Singapore,&nbsp;including Japan, Malaysia, and Guam.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US informed us that after the initial detection of the leak and the report that the submarine had been leaking while in port in Japan, the United States Navy <p align=left>Column: 2970</p>had conducted more tests to determine the extent and duration of the leak.&nbsp; The US informed us that through these tests, the United States Navy was able to determine that one of the USS Houston's shut valves was leaking water at a rate slightly above the United States Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Programme's stringent design specifications.&nbsp; The US told us that further tests by a specialised US government nuclear laboratory, Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), were required to determine the extent of radioactive material being leaked, as well as the duration of the leak.&nbsp; KAPL eventually determined that the leak could have begun as early as June 2006.&nbsp; The US also told us that KAPL confirmed that the trace amounts of radioactive water leaked were so low that the monitoring systems onboard the USS Houston itself could not detect the leak.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US has assessed that the cumulative amount of radioactivity that could have been leaked in Changi Naval Base was approximately 0.095 micro curies.&nbsp; To put things into perspective, the US indicated that this was less than the amount of radioactivity found in a common smoke detector, and would not have any adverse effect on human health, marine life or the environment.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the information provided to us by the US, MINDEF also has its own independent monitoring system.&nbsp; Since February 2003, MINDEF has put in place a round-the-clock Integrated Environment Monitoring System (IEMS) at Changi Naval Base.&nbsp; The IEMS takes readings of air quality, and water and sea-bed samples to determine the normal background environmental radiation level, and to detect whether there has been any abnormal level of radiation which may be of safety concern.&nbsp; The safety limits are set by our National Environment Agency's Centre of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2971</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the USS Houston was in Singapore in September 2006, the IEMS did not show any abnormal readings.&nbsp; After the news of the USS Houston's leak in Japan broke, a review of the IEMS data for the period of the USS Houston's visit also confirmed that there were no abnormal readings recorded.&nbsp; Our IEMS has therefore provided independent verification that public safety was not compromised at any point during the USS Houston's port call in Singapore in September 2006.&nbsp; Our Defence Science Organisation scientists have also assessed that based on the figures provided by the United States Navy, the potential exposure is 100,000 times less than exposure from natural radiation in a year.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assurances from the US, verification from the data collected from our own&nbsp;monitoring system and our own experts' assessments, I am confident that there was no adverse impact on public health, marine life or the environment as a result of the USS Houston's port call in Singapore in September 2006, and that the safety of Singaporeans was not compromised by the reported leak.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Second,&nbsp;why is it that nothing abnormal was picked up by MINDEF's monitoring system even though there were leaks?&nbsp; Is that because it was so low?&nbsp; Third, are we sure that it will pick up any leaks that may occur in the future and has the US assured that none of their other nuclear-powered ships are leaking?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we continue to engage the United States <p align=left>Column: 2972</p>Navy to understand and to ensure that their ships which call in Singapore, particularly their nuclear-powered vessels, are safe.&nbsp; The US Navy has assured us that their nuclear-powered vessels are designed to extremely stringent standards and these standards include being able to operate in a combat shock environment.&nbsp; They tell us that the nuclear material is contained in four ways.&nbsp; First of all, in the fuel itself, so that radioactive material is not likely to escape from the fuel rods.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the containment vessel,&nbsp;the compartment in which the reactor is mounted, and the hull of the ship itself, be it the submarine or surface vessel.&nbsp; So within these four very strongly built containment systems, the US Navy's assessment is that it is highly unlikely that there will be a leak of radioactive material.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is also our own assessment.&nbsp; The US Navy has operated&nbsp;nuclear-powered vessels for 50 years without incident.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why has the IEMS not detected radioactive activity in spite of there having been a leak?&nbsp; The reason is that the radioactive leak was so low that it was below the threshold which the IEMS was designed to detect.&nbsp; The IEMS threshold is set at the safety level which has been designed and determined by the National Environment Agency.&nbsp; In fact, the USS Houston, which itself has a radiation detection system, did not detect such a leak.&nbsp; It is my belief that for the submariners themselves, because they are living next to the reactor 24 hours a day, they are the ones who are&nbsp;most keenly interested in whether or not there are radioactive leaks from the reactor.&nbsp; Their own radiation detector did not pick up such a leak.&nbsp; And that is the main reason why the IEMS did not pick up anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to look at the IEMS system to make sure that it remains up-to-date and that it continues to be able to perform the mission that we have set out for it.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:STRONG SINGAPORE DOLLAR POLICY AND MANUFACTURING SECTOR--><!--END_COL_TITLE:STRONG SINGAPORE DOLLAR POLICY AND MANUFACTURING SECTOR:::2980--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore adopts an exchange rate-centred monetary policy to maintain price stability for sustained economic growth. In setting the exchange rate policy, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) seeks to strike the right balance between inflation and growth.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; Since 2004, MAS has adopted a policy of targeting a modest and gradual appreciation of Singapore's trade-weighted exchange rate, amidst robust economic growth. In its last two policy announcements in October 2007 and April 2008, MAS announced that it would allow a stronger appreciation of the Singapore dollar, through a steeper slope <p align=left>Column: 2974</p>and an upward re-centring of its policy band, respectively.&nbsp; These were considered and measured responses to counter the inflationary pressures that were building up in the economy and the sharp increases in global food and fuel prices.&nbsp; If left unchecked, these price pressures could erode Singapore's cost competitiveness and derail our economic growth.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa has asked whether the Government will maintain the policy of an appreciating Singapore dollar, in view of weaker GDP and export figures.&nbsp; We recognise that a strengthening Singapore dollar could have some restraining effect on exports in the short term.&nbsp; There is therefore a limit to how strongly the Singapore dollar can appreciate to offset the effects of global inflation passing through to the Singapore economy.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this stage, the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate in the context of achieving low inflation for sustained economic growth over the medium term.&nbsp; MAS will analyse inflation and growth data in a holistic assessment to determine the appropriate policy at its next scheduled policy review in October.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now proceed to answer the questions on manufacturing. The manufacturing sector contracted by 5.2% in the second quarter of 2008 because of weaknesses in pharmaceutical and electronics output. Mirroring the slowdown in these two key exporting segments, our non-oil domestic exports contracted by 5.7% in July.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large part of the recent downturn in manufacturing can be attributed to volatility in the pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp; Significant swings in pharmaceutical output occur quite regularly due to changes in product mix, but these do not reflect fundamental weaknesses in the industry. In fact, employment in the pharmaceutical industry has grown steadily over the years, as has the value-<p align=left>Column: 2975</p>added.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the short-term outlook for biomedical manufacturing will remain weak due to global trends such as competition from generic drugs and delays in government approvals for new drugs.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Besides pharmaceuticals, we are also seeing some slowdown in other industries. The electronics industry grew by just 0.2% in the second quarter of 2008; the chemicals industry by 1.2%. Precision engineering fell by 1.7%. All these sectors depend crucially on external demand, especially from developed countries like the US, Japan and Europe. But demand from these countries has come down considerably and is expected to remain weak for some time to come.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding these short-term difficulties in some manufacturing segments and exports, we have not yet seen significant numbers of retrenchments besides those arising from the closure of a Motorola plant earlier this year. In fact, employment went up by about 144,000 in the first half of this year, of which 22,000 were attributed to the manufacturing sector. But we should expect that job creation will slow down and some retrenchments may be inevitable in the manufacturing and export-oriented sectors, as they adjust their employment with the falling global demand. It is still too early to tell whether there will be significant retrenchments, and we are monitoring the situation closely.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked what measures the Government is taking to minimise job losses in the manufacturing sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Realistically, we cannot seek to protect every manufacturing job or to prevent job losses when the industry restructures or adjusts to slower business demand. Nevertheless, we can reduce the effect of cyclical job losses to the minimum by ensuring that we have a <p align=left>Column: 2976</p>strong pipeline of investments.&nbsp; Some existing jobs will be lost, but new and better paid jobs will also be created.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our investment commitments for 2008 remain strong. In the first half of 2008, we attracted S$12.9 billion of fixed assets investments and S$4.8 billion of total business spending. These projects are expected to generate S$9 billion of value-added and more than 10,000 skilled jobs. We are therefore confident that there is strong sustained investment momentum as evidenced by the recent project announcements, including 3M's new facility to produce film coatings, Wyeth's expansion of its nutritional manufacturing facility, and Procter &amp; Gamble's new perfume manufacturing facility.&nbsp; Many of the new investment projects that we are bringing in will create quality jobs for Singaporeans. We will continue to pursue such high-end investments from both established industries as well as from new growth areas such as clean energy, environment and water.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp;is important that our existing workforce can be trained to meet the&nbsp;needs of these new industries. The Government is committed to investing in training programmes to ensure that the skill-sets of&nbsp;workers fully meet industry requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are joint initiatives put in place by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to equip our workers with portable skill-sets to meet the needs of growth sectors. For example, the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) is an initiative that was launched in February this year by NTUC in partnership with WDA and the Singapore Labour Foundation. It is a one-stop shop that provides employability assessment and coaching, skills training and job placement opportunities for workers. It reaches out to a broad spectrum of <p align=left>Column: 2977</p>existing and displaced workers with different needs and challenges such as the retrenched workers, the lower-wage workers and older workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to sum up, we remain confident that manufacturing as a whole will still generate good employment for Singapore. Our strategy of constantly upgrading the sector and workforce will ensure that manufacturing remains a key part of our economy, with meaningful and well paying jobs for Singaporeans.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> &nbsp; Sir, in the second quarter economic survey, we have seen unit labour cost&nbsp;and inflation rose&nbsp;but productivity fell.

What we are seeing in recent months of our unit labour cost going up and&nbsp;productivity coming down is partly due to the cyclical changes. As you know, the economy performed extremely well in the last few years and employers have been building up their workforce. Now, with the sudden, abrupt reduction in demand, this has caused&nbsp;productivity to drop. Overall, we believe we still remain competitive as evidenced by most of the international competitiveness reports. Also,&nbsp;our EDB offices overseas, the companies that they deal with, look at the value proposition of Singapore and they remain very confident that Singapore is a very attractive investment location, as is evidenced by our strong pipeline of investments.

We are still in the early stage of building up the sector. The companies that we have here have sunk in very heavy investments. They produce active pharmaceutical ingredients for the global market, particularly for the developed markets. And so every time they change the production mix, we get this impact on our value-add but the workers remain there. In fact, as I mentioned in my response earlier, the employment figures are going up.&nbsp; And because these are very highly capital intensive, high value-added, the wages in this sector&nbsp;are very high and, therefore, the employment prospects of our workers there are very good. So far, we have not seen significant retrenchments in the pharmaceutical sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The slowdown in&nbsp;output in this quarter is just reflective of the volatility of the production mix. Another contributing factor which&nbsp;I mentioned was the delay in <p align=left>Column: 2979</p>the introduction of new products because of delays in government approvals for new drugs. But this is something that the drug manufacturers have taken in their stride and they have readjusted their production schedules accordingly. So, going forward, we remain very confident about the prospects of the pharmaceutical sector.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from labour cost, companies have also complained that other costs also affect their competitiveness, like rental of office spaces and factory spaces and also accommodation for foreign workers.

A third meeting in Ghana is taking place right now. Further discussions are scheduled to be held later&nbsp;in&nbsp;Poland in December. To date,&nbsp;I am afraid progress has been slow especially on substantive issues. This is because the discussions are complex and also highly politicised.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussions have thus far proceeded along the divide between the developed (Annex 1) countries and the developing (non-Annex 1) countries. Developing countries want to see a greater commitment from developed countries to reduce CO2 emissions. They would also like to see greater transfer of technology and financial support from the developed countries. On the other hand, while developed countries subscribe to the principle of \"Common but Differentiated Responsibilities\" (CBDR), they would want to see the major economies amongst the&nbsp;developing countries taking on <p align=left>Column: 2981</p>commitments to reduce the growth of emissions.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our assessment is that progress will continue to be slow this year as 2008 has been earmarked for exchange of views and discussions to facilitate the actual negotiations which are scheduled for next year. The forthcoming US presidential elections, with policy changes, including&nbsp;for climate change, by the new US Administration in 2009 has also been a contributory factor.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the reasons which&nbsp;were outlined in my answer in this House in January this year, Singapore attaches great importance to these international discussions on climate change, in which we have been participating actively.&nbsp; As PM Lee Hsien Loong outlined at the Bali meeting, any new framework must recognise the vital importance of economic growth and take into account differences in national circumstances and constraints of the countries concerned.&nbsp; As a responsible global citizen, we will continue to play our part on climate change if there is a global agreement to do so.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ACQUITTALS OF ACCUSED AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:ACQUITTALS OF ACCUSED AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE:::2992--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 2981</p><B>ACQUITTALS OF ACCUSED AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; <B>Mr Alvin Yeo</B> asked the Minister for Law in view of the public comment that has generated, if he will make clear the Government's position on the letter written by the Attorney-General's Chambers to&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I> on 14th May 2008 that people acquitted of crimes may not necessarily be factually innocent.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza</B> asked the Minister for Law whether the Government supports the presumption of innocence and if yes,&nbsp;whether he will clarify the comments in the letter by the Attorney-General's Chambers to&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I> <I>Forum</I> page on 14th May 2008.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, I will take Question Nos. 5 and 6 together.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 2982</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:&nbsp;</B> Yes, please.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Shanmugam:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hon.&nbsp;Members have asked about the Government's position on a letter written by the Attorney-General's Chambers to the <I>Straits Times</I> <I>Forum</I> page on 14th May 2008.&nbsp; It is first necessary to set out the context in which the letter was written.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General's Chambers made two statements on 8th and 14th May 2008, to the effect that \"an acquittal does not mean that an accused is innocent\" and that an acquitted person could be \"guilty in fact\".&nbsp; These statements were made in response to a journalist's question.&nbsp; The question posed was whether compensation ought to be awarded where there has been an acquittal.&nbsp; The Attorney-General's Chamber's statements must therefore be understood in the context that the AG was dealing only with the issue of compensation.&nbsp; He was explaining why compensation could not be paid to everyone who gets acquitted, by pointing out that not everyone who gets acquitted is necessarily innocent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having set out the context in which the statements had been made, let me now deal with the specific issues on the presumption of innocence that have been raised by the two hon. Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our criminal justice system:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; When a Court finds an accused guilty of an offence with which he has been charged, it means that the judge is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offence charged.&nbsp; In other words, the judge is convinced that the accused is guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; On the other hand, when the Court acquits an accused, it simply means <p align=left>Column: 2983</p>that the Court is not convinced that he is guilty.&nbsp; This is because the Court does not have to go into the question of whether the accused is in fact innocent.&nbsp; An acquittal (often) simply means that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In such a situation (when there is any reasonable doubt), the Court has a duty to acquit the accused, regardless of whether the Court thinks the accused may have in fact committed the offence.&nbsp; It is therefore possible for a person who has committed the offence to walk away free.&nbsp; We accept that as an unavoidable consequence of our trial system, as procedural justice is important.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position has been stated by DPM Prof. Jayakumar in Parliament, in 1994 and 1996 and again by SMS Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee in 2004 and 2006.&nbsp; These statements were made by the Government after obtaining the advice of the then-Attorney-General, Mr Chan Sek Keong, now Chief Justice.&nbsp; The AG was thus restating a similar position in the statements he made on 6th and 14th May 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position that has been stated is:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I emphasise: no serious lawyer will question this possibility.&nbsp; There are many reasons why there might be an acquittal.&nbsp; Witnesses <p align=left>Column: 2984</p>may not be found at trial.&nbsp; Or they may change their evidence, either because they genuinely fail to recall essential facts, or for other reasons.&nbsp; Or there might be an acquittal on a technicality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's position is, therefore, simply a statement of logical and undeniable fact: a person may have committed a crime and yet get an acquittal in Court.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The propositions which have been stated are consistent with jurisprudence from other countries</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the English House of Lords, in <I>Director of Public Prosecutions v Shannon [1975] AC 717</I>, the effect of an acquittal was considered by Lord Salmon in the following terms:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Interesting questions have been debated before your Lordships as to the true effect of an acquittal.&nbsp; An accused is entitled to be acquitted unless the evidence satisfies the jury beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty.&nbsp; A verdict of not guilty may mean that the jury is certain that the accused is innocent, or it may mean that, although the evidence arouses considerable suspicion, it is insufficient to convince the jury of the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. &nbsp;The verdict of not guilty is consistent with the jury having taken either view. &nbsp;The only effect of an acquittal, in law, is that the accused can never again be brought before a criminal court and tried for the same offence.&nbsp; So far as the Crown is concerned, the accused is deemed, in law, to be innocent <I>[at p. 772]</I>.\" [emphasis added.]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Lords could not have been clearer on the meaning of a \"not guilty\" verdict.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Scotland&nbsp;&ndash; a well-worn system tested over the course of 250 years&nbsp;&ndash; the jury in criminal trials has the choice of three verdicts: \"guilty\", \"not guilty\" and \"not proven\".&nbsp; The verdict of \"not proven\" has the effect, just as a not-guilty <p align=left>Column: 2985</p>verdict, of an acquittal.&nbsp; However, the verdict of \"not guilty\" suggests that the accused definitely did not commit the crime which is a positive declaration of innocence, whereas the verdict of \"not proven\" implies only that the accused's guilt has not been conclusively demonstrated.&nbsp; The latter verdict may often leave the public with the perception that the accused was guilty but this guilt could not be proved because of some inadequacy in the evidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, in a major public lecture on Criminal Law, in 1996, the then-AG Mr Chan Sek Keong pointed out that the trial process is designed to prove guilt.&nbsp; It is not designed to prove innocence <I>[Tenth Singapore Law Review Lecture, The criminal process &ndash; The Singapore model (1996) SLR 433]</I>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AG Chan's lecture is very instructive and a <I>tour de force</I>, carefully analysing the concepts of legal and factual innocence and the presumption of innocence.&nbsp; He pointed out that a person acquitted of a charge is legally innocent but may not be factually innocent.&nbsp; He explained that the presumption of innocence is a presumption that an accused is legally innocent.&nbsp; It is simply an expression, that in a criminal trial, the prosecution is obliged to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr de Souza has asked if the Government supports the \"presumption of innocence\".&nbsp; Sir, let there not be any doubt on this point: the presumption of innocence is an important and fundamental principle, and is one of the foundations of our Criminal Justice System.&nbsp; The Government is absolutely committed to upholding the presumption of innocence, as a core principle in our commitment to the Rule of Law.&nbsp; There is no intention to question or qualify that principle in any way.&nbsp; I am surprised that any doubt at all should have arisen about this and I thank Mr de Souza and Mr Yeo <p align=left>Column: 2986</p>for raising this issue and allowing me to clarify the position.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that the AG's statements made in May 2008 do not in any way seek to encroach on the function of the Courts.&nbsp; It is for the Courts, and the Courts alone, to exercise judicial power and decide the question of guilt, in a trial.&nbsp; That is a fundamental principle of our Constitution<B>.</B> &nbsp; The AG did not question that principle.&nbsp; He was simply pointing out the reality of the trial system: that a person may have committed a crime but, nevertheless, the Prosecution may not succeed in Court, because of a gap between the commission of a crime and the prosecution's ability to prove that guilt in Court.&nbsp; The presumption of innocence does not preclude us from acknowledging that possibility.&nbsp; As I stated earlier, the Court can only look at the evidence in Court and must acquit the accused (if there is any reasonable doubt), even if the Court thinks that he probably committed the crime&nbsp;&ndash; because such probability is not enough for conviction under our law.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that some confusion had arisen because this is a technical area and there is tendency in common parlance to equate a finding of \"not guilty\" in court with actual innocence.&nbsp; A recent article by the Massachusetts Bar Association&nbsp; <I>[http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:NoXWb4Px41EJ:www.massbar.org/about-the-mba/press-room/journalists%27-handbook/6-not-guilty-does-not-mean-innocent+massachusetts+bar+association+journalist+innocent&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=sg&amp;strip=1]</I> points out this common mistake and calls for more precise terminology.&nbsp; A finding of&nbsp;\"not guilty\" is not to be equated with actual innocence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we acknowledge the realities of the trial system, it is also important to stress that just as a person acquitted may not necessarily be innocent, he may well also in fact be innocent.&nbsp; We should not assume guilt by <p align=left>Column: 2987</p>reason of a person being charged because our legal system, like many others, and for various sensible reasons, does not go on to establish the factual innocence of the accused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that I have made the Government's position clear.&nbsp; I wish to again thank both Mr Alvin Yeo and Mr de Souza for having raised these important questions.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Shanmugam:</B>&nbsp; That is the question that the Attorney-General was dealing with, and it raises a number of serious issues, including whether we want to fundamentally change our system to one where we require the accused to go further and prove their innocence.&nbsp; In the jurisdictions where compensation has been considered, by and large, they have been required not just to prove that they have been acquitted but to go further and say, \"I am actually innocent\".&nbsp; That means the burden of proof passes on.&nbsp; That raises a variety of policy issues and I have to say that it is not something that we are considering at this point in time.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> &nbsp; Thank you, Minister, for your response.&nbsp; I am afraid I do not agree that the issue of cost creates opportunity for parties to second guess judicial pronouncements.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I do have three questions arising out of this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, if we take the argument on the issue of cost to its logical conclusion, <p align=left>Column: 2988</p>would the Minister then think it is acceptable for a defence counsel, whose client has been found guilty&nbsp;by the Court of Final Appeal to say&nbsp;publicly that his client&nbsp;could be factually innocent and, therefore, need not have to pay cost?&nbsp; This is possibly a real issue because under section 401 of the CPC, prosecution can request cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, does the Minister agree that the principal and unique role&nbsp;accorded to our Courts in criminal cases is to vindicate or to convict?&nbsp; If so, what right do parties have to second guess such vindication?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, does the Minister agree that where a man has been acquitted by the Court of Final Appeal, it must be unjust for parties to the proceedings to cast aspersions on his guilt that will hang over him all his life?&nbsp; More so, if the Court has pronounced a \"not guilty\" verdict.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Shanmugam:</B>&nbsp; Sir, as to the issue of cost, the way to resolve itself is as follows: at the end of the day, when there is a verdict by the Court, the Criminal Procedure Code has provisions for the prosecution to ask for costs in certain types of cases.&nbsp; Whatever the parties may think, it is for the Court to decide, upon an application by the prosecution, to decide whether it is an appropriate case for costs and, if so, whether the defence in that case should pay it.&nbsp; If the defence takes a view that costs should not be paid, it will not be the first time parties before a Court disagree with the verdict but nevertheless have to comply with it.&nbsp; There is really no public policy issue involved in that.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Mr de Souza also asked: is it appropriate for parties to second guess what happens in a Court, ie, there is a verdict, what if the person is acquitted, should parties cast aspersions?&nbsp; While he said there is a third question, I think the third question is really a reformulation of the second question, so I will take them <p align=left>Column: 2989</p>together.&nbsp; That is what my answer has been about.&nbsp; Take it as matter of logic.&nbsp; Do we accept that when the accused gets charged and there is a trial and gets acquitted, there can at least be two categories: some who are really innocent; and some who get acquitted despite the fact that they actually committed the offence but the prosecution is unable to prove it.&nbsp; As a matter of logic, no one will question that, and that is why I went through the jurisdictions in England and Scotland, where they actually have a \"not proven\" verdict as well, and the fact that our own Attorney-General has expressed those views.&nbsp; I will give&nbsp;Members one obvious example of that: most of the Members here will recall the O J Simpson case.&nbsp; He was acquitted in a criminal trial but that did not prevent his next-of-kin from suing in a civil case and getting damages because the standards of proof were different.&nbsp; So, the only recourse that a person who gets acquitted in Court of a criminal trial has, if someone outside says he in fact committed the offence, is to sue in defamation, in libel.&nbsp; But as a matter of logic, as a matter of factual proposition, as a matter of legal proposition, it will be absurd to suggest that simply because you get acquitted in a criminal trial, no one can say that you actually did it.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> &nbsp;Sir, while I can accept the differentiation between innocent in law and innocent in fact, and the fact that compensation in the acquittal situation is a matter of policy, there could be instances where prosecution decides to proceed with the matter on the basis of sloppy investigation and in the process of which drag the innocent party through a lengthy trial process at a great cost because he has to spend a great amount of money to defend his good name.&nbsp; In such a situation, would it be fair to say, therefore, that the onus is on the Government to then compensate?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 2990</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Shanmugam:&nbsp;</B> Sir, the questions I have been answering so far have to deal with the issues of \"innocent\" in law and \"innocent\" in fact.&nbsp; That is the question that I am answering and making clear absolutely the Government's commitment to the presumption of innocence and at the same time explaining why the Attorney-General said what he said and why that is consistent with the Government's position.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we deal with the issue of compensation and whether the accused who gets acquitted should be compensated, we deal with entirely separate issues which is really not the subject of my question.&nbsp; But as I answered earlier, it raises a number of difficult, complex, public policy issues because each time you talk about compensation, it is really the State, the Public Prosecutor, making careful decisions whether to proceed with a case or not to charge someone in Court.&nbsp; And he does it on behalf of all of us as the State against an individual, after what we believe are thorough and careful investigations, both on the part of the Police and then with the second layer, on the part of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and it has to be proven in Court.&nbsp; Do we want to add a further layer of checks on his decision-making by imposing on the Public Prosecutor the possibility that if the case does not succeed, which is taken not on behalf of himself as in a civil case, but on behalf of the entire public, as it were, in the protection of public interests?&nbsp; Do we want to impose a further layer of caution by telling him that if he gets his decision wrong, he has got to pay costs?&nbsp; Until now, and the answers have been given in this House, the public policy perspective has been not to impose that burden on the Attorney-General.&nbsp; It will be too high a burden.&nbsp; That is the view that has been taken.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Member's and Mr Yeo's questions, the issue is what are the legal consequences <p align=left>Column: 2992</p>and what is the precise nature of an acquittal.&nbsp; That is a philosophical issue, as it were, that we have been debating and dealing with.&nbsp; It is an entirely separate question as to whether either costs or compensation ought to be paid upon an acquittal and a couple of Members asked that question.&nbsp; I have tried to deal with it as best as I can, and I will repeat that answer, which is that when you get acquitted, there can be a number of policy perspectives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, anyone who gets acquitted should get compensation.&nbsp; I do not think the public in Singapore would support that for the reason that there are many who may in fact have gotten away on a technicality. And if you tell the man in the street that all of them are going to get paid, I think people would not support it.&nbsp; I do not see Members in this House supporting it.&nbsp; I do not see the public supporting it. &nbsp;And I know of no jurisdiction where that is enforced as a matter of principle.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second possibility could be compensation or some kind of costs are paid upon the accused not only proving that he got acquitted but going further to prove his innocence.&nbsp; There are jurisdictions where that is allowed.&nbsp; What we provide for is, if you can show that the prosecution was malicious and in some ways, what Mr de Souza said, that the prosecution should never have been started in the first place, then there are possibilities, if you can show that it was malicious or vexatious, for you to get some compensation.&nbsp; That is where we have set the bar, and we are not looking at changing that.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:INFLATION AND STAGNATION OF WAGES ON LOWER-INCOME SINGAPOREANS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:INFLATION AND STAGNATION OF WAGES ON LOWER-INCOME SINGAPOREANS:::2999--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 2992</p><B>INFLATION AND STAGNATION OF WAGES ON LOWER-INCOME SINGAPOREANS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Assistance--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Assistance)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo</B> asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and <p align=left>Column: 2993</p>Sports (a) whether his Ministry is monitoring how the lower income Singaporeans are being affected by inflation and stagnation of wages; (b) whether the available assistance is lessening their difficulties; and (c) whether there will be other measures to ensure that no one falls through the crack.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon) (for the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the&nbsp;hon.

Consequently, the Government has implemented programmes aimed at increasing the productivity of our industries and helping lower-skilled workers upgrade so that they can take on jobs in new growth sectors,&nbsp;like Minister Lim Hng Kiang has explained just now.&nbsp; We also invest in redesigning jobs for enhanced productivity and better wages for workers.&nbsp; At the same time, we work at enhancing the employability of our mature workers and encouraging homemakers back to work.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has instituted the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme as part of our social security system.&nbsp; Some 300,000 low-income workers have benefited from $300 million worth of WIS payments for work done in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further cushion the impact of rising costs, $3 billion will be given to Singaporeans this year, with low-income households receiving more.&nbsp; On top of the GST Credits, Senior Citizens' Bonus and Growth Dividends, they will also receive <p align=left>Column: 2994</p>U-Save, Service and Conservancy Charges and rental rebates as well as top-ups to their Medisave accounts and their children's post secondary education accounts.&nbsp; On top of this original $3 billion package, the Government will be distributing an additional support package amounting to $256 million as announced recently at the National Day Rally by the Prime Minister.&nbsp; The enhancements comprise a 50% increase in the remaining instalment of Growth Dividends (GD) and a 50% increase in the total amount of Utilities-Save (U-Save) rebates to be given out in Fiscal Year (FY) 2008.&nbsp; Taking all this help together, a low-income family of&nbsp;three living in a 3-room HDB flat&nbsp; could receive benefits of about $5,400, which would help to offset the recent increase in their cost of living.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we are fully aware of the situation.&nbsp; There will be those who need more help.&nbsp; The ComCare Work Support Programme was launched in 2006 to provide short-term help to needy families. The workfare-based programme seeks to help workers upgrade their skills and find a job.&nbsp; In the interim, they also receive financial assistance, rental, utilities and service and conservancy charges vouchers, childcare and student care subsidies, and medical and educational assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, about 4,000 households benefit from the Work Support Programme.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needy families can also tap on extensive community support.&nbsp; For example, the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) can tap on the CCC ComCare Fund to provide urgent help to needy residents.&nbsp; From January to May 2008, the CCCs disbursed about $850,000.&nbsp; As announced in March 2008, we will be topping up the CCC ComCare Fund by $5 million over the next&nbsp;four years. With this boost, there will be $6.25 million per year available in the CCC ComCare Fund.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2995</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are adequate resources and many helping hands to ensure that no one falls through the cracks. Those who need help can approach their Community Development Council (CDC), Family Service Centre or RC grassroots leaders for help. They can also call the ComCare Call service at 1800-222 0000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Is it true that, according to one survey, there are about 100,000 households of such families?&nbsp; May I ask the Minister of State whether there is any better long-term solution to get them out of the poverty trap and whether their children can be given a better chance to climb the social strata?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;knows that before 2005, before the establishment of the ComCare Fund, the public assistance cases&nbsp;were about 3,000 and today, after the establishment of the ComCare Fund, the Government policy is to take care of the 20% low-income group in Singapore.&nbsp; We take $1,500 as&nbsp;the family income and for those&nbsp;below $1,500, we are trying to develop various schemes to help them.&nbsp; And despite this cap at $1,500, we have certain schemes to cover those who earn even $1,800&nbsp;to help the students, such as&nbsp;KiFAS, CFAC.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do&nbsp;a calculation, we&nbsp;cover slightly more than the bottom 20% of Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Ministry's concern is:&nbsp;how far do you want to cover?&nbsp; Do you want to cover up to the bottom 30%, 40%&nbsp;or 50%?&nbsp; So far, the cut-off point is about $1,500&nbsp;or the bottom 20% of our population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2996</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said just now, after the last Budget debate, we have implemented a few new schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, for public assistance, in the old days, it was only for old people without family support, without children and unemployable.&nbsp; After the last Budget debate, we have relaxed this criterion.&nbsp; We even cover&nbsp;old people who have children but the children have difficulty&nbsp;taking care of their own family and&nbsp;as long as the children earn below $1,000 and&nbsp;have&nbsp;school-going&nbsp;children,&nbsp;these old people can also apply for public assistance.&nbsp; By doing so, we expect another 600&nbsp;such public assistance cases which will&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area we have made changes is the ComCare Transitions.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;in some of the families, even though they have children but&nbsp;they are temporarily unemployable, maybe because of&nbsp;accident or some chronic sickness,&nbsp;we are prepared to help them for about a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will review the case year by year.&nbsp; This is monitored by the CDCs.&nbsp; So we call it&nbsp;the ComCare Transitions.&nbsp; It is quite close to the public assistance cases, but we do not give them&nbsp;long-term help.&nbsp; We hope that they can&nbsp;go back to work again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area we have relaxed is the cap for KiFAS, CFAC and the other benefits for the children.&nbsp; Previously,&nbsp;for the children, we capped it at $1,500.&nbsp; But after the last Budget debate, we increased it to $1,800.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those families whose income is about $1,800, their children can apply for KiFAS, CFAC and also the student care services.&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of all this help plus the GST Offset, U-Save, and so on, I think the range is that even for public assistance cases, one adult PA can get about $2,000 for this year.&nbsp; And for&nbsp;a family who has two adults and two children, it will &nbsp;get&nbsp;benefits of about $3,600 from the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;This amount&nbsp;can offset the inflation cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Government will monitor all this very carefully, and this is only the <p align=left>Column: 2997</p>MCYS' effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the efforts of the Ministry of Education,&nbsp;Ministry of Health and also the many-helping-hands?&nbsp; As a society, we do our best to help.&nbsp; But I totally agree with Minister Lim Hng Kiang's argument just now&nbsp;that, in the long run, the most important thing is that Singapore needs to develop&nbsp;and improve&nbsp;productivity and we add value to the investors and make sure that our workers can have better return.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

At this moment, the Government gives GST offsets, Growth Dividends, and so on.&nbsp; Each family gets a few thousand dollars that&nbsp;can cover the cost of inflation.&nbsp; But in the long run, I do understand, agree and sympathise with the difficulty that the lower-income group has had&nbsp;to manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as a country, we need to grow.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (for the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Assistance (PA) rates are calibrated to provide for the basic living needs of PA recipients.&nbsp; The PA scheme and rates are reviewed regularly.&nbsp; We recognise that the cost of living has risen more rapidly than usual in the last year, and MCYS has been closely monitoring the impact of increasing costs on our PA recipients.&nbsp; We have recently revised the PA rates to help PA recipients cope with the rising cost of living.&nbsp; From May 2008, PA recipients received an increase of between $40 and $165 a month in their allowance, depending on the size of their households.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3000</p>An elderly Public Assistance recipient living alone has seen a 14% increase from $290 a month to $330 a month.&nbsp; A family with two adults and two children has seen their assistance increased by 19% from $855 to $1,020 a month.&nbsp; Furthermore, for families with school-going children, their children's school and miscellaneous fees are fully covered under the Ministry of Education's Financial Assistance Scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PA allowance is just one part of the overall safety net for those who are unable to work.&nbsp; They also hold a Public Assistance card which makes them eligible for free medical treatment and heavily subsidised rental housing.&nbsp; On top of these, PA recipients also receive extensive community support, such as befriending programmes, daily activities at Senior Activity&nbsp;Centres, food rations, free meals, <I>ang pows</I> and cash allowances.&nbsp; PA recipients will also be receiving disproportionately more of the $3 billion worth of benefits which will be given out to Singaporeans this year.&nbsp; On top of the GST credits, Senior Citizen Bonus as well as Growth Dividends, PA recipients will also receive U-Save, service and conservancy charges and rental rebates.&nbsp; On top of this original&nbsp;$3 billion package, the Government will be distributing an additional support package amounting to $256 million, as announced recently at the National Day Rally by PM.&nbsp; The enhancements comprise a 50% increase in the remaining instruments of Growth Dividends and a 50% increase in the total amount of U-Save rebates to be given out in Fiscal Year 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking all these together, a single elderly PA recipient living in a one-room rental flat will receive about $1,250 in additional cash handouts by the end of this year.&nbsp; When we include Medisave top-ups and U-Save, S&amp;CC and rental rebates, the total amount of benefits a single elderly PA recipient living in a one-room rental flat could receive by the end of this <p align=left>Column: 3001</p>year is almost $2,000.&nbsp; A PA family with two adults and two children living in a two-room rental flat could receive about $1,600 in cash benefits, an additional $2,000 in Medisave and Post-Secondary Education Account top-ups, U-Save, S&amp;CC and rental rebates.&nbsp; In total, such a family could receive benefits amounting to more than $3,600 this year.&nbsp; So we will continue to help PA recipients cope with the increase in the cost of living.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask if the Ministry could have a system whereby the PA allowance quantum be automatically reviewed on a regular basis, taking into consideration any appropriate indices deemed necessary for a fair and timely computation of the amount to address the basic needs of the PA recipients.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Member because we do not believe that the PA allowance should automatically be tied to the CPI.&nbsp; We will monitor the cost of living and every item.&nbsp; In the last one year, we have already increased about 14% to 20%, based on the number of people in the household.&nbsp; In&nbsp;2007, it was about $260.&nbsp; Then, we increased it to $290.&nbsp; This year, we have increased it to $330.&nbsp; For families with children, they get about $1,000-plus in public assistance.&nbsp; We should also bear in mind that we should not overdo it, otherwise we&nbsp;will undermine&nbsp;work ethics in Singapore.&nbsp; Just now, hon. Members talked about the low-income group.&nbsp; For the low-income group, we peg it at $1,500.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the PA&nbsp;for&nbsp;a family with two or three children is about $1,000-plus.&nbsp; And that is only cash.&nbsp; Including other subsidies, eg, rental, medical fees, free education, and the budget handouts, they will easily get about $2,000 to <p align=left>Column: 3002</p>$3,000.&nbsp; We do sympathise with such cases.&nbsp; We will monitor the cases carefully.&nbsp; I should say that Public Assistance is only manageable.&nbsp; I do agree that it is not very comfortable, but it is manageable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is&nbsp;most important is that, together with MOE and others, we try to help the children to make sure that they&nbsp;go to school, have pocket money, proper meals and break out of the poverty cycle.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE:::3004--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, then, there is usually a second though much smaller peak outbreak in September, which is just around the corner.&nbsp; So we have to be careful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3003</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the April outbreak period, a total of 35 preschools and childcare centres were ordered to close while 95 were advised to close so that the premises could be cleaned thoroughly and the chain of transmission within these centres broken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to reduce the transmission of HFMD, including EV71, is to continuously maintain a very high standard of personal and environmental hygiene and also to seek medical treatment early when the child is unwell. &nbsp;Parents should also ensure that their children with HFMD have adequate rest and, very important, to&nbsp;remain at home for the duration of the illness as advised by the doctors.&nbsp; We have worked closely with MCYS and MOE in educating all childcare, kindergarten and preschool operators on hygiene measures.&nbsp; My Ministry has also alerted doctors to be vigilant for complications from HFMD as the predominant strain this year is the EV71 strain.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We exceeded that level in April, during the recent outbreak.&nbsp; Currently, we are close to that level.&nbsp; So, let us be careful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution to it, which is in reply to&nbsp;the second question, remains the same.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3004</p>Until a vaccine is found, we have to rely on&nbsp;basic grandmother advice, which is frequent&nbsp;hand washing, thorough handwashing with soap, and maintain high&nbsp;personal&nbsp;and environmental hygiene standard.&nbsp; The solution is well-known, easy to explain, but execution is a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first had to deal with this public health issue&nbsp;years ago, I was naively ambitious.&nbsp; I thought in modern Singapore we should be able to eliminate this.&nbsp; We&nbsp;know the Japanese are legendary in their personal hygiene standard&nbsp;&ndash; how to wash hands, and they teach their kids from young.&nbsp; So I told my colleagues in the Ministry of Health, \"You go and check.&nbsp; I am sure in Japan they do not have Hand, Foot and Mouth disease, given their high standard of personal hygiene.\"&nbsp; I was personally quite&nbsp;disappointed when I found that even Japan has HFMD outbreaks, not throughout the year, but during the hot season.&nbsp;

The bulk of these nurses,&nbsp;67%, work in the public sector.&nbsp; The turnover of public sector nurses has improved over the years from 14% in 2001,&nbsp;to&nbsp;9% last year.&nbsp; But we want to reduce&nbsp;it further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet the projected demand for nurses, we are working on several fronts.&nbsp; First, we have progressively stepped up the local training of nurses.&nbsp; Our current local training capacity is 1,875 intake per year,&nbsp;which is more than double the intake of 728 in 2001.&nbsp; We are raising it to 2,000 per year and will consider further increases in due course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will continue to recruit foreign nurses to supplement our local supply.&nbsp; Currently, foreign nurses make up 15% of our total nurses population.&nbsp; Not too long ago, we have foreign nurses accounting for almost 25%, so we have&nbsp;been able to reduce it&nbsp;to 15% because of increased interest among Singaporean boys and girls. But 15% is low compared to our peak of 25%, so there is scope to raise this proportion further, if necessary, and I think it is necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will continue to enhance the image and the value of nursing as a desirable profession.&nbsp; This requires the employers to provide challenging career opportunities and favourable working conditions to attract and retain the talented to join the profession.&nbsp; Increasing the nurse to population ratio is part of this strategy to enhance the working condition for our nurses so that&nbsp;they have more <p align=left>Column: 3006</p>time to look after their patients and also enjoy better worklife balance as well.&nbsp; Our efforts have seen result, both in terms of increased student interest in nursing and the reduced attrition of nurses from the healthcare sector.&nbsp; But we must not relent in our effort to compete for our fair share of talent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, we are grateful to the President for honouring nurses by hosting an annual reception at the Istana&nbsp;every year on&nbsp;Nurses' Day which is&nbsp;1st August.&nbsp; As employers, healthcare institutions will make the effort to show their appreciation for their nurses on this day. Their gestures take many forms, ranging from awards to celebrations.

Yes, as an employer, I do give my nurses a day off for Nurses' Day.&nbsp;It may not be taken on 1st August but it can be taken as off in lieu of another day. I hope that the Ministry can consider granting nurses one day off in lieu and that they can take it at any time of the year.&nbsp;I think that would be a good gesture since teachers have a day off and&nbsp;nurses are as equally important to our society as teachers.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, as I said in my reply, it is really something for the employers to decide and it is up to them how they want to show it. &nbsp;My preference is to show gesture throughout the year and not just for that one day, which&nbsp;means showing respect, treating your nurses with dignity and recognising that theirs is a worthy profession&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;recognising nurses who are doing their best to treat their patients and serve them well.&nbsp; In fact, <p align=left>Column: 3007</p>going forward, with ageing, the role played by nurses and highly-skilled nurses will become even more&nbsp;important because we will always be short of specialists and doctors.&nbsp; I have just had&nbsp;a discussion with the Ministry of Health colleagues on how to ramp up trained oncologists, orthopaedic surgeons, and so on.&nbsp; And the conclusion is that&nbsp;the world is so short of such specialists.&nbsp; While we&nbsp;will still try to&nbsp;ramp up the numbers,&nbsp;it can never be enough and, increasingly, we have to&nbsp;look at alternative&nbsp;allied health professionals, of which nurses&nbsp;are a big&nbsp;part, to try to help out. &nbsp;If you train them well, they can take on&nbsp;many of the routine stuff from the specialists.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B>&nbsp; The crux of Mrs Josephine Teo's and Dr Lim Wee Kiak's questions is how we can encourage more people, especially the drivers, to use public transport.&nbsp; Sir, we are tackling this on two fronts: (a) firstly, enhancing our public transport services to improve the areas that matter most to commuters such as the travelling and waiting time; and (b) secondly, enabling motorists to switch to public transport more easily if they wish to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo and Dr Lim Wee Kiak both highlighted the Park and Ride Scheme as an area to look into.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; We should do more to encourage car owners to Park and Ride because it provides motorists with an additional option to use public transport for their daily commute. LTA is currently undertaking a review of the existing scheme with Transitlink which administers the scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some motorists have found the Park and Ride Scheme attractive, where they pay $70 for a Park and Ride Set which includes a Season Parking Ticket for the month and a $40 Park and Ride ez-link card. Overall, the current utilisation rate is 31.3% of available car parking lots. However, the take-up rate has not been uniform. LTA found that some of the carpark sites under the scheme are fully utilised because of their proximity to the MRT stations while some&nbsp;have hardly any takers. For the popular carparks, there is also a need to look into how the balance should be struck between the car parking needs of the HDB residents and that of visitors which include the Park and Ride users.&nbsp;Then there is also the issue of misuse, where some people with offices in the suburbs use the Park and Ride Scheme as a cheap alternative office <p align=left>Column: 3009</p>carpark.&nbsp;In its review, LTA will need to work with the various agencies to study these issues carefully and how to&nbsp;enhance the Park and Ride Scheme to better facilitate inter-modal transfers for motorists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for car pooling, there is really nothing stopping motorists from car pooling today if their savings on the costs of driving, such as parking, petrol and ERP, made it sensible to do so. Sir, this is a personal choice, and we will leave&nbsp;it to individuals and informal groups to work out their own arrangements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the public transport front, Mrs Teo asked about plans to enhance the connectivity of feeder bus services. We will need to look into both the feeder bus routes as well as the frequency of the services. Sir, the House will recall that LTA will take over the centralised planning of bus routes by 2009; this will ensure that there are more direct feeder services so that commuters can get to MRT stations and bus interchanges in less time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the frequency of feeder bus services, more than 80%&nbsp;of our feeder bus services currently operate at frequencies of 15 minutes or less during the peak hours. However, this can be improved. As part of the Quality of Service Standards (QoS) for basic bus services, the operators will be required to run at least 85% of feeder bus services at headways of not more than 10 minutes during the weekday peak hours by August 2008 or this month. The PTC will raise this standard progressively from 85% to 90% by August next year, to allow time for the bus operators to phase in their procurement of new buses as well as to recruit more bus drivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other measures to improve our public transport system include the&nbsp;introduction of&nbsp;competition&nbsp;by the LTA&nbsp;to the bus industry&nbsp;through competitive tendering from 2010 as well as <p align=left>Column: 3010</p>introducing more Premium Bus Services and competitive bus services along mature MRT lines so as to relieve the train loads.&nbsp; To encourage more people to take public transport, the measures I have mentioned have to work together on both fronts.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> &nbsp; Sir, I thank Mrs Lim Hwee Hwa for answering the Question. I&nbsp;think as far as&nbsp;car pooling is concerned, I tend to disagree that it should best be left to individual groups to arrange. In the first place, I think we need all measures to solve our congestion problems.&nbsp; Most of us have seen parents sending kids to school&nbsp;with&nbsp;only one child inside the car and&nbsp;there is a long queue going to the school. I am just wondering whether there can be some platform set up, eg, at the Ministry of Education's school level to encourage parents to car pool, especially within the same area, they can send their kids together to school. Likewise for working places or even those residing in the same town, the CDC or the grassroots organisations may encourage such schemes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> &nbsp; Sir, as Dr Lim Wee Kiak has very well elaborated, car pooling tends to work better in a localised and customised fashion. Therefore, unless the Government can add value by having national platforms, it will still be far better to allow the informal arrangements to take place.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State&nbsp;whether the Ministry would consider giving priority to the housing estates which are affected by the new ERP gantry as a result of the outer-cordoned concept for their feeder-bus services to be improved at a faster rate because they are truly the ones who are being affected most.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> &nbsp; Sir, I think the ERP system covers most, if not all, parts of <p align=left>Column: 3011</p>Singapore.

It is therefore best to assess productivity over a longer horizon, instead of drawing conclusions on the basis of a few quarters' or a single year's data. Over the past five years from 2002&nbsp;to 2007, productivity growth averaged 3.0% per annum, higher than the real wage growth of 2.8% per annum. This is a respectable rate of productivity growth for a mature economy like Singapore. In developed countries like Australia, Germany, the UK and the US, average productivity growth is typically around 2.0% or below.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decline in productivity in 2007 is partly due to the record employment growth of 234,900 jobs (9.4% growth), which was far higher than the average of 116,500 jobs created per year over the last&nbsp;five years. During periods of strong employment growth, productivity growth typically tends to be lower as output growth will take time to catch up&nbsp;with the increase in manpower. We saw this happening during the economic boom <p align=left>Column: 3012</p>between 1996 and 1997, preceding the Asian financial crisis, when employment grew strongly (6.2% per annum on average) and productivity growth was low (1.8% per annum on average).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be simplistic to conclude that the weaker productivity performance was due to the increased presence of foreign workers. In fact, our flexible and responsive foreign manpower policies enable companies to capitalise quickly on growth opportunities in Singapore and expand to create even more jobs, including jobs for locals.&nbsp; This is why employment has grown strongly over the last few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we should redouble our efforts to ensure that productivity continues to grow over the long run so that we remain competitive.&nbsp; Our strategy to achieve this is three-fold.&nbsp; Firstly, by investing in the training of our workers.&nbsp; Secondly, by helping companies to take advantage of the higher skills of its workers through job redesign. Thirdly, by bringing in new investments and encouraging existing companies to upgrade through technology and innovation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will continue to invest in our workers to enable them to upgrade their skills and take on better jobs, through the CET Masterplan. Companies can also benefit from a more adaptable and productive workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On job redesign, we are working closely with companies to redesign jobs to enhance productivity and value. Spearheaded by NTUC, the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) is a key driver for Job Re-creation and Industry Re-development efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we support companies to upgrade their capabilities to undertake higher value-add activities and encouraging companies to invest in technology <p align=left>Column: 3013</p>and innovation for greater productivity.&nbsp;SPRING has been helping Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) through its Technology Innovation Programme (TIP) to accelerate technology adaptation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers and employers must work together to retrain and retool to improve our productivity and ensure our labour force remains competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Order.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the years, the Government has reviewed the conduct of every General Election (GE) and made the process simpler to both candidates and voters without compromising the integrity of the electoral process. After the 2001 <p align=left>Column: 3015</p>General Elections, Elections Department implemented a number of improvements for the 2006 General Election.&nbsp; The Parliamentary Elections Act was amended in 2005 to simplify the nomination process, and streamline the post-election reporting of political donations and election expenditure, among other issues. During the Committee of Supply debate this year, I informed the House that Elections Department has also reviewed the 2006 GE and will implement more improvements for the next GE. A key review area concerned overseas voting, which is the subject of the Bill before the House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Overseas voting</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2006 GE was the first time when overseas Singaporeans could vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,017 overseas Singaporeans registered to vote.&nbsp; 335 of the 553 overseas electors from the 16 contested constituencies eventually voted at the eight overseas polling stations. Now that we have experience in conducting overseas voting, we are prepared to take bolder steps to facilitate the participation of more overseas Singaporeans in our national elections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The constituency of overseas Singaporeans is growing as more Singaporeans go abroad to work and study. It is estimated that more than 150,000 Singaporeans are working or studying overseas today. This number will grow.&nbsp; It is important that they remain engaged in our domestic affairs and not lose the connection with their homeland.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill before the House proposes a number of amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act to that end. The amendments can be grouped into three broad areas. First, we will relax the qualifying criteria for overseas Singaporeans to vote. Second, we will simplify <p align=left>Column: 3016</p>the registration procedures for overseas voters. The third area comprises a number of miscellaneous amendments to support the first two groups of amendments. I will now elaborate on each of these areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Relaxing the qualifying criteria for overseas voting<br>Residency requirement<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overseas Singaporeans have to meet a basic residency requirement before they are eligible to register to vote overseas.&nbsp; We will continue to retain a residency requirement. Many countries have minimum residency requirements for their overseas voters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, all overseas Singaporeans who wish to vote must fulfil the requirement of having resided in Singapore for a cumulative period of two years within the period of five years before the cut-off date for the registers of electors. In addition, they must maintain a local contact address with the ICA, so that their names can be entered or retained in a constituency&rsquo;s register of electors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill will shorten the residency requirement to a cumulative 30 days out of the last three years before the cut-off date for the registration of electors. This will allow more overseas Singaporeans to vote. All an overseas Singaporean needs to do is to come home for 10 days a year to visit his family and friends. This is a far more liberal residency requirement compared to the present one. The Bill also does away with the current special treatment for Government officials and scholars or employees of approved international organisations who are employed or studying abroad, and their family members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Foreign electoral registers</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, certain voter disqualifications were reviewed after the 2006 GE in view <p align=left>Column: 3017</p>of feedback from overseas voters. The current Parliamentary Elections Act disqualifies overseas Singaporeans from voting if their names are entered in the electoral registers of other countries. The rationale was to exclude any citizen who could be a participant in the political process of a foreign State.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, we learnt that the UK authorities require all households to submit the particulars of household members annually. This is compulsory and applies to foreign residents from Commonwealth countries, which include Singapore. The information is then entered into the UK electoral registers. Some Singaporeans who were living in UK had their names entered into the UK electoral registers and were thus unable to register for overseas voting in the 2006 GE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should distinguish between Singaporeans who choose to participate in the political process of a foreign State and those who are included in foreign electoral registers and do nothing more. The former will continue to be disqualified whereas the latter should be given an opportunity to vote.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 of the Bill will amend section 6(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act to delete the current disqualification for overseas Singaporeans on account of their names being entered in the electoral registers of another country or territory. Instead, the disqualification criteria will be aligned to the circumstances under which a person may be deprived of Singapore citizenship, as spelt out in Article 135(2) of the Constitution. This covers the scenarios where Singapore citizens who acquire or apply to acquire foreign citizenship or where they exercise any rights which are accorded exclusively to the citizens or nationals of that country. For example, casting a vote in any foreign national election or the mayoral elections <p align=left>Column: 3018</p>of metropolitan areas like London will be disqualifying acts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Simplifying the registration process of overseas voters<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me move on to the second group of amendments, which is in the area of registration procedures, especially for overseas voters. Today, all voters, including overseas voters, who wish to register, must submit a completed and signed application form with supporting documents, either by hand or registered post, to any local or overseas registration centre or to the Elections Department. Overseas voters have just 21 days to register themselves for overseas voting after the registers of electors are revised and open for inspection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present registration period of 21 days is tight and may be too far removed in time from the actual issue of the Writ of election.&nbsp; The last GE saw Singaporeans who were newly-resident overseas travelling long distances to the nearest Singapore Embassy only to be disappointed that they could not cast their vote, because they had not registered during the 21-day window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will now allow overseas voters to register themselves at any time before the Writ of election is issued. Once the Writ is issued, registration will cease. Once the election is over, an overseas Singaporean can apply to register as an overseas voter for the next General Election. Clause 8 of the Bill does away with the 21-day window period stipulated in section 13A. Overseas voters will also be allowed to de-register or to change their assigned overseas polling station at any time before the Writ of election is issued. This will address the inconvenience arising whenever a registered overseas voter returns to Singapore or relocates to another city which is designated for overseas voting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3019</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also simplify the registration procedures in a number of ways. We will create an online facility to allow all Singaporeans to register as electors. The Bill does not deal with this&nbsp;explicitly. Regulations will be made under the Parliamentary Elections Act later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 11 of the Parliamentary Elections Act to remove the current requirement for every objection to be submitted in duplicate. With online processes, overseas Singaporeans will find this useful, especially if they are non-voters, and want to apply to restore their names to the registers of electors, or if they need to file claims to names omitted or objections to names found in the revised registers of electors during the 14-day period when the revised registers are open for inspection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 7 of the Bill also amends section 13 of the Parliamentary Elections Act to allow the Registration Officer to update the list of overseas voters in the registers of electors whenever necessary. The Registration Officer will be empowered to remove from the register the names of overseas voters whose contact addresses have ceased to exist or are outdated. The Officer can also enter the name onto the appropriate register once the person whose name is removed has notified the Commissioner of National Registration of his new contact address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other miscellaneous amendments<br>Extra-territorial application of the Parliamentary Elections Act<br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most of other laws, the Parliamentary Elections Act currently applies only to acts and omissions occurring within the territory of Singapore and there are no means to enforce its provisions against citizens outside Singapore. An overseas voter who <p align=left>Column: 3020</p>commits an election offence while he is in an overseas polling station therefore cannot be charged in our courts here.&nbsp; Similarly, false claims or declarations made by overseas Singaporeans to gain registration also fall outside the Parliamentary Elections Act&rsquo;s application.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While making it easier for overseas Singaporeans to vote, we must have avenues to deal with those who undermine the integrity of the electoral process by committing an election offence or making false declarations.&nbsp; The Bill therefore provides for extra-territorial application of the Parliamentary Elections Act to ensure that the integrity of the election process is not undermined. For example, the making of any false declaration when applying to register as an overseas voter or to change the allotted overseas polling station will be an offence, even if made outside Singapore. The person, if convicted, faces a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both. Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 21 of the Parliamentary Elections Act for this purpose. Clause 12 of the Bill similarly gives extra-territorial effect to the regulations governing overseas voting. The legal proceedings for these offences will take place only in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Improving access to overseas stations</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have designated&nbsp;nine cities where overseas polling stations may be set up.&nbsp; Currently, only diplomatic Missions may serve as overseas polling stations. This is because they enjoy diplomatic immunity and any activity conducted in it remains under Singapore&rsquo;s control. To deal with situations where a particular Mission is not available to cope with the number of voters, we will expand the class of premises that can be used as overseas polling stations, to include the official residences of our senior diplomats. These premises similarly have diplomatic immunity. Clause 10 of the Bill makes this <p align=left>Column: 3021</p>change.&nbsp; This is connected with the amendment to the definition of &ldquo;overseas polling stations&rdquo; in clause 2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By clause 12 of the Bill, we will also lift the existing cap on voting hours at overseas polling stations in section 39A, overseas polling stations. This means that an overseas polling station may operate beyond the current limit of 12 hours when necessary. However, an overseas poll must close not later than the close of the polls on polling day in Singapore. This is unchanged.</p><p><br><I>Amendments to the Presidential Elections Act<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 13 of the Bill makes related amendments to sections 2 and 22A of the Presidential Elections Act in the same manner as the amendments in clauses 2, 11 and 12 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as more Singaporeans venture abroad to work or study, we will strive to ensure that they remain connected to Singapore.&nbsp; This Bill seeks to make it easier for overseas Singaporeans to register and vote while at the same time preserving the integrity of the election process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question&nbsp;proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.16 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, the proposed relaxations to increase the catchment of overseas voters are a step in the right direction,&nbsp; in particular, section 5 eases the residency requirement from two years out of five to 30 days out of three years which should enable more to qualify.&nbsp; However, I would like to seek two clarifications from the Deputy Prime Minister about the amendments.&nbsp; First of all, the definition of \"overseas polling station\" has now been <p align=left>Column: 3022</p>expanded to cover the official residence of our diplomats.&nbsp; And based on his Second Reading speech earlier, are we to assume that the increase in polling stations is still confined, for&nbsp;example,&nbsp;to the political capitals of the countries in question?&nbsp; Second, is there any plan in the near future to explore other countries which are not currently listed?&nbsp; I understand that there are a fair number of Singaporeans, for example, in other countries such as New Zealand and India.&nbsp; Would those countries be considered in the medium term?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there is also the provision, section 39A, which remains unchanged that the polls overseas should not close later than the poll in Singapore which, I think, is a very right step.&nbsp; Is the Government considering closing the overseas polls early enough so that the overseas votes can be sent back to Singapore in time for counting to be combined with the local votes?&nbsp; As I previously said, this is important for voter anonymity, especially in smaller constituencies where the number of overseas voters may be very small.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Sir, I was also intending to raise issues concerning by-elections in the Group Representation Constituencies which are covered under the Parliamentary Elections Act.&nbsp; However, as there has been a motion filed by the Nominated Member, I will be raising my comments at that time.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.18 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill seeks to refine the Act by implementing changes that the Deputy Prime Minister had announced in the Committee of Supply debate earlier this year.&nbsp; These refinements are positive and much welcome.&nbsp; Having said that, I have <p align=left>Column: 3023</p>three points for the Deputy Prime Minister's consideration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, of all the amendments, the relaxation of the eligibility criteria for an overseas voter is the most significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore citizen must now spend an aggregate of 30 days in the past three years in Singapore to qualify for overseas voting.&nbsp; It removes the previous eligibility criteria which had been heavily criticised.&nbsp; This will have the effect of enabling many more overseas Singaporeans to vote.&nbsp; It also means that at the next general elections, overseas polling stations are likely to receive many more overseas voters than in the 2006 elections.&nbsp; Section 39 of the Act specifies that the Presiding Officer of a polling station, which includes an overseas polling station, shall exclude from the polling station&nbsp;all persons except voters allotted to that polling station, the candidates, the polling agents of&nbsp;each candidate and other persons involved in the functioning of the polling station.&nbsp; My question is whether the Government will make special provision to enable polling agents of candidates to be present in overseas polling stations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Act, as it now stands, permits parties to send their polling agents to overseas polling stations, the reality is that travel costs would be so high as to make this prohibitive and unrealistic.&nbsp; That being the case, I propose that the Government should fund the travel of one polling agent from each political party involved in the elections to each overseas polling station where overseas voters in respect of constituencies contested by that party are registered to vote so that all parties would be able to appropriately monitor the various overseas polling stations.&nbsp; This would ensure that the same degree of transparency and accountability applies to both local and overseas polling <p align=left>Column: 3024</p>stations and preclude any allegation of vote rigging, foul play or other unfairness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point relates to early voting for overseas voters.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim had raised this issue in last year's COS and I think she has mentioned this slightly earlier.&nbsp; Sir, at COS this year, the Deputy Prime Minister had answered that there are many implications to early voting which make it unfeasible, including the fact that overseas Singaporeans would then only witness four to five days of campaigning from overseas before voting which may not be enough for them to form a conclusion on whom to vote for.&nbsp; I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to reconsider this and to permit early voting for overseas voters.&nbsp; The concern raised by Ms Lim is certainly true that there is a valid concern about anonymity in some wards, in particular single member constituencies.&nbsp; It seems to me that there is little qualitative difference between five days of campaigning and nine days of campaigning.&nbsp; I believe that the benefits of permitting early voting for overseas voters far outweigh the potential problems.&nbsp; And, certainly, if the Government was keen to give Singaporeans more time to come to an informed conclusion, then it should provide for much longer campaign period than the statutory minimum of nine days which has been the practice in past elections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, in this year's COS, Mr Matthias Yao had raised the question of contingency plans to deal with possible disruptions to the smooth conduct of elections, such as severe weather on Nomination Day and Polling Day.&nbsp; The Deputy Prime Minister's response then was that the Elections Department was looking into this and&nbsp;legislative amendments would be introduced to address such situations.&nbsp; The Bill currently before this House does not appear to address this issue.&nbsp; I therefore hope that the Deputy Prime Minister can update this House on the status of the Elections Department's work on contingency <p align=left>Column: 3025</p>planning and the proposed legislative amendments that he had referred to in this year's COS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Amendment Bill before this House is a well-balanced piece of legislation that preserves the principles of democracy by enabling many more overseas Singaporeans to vote than is presently the case.&nbsp; This keeps our general elections relevant in today's globalised world.&nbsp; I believe that the refinements I have suggested would improve the Act even more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.22 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, I thank the Members for supporting the amendments in this Bill.&nbsp; I will answer&nbsp;the questions raised by both Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Siew Kum Hong.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lim asked whether&nbsp;we could&nbsp;expand the number of overseas polling stations or not.&nbsp; Right now, we have nine.&nbsp; There are certain basic criteria we have to consider before we decide to open an overseas&nbsp;polling station.&nbsp; Firstly, we must have a Mission in that particular country.&nbsp; Secondly, we must have enough Singaporeans living in that country.&nbsp; And, thirdly, if&nbsp;the election&nbsp;is to be held in a particular city, we also must have enough mass in that particular city.&nbsp; What are the numbers we look at?&nbsp; If we have 10,000 Singaporeans living in&nbsp;a country, say,&nbsp;China, definitely, we will have a polling station in China.&nbsp; If there are more than 1,000 Singaporeans in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, we will have an overseas polling station in these two cities.&nbsp; Short of that, it is hard to justify&nbsp;opening an overseas polling station because it does require a lot of planning and resources to deal on the actual day of polling.&nbsp; So from the studies we have made, I think the expansion to the current list of nine cities is enough.&nbsp; If there is a need to do more, <p align=left>Column: 3026</p>we will look at them and see what more can be done to open up more polling stations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On advancing the end of poll for overseas polling stations, I have explained before that it&nbsp;will shorten the time for overseas voters to make an informed decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just heard&nbsp;Mr Siew saying that five days of campaigning is the same as nine days of campaigning, so why not close four days earlier.&nbsp; I am not sure if the Opposition will agree with that.&nbsp; I think we all want to have as much time as possible to put our views across.&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing right now to close the poll for overseas station no later than&nbsp;we close the poll for the Singapore station&nbsp;is a correct one.&nbsp; We will see how else we can deal with the situation of too few voters in a particular constituency.&nbsp; But as more Singaporeans go overseas to work and register themselves to vote, then the chances are that many of them will come from&nbsp;a particular constituency, and therefore the question of secrecy or anonymity of the vote will no&nbsp;longer arise.&nbsp; In fact, even if there are&nbsp;five overseas Singaporeans who voted&nbsp;for a particular&nbsp;constituency, nobody can tell really how the five individual members actually voted other than to know that maybe X number for one party and&nbsp;Y number for another party.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, who voted for who is anybody's guess.&nbsp; I think the Opposition Member, Mr Low Thia Khiang himself, also once agreed with me that the vote is secret and we cannot really tell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the eligibility criteria, I have explained that. Mr Siew is quite happy with the change.&nbsp; His suggestion about Government funding the polling agent to go to a polling station overseas&nbsp;is something that we will not need to do, because there is no law compelling any party to send any&nbsp;polling agent to&nbsp;the polling station.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not compulsory.&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not have to do it.&nbsp; In fact, there are some parties that could not even have&nbsp;enough&nbsp;polling agents for the Singapore <p align=left>Column: 3027</p>elections.&nbsp; So we do not see the need to spend public money to send the Opposition or PAP polling agent to an overseas station.&nbsp; We should trust the integrity of the election process and,&nbsp;so far, there has been no complaint.&nbsp; People know that our election is fair and transparent and it is not an issue at all not to have polling agents to oversee it.&nbsp; If the party wants to do so, I think they are free to spend whatever they need or even to appoint somebody overseas as their polling agent.&nbsp; But, again, that must be subject to the availability of space in a particular overseas polling station because, as&nbsp;we know, Singapore is quite frugal.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have&nbsp;large Missions like some countries and, therefore, we may not be able to find enough&nbsp;space to accommodate all the parties that want to send their polling agents to those countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the last question of contingency plans, these are still being worked out.&nbsp; This particular Bill only deals with overseas voting and registration for overseas voting.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The staging of strategic tourism events in Singapore enhances Singapore's global branding and brings significant economic benefits to the country.&nbsp; However, such events typically entail high staging costs.&nbsp; The Government can provide financial support commensurate with benefits to the broader economy to help defray some of the costs.&nbsp; But it is not sustainable for Government to be the sole source of support for such events.&nbsp; We need the key beneficiaries of such events to also play a part in defraying these costs as they <p align=left>Column: 3030</p>derive significant economic benefits from these events.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the tourism and hospitality sectors stand to benefit from the higher foreign visitorship to Singapore arising from these events.&nbsp; This will&nbsp;translate into higher hotel occupancy and room rates, increased patronage of entertainment and retail establishments, and greater tourist spending.&nbsp; It is hence reasonable for such benefiting establishments to provide an equitable contribution in the form of cess to defray part of the high costs of staging strategic tourism events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go through the major amendments proposed in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Imposing cess to fund specific tourism events</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, sections 5 and 6 of the Singapore Tourism (Cess Collection) Act stipulate that tourist establishments are liable for cess on the specified sales made or charges collected at a specified rate.&nbsp; To allow cess to be used in a more targeted way, clause 3 of the Bill empowers the Minister to declare a tourism event where cess will be applied and the period for which cess shall be levied.&nbsp; The clause would also allow the Minister to specify the descriptions of sales or charges for which cess shall be paid, the tourist establishments upon which cess shall be levied and the rates at which cess shall be paid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Changing incidence of cess on to tourist establishments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, my Ministry proposes to repeal section 7 in clause 4 of the Bill to remove the provisions for the recovery of cess from consumers.&nbsp; Currently, tourist establishments may recover cess from their customers and, in doing so, show the amount of cess paid on the sales receipts.&nbsp; With the amendment, the <p align=left>Column: 3031</p>Singapore Tourism (Cess Collection) Act will reposition the incidence of cess on the specified tourist establishments, rather than on their customers.&nbsp; Tourist establishments can then price their products and services in accordance with prevailing market conditions.&nbsp; This is in line with the Government's intent for the key beneficiaries of tourism events to make a contribution towards the cost of these events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Allowing the Singapore Tourism Board to obtain information</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is currently empowered to obtain information under the Singapore Tourism (Cess Collection) Act for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of cess to be paid.&nbsp; Under the proposed approach of imposing cess for specific tourism events, the STB would need to advise my Ministry on the tourist establishments on which cess is applicable and the amount of cess to be paid by any person under the Act.&nbsp; Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill will allow the STB to obtain the information required to carry out this responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Improvement to the penalty structure</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 9 of the Bill will strengthen the penalty framework in the Singapore Tourism (Cess Collection) Act to allow the STB to deal more effectively with non-compliance.&nbsp; The penalty for late or non-payment will increase the longer a person delays cess payment.&nbsp; Beyond the initial 5% penalty, any additional penalty is subject to a maximum of 50% of the amount of cess outstanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the Singapore Tourism (Cess Collection) Act will enhance our ability to anchor strategic tourism events in Singapore, many of which come at a high staging cost.&nbsp; These tourism events <p align=left>Column: 3032</p>will not only benefit the tourism sector and the economy at large, but will also enhance the profile of Singapore internationally and contribute to ongoing efforts to transform Singapore into a distinctive and vibrant global city.&nbsp; While Government can provide support commensurate with the benefits to the economy, it is essential for the success and sustainability of these tourism events that the key beneficiaries also play their part and help defray the high staging costs of such events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Public Transport Council Act (PTC Act) to enable <p align=left>Column: 3033</p>the PTC to support the development of a more integrated public transport system, by introducing distance-based through fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our public transport system is based on a hub-and-spoke model. &nbsp;This is a much more efficient model than having many direct services. &nbsp;How this works is that we have more frequent and faster services bringing commuters to a transport hub and then onwards to their destination, with the same amount of resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will deliver better outcomes for commuters because more frequent feeder services will mean shorter waiting times for commuters.&nbsp; Making transfers can also reduce overall travel time, especially for longer journeys.&nbsp; This is the correct model for a compact city state like Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, we will enhance our hub-and-spoke public transport system to address waiting time, travel time and crowding levels, which Members often raise in this House, as key areas of concern to commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfers are part and parcel of a hub-and-spoke system.&nbsp; However, our fare structure today is not fully integrated and does not support transfers.&nbsp; In fact, a commuter pays more to make a transfer journey compared to a direct journey, even if he travels on a comparable route over the same distance.&nbsp; Although he receives a rebate of 25 cents whenever he makes a transfer between bus and rapid transit, or between buses, this does not fully cover the additional cost of the transfer. &nbsp;Commuters who make transfers today therefore bear a financial 'penalty' for making a transfer.&nbsp; In effect, revenues from transfer journeys cross-subsidise direct journeys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A better, more integrated fare structure would be distance-based through fares: charging commuters based <p align=left>Column: 3034</p>on the distance travelled, regardless of the number of transfers made.&nbsp; This would be more equitable for all commuters as it will eliminate any cross-subsidy between transfers and direct journeys.&nbsp; It would also benefit all commuters, whether they make transfers or not, in that all commuters would be given more choices over the routes for their journeys.&nbsp; They would not be penalised for choosing to make transfers if doing so were faster, more direct or provided a better travel experience, compared to having to wait for a direct service in order to avoid paying the \"transfer penalty\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, distance-based through fares would make our public transport system more seamless.&nbsp; As transfers are part and parcel of a hub-and-spoke network, we should have a fare structure that removes the current impediments to making transfers. &nbsp;In addition, providing commuters with more choices and greater convenience will increase the attractiveness of public transport as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the PTC already oversees matters related to public transport fares, it is the most appropriate agency to lead the integration of public transport fares. &nbsp;To that end, a new function has to be enacted in the PTC Act.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the PTC Act will be amended for the PTC to take on a new function: to drive fare integration by introducing distance-based through fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill expands the PTC's current functions under section 4 of the PTC Act, to include promoting and facilitating the integration of bus and Rapid Transit System (RTS) fares to ensure the provision of efficient public transport services and facilities.&nbsp; This will give the PTC the necessary mandate to integrate fares by introducing distance-based through fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3035</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key amendments arising from this new function are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;The PTC to initiate and impose changes to the public transport fare structure and the apportionment of fare revenue among the public transport operators; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;The widening of its range of enforcement powers on its decisions on fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me elaborate and highlight the key provisions in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the PTC will be able to initiate a review of the bus and RTS fares and make changes to the fares and apportionment of fare revenues, for the purposes of integrating public transport fares. &nbsp;This will be in addition to the PTC's current mandate in the annual fare revision exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this, clause 5 proposes inserting two new sections to the PTC Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 24AA empowers the PTC to make structural changes to any fare by varying them, or imposing such changes as conditions to its approval of fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PTC would also need to have powers to determine the rules for revenue-sharing among the public transport operators.&nbsp; This is meant to ensure the continued financial viability of the operators and the overall system, even as fares are being changed to a more integrated form.&nbsp; Section 24AA will, therefore, also provide the PTC with the power to impose conditions on operators with regard to the apportionment of fare revenues.&nbsp; Such conditions could also require the operators to publish the integrated fares for the benefit of commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3036</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These structural changes will affect many parties, especially the public transport operators who provide the services.&nbsp; To ensure due process in making these changes, we propose to insert a new section 24AB, which requires the PTC to give notice to and consult the relevant parties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the PTC decides on the revisions in fares, it would need powers to enforce its decisions, to ensure the public transport operators comply with its decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 24 of the Act to enable the PTC to take a wider range of enforcement measures if the operator does not comply with its decision.&nbsp; Depending on the gravity of the non-compliance, the PTC can decide to revoke its approval of the operators' fares, suspend its approval for a period not exceeding six months, impose a financial penalty not exceeding $100,000 or publicly censure the operator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PTC will be required to give notice to the operators concerned, and allow the operators to show cause as to why the PTC should not take action before carrying out the enforcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To align the current enforcement provisions with the changes, clause 3 of the Bill amends section 23&nbsp;of the Act to make it clear that any public transport fares suspended by the PTC will be deemed not to be an approved fare.&nbsp; Clause 3 also clarifies section 23 to make it an offence to charge fares that are not approved by the PTC under the amended provisions of the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of distance-based through fares will mean structural changes to our bus and RTS fares.&nbsp; This is necessary to better integrate our hub-and-spoke public transport system, and will benefit commuters by giving them more choices.&nbsp; By giving the PTC the necessary <p align=left>Column: 3037</p>powers to integrate our fare structure and introduce distance-based through fares, it would help to realise our vision of a more people-centred land transport system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.07 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (West Coast):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Public Transport Council (Amendment) Bill introduced by the Minister for Transport.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, commuters who make a transfer between buses, or bus and MRT, or the LRT and the MRT, face a transfer penalty, as the Minister pointed out.&nbsp; This arises because the current transfer rebate, a misnomer, of 25 cents, does not fully offset the boarding charge of 60 cents for the subsequent leg of a transfer journey.&nbsp; These commuters are effectively cross-subsidising direct journeys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been reported that&nbsp;four in 10 commuters today make at least one transfer journey each day and they are not&nbsp;a happy lot.&nbsp; The need to make a transfer is inevitable in a hub-and-spoke system, as the Minister also pointed out.&nbsp; The alternative to hub-and-spoke system is to have direct services but the cost will be&nbsp;too prohibitive for a small city like Singapore.&nbsp; The proposed introduction of distance-based through fares and the removal of transfer penalties is therefore long overdue and represents a sensible and positive move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commuters who need to make transfers are already inconvenienced as their total journey time would be longer and yet, these commuters are being penalised for having to make a transfer. &nbsp;This should be stopped if we are to attract more to take public transport.&nbsp; Such commuters should be enjoying a full <p align=left>Column: 3038</p>rebate of&nbsp;the boarding charge for any subsequent leg of their journey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shipping&nbsp;or the airline business, if you ship something from Perth to Los Angeles and the container has to be transhipped in Singapore, you cannot charge the customer more.&nbsp; In fact, you might have to charge lower because of the time delay in transhipment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the PTOs want to rationalise the public transport system to reduce&nbsp;overall network cost, it should, at the same time, pass such savings on to those who are affected by such rationalisation.&nbsp; The proposed amendment is, therefore, an equitable and efficient way forward as part of MOT's strategic thrust of making public transport&nbsp;the choice mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, I think there are other potential benefits beyond what we see, based on today's travel patterns.&nbsp; The benefit of distance-based through fares does not stop here. There are many other commuters who are currently not making transfers because they do not wish to pay the transfer penalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the removal of the transfer penalty, more commuters will take to the hub-and-spoke network which will further enhance its efficiency and make it work better. &nbsp;Also, hopefully, concession fares (monthly concession season fares and so forth) can be rationalised and offered seamlessly for commuters of both bus and rail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I support the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions regarding the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, could he highlight the number of commuters who could potentially benefit from the distance-based through fares?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, would the majority of six in 10 commuters that make direct journeys today be made to bear the burden of removal of the transfer penalty?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if so, does MOT have any plans to ease such a burden?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3039</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, for commuters to reap the benefits of a distance-based through fare system, the hub-and-spoke system needs to work better.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government's part, what is being done to improve our hub-and-spoke system further, especially the capacity of our bus and MRT terminals which act as transfer hubs today because we can envisage that these terminals would be handling much more traffic than they are currently handling?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the Bill seeks to enable the PTC to take various enforcement measures, including imposing&nbsp;a financial penalty of up to $100,000.&nbsp; The Minister did mention there are other measures that the PTC can take, like revoking the licences of the PTOs. &nbsp;But such measures are draconian in nature and have public interest implications.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister whether the $100,000 penalty is sufficient to ensure compliance of PTOs without resorting to more draconian measures?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I strongly support the Bill because the new framework will pave a more equitable way forward as part of MOT's strategic thrust of making public transport a choice mode.&nbsp; At the same time, the hub-and-spoke system has to be further improved in tandem and the new framework should not come at the expense of&nbsp;commuters who make direct journeys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.13 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with firm conviction that the integration of bus and rail fares will mark an important milestone in the continuing improvement of our public transport system.&nbsp; I rise in support of the proposed amendments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3040</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic and population growth are two compelling reasons to raise the bar on our public transport system.&nbsp; As we plan for a global city that&nbsp;6.5 million people can proudly call home, we also have to plan for a transportation system that will take them anywhere within the city as easily as possible.&nbsp; More immediately, rising fuel costs, coupled with plans to lower the vehicle population growth rate to 1.5% per annum&nbsp;as room for road expansion becomes more limited, mean that the cost of private car&nbsp;ownership and usage&nbsp;will increase over time and become less practical for many.&nbsp; Public transport must be improved so that people are able to move and travel conveniently and comfortably on buses and trains without overstraining their budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is timely that we&nbsp;embark on a major revamp of our public transport system to bring about a people-centred system as set&nbsp;out in the Land Transport Masterplan. &nbsp;To succeed, this major revamp requires fares to be integrated and bus services to be realigned and coordinated.&nbsp; With these amendments to the Public Transport Council Act, the PTC will have the powers to initiate and change the fares, including the fare structures, to be charged by the public transport operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2009, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will take over centralised planning of the bus network and services with the PTC retaining oversight. On both fronts, the PTC plays a very crucial&nbsp;role in the implementation of these changes as both of them are extremely sensitive and emotive exercises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As can be seen from the recent fury of protests in the forum pages of newspapers and in the various blogs and podcasts such as the mrbrown show podcast which puts forward a humorous but biting take on transfers, and I quote, \"fare game\", those who end up inconvenienced will naturally be dis<p align=left>Column: 3041</p>gruntled but those who end up better served will not thank anyone for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a need to redress this imbalance in the feedback that we receive.&nbsp; I understand&nbsp;it can be&nbsp;very difficult to speak out.&nbsp; When we attend a dinner, for example, and everyone around the table is complaining about how adversely affected they are, I am sure you will feel quite shy to say out loud that you are happy because you are benefiting.&nbsp; Somehow, it is popular to criticise and complain.&nbsp; Somehow, we do not want to be seen to take pleasure in the unhappiness of others or we simply do not want to attract undue sarcastic comments from those who are unhappy around us.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some inconveniences and unhappiness would inevitably arise in some quarters when a change is implemented.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would strongly encourage those who support or benefit from fare integration to come out and be more vocal about their views for the change.&nbsp; More importantly, I urge all commuters to look at the bigger and longer term picture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vision of the Land Transport Ministry&nbsp;is to ensure a quality urban living environment&nbsp; as the economy and population grow and to achieve this goal, the commuter is put squarely in the centre.&nbsp; The interest of the commuter is right at&nbsp;the heart of the Land Transport Masterplan.&nbsp; In other words, the intention of the present fare integration exercise is to give a better commuter experience as a whole. Ultimately, it is critical for the Government to have the political will to carry out measures which may not enjoy popular support in the short term but will result in the long-term benefit for commuters as a whole. &nbsp;In other words, short-term pain for some, long-term gain for the majority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the public transport operators, SBS Transit and SMRT, operate <p align=left>Column: 3042</p>within a fare structure that has been agreed and approved by the PTC.&nbsp; Any application for increase or change has to be submitted to the PTC for approval.&nbsp; But the PTC has no authority to proactively force an operator to change the fare that he charges and could only react when an application is submitted by the operator.&nbsp; Hence, it is only recently, after many years of persuasion and petitioning by the MPs and the public, that SBS Transit introduced the&nbsp;season pass that allows unlimited rides within a given period of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sense that the operators were reluctant to offer season tickets as this was seen as less revenue compared to standard tickets for one-time travel.&nbsp; I, therefore, welcome the amendments to the PTC Act which give the PTC powers to initiate and change the fares, including the fare structure.&nbsp; I look forward to PTC introducing more types of travel passes and season tickets for unlimited travel on bus and rail. &nbsp;For example, in London, although the cash single-fare is prohibitively high, very few people actually pay that fare because there is an array of \"oyster\" fare, one and three-day passes, off-peak travel cards and season tickets to choose from. &nbsp;Not only does this give the commuter a capped-cost to better manage his budget for transport expenses, it will encourage him to take public transport more, because he has already paid for the season ticket.&nbsp; Such unlimited travel passes will revolutionalise the travel patterns of our population. Perhaps, in addition to the basic transport needs of getting to and from work, people will be able to go out more, to socialise more, to shop more and to dine more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with our pro-family initiatives, I would also like to suggest to the PTC that family fares be introduced, allowing a family travelling together to pay less than the sum total of the individual standard fares.&nbsp; Families can enjoy more outings <p align=left>Column: 3043</p>together, especially during off-peak weekends, knowing that their transport expenditure is capped.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, having said the above, I do not think we can start celebrating that the PTC will now favour commuters without regard to the interests of the operators, because the PTC still has the challenging mission of balancing&nbsp;commuters' interest with the long-term viability of the transport operators. &nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to clarify how this will work in practice. &nbsp;For example, if the PTC thinks that a certain type of season pass should be introduced, will the PTC then have to consult with the transport operators to take into consideration how much revenue operators will lose when commuters use this new season pass and try to compensate the operators with extra fare revenue by allowing an increase in fares from somewhere else?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One recent change which illustrates PTC's challenge is distance-based fare&nbsp;structure and the&nbsp; removal of transfer penalty.&nbsp; As transfers lubricate the wheel that comprises the hub-and-spoke transport system, it makes sense that for the hub-and-spoke model to function optimally, transfers should be the order of the day and not to be penalised.&nbsp; The distance-based fare structure will allow commuters to choose the preferred route to take to reach their destination.&nbsp; The revelation that the distance-based system will&nbsp;help cut transport costs for four in 10 commuters&nbsp;was welcomed.&nbsp; But the news that this loss of revenue will be passed on to direct fares thus would result in higher fares for the remaining six commuters who make direct trips has provoked public outcry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was perturbed that the&nbsp;public transport operators are allowed to recoup the loss of transfer penalty by raising fares on direct trips. &nbsp;I think we should <p align=left>Column: 3044</p>first observe and monitor the impact on the collections of the PTOs following the introduction of the distance-based through&nbsp;fares and allow some time for the system to settle down before considering making any fare adjustments for direct trips. &nbsp;This will be more favourably received by commuters than imposing an immediate increase in fares for direct trips. &nbsp;With respect, the premise that the fares for direct trips be immediately increased to meet the costs of restructuring is untenable.&nbsp; This is because the exercise to integrate fares by introducing distance-based through fares is not a simple one. &nbsp;We are not talking about a straightforward equation of compensating for the loss of revenue in one area by increasing revenue by charging more money somewhere else.&nbsp; As the PTC is well aware, pricing of fares involves many factors and variables and it is not clear whether at the end of the day, the PTOs will lose any revenue or what the quantum of any loss of revenue would be. &nbsp;It may be well that the overall revenue may increase due to a rise in ridership as more travel options open for commuters with the introduction of distance-based through&nbsp;fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in theory, the hub-and-spoke system is an ideal model on which to base transport planning.&nbsp; It is cost-efficient,&nbsp;energy-efficient and has the capability to match and maybe surpass the journey-time offered by direct services, the only drawback being that commuters have to make more transfers.&nbsp; However, I am not convinced of the effectiveness of the hub-and-spoke system in our HDB estates where there is a heavy dependence on feeder services.&nbsp; In my constituency, Tampines, residents have complained to me that their children have been posted by MOE to schools in the neighbouring housing estate of Bedok.&nbsp; As the crow flies, Bedok may be the nearest town from Tampines.&nbsp; However, to get from their home in Tampines to their school in Bedok, the students have to take a feeder bus to the hub in Tampines, transfer to a <p align=left>Column: 3045</p>trunk service or the MRT to Bedok hub before hopping&nbsp;on another feeder to go to school. On the other hand, if their home and their school are served by a couple of trunk services each, their choice of services and connections is multiplied as these services criss-cross each other along their routes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Transport has indicated that when LTA takes on the role of central bus planner, it will seek to make feeder services more direct and frequent.&nbsp; I hope LTA will conduct a fundamental review of the feeder bus system to improve the connectivity in our HDB estates. &nbsp;I am still not convinced why feeder bus services should ply in a loop around the hub.&nbsp; We speak of the hub-and-spoke system.&nbsp; The spokes of a wheel radiate from the hub. &nbsp;Therefore, is a two-directional bus service linking two hubs&nbsp;not better than a feeder service going one full circle in a loop?&nbsp; It will give commuters a choice of taking the service one way or the other way, to either one of the hubs.&nbsp; Such a service linking two hubs can collect and feed people living along the route to either hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Amendment Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.23 pm</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang):</B> Sir, I support the proposed Amendment Bill to confer a new function on PTC to drive integration of bus and RTS fares by means of introducing distance-based through fares.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, our fare structure is not equitable and not consistent with our hub-and-spoke model as it is not fully integrated and does not support transfer. In fact, a commuter pays more to make a transfer journey with less travelling time compared to a direct journey that requires more travelling time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3046</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for example, a commuter that travels from Yishun to Singapore Expo by MRT. He will incur a fare of $1.75 by ez-link card and the journey time is 58 minutes. However, if he wants to cut down travelling time to 50 minutes and makes a transfer by taking a bus and then a train, he will have to incur a higher fare of $2.30, even after transfer rebates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for commuters to enjoy more efficient, more frequent services and shorter journey times, transfer penalty will have to be removed.&nbsp; Indirectly, this also means that transfer rebates will have to be increased.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the transfer rebate is 25 cents and is paid by the second leg operator.&nbsp; So, if a bus brings commuters to a train, the train will bear the transfer rebate, and vice versa.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek clarifications from the Minister on the following three issues:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Transfer rebates.&nbsp; How will PTC ensure that the rules of transfer rebates and revenue sharing are equitably introduced so as to balance the interests of commuters, operators and workers in the transport industry?&nbsp; If transfer rebate is high, commuters that make transfer journey will understandably be happy.&nbsp; However, it may &nbsp;not be so for operators as it may affect their financial viability.&nbsp; For workers in the transport industry, they could be worried too as the operators&rsquo; revenue may be affected.&nbsp; Like any other ordinary Singaporean workers, they too look forward to annual wage and bonus increases.&nbsp; On the other hand, will commuters on direct journey be made to pay a higher fare as a result of this structural change?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;Fares for Distance. &nbsp;Currently, PTC has a formula to determine the appropriate annual fare increase after submission by the operators.&nbsp; As the <p align=left>Column: 3047</p>current&nbsp;fares are set by the operators based on fare stages, which is also distance-based, what will be the roles of the operators and PTC in determining and setting the fare for a particular distance with the empowerment to PTC to introduce distance-based through fares? As the Minister mentioned just now, with&nbsp;the amendment, PTC is required to consult the&nbsp;relevant parties. Who are the relevant parties that PTC needs to consult?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;Transfer and Direct Journey. &nbsp;Does MOT have the information on the number of commuters who make transfers and what were their patterns?&nbsp; Is it bus-bus between the same operator, or bus-train between different operators or bus-train-bus?&nbsp; This will be useful in determining how the structural change in the fare system will affect the commuters and their travelling patterns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.27 pm</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments contained in the Bill will put in place the necessary framework&nbsp;to allow the Public Transport Council to implement distance-based through fares, which is, in my view, a fair basis for determining public transport fares. So I only have two points to make in relation to the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 23 of the Act, in particular clause 3(b) amends section 23(2) such that PTC may, in certain circumstances, prohibit persons from charging fares lower than those approved by the PTC. This is a change from the current situation&nbsp;where persons are freely permitted to charge fares lower than those approved by the PTC. This seems counter-intuitive. After all, if an operator is able and willing to reduce its <p align=left>Column: 3048</p>fares, why should the PTC stop it from doing so?&nbsp; I would&nbsp; think that lower transport fares are a good thing, especially in these times of high inflation. I therefore hope that the Minister can clarify the situation in which the PTC will proscribe persons from charging lower fares than what have been approved and what measures will be put in place to ensure that the PTC will do so only in these situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, the new section 24AB creates a mechanism for the PTC to consult with licensed bus service operators and licensed Rapid Transit System operators. But this excludes the public. I hope the Minister can clarify why only the operators and not the public who, after all, are the persons who will be paying these fares, will be consulted. Indeed, a recurring complaint from the public is that the PTC does not pay sufficient heed to the concerns of the commuters themselves, considering that it is the commuters who will be using the system and paying the fares.&nbsp;I think there is room for the Act to be amended to allow for greater public consultation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.29 pm</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Public Transport Council&nbsp;(Amendment) Bill, as it is indeed very timely with the increasing call of the public to switch to public transport.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the population projected to increase in the years ahead, we must be&nbsp;conscious in our approach&nbsp;in urban planning and ensure that what we implement must be far-sighted so that we do not leave our future generation with problems that are insurmountable.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our economy, our <p align=left>Column: 3049</p>entire society, revolves around it&nbsp;&ndash; a fact highlighted by the more than five million trips that are made on it every day.&nbsp; Yet this is overlooked, sometimes taken for granted even.&nbsp; Demands from its users for its absolute perfection, in terms of cost and efficiency, are continually heard.&nbsp; Such expectations are healthy, as it stimulates constant improvement&nbsp;&ndash; an element which is very necessary when we look at the demands on our transport system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the proposed amendments, I hope we can have before long a more equitable fare system so that commuters would not be penalised by the fare structure for the many criss-crossing they have to make daily from one transport service to another.&nbsp; I have a few concerns and suggestions to&nbsp;make on the integration of fares and the PTC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, I would like to urge the Ministry to hasten the integration of fares.&nbsp; Do not take another six months of review like the issue on safety belts.&nbsp; If necessary, implement in phases and roll out the new plans so that the benefits could expeditiously benefit the commuters without further delay as they are long overdue.&nbsp; As with motoring, speed of travel is the equation to efficiency.&nbsp; I am glad that the Ministry has recognised&nbsp;time as the key measure for transport efficiency.&nbsp; Hence, the distance-based fares to allow the commuters to switch from one mode of transport to another depending on the availability of services,&nbsp; and the key is the availability of bus and rail services and the timeliness of these services&nbsp;is critical for an integrated public transport system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an integrated public transport system, then only can the PTC ensure that there is maximum value for the commuters through distance-based fares.&nbsp; So the PTC should not only look at the distance-based fares but&nbsp;also look at the availability of the rail and&nbsp;bus services at <p align=left>Column: 3050</p>the same time and also the timeliness of the arrival of these services.&nbsp; So this key change is welcome as it would mean lower costs for commuters and a shorter travelling time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for single long distance-based commuters, I hope the Ministry would consider lowering the fixed cost fare for the first journey since the other component, the distance-based fare, would take into account most of the cost of travelling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With PTC taking on the additional responsibilities to initiate and impose changes on the transport fare structure and the apportionment of fare revenue, I would like to call on the PTC to review the fare structures for our senior citizens and students of tertiary institutions in view of the gloomy economic situation ahead.&nbsp; I make this call against the backdrop of the call for our senior citizens to work beyond 62 and to lead active lifestyles.&nbsp; In addition, with many young adults aspiring to have a tertiary education and the latest statistics show that 59% of our annual batch of students&nbsp;are pursuing tertiary education, we should look into how to help this group of students as they need to travel more frequently and are active.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarise, the Ministry, together with the PTC, should look closely at the route planning and distance-based fare structure to ensure that our commuters, especially the senior citizens and&nbsp;tertiary students, with their limited income, can enjoy the maximum value for the fare that they pay travelling on public transport.&nbsp; This is something that is long overdue as the present benefits extended are limited, in terms of time of travel and the number of trips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of the Through Card for all public transport mode is very much overdue as well.&nbsp; With MOT taking over the role of central route planning and the <p align=left>Column: 3051</p>PTC tasked to initiate the fare structure, it is timely to introduce the Through Card for all public transport modes.&nbsp; This would enhance the maximum value, offer convenience for our frequent travellers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With limited land and physical capacity, to ensure that we continue to have an efficient public transport system is to employ technology in route planning and fare structure.&nbsp; With advancement in computer technology, I am sure we can tap on the ability of computer programming to chart an efficient distance-based network for commuters.&nbsp; If motorists can use GPS to plan their routes, I am sure the public transport operators too should do better to ride on technology to deliver their services with greater efficiency to their customers.&nbsp; We should also look at how other countries apply technology to the best advantage.&nbsp; And I urge PTC to look into setting up a Research and Development function so that we can build up our own technology as we move towards the future.&nbsp; The employment of technology should not only be in the functions of PTC but also in the communication with commuters in real time.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.&nbsp; I understand that one department in the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) is developing a software by taking into account the existing public transport route information to direct a commuter from one place to another.&nbsp; They are able to recommend the lowest cost route or the fastest route based on cost and times as parameters which include the buses and&nbsp;rail.&nbsp; Such R&amp;D would benefit the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the impetus of tapping on technological advancement is critical, we must always adopt an open system and not allow any system to be the monopoly.&nbsp; These criteria should be a system that allows and promotes integration and wider usage.&nbsp; Use the ez-link card as&nbsp;an example.&nbsp; I look forward to the day when <p align=left>Column: 3052</p>we can do away with the current system of having to pay&nbsp;$1 deposit for the ez-link card and to get a refund when you return the card.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, PTC comprises a panel of members who are mostly professionals.&nbsp; This is good because, by their training and understanding of how to manage issues and find solutions, they are well-equipped to handle their responsibilities.&nbsp; However, I would like to suggest that&nbsp;the Minister&nbsp;consider enlarging the Council or set up more and specific ad hoc committees, comprising more of the ordinary man-in-the-street, the working class or the \"broad masses\", if I may borrow the phrase.&nbsp; For example, if the central bus route planning and fare structure&nbsp;are for the area, say, Aljunied GRC, then more residents of Aljunied GRC could be called upon to assist and contribute.&nbsp; This ad hoc committee will serve as a reference to give feedback on the day-to-day goings-on at the bus stops, the train stations and the taxi stands.&nbsp; They will also be able to share with the PTC on the impact of fares on their expenses and how they have been coping.&nbsp; With all due respect to the members of the PTC, many of whom may be car owners, the frequency and the time they spend on public transport will not be sufficient to give them an appreciation of the headaches, the heartaches and the frustrations confronting the commuters who day in and day out have to muscle and jostle with everyone, not just once a week, but every day, five days a week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the members of this committee can serve as \"ambassadors\" for PTC, giving it more transparency and support for the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criteria for members to qualify for appointment to this ad hoc committee should be based on their income level and non-car ownership.&nbsp; Also, members of this ad hoc committee will serve for only one term so that we can give as many people <p align=left>Column: 3053</p>as possible an opportunity to serve on the committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know PTC members do get feedback but, in getting public feedback, often it is those who are vocal that will speak out and we may not get the true picture of others who have a different viewpoint to share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the timeliness of service of our buses&nbsp;is still far from ideal.&nbsp; Presently, PTC only measures the timeliness of the buses at the starting time of the service.&nbsp; However, with the extension of dedicated bus routes, PTC should look into the promptness of this service at the midpoint of each bus service journey.&nbsp; This would ensure that the waiting time for our buses&nbsp;could be reduced and hence&nbsp;overcrowding during peak periods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, I am confident that, with PTC's guiding hand, the quality of our public transportation system might one day parallel or even surpass that of its counterparts in Tokyo, Japan.&nbsp; We are already on track to build our own comprehensive transport system, what with our current 109 km of MRT lines, more than 3,000 buses and the upcoming Circle and Downturn Lines that are still in development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no doubt that the PTC will build on these achievements and continue to advance the standard of our public transportation system beyond our most optimistic expectations for the benefit of all our citizens.&nbsp;

I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier this year, LTA released its Master Plan where the Government stated <p align=left>Column: 3054</p>that one of its objectives is to make public transport the choice mode,&nbsp;and this will in turn lead to making Singapore a liveable city.&nbsp; Sir, I support the LTA Masterplan as well as the plans to make public transport a choice mode in view of the fact that there are increasing demands on our roads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Minister has stated, our transport system is based on a hub-and-spoke model.&nbsp; This means that there are less direct services for the commuters.&nbsp; Instead, the commuter has to usually take a bus from his original starting point to the hub where he then changes to a train or to another bus to go to work or to another location.&nbsp; And as the hon. Member for Tampines GRC, Mr Ong Kian Min, has said, sometimes, they have to change from&nbsp;bus to a train to another train and then to another bus, and this is only one way.&nbsp; It will be the same for the reverse way where they have to change to a bus, to a train, to a train and back to&nbsp;a bus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if you ask many residents, they would prefer to have a direct transport service from their home to their workplace as this would save them waiting time and also save them on transport costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I accept that the hub-and-spoke model is more efficient as it is very difficult to be able to have direct transport services from your home to the market, or to your office or to the Orchard Road shopping area.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the hub-and-spoke model inconveniences the commuters as they have to spend additional time waiting for their bus and then for their next train or for another bus.&nbsp; In addition, under the current fare system, even though a fare rebate is given, the commuter still has to bear the cost of the inconvenience as he has to pay more than one base fare, as he changes his bus or train to bring him to the next destination.&nbsp; Sir, this is unfair to the commuter as he spends more time on <p align=left>Column: 3055</p>commuting as well as waiting and then he has to pay more whenever he changes the mode of transport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, I support the PTC (Amendment) Bill as it seeks to allow the Public Transport Council to initiate and change the fares and fare structure and to allow the PTC not only to set the fares but also to re-allocate the revenue amongst the transport operators.&nbsp; The Government's aim of amending the fare structure such that the commuter is not penalised by having to pay more than one base fare is, to me, a step in the right direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there is some concern that after the Act is amended and a distance-based fare is implemented, the commuters would have&nbsp;to share the loss in revenue with the public transport operators (PTOs).&nbsp; It has been estimated that six in 10 commuters may end up having to pay more.&nbsp; Sir, I would urge the Public Transport Council to ensure that this loss of revenue is not passed on to the commuters but instead absorbed by the transport operators.&nbsp; The current public sentiment is that the public transport operators have made sufficient profit from their transport operations.&nbsp; As such, they should consider their public and moral obligation to their customers to maintain fares at an affordable rate and to provide value to their customers.&nbsp; Further, the Public Transport Council Act only requires the Council to consider the need for the public transport operators to remain financially viable and not to continue making a profit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are a few queries on the Bill which I wish to seek clarification from the Minister:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Under what circumstances would the Public Transport Council consider suspending approval for fares which had <p align=left>Column: 3056</p>been previously approved?&nbsp; In such a situation where the fares had been suspended, what would happen to the services which had been approved?&nbsp; Is it the intention of the Public Transport Council that the fares are suspended but the services continue to operate, ie, the commuter travels for free?&nbsp; Otherwise, if the fares are suspended and the transport services are correspondingly suspended, then the powers of suspension are really not effective at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) In respect of section 24(8), would it be more relevant for the Public Transport Council to consider an applicant's conviction for an offence \"under the Act\" rather than for any \"criminal offence\"?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) When the Public Transport Council carries out a review under section 24AA, would the Public Transport Council have to consider only the consideration stated in section 24AA(2) which is that \"the decision is in the interest of the public and would to any extent promote or facilitate the objectives referred to in subsection (1)(a) or (b) or both\", or would the PTC have to consider the first limb of section 24(2) which is to consider the financial viability of the applicant who is the public transport operator?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is there any provision for any public transport operator to make an appeal against the decision of the Public Transport Council if they are not satisfied with the decision made under section 24AA(2) even after they have been consulted?&nbsp; Would there be a corresponding amendment to section 22I of the Public Transport Council Act to allow an appeal to the Minister whose decision would then be final?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister's clarification would assist the Public Transport Council greatly in making their decision as the Council is an independent body, with council members who are not part of the <p align=left>Column: 3057</p>Government and who are mostly volunteers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I wish to urge the Government to make more efforts to explain why is there a need to ensure that public transport operators remain financially viable.&nbsp; Many people simply do not understand the rationale for the Government to have a law to protect the profitability of listed commercial companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.46 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I note that this Bill is about empowering the PTC and indeed it is a very good idea to protect our public transport users against unjustifiable fare increases.&nbsp; However, I am concerned about the avenues through which the transport operators could seek redress should they feel that their proposals for fare increases have not been considered thoroughly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed clause 4 empowers the PTC to enforce compliance with certain conditions.&nbsp; My concern is that there seems to be no avenue for the public transport operators to appeal if they should feel that approval for fare changes was withheld unfairly or revoked unfairly.&nbsp; Currently, an appeal to the Minister is available under section 22(1), but only for certain decisions made by the PTC as listed in section 22(1).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify if the decision to limit appeals to the Minister is deliberate?&nbsp; If so, what can public transport operators do if they are dissatisfied with a decision handed down by the PTC?&nbsp; It should not be that operators have to take the PTC to court over such decisions because the cost of <p align=left>Column: 3058</p>doing so could result in unnecessary expenditures for both the PTC and the operators.&nbsp; Alternatively, if costs are passed on, law suits could result in increased cost for commuters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above scenarios would not benefit commuters in the long term.&nbsp; Also, the proposed section 24(7) seems slanted in favour of the PTC because the PTC is empowered to decide if sufficient cost is shown by the operator threatened with a sanction when in the first place the PTC was the body intending to issue the sanction.&nbsp; While it seems to me that this section was aimed at giving the operators a chance to explain their apparently errant behaviour before the PTC imposes a sanction and to do so efficiently, I wonder if there could be a slightly fairer way of doing so, for instance, by asking a third-party to decide if sufficient cause is shown.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 of the Bill empowers the PTC to initiate reviews and fair changes to the fare structures.&nbsp; It is good that the PTC can take the lead in ensuring fares are fair for all parties.&nbsp; However, it sounds rather draconian to allow the PTC to impose new conditions, especially those suggested in the Explanatory Statement that public transport operators may be required to enter into agreements with each other on terms specified by the PTC regarding the re-allocation of revenue on public transport operators before fare changes are approved.&nbsp; This is especially so in light of the proposed section 24AB where the PTC only has to consult and give notice to affected public transport operators before they impose decisions made under the new power to initiate fare reviews.&nbsp;While I have every belief that the PTC will arrive at its decision fairly, there is no requirement that the PTC has to accept the views of the&nbsp;public transport operators.&nbsp; Therefore, if the&nbsp;public transport operators feel aggrieved by the decision, what recourse will they have?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3059</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Amendment Bill is timely, especially in light of public sentiments that fares have only been going up and never down, despite temporary declines&nbsp;in oil prices.&nbsp; Perhaps, more transparency in the review process and public disclosures of review reports would help the public better understand how fares are decided upon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.50 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for their comments and strong support for the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just take the House through some of the key issues that Members have raised in the course of this debate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo brought up an important point.&nbsp; He said that, right now, four in 10 commuters benefit because they make transfers daily.&nbsp; But he argued that the potential benefit should be wider.&nbsp; And he is right, it is much wider.&nbsp; The four in 10 ratio understates the benefits to the commuters because it is looking at whether or not the commuter takes the transfer daily.&nbsp; But the commuter might not take it every day.&nbsp; He might take it two or three times a week.&nbsp; So Mr Foo is right and it is an important point to stress that the benefits of this distance-based through fare that we are putting through today&nbsp;are much wider than four in 10 commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in terms of potential benefit, it is even wider.&nbsp; Travel patterns change.&nbsp; If we take&nbsp;a commuter today who does not make any transfer at all, he might change his place of work and his home, and that might involve transfer journeys in the future.&nbsp; Even if he does not change his place of work or his home, he now has the option of choosing what is the&nbsp;optimal <p align=left>Column: 3060</p>service combination to get to his destination.&nbsp; As Members have said, this might be&nbsp;a shorter waiting time and a faster&nbsp;journey, without having to pay a transfer penalty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other item that has been brought up is this issue that as we move towards distance-based through fares, how do we allocate the adjustment costs?&nbsp; As a matter of principle, both the public transport operators (PTOs) and the commuters benefit and therefore they should each bear some of the adjustment costs.&nbsp; The commuters benefit because they now have a fairer fare structure and greater choices.&nbsp; The PTOs benefit, as Mr Ong Kian Min correctly pointed out, as they should see&nbsp;higher ridership in the long term.&nbsp; Both benefit, so as a matter of principle, both should bear some of the costs.&nbsp; What the PTC will be doing is to look into the details of this and see how these adjustment costs should be borne between the public transport operators and the commuters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worth emphasising what PTC Chairman,&nbsp;Mr Gerald Ee, said&nbsp;that for this year's fare revision&nbsp;and fare restructuring exercises which are both taking place at the same time, even though the maximum fare&nbsp;cap this year is 3%, his Council will endeavour to ensure that&nbsp;the net fare adjustment will be below 1%.&nbsp; This is actually lower than last year's fare cap, which was 1.8%.&nbsp; He further said that he would also, when looking at the details of this fare revision and fare restructuring, ensure that the majority of commuters benefit, that they will pay less than 3%.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will turn on the transfer rebate the Council will give, how this will be allocated between the PTOs and the commuters, what sort of fare increase and how is that spread across the fare stages.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that he understands the current difficult economic conditions and that his Council will endeavour to make sure that the majority of commuters benefit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3061</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo also pointed out that under the current system, what is happening is that commuters who are taking direct trips are effectively being cross-subsidised by those taking transfer journeys, and he is right.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Ong Kian Min alluded to it in his speech when he said that&nbsp;we are actually trying to correct an existing inequity in the system.&nbsp; He said quite rightly that it is the majority of&nbsp;people who will&nbsp;benefit and that those who benefit should actually speak up.&nbsp; I&nbsp;fully support him in this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another issue that was brought up by Members is&nbsp;enhancing the existing hub-and-spoke system.&nbsp; To put matters in perspective, we have a good public transport system.&nbsp; We conduct surveys every year.&nbsp; In the last two years, 2006 and 2007, eight in 10 commuters who took public transport&nbsp;said that, overall, they were satisfied with it.&nbsp; Yes, certainly, there are areas for improvement.&nbsp; Members have mentioned, for example,&nbsp;waiting time and travel time.&nbsp; All these can be improved, and both the LTA and the PTC are looking into these&nbsp;pain points in our system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Foo asked what else are we doing to enhance the hub-and-spoke system.&nbsp; As Members would know, we are doubling the rail network within&nbsp;a span of 12 years.&nbsp; We will spend close to&nbsp;$40 billion.&nbsp; Every other year, there will either be a new rail extension or stage of rail line opening.&nbsp; For example, next year, we are going to have the Circle Line opening up in the north-east sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also having more integrated public transport facilities.&nbsp; We have also introduced integrated public transport travel information, a point which Mdm Cynthia Phua brought up, that is we are using technology to provide travel information to commuters.&nbsp; We will see what more we can do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3062</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, we are looking into central bus planning, which a few Members mentioned.&nbsp; LTA will be the central public transport planner.&nbsp; They are already doing that now for the rail system.&nbsp; They will take on board from 2009 onwards the bus side, so that they can look at the system as a whole, how best to optimise the network from the commuters' viewpoint.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong made two points.&nbsp; First, he asked whether under the amendments to the Act we are changing the current position, which is that a public transport operator can charge a lower fare.&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; It is up to the public transport operators.&nbsp; They can offer discounts, whatever package they want, and to offer a lower fare than that which is approved by the PTC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the principal circumstances in which they are not allowed to do that?&nbsp; It is in the premium bus sector.&nbsp; In the premium bus sector, there is a price floor.&nbsp; This is to ensure that the premium bus operators do not cannibalise the basic bus services because they run only during the peak hours.&nbsp; So, if we allow them to price-compete with the basic bus operators, the basic bus operators would be under stress.&nbsp; The basic bus operators, when they run a service, they have to run it for at least 18 hours a day, whereas in the case of the premium bus operator, they only run it during the peak periods.&nbsp; For the premium bus services, they are not allowed to price-compete, they compete on quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew also brought up, in terms of representation to the PTC, that there should be commuter input.&nbsp; This is actually part and parcel of the PTC as embodied in the composition of its members. Community leaders are members of the PTC.&nbsp; It takes in people from all walks of life.&nbsp; We wanted to ensure that it is representative.&nbsp; So I would like to assure <p align=left>Column: 3063</p>Mr Siew that that has actually been taken into account and is part and parcel of PTC as an institution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the matter of community engagement which Mdm Cynthia Phua brought up, as&nbsp;Members know, right now, we have set up a division called the Land Transport Community Partnership Division precisely for the reasons that the Member has said, ie, it is important that our land transport planners and decision makers have a feel of the issues on the ground.&nbsp; So, every constituency now has a Land Transport Authority officer sitting in their Citizens' Consultative Committee taking in the feedback.&nbsp; If there is more that can be done, whether small groups should be formed like Mdm Cynthia Phua suggested, this is something that we can study.&nbsp; But the principle is there, that we want to engage and hear what the difficulties are on the ground and see how best some of these difficulties can be resolved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also some clarifications which Members&nbsp;&ndash; Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mdm Ho Geok Choo &ndash; sought on amendments to certain specific clauses.&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about the suspension of the approved fares.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whole idea, when we amended the Act, was to give the PTC a range of sanctions that they can use. So it can be a censure, it can be a fine, it can be a suspension which is really a temporary revocation for not longer than six months, or it can revoke the approved fares completely. And when it does that, like Mr Cedric Foo mentioned, it is a draconian measure.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when will we use this?&nbsp; It has to be very grave and repeated breaches, because if you revoke the approved fares, there are serious financial consequences on the public transport operators as they will still be running the service. It does not mean that when you revoke the fares, <p align=left>Column: 3064</p>they stop running the service, which is the point Mr Lim Biow Chuan brought up.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the idea was to give the PTC a range of sanctions and they can then calibrate how best to meet particular circumstances, including the $100,000 fine that Mr Cedric Foo brought up. It is a part of the range of measures. Next, Mr Lim Biow Chuan pointed out that section 24(8), which refers to any criminal offence, should really be for an offence under the Act. He is right because if you read section 24(8), it refers back to section 24(4) and that makes it clear that the offence in question is an offence under the Act.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim also brought up the point about section 24AA on the review of fares and whether or not financial viability would be one of the considerations when the PTC deliberates on this matter.&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; Section 24AA says that the PTC must take into account the interest of the public, and the interest of the public is wide enough to cover the financial viability of the public transport operators.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about the recourse if PTOs are unhappy with the PTC's decision. The PTC plays many roles. But in the case of the fare review, it is really taking on the position of an arbiter and so it is not really a case of the relation between the PTC and the public transport operators. The Council is trying to balance the interest of the public transport operators and the interest of the commuters.&nbsp; We deliberated and decided that we should have an independent body, comprising people from all walks of life, that looks into this matter and that was why the PTC was set up in 1987.&nbsp; They will be the final decision maker when it comes to matters relating to fares.&nbsp; That is the reason why the PTOs cannot appeal beyond the PTC to the Minister.<br></p><p align=left>Column: 3065</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of consultation, the process is therefore built into the system.&nbsp; Before the Council makes deliberations, whether it be on distance-based through fares or on the annual fare review, it invites submissions, it hears out the PTOs, and then makes a decision. So there is due process.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members mentioned about season passes. The LTA is working on it. It is also working on central bus planning, such as more direct routes. These are matters which PTC and LTA will look into, but what is important is that when it looks into this, one of the key things that they have to take note of is to ensure that whatever that has been developed, proposed and launched is commercially viable.&nbsp; I think Mr Ong Kian Min made that point. He said that the challenge is to ensure that when we do all these things to try to benefit the commuters, it is also important, at the same time, to ensure that, if you are launching a travel pass, or you are working out a particular bus route, at the end of the day, you do not compromise the financial viability of the system as a whole. In fact, this goes to Mr Lim Biow Chuan's last point where he said that some people are confused and they think we set up the PTC to protect the PTOs, which is not the case.&nbsp; As I have said, the PTC was set up to find a balance between the commuters' interest&nbsp;&ndash; to ensure that they have an affordable high quality public transport system&nbsp;&ndash; and the financial viability of the PTOs. The financial viability of the PTOs is important because if the PTOs are financially not viable, your public transport service will deteriorate over time and that is against the commuters' interest, and that is why the PTC has to do this balancing act.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have answered most of the key issues that were raised.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 3066</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to seek some clarification from the Minister.

Should it be more than 50-50? &nbsp;This is something that the PTC will have to deliberate and make a decision for this year's fare review.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered my two clarifications on the transfer rebate.&nbsp; I&nbsp;said that&nbsp;if a transfer rebate is too high, it will jeopardise the viability of the PTOs and that will affect the welfare of the&nbsp;public transport workers.

It provides consumers with legal safeguards against unfair practices, and enables them to have recourse to civil remedies before the Courts. The Act also allows specified bodies to enter voluntary compliance agreements with, or apply for injunction orders against errant traders. Suppliers are required to provide a cooling-off period for direct sales and timeshare contracts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3070</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the implementation of CPFTA in March 2004, the number of cases arising from the Act has been increasing steadily.&nbsp; In 2007, consumers lodged nearly 750 CPFTA-related complaints with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE). CASE also entered into&nbsp;eight Voluntary Compliance Agreements (VCAs) and obtained&nbsp;three injunctions against businesses. This shows that the CPFTA has been effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 2006, MTI&nbsp;and CASE jointly established a taskforce to review the CPFTA to take into account the new trends and patterns of consumer disputes. The taskforce's recommendations, which were accepted by my Ministry, became the basis for wider public consultations with consumer and industry bodies from October last year. We thank the many who contributed generously their suggestions to the improvement of the Amendment Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key amendments</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill before us is the outcome of the work mentioned above. Let me now outline the main amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Inclusion of financial products and services</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 8 of the Bill extends the application of the CPFTA to financial products and financial services which are currently excluded. With the removal of the exclusion, the CPFTA would be applied to the financial products and services regulated under certain legislation administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and under the Commodity Trading Act with the commencement of this Bill. This will be followed by the financial products and services that are regulated under the Moneylenders Act and the Pawnbrokers Act in 2009 and 2010 respectively, when the Ministry of Law completes its review of these legislation.</p><p align=left>Column: 3071</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By extending the CPFTA to financial products and services, two consequential amendments have become necessary:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, clause 4 requires the Court to consider whether a consumer had sought to resolve a dispute through a specified dispute resolution scheme where available. My Ministry intends to designate the existing Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Limited, or FIDReC in short,&nbsp;as the relevant scheme for disputes relating to financial products and services supplied by FIDReC subscribers. In this way, consumers will be encouraged to resolve their disputes with financial institutions via FIDReC first before going to Courts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clause 7 clarifies how the prescribed claim limit should apply when a consumer commences multiple actions involving the same unfair practice. My Ministry intends to provide that in such cases involving financial institutions, the claim amount for each of the actions should be aggregated for the purpose of applying the prescribed claim limit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now move on to the other main amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Regulation of timeshare products</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;timeshare-related disputes have been an increasing source of complaints. These involve businesses that claim to help customers or consumers re-sell or dispose of their rights under timeshare contracts, a business model that has emerged in recent years. To address this, clause 2 inserts a definition of timeshare-related contract.&nbsp; My Ministry intends to extend the cooling-off period that currently covers timeshare contracts to these businesses as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3072</p><p><I>Prescribed claim limit</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reflect the increasing claim values of consumer transactions, clause 3 increases the prescribed claim limit from $20,000 to $30,000. With this increase, we believe 99% of CPFTA-related complaints CASE received would be covered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Jurisdiction of Small Claims Tribunal</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Small Claims Tribunals have been an integral part of the dispute resolution mechanism under the consumer protection framework. The Tribunals are designed to handle small and straightforward consumer disputes, and are therefore able to provide consumers with&nbsp;&nbsp;speedy and inexpensive resolutions. We are glad that the Tribunals are able to expand their jurisdiction to cover new areas of consumer disputes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 of this will extend jurisdiction to cases related to, firstly, the cancellation of timeshare and timeshare-related contracts during the cooling-off period and, secondly, a deposit paid in motor vehicle sale contract.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 further extends jurisdiction to claims relating to a dispute arising from a contract to buy or sell foreign currency notes made with a licensed money-changer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Limitation periods</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specified bodies currently have to commence an action against errant traders within a year of the last material event on which it is based. Experience has shown that this is insufficient time for specified bodies to build their cases and explore&nbsp;alternatives to litigation such as Voluntary Compliance Agreements with traders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 therefore extends the limitation period from one to two years for the specified bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3073</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 also extends the limitation period for consumers from one to two years. In addition, clause 3 allows the Court to stay the proceedings for&nbsp;consumer's action when there is another action by a specified body relating to the same unfair practice. These amendments allow consumers to better rely on the efforts of specified bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Burden of proof</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, traders are often in a better position than consumers to keep proper records of their actions. Clause 6 gives the Minister the power to make regulations to place on suppliers the burden of proving that they have complied with certain requirements of the CPFTA or its regulations. My Ministry intends to apply this in two specific cases. First, timeshare industry and direct selling suppliers must prove that they have given the consumers information notice to inform consumers of their rights in relation to the cooling-off period. Second, motor vehicle dealers must prove that they have informed consumers in writing of their deposit refund policies, and applied for a loan in terms agreed by the consumer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Regulations</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To operationalise the proposed amendments, my Ministry is finalising the supporting regulations as well as implementing other recommendations made by the review taskforce. We will issue them shortly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, the principle of \"caveat emptor\" remains fundamental in our overall approach to the regulation of consumer transactions.&nbsp; To that end, the amendments to the Act aim to inform both businesses and consumers of the desired standards of fair dealing across a broader spectrum of products and services.&nbsp; In the long term, an increase in consumer sophistication remains the first-line and best defence of their interests. <p align=left>Column: 3074</p>Continual consumer education is therefore critical in ensuring that consumers are informed to make smart choices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments in this Bill also reflect a concerted effort by all the stakeholders to make the existing consumer protection framework even more robust. In drafting this Bill, we have taken great care to ensure that it is both pro-consumer and business-friendly. We believe that a sustainable consumer protection framework is also a win-win framework embraced by both consumers and businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.24pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to comment on clause 2 of this Bill which extends the protection for consumers under this Act to include certain financial products and services.&nbsp; This is timely because of the high pressure and sometimes misleading sales tactics used in the financial services and beauty industries.&nbsp; While we must remember the principle of&nbsp; \"caveat emptor\", at the same time we must try to protect the most vulnerable to unfair sales tactics.&nbsp; Currently, the financial services sector is to a certain extent regulated by the Financial Advisers' Act but there are still financial services which do not fall under the stringent regulation of the Financial Advisers' Act, such as moneylenders.&nbsp; For instance, consumers aggrieved by a particular moneylender would have no civil remedy against the moneylender.&nbsp; The changes to the CPFTA will strengthen the remedies that consumers have against errant merchants and send out a strong deterrent message to would-be crooks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3075</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of this Bill increases the cap on the amount that can be claimed via an action brought under this Act from $20,000 to $30,000.&nbsp; I see this as a welcome change.&nbsp; While this Act was initially introduced for the benefit of small-time consumers, there is no reason that we should not protect big-time consumers as well.&nbsp; If allowing a claim through the Small Claims Tribunal under this Act would save much of the Courts' time, why not extend this to larger spenders?&nbsp; Also, with inflation and increased consumers spending, it is good that the cap be raised so that the remedies under this Act can be made used of by more consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 6 is an interesting clause because it places the onus of proving compliance with the statutory regulations on the supplier where there is a dispute.&nbsp; If I understand it correctly, the current position is that in a lawsuit, the party alleging the fact has to prove it.&nbsp; With the implementation of this clause, the consumer can allege unfair practices on the part of the merchant without having to prove it while the merchant will have to scramble to prove that he has in fact complied with the CPFTA.&nbsp; This seems to place an onerous burden on the supplier and may not be the best balance between protecting consumers' rights and not impeding businesses or business practices through over-regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppliers may feel threatened by this clause and thus take more precautions in their business dealings which may lead to increased cost of compliance.&nbsp; Such cost could either reduce the competitiveness of a business or end up in higher cost for the consumers if the costs of compliance are passed on.&nbsp; But, Sir, there is one bright spot in this clause, which is that the Minister retains the discretion to specify the regulations to which this reversal of the burden of proof will apply.&nbsp; Ideally, it <p align=left>Column: 3076</p>should only apply to those where the customers will find it difficult to prove lack of compliance while it is easier for the suppliers to prove compliance in order to ensure that this clause is fair to both sides of a consumer transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of the foregoing, Sir, I support this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Act helped consumers to seek redress when vendors had engaged in unfair practices.&nbsp; For instance, last year, under this Act, CASE had managed to help consumers to recover&nbsp;S$4 million&nbsp;in kind and in cash.&nbsp; We strongly welcome the amendments to the CPFTA to widen its scope and appreciate that several suggestions from CASE have been taken into consideration in the current amendments to the CPFTA.&nbsp; These include increasing the prescribed claim limit from $20,000 to $30,000.&nbsp; We strongly believe that the Consumer Protection (Fair&nbsp;Trading) (Amendment) Bill will further benefit and provide better protection to consumers.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the President of CASE, I am happy to note that the cooling-off period would&nbsp;also be&nbsp;extended to the&nbsp;resale timeshare industry.&nbsp; In year 2007 alone, 300 consumers had filed&nbsp;their disputes against resale timeshare operators with CASE.&nbsp; The extension of the&nbsp;cooling-off period to the resale timeshare industry would no doubt offer consumers some level of protection. However, it would also be&nbsp;better if MTI could consider the proposal that the suppliers or&nbsp;vendors are not&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to collect huge sums of deposit during the cooling-off period, as such restriction would pre-empt the need to recover the money from the vendors subsequently.&nbsp; CASE is also disappointed that the cooling-off period is not extended to include contracts</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Let me give Members a real life case.&nbsp; Earlier this year, a 56-year old lady just collected her CPF money and she went to a local bank to deposit the $30,000 into a fixed deposit account.&nbsp; Before he could proceed with the transaction, she was approached by a financial consultant who advised her to invest the money into a new financial plan which would yield a higher interest and return.&nbsp; However, this financial consultant did not highlight to her the financial risks involved.&nbsp; A few months later, she went to the bank to inquire about her bank balance and discovered that there was only $25,000 left in the account.&nbsp; She was very worried because she wanted to save the money for her son's university education.&nbsp; Therefore, I believe that the amendment to the Act to include the sale of financial products and services is a step in the right direction.&nbsp; It is appropriate and timely.&nbsp; After the amendment, the Act would protect people like this 56-year old lady.&nbsp; Meanwhile, CASE has acted upon this matter and negotiated with the bank on her behalf, but we have yet to receive a response from the bank.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(<I>In English)</I>:&nbsp; We hope MTI could consider another new feedback we receive from consumers on unfair practices in the telecommunication sector which are the auto-renewal clauses in the contracts.&nbsp; This is prevalent in the telco contracts such as Internet access, subscription plans for handphones and television services.&nbsp; I am of the view that auto-renewal clauses are unfair to consumers.&nbsp; Consumers should be given the option to source for new providers <p align=left>Column: 3078</p>upon the expiry of their contracts.&nbsp; Providers could and should remind their customers about a month before the expiry date of the contracts and encourage them to renew their contracts with them, instead of making it automatic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CASE also noted instances where suppliers deter consumers from seeking third party assistance by stating in the contract that once a third party intervenes, the contract will become null and void.&nbsp; Consumers are also told that the contract is private and confidential and should not be disclosed to third party, including CASE.&nbsp; We find such practices unfair.&nbsp; Consumers should not be prevented from seeking third party assistance for any contract dispute.&nbsp; Consumers are usually in a less knowledgeable position than the suppliers and, hence, are greatly disadvantaged and vulnerable, and need more help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope MTI would consider including such third party exclusion clause in the contract as unfair practices under the Second Schedule of the CPFTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CASE hopes to see more self-regulation and prepare to work with all the business associations closely to achieve this.&nbsp; I would like to know whether the Ministry has any plan to make the implementation of this legislation more effective.&nbsp; What role would the relevant Government agencies like MAS, SPRING Singapore and the Singapore Tourism Board play?&nbsp; And would MTI coordinate&nbsp;better efforts by these agencies?&nbsp; What support would they provide to the retail <p align=left>Column: 3079</p>and service sectors to educate the traders and facilitate the effective implementation of this CPFTA?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Early this year, during the Budget debate, I had asked MTI for an update on the progress regarding the revision to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.&nbsp; As most people would know, the CPFTA is one of the principal legislation which promotes a fairer and more equitable marketplace and affords better protection for consumers in Singapore.&nbsp; It has been more than four years since the Act came into force.&nbsp; Over these four years, due to changing trade practices, certain aspects of the Act would need to be updated or fine-tuned to ensure that the legislation remains relevant.&nbsp; I am indeed grateful that the Government has tabled this Bill to amend the CPFTA in response to repeated requests from consumers all over Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe the amendment to the Act to include the sale of financial products and services is a step in the right direction.&nbsp; Over the past years, complaints regarding the sale of financial products remain high.&nbsp; Most of these complaints relate to the aggressive pushing of financial products to elderly or illiterate consumers who may not appreciate fully the nature of such products and the nature of the risks involved.&nbsp; Even educated persons may not appreciate the complicating financial products that are being sold.&nbsp; For example, I have seen some of the capital guaranteed product does not necessarily mean that your capital is guaranteed.&nbsp; It will be subject to <p align=left>Column: 3080</p>various deductions for costs and expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many of the consumers are only told of how much better returns can be attained with the investment in the financial products and the potential risks of losing your investment is glossed over.&nbsp; In such circumstances, the financiers should have recourse under the Consumer Protection (Fair trading) Act as the sale was made to them under undue pressure or undue influence.&nbsp; I also applaud the Government's move to extend the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal to hear and determine claims made under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.&nbsp; For many, consumers, who have disputes with businesses,&nbsp;face financial limitations when trying to engage lawyers if their disputes with the businesses cannot be resolved amicably.&nbsp; Once their claim exceeds $20,000, they not only have to incur hefty legal costs to seek legal redress, they also have to worry that the businesses which have legal pockets would bully them by endless litigation.&nbsp; The increase in the prescribed limit from $20,000 to $30,000 would certainly allow more consumers to be able to seek redress through the Small Claims Tribunal without having to incur expensive legal costs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the extension of the limitation period to commence the claim from the current&nbsp;one year to two years&nbsp;is also welcome, and this would allow consumers more time to seek advice or mediation with the businesses through the CASE&nbsp;mediation services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are just three areas in which I wish to seek clarifications from the Government.&nbsp; In the explanatory note to the Bill, it was stated that the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Limited, or FIDReC, would be prescribed as a specified dispute resolution scheme&nbsp;for disputes relating to certain financial products and services regulated by MAS.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3081</p>Could the Minister clarify whether MAS would be designated as a specified body under the Act to monitor the businesses which are in breach of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act and whether MAS has the power to seek voluntary compliance agreement or a mandatory injunction against recalcitrant financial companies who flout the Act?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also previously asked that the onus and cost of prosecution of errant traders under section 9 of the Act be transferred to the Attorney-General's Chambers once CASE has made a successful application to the injunction proposal review panel.&nbsp; This is because CASE is a non-Government body and has limited funds to carry out such prosecution to obtain a mandatory injunction.&nbsp; Each time, CASE takes action to apply for such a mandatory injunction under the Act, the legal cost involved is very, very high.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider the request?&nbsp; I also understand from the consultation exercise held in September last year that the Ministry intended to introduce a Consumer Protection (Fair Training) Opt Out Practices Regulations.&nbsp; This is an area in which CASE has been advocating for a while.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister when would the regulations be implemented?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, in view of the fact that trade practices evolve rapidly in an open economy like Singapore, may I urge the Government to implement regular reviews of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to ensure that the law remains relevant and useful.&nbsp; For example, there used to be many complaints against the undue pressure used by some companies for the sale of timeshare holidays.&nbsp; In recent times, the tactics have changed.&nbsp; Now the companies are making false promises and undue pressure to persuade the consumers that in exchange for payment of a hefty fee, the company can assist to resell timeshare holidays which the consumers had bought previously.&nbsp; So <p align=left>Column: 3082</p>the consumers, having paid once to buy timeshare holidays, now pay a second time to sell their timeshare holidays.&nbsp; Hence, the need for the laws to be reviewed regularly to cater to changing unfair tactics against consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act took effect on 1st March 2004.&nbsp; Consumers and businesses have had over four years to become familiar with the Act with what is permissible under the Act and what is not.&nbsp; The Consumers' Association of Singapore, or CASE, as a specified body under the Act, has played a key role in giving teeth to the Act.&nbsp; This update of the Act is therefore timely.&nbsp; While any enhancement to consumer protection is praiseworthy and to be welcomed,&nbsp;the Amendment Bill is nevertheless not perfect.&nbsp; I will touch on four areas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the Amendment Bill expands the jurisdiction of the Act to include financial products and services, motor vehicle sale contracts and timeshare-related contracts.&nbsp; The maximum quantum for claims under the Act will also be increased from $20,000 to $30,000.&nbsp; Sir, the inclusion of motor vehicle sale contract is timely and much needed.&nbsp; However, the amendments do not adequately address the issue of lemon cars which are new cars with many defects and problems.&nbsp; This is essentially the sale of a fundamentally defective product to a consumer.&nbsp; While the purchase of a car from a car dealer will appear to be covered by the amended Act, the amended prescribed limit of $30,000 is inadequate.&nbsp; It seems arbitrary to me that the purchaser of a very cheap car can get proper redress if it is a lemon <p align=left>Column: 3083</p>but not the majority of car buyers.&nbsp; Here, I think it is important to note that $30,000 would be a&nbsp;very low price for a car, even for second-hand cars.&nbsp; It is not clear if lemon car cases are common.&nbsp; But this discrimination does not seem right in principle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial products and services are also being brought under the Act.&nbsp; My first point is that even the amended prescribed&nbsp;limit for claims of $30,000 may be too low for claims in respect of such products and services.&nbsp; By way of comparison, the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre, or FIDReC, hears cases with amounts of up to $100,000 for disputes between insured persons and insurers and $50,000 for other disputes, including disputes between banks and consumers.&nbsp; In fact, from the FIDReC Annual Report for 2006-2007, it seems that financial institutions have voluntarily submitted to FIDReC jurisdiction for disputes over amounts exceeding $100,000,&nbsp;such that the biggest claim adjudicated by FIDReC in its 2006-2007 financial year was actually $729,000.&nbsp; But I am more concerned that, despite what is contained in the Amendment Bill, most financial products and services may end up being excluded from the ambit of the Act.&nbsp; According to the public consultation exercise conducted by the Ministry last year, the Ministry's intent was to exclude from the Act by way of regulations all financial products and services regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.&nbsp; What this means is that even if, today, this House passes the Amendment Bill to include financial products and services under the Act, tomorrow, the Minister may issue regulations that exclude the bulk of such products and services from the Act.&nbsp; I hope that that will not be the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in last year's public consultation exercise, the Ministry stated, and I quote, <p align=left>Column: 3084</p>\"MAS already monitors the financial services industry closely in its capacity as the regulator.&nbsp; Furthermore, MAS has regulatory and enforcement powers against financial institutions and representatives if they breach MAS' administered laws.\"&nbsp; While I am sure that the MAS considers the interest of consumers when acting as the regulator, it nevertheless has other priorities as well.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Act contains important features that are absent from the MAS' regime.&nbsp; Consumers have a private right of action against suppliers.&nbsp; There is the voluntary compliance agreement which can include provisions requiring the supplier in question to compensate consumers who have suffered loss or damage resulting from the unfair practice.&nbsp; CASE is also empowered to apply to the court for a declaration or injunction against offending merchants and the decisions of the court are subject to appeal and public scrutiny.&nbsp; These are all essential enforcement mechanisms implemented by the Act but absent from the MAS' regulatory regime.&nbsp; Crucially, many of these features relate to the compensation to consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are here today to debate the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me repeat:&nbsp; consumer protection.&nbsp; On the other hand, MAS administers a regime to regulate banks and financial institutions.&nbsp; It may be fine for regulating the financial industry, but does it protect consumers?&nbsp; It certainly does not provide for compensation to consumers.&nbsp; Regulation of merchants' behaviour is fundamentally different from compensation to consumers.&nbsp; The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act encompasses both aspects.&nbsp; But the MAS-administered regime provides only for the former and not the latter.&nbsp; After all, if the MAS-administered regime was sufficient to protect the consumers, then why amend the First Schedule to the Act to bring financial products and services under the Act in the first place?&nbsp; It would be highly disappointing if any financial products or <p align=left>Column: 3085</p>services are excluded from the Act simply because they are regulated by the MAS.&nbsp; That would render completely pointless the inclusion of financial products and services into the Act.&nbsp; Many believe that Singapore is overly pro-business and too lacking in consumer protection.&nbsp; Such a move would simply prove such views to be true.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I hope that the Minister of State will inform this House whether MAS-regulated financial products and services will subsequently be excluded from the Act by way of regulations and, if so, explain why and how such a move will nevertheless benefit and protect consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my second point relates to clause 3 of the Amendment Bill.&nbsp; It amends the Act so that where a consumer has commenced legal proceedings against a merchant and subsequently CASE or a specified body applies for a declaration of injunction against that merchant, either the consumer or the merchant may apply to the court for a stay of the proceedings, pending the resolution of the application.&nbsp; It seems to me that the supplier is far more likely than the consumer to exercise this right.&nbsp; There are a number of problems with such a mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, it seems to me inherently unfair that a consumer's course of action against a merchant who has engaged in unfair practices can be held hostage to a separate application by a specified body.&nbsp; As the saying goes, \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\"&nbsp; I understand that, in most cases, the consumer would already have approached CASE before commencing legal proceedings against the merchant and,&nbsp;obviously, he was not willing to rely on CASE.&nbsp; What happens if the merchant dissipates his assets, pending the resolution of CASE's application?&nbsp; The consumer would then have been deprived of his recourse against the merchant through no fault of his own.&nbsp; If the worry <p align=left>Column: 3086</p>is of conflicting outcomes between the consumer's case and the application to the court for an injunction or declaration, then an alternative approach could be to declare that the decision in the consumer's case will not affect and have no precedential value in the other case.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another approach that is fairer than what is in the Amendment Bill will be to allow only the consumer and not the merchant to apply to the court for a stay of the legal proceedings so the consumer can choose for himself whether or not he would like to wait for the outcome of&nbsp;CASE's application.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 6(9) of the Act is also unfair to consumers.&nbsp; This provision permits the court, acting on its own motion, to discontinue proceedings that have been stayed, if there are no further steps in the proceedings for two years.&nbsp; This is regardless of the status of the application by a specified body for a declaration of injunction.&nbsp; In other words, the stayed proceedings can be discontinued even if the other application drags for more than two years and remains unresolved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, justice should not be held hostage to the court's desire to clear their docket of outstanding cases, especially where the legal proceedings were stayed through no fault of and against the wishes of a consumer.&nbsp; While the Amendment Bill does specify that the discontinuance is without prejudice to the consumer's right to reinstate the action, it seems to me unfair that the consumer, and even the supplier, should have to bear the cost and inconvenience of effecting a reinstatement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related note, in light of the power of the court to discontinue proceedings if no steps are taken for two years, the Act should require either the court or the supplier to notify the consumer of the outcome of the <p align=left>Column: 3087</p>application.&nbsp; The consumer may not be able to monitor the other application and so may not be aware of its outcome and the possible additional steps that he can or should take.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my third point concerns the Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp; The amendments will effectively expand the jurisdiction and caseload of the Tribunal.&nbsp; I trust that the Ministry and the Subordinate Courts will ensure that the Tribunal is appropriately staffed and equipped to handle this expansion.&nbsp; I would also like to propose that decisions of the Small Claims Tribunal, at least those in proceedings commenced under this Act, be published.&nbsp; Decisions of the Tribunal are currently not published, so consumers have little guidance as to the relevant factors that the Tribunal will consider when coming to a decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have received some troubling anecdotal feedback about the Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the Tribunal's decisions are inconsistent.&nbsp; The Tribunal also seems to construe \"services\" very narrowly, as having to require skill and labour.&nbsp; Accordingly, it seems that the Tribunal has ruled that cases, eg, car rental disputes, fall outside its jurisdiction which, in my view, runs contrary to the clear intent of the Act and a purposeful construction of the term \"services\".&nbsp; I have also been told that some businesses have had so many complaints against them that their representatives before the Tribunal have become extremely experienced, thereby facing lay consumers who may well be appearing in a court setting for the very first time at a severe disadvantage when they appear before the Tribunal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe in the usefulness of the Small Claims Tribunal where lawyers are <p align=left>Column: 3088</p>not allowed and&nbsp;so I support in principle the central role&nbsp;of the Small Claims Tribunal in the Act.&nbsp; However, it seems to me necessary for the Tribunal to publish its decisions or, at the very least, summaries or digests of cases.&nbsp; This will address the criticisms I have mentioned, introduce some important transparency into the process, and provide valuable clarity and guidance to consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Act has been effective in preventing what may well be called \"serial offending\".&nbsp; It is possible for an unscrupulous businessman to set up a business, such as a time-share company, that engages in unfair practices prohibited under the Act.&nbsp; When complaints are lodged against the company and it faces legal proceedings, whether from consumers or CASE, they can simply shut this company down and start a new one and continue preying on consumers.&nbsp; The Act and the amendments do not address this, and I am told that this does happen in practice.&nbsp; Perhaps, in addition to the amendments currently before this House, the Ministry should also amend the Act to apply its mechanisms to the person behind these companies.&nbsp; For instance, section 9 of the Act could be amended such that if CASE applies for an injunction, then the court is explicitly empowered to extend the injunction to apply against the company's directors and shareholders as well, if it is satisfied that such persons have previously been involved in other companies that have engaged in similar unfair practices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, the Ministry has done well to update the Act to keep it relevant, in light of changing circumstances.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there remains much room for improvement and I hope that the Minister can address the issues I have raised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Yi Shyan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 3089</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.52 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lee Yi Shyan:</B> Sir, I want to thank the various Members for speaking passionately and giving good thoughtful suggestions as to how the Act can be further enhanced.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me first establish the philosophy of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act that we have here in this country.&nbsp; Unlike the Office of Fair Trading or the Fair Trading Acts in other countries, our Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act does not intend to criminalise unfair practices.&nbsp; This is because the more serious offences related to business dealings are already covered by existing legislation.&nbsp; So, aggrieved consumers have actually choices to go to the court and seek civil redress in that manner.&nbsp; The consumer protection framework in Singapore is established to help small and vulnerable consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To put things in perspective, when the Small Claims Tribunal was established in the 1970s, the claim limit was only $2,000.&nbsp; Obviously, from today's discussions here, we know that the amount has been raised successively over the years, and now we are proposing to raise it to $30,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, whether&nbsp;$30,000 is an adequate figure or not to cover a whole host of&nbsp;unfair practices, we have to look at it from the point of view of the small consumers with limited ability to seek redress.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have to consider, as Mr Siew Kum Hong rightly pointed out, the capacity of the dispute resolution mechanism.&nbsp; In this case, we have the Small Claims Tribunals as well as FIDReC, the newly designated dispute resolution scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look at their capacity and ability to remain focused on small consumers who require help because, if we overload them with too many cases by raising the claim limits ahead of these groups' dispute claim value, we would <p align=left>Column: 3090</p>inadvertently be doing a disservice to them rather than helping them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short,&nbsp;the consumer protection framework is one that is evolving with time, responding to the pattern and trends of the new types of consumer dispute cases.&nbsp; This is also a fruit, an outcome of the joint work between the Government, the consumer associations, the specified bodies, businesses and the public in general.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now address some of the Members' specific questions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho has raised the question&nbsp;whether the amount of $30,000 could be raised further.&nbsp; I have answered that.&nbsp; Mdm Ho also raised the interesting point about whether we are making it too onerous for suppliers of services.&nbsp; Unlike the other three Members, her concern is that we are creating too much demand in terms of documentation and compliance which will translate into business costs and, in the end, will pass down to consumers, if we are not careful.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Mdm Ho that in crafting the provisions, we have seriously taken into consideration the balance between protecting consumers at large and targeting the errant suppliers or traders who, we believe, are a&nbsp;small minority.&nbsp; So, any provisions that we propose should not have a negative impact on the large number of suppliers who are honest and professional.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang singled out the beauty industry as an example where there have been many complaints.&nbsp; I am sympathetic to the number of consumers who were taken in by&nbsp;persuasive beauticians or consultants who promised them youth and many different kinds of services.&nbsp; But this is a case&nbsp;where the existing CPFTA has provisions, for instance, in the Second Schedule, for consumers to seek redress if there has been a misrepresentation given to the <p align=left>Column: 3091</p>consumers, such as&nbsp;a \"yes\" when it is \"no\", or a \"no\" when it is \"yes\".&nbsp; So, our framework does provide avenues for consumers to seek redress.&nbsp; We do not think at this point that&nbsp;extending the three-day cooling period is necessary to this industry.&nbsp; In fact, the right approach to solving this type of complaints is to strengthen education and promote best practices among the players in the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also mentioned about the auto-renewal feature, especially in the telecommunications industry.&nbsp; As Members can imagine, thousands of consumers would have their contracts expiring every day, because we have six million mobile users and many other fixed-line subscribers, etc.&nbsp; So, if&nbsp;every&nbsp;single contract&nbsp;has to be renewed without this automatic feature, then we can imagine many consumers suffering from lines dropping and being discontinued.&nbsp; So we are not very sure, in this case, whether we will be&nbsp;doing a service or disservice to&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;by removing this auto-renewal feature.&nbsp; However, we can work with the regulatory agency&nbsp;&ndash; in this case, IDA&nbsp;&ndash; to also promote best practices</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I want to thank Mr Lim for his support for the proposed amendments in this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he asked for three clarifications.&nbsp; The first one is on FIDRec.&nbsp; He asked whether MAS can be designated as its specified body.&nbsp; MAS today regulates a number of financial-related&nbsp;products and services.&nbsp; MAS has supervisory as well as regulatory authorities over the institutions they licensed.&nbsp; Therefore, if they find that financial institutions are in breach of any rules or laws under them, MAS actually is&nbsp;more powerful than a specified body, in a sense, that they can suspend or&nbsp;stop the <p align=left>Column: 3092</p>operation of the particular financial institution.&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong also mentioned the seeming contradiction between excluding the financial products and services in the first instance and now including them.&nbsp; The financial products and services were included when the CPFTA was first introduced for good reason.&nbsp; At that time, some of the Acts were very new and they were also to be introduced and in the decision, there were other dispute resolution mechanisms in the financial industry.&nbsp; So it was decided then that it was better for the various mechanisms to function as they&nbsp;were designed to serve consumers and businesses.&nbsp; But having had the experience of the last few years, I think we are ready to incorporate the financial products and services&nbsp;regulated by the MAS and later on to&nbsp;also bring in the other two financial-related products and services under the Ministry of Law.&nbsp; So MAS, therefore, in our view, has already got the power to supervise and regulate the financial institutions under&nbsp;its supervision.&nbsp; So, it is not necessary to specify them as a specified body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim also asked about the opt-out regulations&nbsp;&ndash; whether the Ministry intends to issue the opting-out feature.&nbsp; We have observed that the suppliers sometimes send goods and services to consumers without their prior consent and subsequently demand payment from them and as a result, some consumers may mistakenly make payment for such goods and services.&nbsp; And sometimes goods and services may also be provided on a free trial basis with or without the consent of the consumers.&nbsp; So this places a burden on consumers to opt-out from the arrangement.&nbsp; Providing unsolicited goods and services and giving consumers free trials may be an effective marketing tool to raise awareness and allow consumers to try out new products and services.&nbsp; However, this practice should not be used as a means to take unfair advantage of consumers.&nbsp; This is why we intend to <p align=left>Column: 3093</p>introduce regulations to allow consumers to treat all unsolicited goods and services as unconditional gifts from suppliers, unless the consumer has acknowledged in writing his willingness to accept and pay for such goods and services.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I want to also touch on Mr Siew's questions on lemon law.&nbsp; This subject of lemon law has been raised before in the previous parliamentary discussions.&nbsp; In our subsequent revision, we would work with CASE to see if introduction of this law would indeed serve the intended benefits of the consumers in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the&nbsp;other suggestion by Mr Siew&nbsp;on improving the effectiveness of the Small Claims Tribunals, we welcome the suggestion and would convey these suggestions to the&nbsp;Ministry of Law because the Small Claims Tribunals belong to the Subordinate Courts system.&nbsp; He also asked whether CPFTA is indeed effective against the serial offenders because some of these may close and re-open businesses.&nbsp; For this kind of situation, indeed, we are working with CASE to see how we can have a better oversight of companies or directors behind the companies who are engaged in these unfair practices with other agencies that have supervision over them.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Bill also amends the Patents Act to align it with the Competition Act.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3095</p><p><I>Amendments related to the TRIPS Protocol</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement covers compulsory licensing or the use of patents by third parties without the authorisation of the right holders. Under it, WTO member countries can issue compulsory licences for the domestic production of patented pharmaceutical products predominantly to supply their own domestic market to address public health emergencies. When this happens, the volume available for export will be affected.&nbsp; WTO member countries with insufficient or no domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity cannot make effective use of Article 31 and the amount they can import from those member countries with&nbsp;manufacturing capacity will be limited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, in August 2003, the WTO General Council decided to 'waive' the export limitation in Article 31 to allow member countries to manufacture patented pharmaceutical products under compulsory licence for export to countries in need under certain conditions. The Protocol is to formally incorporate this 'waiver' into the TRIPS Agreement.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system put in place by the TRIPS Protocol can increase Singapore's access to medicines in situations of national emergency. For us to import medicines under the system, we need to amend our Patents Act to give effect to our obligations under the TRIPS Protocol.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 56 of the Patents Act currently allows the Government or any party it authorises to use a patented invention without infringing the patent under limited circumstances, such as for or during a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 56 to add <p align=left>Column: 3096</p>that this includes the import of patented pharmaceutical products, if the relevant notification has been given to the TRIPS Council.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, further, we need to put in place safeguards to ensure that the rights to import patented pharmaceutical products manufactured under compulsory licence are not abused for commercial profit, and that patent holders are remunerated accordingly for the use of their patents. Thus, clause 5 of the Bill amends section 60 to prohibit the re-export of patented pharmaceutical products imported into Singapore under the TRIPS system. Clause 7 amends section 66 to prohibit patented pharmaceutical products produced under compulsory licence for another country from being diverted into Singapore through parallel import.&nbsp; And,&nbsp;finally, Sir,&nbsp;clause 6 of the Bill amends section 62 to clarify that patent holders will not be remunerated if they have already received or will receive remuneration for the use of their patents in the exporting country, as provided for under the TRIPS Protocol.</p><p><br><I>Amendments to align the Patents Act with the Competition Act</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill also seeks to align the Patents Act with the Competition Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Patents Act, which was enacted in 1995, currently bans certain types of agreements involving patented inventions believed in the past to be inherently anti-competitive. Specifically, section 51 bans agreements that require or tie the licensee to procure something else in addition to the patented product from the patent holder, thus allowing a patent holder to unfairly extend his monopoly rights to an unrelated product. Section 52 bans agreements that require a patent licensee to continue to pay patent royalties after expiry of the patent, thereby effectively extending the life of the patent.</p><p align=left>Column: 3097</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in reality, these agreements may not always be anti-competitive. For example, 'tying' arrangements may not be anti-competitive if there are alternative products on the market that serve the same purpose as the patented product. Also, agreements that require a patent licensee to pay royalties after the expiry of the patent may not amount to an abuse of monopoly rights by the patent owner since licensees may, for commercial reasons, prefer to distribute the royalties payable over a longer time period.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, with the enactment of the Competition Act in 2005, such agreements are more appropriately dealt with under competition law. As there could be agreements that have been entered into on the basis of the law as set out in sections 51 and 52, clause 3 of the Bill inserts a new section 50A in the Patents Act to restrict the application of sections 51 and 52 to those agreements made before the commencement of the new section 50A. Agreements made after that will thus come entirely under the purview of the Competition Act. So this will give businesses greater flexibility in structuring new commercial agreements and put Singapore on par with jurisdictions such as the UK and US, where such agreements are regulated by competition law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to sum up, this Bill would bring our patents regime into alignment with our obligations under <p align=left>Column: 3098</p>the TRIPS Protocol and enable Singapore to import patented pharmaceutical products made under compulsory licence, to cope with public health emergencies. Also, this Bill will align our patents regime with our competition regime. Consultations by IPOS indicate that the proposed changes are welcomed and supported by stakeholders in Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT--><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT:::3098--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For graduate Senior Police Officers (SOs), recruitment and retention has remained stable and strong despite the tighter labour market.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Junior Police Officers (JOs), however, recruitment and retention has been adversely affected by the tighter labour market. &nbsp;Since 2004, Singapore Police Force (SPF)&nbsp;has had more Police Officers (POs) leaving the service; from 221 in 2004 to 332 in 2007, a 50% increase. &nbsp;As for recruitment, the numbers dropped initially in 2005 (from 419 in 2004 to 350 in 2005), but has since improved (350 in 2006 to 407 in 2007).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the stronger recruitment numbers, SPF is still unable to meet its recruitment needs to address the higher demands placed on the Force.&nbsp; Apart from the threat from terrorism, the growth of Singapore as a Meeting, Incentive, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) has resulted in more high-profile meetings and large-scale events, such as the F1 and the Youth Olympics, being hosted here.&nbsp; To ensure the safety and security of such events, SPF has had to develop new capabilities with a resultant increase in manpower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this demand in a tight labour market, SPF will have to adapt quickly to increase recruitment and retention.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on the recruitment momentum generated over the past three years, the SPF launched its new recruitment campaign with the slogan \"Realise your talent in the real world\" in January 2008.&nbsp; This was accompanied by a series of road shows in shopping malls to more effectively reach prospective applicants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPF has also increased its recruiting presence in schools to highlight the Police Force as an attractive career choice. &nbsp;Besides the traditional career fairs at JCs, Polytechnics, ITEs and secondary schools, a recent innovative initiative was the introduction of a Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) Competition for students which leverages on the popular TV drama \"CSI\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As remuneration is a key consideration for job applicants, we had reviewed the remuneration package for our Police Officers as part of our overall review of the Home Affairs Uniformed Service (HUS) Schemes last year to ensure that we stay competitive.&nbsp; To address the issue of retention, we will be paying a retention bonus this year to our junior officers with the specific aim of retaining these young officers in the first eight years of service.&nbsp; With these changes, we hope to attract and retain our younger officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3101</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond remuneration, the SPF has improved its career development framework in recognition of the fact that many POs leave service because of higher career aspirations. &nbsp;With more officers taking up degree courses to upgrade themselves, there are stronger aspirations today to become a Senior Officer. To meet these aspirations, the SPF has, since 2007, enhanced its career development framework to allow more appointments and promotions into the SOs ranks for deserving POs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, despite challenging labour market conditions, SPF and MHA will continue to pursue an aggressive recruitment and retention strategy so as to remain competitive and attractive as a choice employer.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:POWER CONSERVATION--><!--END_COL_TITLE:POWER CONSERVATION:::3104--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></B><p align=left>Column: 3101<p><B><P>POWER CONSERVATION</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:\"No-jackets\" rule for formal Government functions--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(\"No-jackets\" rule for formal Government functions)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Seah Kian Peng </B>asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in light of the extensive use of air-conditioning in Singapore, whether his Ministry will consider promoting a \"no jackets\" rule for formal Government functions to save electricity.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We share Mr Seah's concerns about energy wastage.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at the same time, we do not want to be overly prescriptive and impose rules on all formal Government functions.&nbsp; Instead, we will leave it to the respective organisers to exercise due discretion, and dress-down when it is appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a nation we must address the larger question of how we can save electricity effectively. We must examine the root causes of high energy consumption and adopt cost-effective solutions to reduce excessive energy losses.&nbsp; There are three main causes of such losses relating to air-conditioning:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, energy wastage may be due to an inadequate building envelope.&nbsp; An adequate envelope will minimise heat gain into the building interior and prevent cold air from escaping.&nbsp; This correspondingly reduces the energy consumption from air-conditioning.&nbsp; Since 1979, a minimum standard for thermal performance of the envelope of non-residential air-conditioned buildings has been put in place by BCA, and revised in 2004.&nbsp; Earlier this year, a minimum standard for residential buildings was put in place as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, buildings may be over-cooled.&nbsp; Generally, this refers to setting the temperature for the central air-conditioning system of the building below the recommended comfort zone of 22.5 to 25.5 degrees Celsius.&nbsp; As a heuristic, lowering the indoor room temperature by 1 degree Celsius through air-conditioning can increase the electricity consumption of air-conditioning by about 3%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce over-cooling, buildings must be equipped with the proper control, monitoring and air-handling systems required for the uniform cooling of the building. Otherwise, parts of the building may be over-cooled, while other parts may be too warm.&nbsp; Thus, it is important that developers, building owners and designers put in place adequate systems when the buildings are constructed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3103</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, besides reducing the air-conditioning load to a minimum with an appropriate envelope, and reducing over-cooling by implementing adequate systems, we have to look into how the air-conditioning can be provided in the most efficient way, namely, by implementing an efficient chiller system.&nbsp; The chiller system, which comprises the chiller plant, pumps and cooling towers, may be poorly designed or implemented, resulting in low efficiency.&nbsp; The efficiency of chiller systems can be measured using an indicator called the coefficient of performance (COP).&nbsp; The COP of the chiller system for an average building in Singapore is estimated to be about 3.0.&nbsp; If best practices and commercially available technology are deployed, a COP of more than 4.7 can be achieved, with potential energy savings of 35% to 50%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our private sector reduce their energy wastage from air-conditioning, the NEA is working with other relevant agencies, such as BCA, on a package of incentives and measures, aimed at building up the capability of our developers, engineers, architects and building managers in the area of building energy management.&nbsp; This will help improve the way air-conditioning systems are designed and operated in buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector is also taking the lead on energy efficiency.&nbsp; All large air-conditioned Government office buildings, as well as polytechnics and ITEs, will conduct energy audits to improve their energy efficiency by March 2010.&nbsp; As of end July 2008, 17 such Government buildings have completed their audits, with eight having already implemented the recommendations to achieve S$2.6 million in annual savings.&nbsp; All large public buildings are also to ensure that the ambient indoor air temperature is maintained within the range of 22.5 to 25.5 degrees Celsius, and agencies should seek to maintain temperatures as high as comfort level allows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to ensure that the chiller systems in our large Government buildings perform efficiently, we will progressively require them to meet a minimum standard of 4.7 for COP.&nbsp; A few of our buildings are already able to meet this standard.&nbsp; For example, in 2007, the Environment Building increased the COP of its chiller system to 5.0, and realised actual savings of 464MWh of electricity, or S$78,000, in 2007.&nbsp; The MOM building is in the process of implementing the measures identified by their energy audit as well.&nbsp; They are expected to improve the COP of their chiller system from 3.2 to 5.2, with estimated annual savings of over 1,300MWh of electricity, or cost savings of S$339,000.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is why as part of the enhanced M&amp;P package, from 1st January 2009, parents with Singapore Citizen children under the age of seven years will be entitled to six days of paid childcare leave each per year, an increase from the current two days.&nbsp; A new unpaid infant care leave of six days per year per parent will also be introduced for those with Singapore Citizen children under the age of two years.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no need to introduce paternity leave as working fathers will benefit from these two leave entitlements.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In 2007, the fatality rate for the sector was 6.9 fatalities per 100,000 workers, a decrease from 9.8 fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2006. &nbsp;Following the recent spate of accidents in shipyards, MOM has stepped up inspections on all 89 shipyards in Singapore.&nbsp; The inspections revealed that there were several areas where safety standards had fallen short.&nbsp; 47 shipyards were fined a total of $113,000. &nbsp;In addition, two shipyards were ordered to suspend operations for serious lapses.&nbsp; Follow-up inspections were also carried out to ensure corrective measures have been implemented by all the shipyards.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry-led Workplace Safety and Health Council and the Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI) have also rallied the industry to implement an unprecedented safety \"time-out\" from work, to review the safety processes in shipyards.&nbsp; The Council has also stepped up its outreach.&nbsp; It organised an industry forum to share how shipyards can build better safety systems and a strong Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) culture.&nbsp; The Council has also developed a WSH Manual for the industry's reference.&nbsp; The Council is currently working with the NTUC and the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Employees' Union on a joint outreach programme to educate supervisors and reach out to every worker on the ground.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also expressed concerns about whether language proficiency could have affected the safety performance in shipyards.&nbsp; I wish to assure the House that all new foreign workers entering this industry must attend the Shipyard Safety Instruction Course and pass the Worker Safety and Well-being test before they can commence work. &nbsp;These are conducted in their native languages to ensure they fully comprehend the safety rules.&nbsp; Existing workers are also required to be re-certified every two years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the workplaces, employers have also developed ways to effectively communicate with the foreign workers.&nbsp; These include daily toolbox briefings for workgroup leaders conducted by supervisors before the start of work to explain the work processes for the day and relevant safety procedures.&nbsp; The workgroup leaders then explain and demonstrate the safety instructions to the workers, and translate them into their native languages if necessary. &nbsp;Many companies also have safety checklists or in-house educational videos in different languages.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM will continue to monitor closely the safety performance at shipyards.&nbsp; I urge all employers to tighten their safety systems and step up their communications with workers in the area of safety processes and procedures.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This includes repeat reports made by a household unit and reports made by several household units of the same incident.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As every case is different, Police does not calculate the average time taken to solve loanshark-related cases.&nbsp; The time taken varies depending on the circumstances and <p align=left>Column: 3115</p>complexity of the case.&nbsp; There are cases, though not often, where Police officers arrest the offender when the crime is being committed.&nbsp; In other cases, there are few leads and more time is required.&nbsp; The lack of cooperation of borrowers and the involvement of syndicates, sometimes with directing elements based abroad, adds to the complexity of investigations.&nbsp; Such cases will take much longer to solve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, by their nature, loanshark harassment cases are not easy to solve.&nbsp; Unless the perpetrators are caught in the act, there are often few leads that Police can follow-up on.&nbsp; This is especially so in situations involving innocent victims of harassment who have no idea who the loansharks are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Police assures me that it will press on resolutely to counter this scourge that poses a threat to Singaporeans' sense of safety and security.&nbsp; We continue to monitor the situation closely.&nbsp; Indeed, since 2005, we upped the ante by introducing several tough measures, encouraged community vigilance and enhanced security features in residential areas. &nbsp;Whilst these measures have ensured that the situation does not get worse, the number of harassment cases is still high and should be reduced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some loanshark runners even harass, vandalise and intimidate home-owners who are unconnected to the borrower or purported borrower, other than being a neighbour.&nbsp; The situation is exacerbated by borrowers being recruited to join loanshark syndicates as runners to discharge their debts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loansharks are constantly evolving their <I>modus operandi</I> to evade Police detection.&nbsp; Transaction risks and costs to the syndicates have been reduced over the years, as the technology for communication and money transfers has proliferated.&nbsp; Syndicates can relocate their operations overseas to evade detection and arrests but continue to supervise local operations through the Internet and Internet telephony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me assure Mrs Josephine Teo that we will continue to put pressure on loanshark syndicates through painstaking investigation and by working with the community to enhance security vigilance on the ground. &nbsp;As I had indicated in the Committee of Supply debate earlier this year, we are also studying additional measures which we will not hesitate to implement, if necessary, to counter this scourge.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Before any <p align=left>Column: 3117</p>physical work is started, LTA's engineers would carry out an extensive investigation into the nature and composition of the soil, search building records for details of the safety condition of nearby buildings, and inspect ground conditions and buildings in the area.&nbsp; During construction, LTA installs and monitors a range of instruments to detect any early signs of soil movement or possible damage to nearby structures.&nbsp; If necessary, they will carry out soil conditioning work to strengthen the ground.&nbsp; A Tunnel Task Force Committee, comprising senior LTA officials, tunnel specialists from the construction industry and geotechnical engineering consultants, oversee and review all of LTA's tunnelling operations to ensure safety.&nbsp; In addition, LTA regularly consults an International Board of Advisors (IBA), made up of world-renowned engineers and academics, to review the technical aspects of the tunnelling with particular emphasis on safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward and as a precautionary measure, LTA has undertaken a comprehensive safety review and tightened its tunnelling specifications, which are technical requirements imposed on all tunnelling works.&nbsp; For example, the revised specifications require soil investigation holes along the tunnel route to be drilled more frequently, every 25 metres compared to the earlier requirement of 50-75 metres.&nbsp; It has also added more early warning devices to detect any abnormal movement of soil.&nbsp; In addition, LTA has added technical refinements to the tunnel boring machines, to improve ground stability during tunnelling.&nbsp; These improvement measures, which are part of LTA's continuous efforts to improve safety practices, reduce the risk of encountering unexpected soil conditions and road subsidence from tunnelling.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Provide consultation to teachers, parents and community partners on ways to assist pupils through their difficulties;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Develop and deliver prevention-oriented programmes to build social and emotional competencies in identified groups of pupils, for example, FTSCs could conduct small group instruction for pupils who lack academic motivation or require help in stress management;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Develop counselling support structures to ensure the smooth delivery of counselling and guidance programmes.&nbsp; These include systems to identify pupils with social and emotional problems requiring counselling intervention and training of staff on specific issues confronting pupils.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools are given the autonomy to assign specific duties and responsibilities to their FTSCs based on schools' needs. &nbsp;For example, schools with fewer pupils who need counselling may request their FTSCs to spend more time developing and conducting prevention-oriented programmes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duties of patrolling the area outside of the school perimeter, however, are usually undertaken by the school's Discipline Committee in conjunction with the police rather than by the FTSC.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
