Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nMinLaw has an ongoing review of various legislation.  The\r\n\r\nrelevant  provisions of the Land Acquisition Act referred\r\n\r\nto  by  the  Member will be included in that review.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  Dr  Amy  Khor  and Mdm Cynthia  Phua,  during  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Supply  debate  this  year,  made  similar\r\n\r\nrequests for review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current approach in the Act is to peg\r\n\r\ncompensation  to the market value of the property  as  at\r\n\r\nthe  date  of  gazette notification or a statutory  date,\r\n\r\nwhich at present is 1st January 1995, whichever is lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the approach in this provision has not been\r\n\r\namended, Government, in fact, has regularly reviewed  the\r\n\r\nstatutory date to ensure that compensations are generally\r\n\r\nin  line  with  market levels.  Previous statutory  dates\r\n\r\nwere  30th  November  1973, 1st  January  1986,  and  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  1992.  We have not changed the current statutory\r\n\r\ndate  of  1st  January 1995 because, given the  depressed\r\n\r\nstate  of  the property market, current values are  below\r\n\r\n1995  values.   This  means that,  today,  the  statutory\r\n\r\ncompensations  paid  to affected owners  are  already  at\r\n\r\ncurrent  market  value.  When circumstances  require  it,\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue to update the statutory date  of\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government introduced an ex gratia\r\n\r\npayment  scheme in 1982 to cushion any financial hardship\r\n\r\nfaced by owners of acquired properties.  This scheme  was\r\n\r\ninitially introduced to top up statutory compensation  to\r\n\r\nmarket value, should the statutory compensation be  lower\r\n\r\nthan  market  value.   Since 1982, we  have  considerably\r\n\r\nexpanded  the scope and quantum given under  the  scheme.\r\n\r\nFor  example, whilst the scheme originally was  available\r\n\r\nonly  to  owner-occupied residential  properties,  today,\r\n\r\nowners  of  other  types  of properties,  whether  owner-occupied  or  not, are eligible to be considered  for  ex\r\n\r\ngratia compensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst, as I have said, we are prepared to review\r\n\r\nthe  relevant provisions, let me say that I do not  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the suggestion inherent in Mr Chiam's question that\r\n\r\nwe  can completely jettison the Land Acquisition Act  and\r\n\r\nits  provisions because Singapore is better off now  than\r\n\r\nbefore.   Whether  or  not  Singapore  is  a  first-world\r\n\r\ndeveloped country today, one feature about Singapore will\r\n\r\nnever  change,  namely, that we are a small  country  and\r\n\r\nland is, and will always be, a scarce commodity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Acquisition Act has made possible some of\r\n\r\nthe  important  developments in Singapore, including  our\r\n\r\npublic    housing    programmes   and   other    physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, such as our ports, expressways  and  mass\r\n\r\nrapid transport system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For future developments in land scarce Singapore, it\r\n\r\nis  obvious  that  we  will continue  to  need  the  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition Act.  Of course, we will need to address  and\r\n\r\nreview  the  question  of how we must  strike  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  interests of the individual landowners  and\r\n\r\nthe wider interests of the public good, which is to press\r\n\r\non  with development projects for public purposes without\r\n\r\nunduly increasing the taxpayer's burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister to explain the rationale for the  $1\r\n\r\ncompensation for the land acquired from Faith Assembly of\r\n\r\nGod Church at Kim Keat Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Dr Amy Khor refers to\r\n\r\nthe  recent  case,  publicised in the  media,  about  the\r\n\r\nacquisition of part of the land of the Church at Kim Keat\r\n\r\nRoad.  Let me explain this case in greater detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Valuer's Office accepted the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  a private valuer  on  its  panel  and\r\n\r\nvalued  the  strip of land acquired, which is  about  200\r\n\r\nsquare  metres, at a nominal $1.  In making  this  award,\r\n\r\nthe Chief Valuer's Office applied existing law, including\r\n\r\nrelevant provisions of the Land Acquisition Act  and  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Act, which takes into account the zoning of  the\r\n\r\nacquired  land.  On that basis, the Collector's award  of\r\n\r\n$1  was  determined.  On a legal basis, Government stands\r\n\r\nby this award.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, after further reviewing the case,\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided to give an ex gratia  payment  to\r\n\r\nthe  owners.   Let  me  explain why.   Before  1998,  the\r\n\r\nportion  of  land,  which has now  been  acquired,  which\r\n\r\nformed a small part of a larger piece of Church land  was\r\n\r\naffected  by a road widening line.  The affected  portion\r\n\r\nwas  at  that  time not zoned as road.  If  the  affected\r\n\r\nportion  had  been  acquired before 1998,  the  statutory\r\n\r\ncompensation would have been computed taking into account\r\n\r\nthe  existing use prior to acquisition, ie, carpark  use.\r\n\r\nIn  that event, more than nominal compensation would have\r\n\r\nbeen  given.  In 1998, after amendments were made to  the\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition Act and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanning  Act, the portion which was previously  affected\r\n\r\nby  a  road line was zoned road in the Master Plan.  This\r\n\r\nwas a change in planning practice so that the Master Plan\r\n\r\nwould  better  reflect planning intention.  The  rezoning\r\n\r\nled  to a valuation of a nominal $1 as there is no market\r\n\r\nvalue  for  a strip of land zoned road.  But it  was  not\r\n\r\nGovernment's   intention  to  change   the   compensation\r\n\r\napproach  when  it designated road lines  as  road  zones\r\n\r\nunder the Master Plan.  In short, there was an unintended\r\n\r\neffect when it came to valuing the affected strip of land\r\n\r\nfor  compensation purposes upon acquisition.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\n$1 nominal compensation was an unintended consequence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law and I asked our officials to\r\n\r\nsee  how we can help the owners in this case.  On review,\r\n\r\nwe determined that this case is a special one relating to\r\n\r\na  specific  situation.  Given what I have said  earlier,\r\n\r\nGovernment  has now decided to make an ex gratia  payment\r\n\r\nto  put the owners in the position they would have  been,\r\n\r\nwith regard to compensation, as if the land affected  was\r\n\r\nacquired before 1998, ie, based on a road line instead of\r\n\r\na  road zone.  On this basis, a payment higher than $1 in\r\n\r\nstatutory compensation will be given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have informed the Church of this and we are\r\n\r\nworking on the final amount with the Chief Valuer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  that in the light of the review  of  the  Faith\r\n\r\nAssembly of God Church's case, how would this affect  the\r\n\r\ncompensation for the Chuan Park's case, which is  also  a\r\n\r\n$1 compensation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, we must not mix the\r\n\r\ntwo  cases.   Like  I  have  said,  the  legal  basis  is\r\n\r\nimportant for computing the compensation award.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe legal position which justifies the valuation of $1?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Chuan Park situation, it is entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent,   based  on  the  provisions   of   the   Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition  Act.   There  is a  provision  in  the  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition Act which takes into account any increase in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue going to the owner whose land has been acquired and\r\n\r\nwho  has  got remaining land.  In other words, for  Chuan\r\n\r\nPark, in fact, only 0.6% of the land was acquired out  of\r\n\r\nthe  entire piece of land  and the benefit to  the  owner\r\n\r\narising  from the proximity of the MRT station  has  been\r\n\r\nestimated at about $18 million.  So there is this set-off\r\n\r\nprovision in the Land Acquisition Act.  Hence,  based  on\r\n\r\nthis set-off position, a $1 nominal compensation will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  Chuan  Park owners.  Chuan  Park  owners  have\r\n\r\nappealed.  I think we should leave it to the Land Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard to decide on this case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the payment\r\n\r\nof  $1 for compulsory acquisition of land is almost  like\r\n\r\nan  outright confiscation.  This is certainly a violation\r\n\r\nof  human rights.  If it violates human rights,  does  is\r\n\r\nalso  not violate the terms of the agreement made between\r\n\r\nSingapore and America under the FTA?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam's premise is\r\n\r\nthat  the  award violates human rights, but I  have  said\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  based  on  the law.   Land  acquisition  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is something which has gone on for a long time,\r\n\r\nand  $1  cases, as I have explained before in this House,\r\n\r\nare  given.  But when $1 awards are given, they are based\r\n\r\non  valuation principles which can be defended.  So there\r\n\r\nare  established categories where $1 awards may be given.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  if  there is a strip of land,  part  of  a\r\n\r\nlarger  piece of land, set aside for public purpose  such\r\n\r\nas a road or drainage purposes for which gross plot ratio\r\n\r\nhas  been  transferred to the adjoining land so that  the\r\n\r\nland  ought  to  be  vested in the  Government,  when  we\r\n\r\nacquire, benefit already has accrued to the owner of  the\r\n\r\nland  in terms of higher and more gross floor area,  then\r\n\r\nwe give $1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance, for example, will be when we\r\n\r\nacquire   a  splay  corner  or  backlane,  incapable   of\r\n\r\nindependent   development,  it   is   $1.    Or   another\r\n\r\nestablished category is when the owner has sub-leased the\r\n\r\nland  to  a  sub-lessee for 999 years, so that  the  sub-lessee gets substantive and substantial compensation, the\r\n\r\nowner who only has a small reversionary interest gets $1.\r\n\r\nSo we must not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  fixated  by the $1 compensation and say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nunfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the Church's case has aroused some\r\n\r\ninterest.    The  Minister  and  I  do  look   at   these\r\n\r\ncompensation awards.  Because we feel that in this  case,\r\n\r\nsomething  is not quite right, that is why we  asked  our\r\n\r\nofficials  to  take  a look at it.  We  then  found  this\r\n\r\nunintended effect and we are now prepared to come forward\r\n\r\nand  give ex gratia payment. I think that is an important\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is true that under the\r\n\r\nLand  Acquisition Act, there are many cases in which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can pay a $1 compensation.  But the  point  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  payment  of $1 compensation,  even  if  it  is\r\n\r\ndefensible  under  our law, violates  human  rights.   My\r\n\r\nquestion  is: if it is a violation of human rights,  does\r\n\r\nthis also not violate the terms of the FTA?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> How could it be a\r\n\r\nviolation   of  human  rights  when  we  are  acting   in\r\n\r\naccordance with our laws?  Is the Member saying that  all\r\n\r\nour  laws are in violation of human rights?  In any case,\r\n\r\nan  important  point is that there is  the  Land  Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard.   We  have  an  Appeals Board which  is  currently\r\n\r\npresided  over by an ex-Judicial Commissioner and  he  is\r\n\r\nassisted by Assessors.  Anybody who is not happy with the\r\n\r\ncompensation   - many of the landowners whose  properties\r\n\r\nare acquired may not be happy  -  there is this recourse.\r\n\r\nThat  is  an  important point.  Certainly, the  Board  is\r\n\r\nproperly constituted.  The process for judicial review is\r\n\r\nthere  and the valuations are given according to accepted\r\n\r\nvaluation  principles.  I do not  see  any  violation  of\r\n\r\nhuman rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MAIN UPGRADING PROGRAMME AT PANDAN GARDENS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  if he will consider  granting  the\r\n\r\nMain  Upgrading  Programme   (Standard  Package)  to  the\r\n\r\nPandan Gardens precinct as the polling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresults show that a majority of 68.84% of eligible voters\r\n\r\nvoted \"yes\" even though it fell below the 75% mark.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nAct,   the   Main  Upgrading  Programme  (MUP)   can   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  in a precinct only if at least  75%  of  the\r\n\r\neligible households vote for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Pandan Gardens precinct, 68.84% of the\r\n\r\neligible voters voted for the MUP.  As this is less  than\r\n\r\nthe  required  75%, the precinct cannot  be  upgraded  as\r\n\r\nthere is no legal mandate for HDB to proceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUP is heavily subsidised. Having residents\r\n\r\npoll  and  co-pay for the programme ensure that upgrading\r\n\r\nis   only  carried  out  in  precincts  where  there   is\r\n\r\noverwhelming  support for it.  That is  why  the  minimum\r\n\r\nsupport  level  is  set  at 75%,  rather  than  a  simple\r\n\r\nmajority of 50%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUP was introduced in 1990 to upgrade older HDB\r\n\r\nestates  to  a  standard  that  is  comparable  to  newer\r\n\r\nestates.  HDB residents find upgrading attractive  as  it\r\n\r\nbrings  them  tangible  benefits.  Five  other  precincts\r\n\r\npolled  for  the MUP earlier this year have all  strongly\r\n\r\nsupported  it.   Three precincts achieved more  than  90%\r\n\r\n\"Yes\"   votes,  while  the  other  two  had  \"Yes\"  votes\r\n\r\nexceeding 80%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Pandan Gardens, some residents felt\r\n\r\nthat it would be prudent not to commit to expenditure  on\r\n\r\nupgrading  during  this  period of economic  uncertainty.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I  note  that more than  two-thirds  still\r\n\r\nvoted for the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to offer upgrading to older HDB\r\n\r\nestates  as  it  improves the living environment  of  our\r\n\r\nresidents.

The  NIE  study was  a  useful  one,  and  its\r\n\r\nfindings  should not surprise us.  The findings reinforce\r\n\r\nour   schools'  belief  in  the  importance   of   racial\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and racial mixing.  They  also  illustrate\r\n\r\nthat nation building is a long and continuing process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked what we have done to encourage\r\n\r\nracial  mixing and if we will consider further  measures.\r\n\r\nBoth  MOE and our schools take this very seriously.  Last\r\n\r\nyear  MOE  set  up  a  Committee on Strengthening  Racial\r\n\r\nHarmony  in  Schools, chaired by Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nfor  Education  Mr Hawazi Daipi, to provide  guidance  to\r\n\r\nschools,  keep  up the momentum, and help them  to  share\r\n\r\neffective and interesting practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through both the formal curriculum and a range of\r\n\r\ninformal  practices, pupils of different  races  interact\r\n\r\nwith  each  other,  work in teams, and learn  first  hand\r\n\r\nabout  each other's cultures.  Besides the staple  events\r\n\r\nwhich  every  child  takes part in, like  celebration  of\r\n\r\nethnic festivals, Racial Harmony Day, Heritage Tours, and\r\n\r\nso  on,  every school also organises and adopts  its  own\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  For example, several schools have  organised\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  team games, home visits and home  stays  in\r\n\r\nwhich  students  get a chance to live with  each  other's\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Others have introduced the learning of another\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  as a third language at the conversational\r\n\r\nlevel.  And there are many other examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-curricular activities (CCA) programmes, such as\r\n\r\nsports,  dance,  uniformed groups, provide  an  excellent\r\n\r\nplatform  for students to play together, train  together,\r\n\r\nand build friendships.  In many instances, they allow for\r\n\r\nstrong bonding experiences, especially when students have\r\n\r\nto  overcome challenging tasks together.  Not every sport\r\n\r\nor  dance attracts pupils from all races, and we may have\r\n\r\nto  do more to interest pupils in activities that they do\r\n\r\nnot  naturally gravitate towards.  Many schools, in fact,\r\n\r\ntake  special  effort  to  ensure  a  mix  of  pupils  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races in various CCAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor also asked if we encourage students to\r\n\r\nvolunteer   for  community  projects  with   multi-racial\r\n\r\nobjectives at Community Clubs and recognise these for CCA\r\n\r\npoints in our schools.  Our schools are doing so.  Pupils\r\n\r\ndoing  community  projects, organised  by  the  Community\r\n\r\nClubs or the CDCs, are recognised as performing community\r\n\r\nservice and are awarded CCA points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi asked if our teachers are equipped\r\n\r\nwith  the  skills to handle racial prejudices.   All  our\r\n\r\nteachers  are  trained in a repertoire of  classroom  and\r\n\r\npupil  management  skills which include  handling  racial\r\n\r\nprejudice, if it does occur.  There are a number of  pre-service  as  well as in-service training courses,  forums\r\n\r\nand workshops which raise the awareness of principals and\r\n\r\nteachers and sensitise them to racial issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi had also asked that we further\r\n\r\npromote the use of the English language within schools as\r\n\r\na  common  social  glue  for children.   I  should  first\r\n\r\nemphasise  that the use of the English language  and  the\r\n\r\nmother  tongues  has  to be seen in the  context  of  our\r\n\r\nbilingual   policy,   and  the  complex   home   language\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  we  have in  Singapore.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nprovide  adequate opportunity for students  to  use  both\r\n\r\nEnglish  and  their  mother tongues in  school,  and  not\r\n\r\npromote one to the exclusion of the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English is the predominant language of the\r\n\r\nclassroom.  In addition, schools\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse  CCAs  such  as oratorical contests and  debates  and\r\n\r\nvarious  other informal strategies to encourage  students\r\n\r\nto  use  the English language, especially those  students\r\n\r\nwho are not confident in the language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language pupils speak in school naturally does\r\n\r\nhave bearing on the ease of interaction between pupils of\r\n\r\ndifferent  races.  But there is no one-size  solution  to\r\n\r\nthis  issue.   We do not, for example, intend  to  impose\r\n\r\ncommon  guidelines on our schools on the  languages  that\r\n\r\npupils  should  be allowed to use outside the  classroom.\r\n\r\nWe  have a spectrum of schools in our system, with pupils\r\n\r\nshowing   quite   different   language   abilities    and\r\n\r\npreferences.   In  schools where pupils speak  mainly  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own mother tongue outside the classroom  and  have\r\n\r\nlittle  opportunity to use the English language at  home,\r\n\r\nteachers  look  for  creative ways to encourage  them  to\r\n\r\nspeak  English  in  school as much as possible.   But  in\r\n\r\nschools  where  pupils speak English most  of  the  time,\r\n\r\nsometimes  all  of  the time, there  are  perfectly  good\r\n\r\nreasons  why  teachers should encourage their  pupils  to\r\n\r\nspeak their mother tongues, at least part of the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the profile of their pupils, schools\r\n\r\nwill  have to find the right balance, a sensible balance,\r\n\r\nbetween speaking English and their mother tongues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made great progress over the last four\r\n\r\ndecades.  We have an integrated, national school  system,\r\n\r\nvastly   different   both  in  structure   and   everyday\r\n\r\nexperiences from the segregated, vernacular school system\r\n\r\nof  the  past.  Our schools have reinforced this  with  a\r\n\r\nrange  of programmes and informal practices, through  the\r\n\r\nyear,  aimed  at  increasing  racial  understanding   and\r\n\r\ninteraction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we do more in our schools? Yes, we can. Many\r\n\r\nsuggestions have been made by the public, the  media  and\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament, and we will look at them.  But MOE\r\n\r\ndoes  not intend to impose a common or fixed template  on\r\n\r\nschools  on  how  they should go about  promoting  racial\r\n\r\nharmony  or  racial  interaction.  We  have  to  let  the\r\n\r\nschools work out their own\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Our principals and teachers are the ones who\r\n\r\nare  in  the  best  position  to  devise  innovative  and\r\n\r\ninteresting  ways of encouraging this.  And many  schools\r\n\r\nare  also  getting their students themselves  engaged  in\r\n\r\nthinking  through ideas, coming up with  ideas,  and  how\r\n\r\nthey can spur this and get an ease of interaction between\r\n\r\nthe races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our schools are also mindful that we cannot\r\n\r\nforce  interaction  or contrive a  sense  of  comfort  or\r\n\r\nfriendship  between  students of  different  backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThere  has to be an element of self-motivation, a certain\r\n\r\nspontaneity,  even a sense of discovery, in any  activity\r\n\r\nthat  aims  to  promote  racial  interaction  and  racial\r\n\r\nunderstanding.   Our  children  have  to   make   friends\r\n\r\nnaturally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage our schools to redouble their\r\n\r\nefforts to promote inter-racial understanding and  mixing\r\n\r\namong  all their pupils.  But schools cannot work  alone.\r\n\r\nParents  and the community at large play equally critical\r\n\r\nroles.   I  cannot emphasise this enough.   This  is  why\r\n\r\nschools  have  actively reached out to  parents  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  take  on  the  shared  responsibility   of\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  cohesive  society.   I  hope  they   receive\r\n\r\nencouragement and support for their efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister: would he not agree that the levels of promotion\r\n\r\nof   inter-racial  mixing  in  school   can   vary   very\r\n\r\nsignificantly,  depending on how much effort  the  school\r\n\r\nputs  in  for such programmes?  This being the case,  and\r\n\r\njudging  from  the NIE study, although I may  agree  that\r\n\r\ninter-racial mixing takes a long time, would  it  not  be\r\n\r\nmore  effective if MOE plans a more coordinated  approach\r\n\r\nand  concerted effort in asking the schools to  implement\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  allow for more inter-racial  mixing,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, through activities, say, in a particular period\r\n\r\ndevoted  for such projects?  Would the Minister also  not\r\n\r\nagree  that students tend to mix amongst their classmates\r\n\r\nwithin  a  class and generally not with schoolmates  from\r\n\r\nother classes?  And this being the case, for instance  in\r\n\r\nthe case of streaming, would it not be better if you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan actually promote activities which allow mixing across\r\n\r\nthe races through school-wide activities?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> MOE does not have a\r\n\r\nhands-off  policy on this.  We are trying to spread  best\r\n\r\npractices.   When  we  see  an interesting  idea  in  one\r\n\r\nschool,  we  publicise it within the cluster of  schools.\r\n\r\nThere is a fair bit being done so that schools learn from\r\n\r\neach   other.   They  are  also  seeding  some   national\r\n\r\ninitiatives.  Some of the activities may be symbolic, but\r\n\r\ntaken together they go quite a long way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the basic point is that we have got to let\r\n\r\nthe  schools  themselves come up  with  innovative  ways.\r\n\r\nThere has to be that spark of ownership and innovation in\r\n\r\nthe schools, and it is happening.  If you look around our\r\n\r\nschools,   you  will  be  surprised  at  the  amount   of\r\n\r\ninnovation that is taking place, not just in general  but\r\n\r\non  ways  of encouraging racial interaction.  I can  give\r\n\r\nyou  many examples.   For instance, Dunman High,  teaming\r\n\r\nup   with   neighbourhood  primary  schools  on   reading\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  involving  them  in  celebration  of  ethnic\r\n\r\nfestivals;  Nanyang  Girls  High  teaming  up  also  with\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  schools which have a  high  proportion  of\r\n\r\nminority  students, involving the girls in  coaching  and\r\n\r\nmentoring.  Two weeks ago, Bukit Panjang Government  High\r\n\r\nstaged a Chinese opera at Victoria School.  Out of the 30\r\n\r\nstudents in the cast, 11 were non-Chinese.  And the  lead\r\n\r\nactress in this Chinese opera was a Faizah Samsudin.  Her\r\n\r\nMandarin  was yi dian dian.  But she recited  her  entire\r\n\r\nscript. Her fellow actors and actresses helped her,  told\r\n\r\nher what the meaning of each phrase or each sentence was,\r\n\r\nand she did it with aplomb!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, I was at Bukit Batok Secondary School\r\n\r\nwhere  it  staged an Indian dance.  Maybe one-third  were\r\n\r\nnon-Indians.  And, in my opinion, the best dancer  was  a\r\n\r\nChinese girl  -  style, and everything!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is happening. And I think our principals and\r\n\r\nteachers have this at the back of their minds.   They  do\r\n\r\nnot want to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover-do  it.  They do not want to contrive it.  But  they\r\n\r\nhave  it at the back of their minds, encouraging students\r\n\r\nof  different  races to get involved in activities  which\r\n\r\nthey do not naturally gravitate towards.  It is happening\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not think we want to over-force it.   But  we\r\n\r\nshould  monitor it, spread best practices  and  encourage\r\n\r\nour schools on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think streaming is the issue. If anything,\r\n\r\nthrough  streaming, we have allowed in both  our  primary\r\n\r\nand  secondary schools a much broader range of  abilities\r\n\r\nwithin  the  same  school.   And  if  we  did  not   have\r\n\r\nstreaming, we would have more segregation of the races by\r\n\r\nschool,  where you have some schools with a  much  larger\r\n\r\nproportion  of  minority students by virtue  of  academic\r\n\r\nachievement.  That is the reality in some other countries\r\n\r\nthat  you can observe.  So, through streaming, a sensible\r\n\r\napproach  of  being  able to match  academic  courses  to\r\n\r\nabilities of students, we have been able to get  a  broad\r\n\r\nrange   of  students  within  the  same  school.    Every\r\n\r\nGovernment school has more than one stream.  The issue is\r\n\r\nhow  do  we  ensure  that whatever  stream  you  are  in,\r\n\r\nwhatever class you are in, you have ample opportunity for\r\n\r\ninteraction  within the school, within  the  clusters  of\r\n\r\nschools, and across schools.  It can be done, and  it  is\r\n\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Can I\r\n\r\nplease  get  greater  clarity on  the  courses  that  our\r\n\r\nteachers and principals, including support staff, go for?\r\n\r\nThat  is  the bedrock, and I would like greater assurance\r\n\r\non that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> There is a whole range\r\n\r\nof  courses.    For  instance, at the pre-service  level,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a compulsory module where all our teachers  go\r\n\r\nthrough,  on the social context of teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a compulsory module which includes issues  to  do\r\n\r\nwith   race  and  ensuring  that  they  have  a   certain\r\n\r\nsensitivity  towards racial issues.  We have  our  annual\r\n\r\nprincipals' forum and National Education Forum.  We  have\r\n\r\na monthly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvideo which we call \"News Teach\".  All of these deal with\r\n\r\nnational  issues,  and  they  often  cover  issues  which\r\n\r\nenhance  awareness and sensitivity to race.  So it  is  a\r\n\r\nwhole  plethora of courses.  I cannot say whether  it  is\r\n\r\nenough.  If there is any specific feedback on how we  can\r\n\r\nimprove a particular module or course, I am sure NIE will\r\n\r\nlook at it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Would the Minister\r\n\r\nagree  with  me  that the understanding  among  different\r\n\r\nethnic  groups could be better fostered if  students  are\r\n\r\ngiven  opportunities to interact on a daily basis, rather\r\n\r\nthan on the occasional performances that they put up?  In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, I was wondering whether the Minister  would\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing SAP schools at the  primary  level  to\r\n\r\noffer  non-Chinese  as  a second language  so  that  non-Chinese  students  can  enrol  into  the  schools,   thus\r\n\r\ncreating  a  better  environment  and  providing   better\r\n\r\nopportunities for children to interact on a daily  basis,\r\n\r\nrather than on an occasional basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> We need both, I think.\r\n\r\nI  take the point that daily interaction does lead  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  sense of comfort that you cannot easily  acquire\r\n\r\nfrom  sporadic or episodic interaction.  It is being done\r\n\r\nin  most  schools  when  project teams  are  formed,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  within  the classroom or  within  a  standard.\r\n\r\nTeachers bear this in mind, making sure that there  is  a\r\n\r\ngood racial mix.  More can be done probably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On SAP schools, it may be precisely because they are\r\n\r\nSAP schools and they are aware of the fact that they have\r\n\r\na  very largely Chinese population of students, that they\r\n\r\ntend  to  think a lot harder about this issue  than  most\r\n\r\nschools.  They think of all kinds of schemes they can get\r\n\r\ninvolved  in.  They are the ones who have taken the  lead\r\n\r\nin  reaching out to the neighbourhood schools - coaching,\r\n\r\nmentoring, involving them in ethnic festivals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited one SAP school a few months ago, Kong Hwa\r\n\r\nPrimary  School.   They had introduced sepak  takraw  for\r\n\r\ntheir  students.   While  I was talking  to  a  group  of\r\n\r\nstudents  and asking them about their ambitions in  life,\r\n\r\nand so on, one young boy put up his hand and said, \"I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  to  be  a  national sportsman.\"  I asked  him  what\r\n\r\nsport.   He  said \"sepak takraw\".  He may  not  become  a\r\n\r\nnational sepak takraw sportsman.  But something has  been\r\n\r\nplanted in his mind.  So this is going on all the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can include a few more non-Chinese students in\r\n\r\nSAP schools, but we have got to make sure they remain SAP\r\n\r\nschools.   We  have  got to make sure  that  they  remain\r\n\r\nsomething   distinctive,  something  that   retains   the\r\n\r\ndiversity  in  our  school system  because  that  is  our\r\n\r\nstrength.   Let us not go for uniformity,  but  within  a\r\n\r\ndiverse system, create bridges, create opportunities  for\r\n\r\ninteraction, where meaningful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  too  worried over the problem  of  inter-racial  mixing  in schools.

I think the problem in many  cases\r\n\r\nmay  be the principals and teachers who turn a blind  eye\r\n\r\nto  the problem in the schools for various reasons.  I do\r\n\r\nnot know the exact reason and many people have gone on to\r\n\r\nspeculate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering, if such an instance that I\r\n\r\ncited  is  the case, whether the Ministry could  be  more\r\n\r\nproactive  and  also  give avenue for  parents  and  even\r\n\r\nstudents  to  highlight  cases that  such  practices  are\r\n\r\ncondoned by teachers and principals and thereby lead to a\r\n\r\nlack  of inter-racial mixing.  Feedback seems to indicate\r\n\r\nthat principals and teachers do contribute to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe problem, because they turn a blind eye to the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, more importantly, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether the committee, that is  headed  by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, could come out with various ways\r\n\r\nof  monitoring not only the measures but the  results  of\r\n\r\nsome  of  these things that the schools have implemented,\r\n\r\nand   not  instances  where  a  Minister  or  Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament  visits the school, they put up a  show  as  a\r\n\r\nmodel  of multi-racialism, but when the Minister,  MP  or\r\n\r\nVIP leaves, what is the real situation in the school.  We\r\n\r\ncan   find   out  whether  this  is  what  the  Singapore\r\n\r\npopulation wants.  Is it the reality, or is it that  some\r\n\r\npolicies or the principals and teachers in charge of  the\r\n\r\nschools  are the cause of the problem?   So I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to pay greater attention to the problem  in\r\n\r\nschool.   It  is  no  point that we start  talking  about\r\n\r\nnation building ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ravindran, no speeches, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> I restrict that to my question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Let me reiterate that we\r\n\r\ndo  not have a hands-offpolicy in this matter and we  are\r\n\r\nnot closing our eyes to the matter.  In fact, we look  at\r\n\r\nit  very  seriously.  We spend time and energy trying  to\r\n\r\nfigure out new ways of enhancing racial interaction.  The\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  the way to do it is  not  to  impose  on\r\n\r\nschools  a  set formula, a fixed template.  It would  not\r\n\r\nwork.   It would be artificial, and it would not  achieve\r\n\r\nwhat  we really want.  If we want to achieve a degree  of\r\n\r\ncomfort  that  lasts between pupils, it  has  got  to  be\r\n\r\nbottoms-up, guided from the Ministry, encouraged  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  and our role is to ensure that best  practices\r\n\r\nget  exchanged  quickly and innovation takes  place  that\r\n\r\nway.  We will try and raise the water level.  But the way\r\n\r\nto  do  it is not to pour a little bit into each  beaker.\r\n\r\nThe way to do it is to exchange best practices quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there are egregious examples of prejudice, we\r\n\r\ntake action.  We look into it.  There may be occasionally\r\n\r\na case of a principal or teacher who does not pay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsufficient  attention to something and those  are  easily\r\n\r\ncorrected.  Because every principal I have met  is  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  issue,  keen  to address  the  issue  and  doing\r\n\r\nsomething about it.  But we are not perfect.  There  will\r\n\r\nalways   be  room  for  improvement.   So  when  we   get\r\n\r\nsuggestions, we take it seriously and we pass it down  to\r\n\r\nthe  schools.  I really have to emphasise the  fact,  and\r\n\r\nthis comes from teachers and principals that parents bear\r\n\r\na  considerable  responsibility in this process.   Pupils\r\n\r\nbring  into  the  classroom and school values  that  they\r\n\r\nimbibe  from their parents.  They may be direct  messages\r\n\r\nthat their parents give or just indirect messages by  way\r\n\r\nof  behaviour.  And I get this message all the time  from\r\n\r\nthe  schools about how they have got to go out  of  their\r\n\r\nway   to  counter  the  biases  and  values  that  pupils\r\n\r\nsometimes  bring into schools.  So we have  got  to  take\r\n\r\nthis  as  a whole community effort, by involving everyone\r\n\r\nand  trying to address the problem.  If schools do it  on\r\n\r\ntheir own, they will go some distance, but they cannot go\r\n\r\nvery far.

Parents may directly or indirectly  bring\r\n\r\nin some prejudices into a child's life.

Hence, PA has  decided  to\r\n\r\nrecover  part  of the costs by levying  a  10%  share  of\r\n\r\ncourse  fee  collections  in two  stages:   5%  from  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember 2003, and 10% from 1st September 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current manpower cost of supporting CC and RC\r\n\r\ncourses  amounts  to  about  $5  million  per  year.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  about  $3  million  per  year  is   spent   on\r\n\r\nmaintaining facilities needed to conduct the courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  total  cost incurred by the People's Association  in\r\n\r\nsupporting trainers and private operators in the  running\r\n\r\nof  the  courses  is therefore about $8 million  a  year.\r\n\r\nThis cost does not include the expenses incurred by PA in\r\n\r\nupgrading  the  trainers  as well  as  in  upgrading  the\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CC and RC centre course fee collections range from\r\n\r\nabout  $15  million to $20 million annually.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  10%  levy means PA would eventually receive  between\r\n\r\n$1.5  and  $2 million per year.  In the first year,  only\r\n\r\nhalf  of  this  amount  will be  collected.   Hence,  the\r\n\r\ncollection of 10% levy recovers only a small part of PA's\r\n\r\ncost  in  organising the courses.  This is just  a  small\r\n\r\nsharing  of costs by the trainers and operators with  the\r\n\r\nPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA does not think the levy will lead to reduced\r\n\r\nservice  or reduced share to the CCs and RCs.  Conducting\r\n\r\ncourses  at  the  CCs and RCs remains attractive  to  the\r\n\r\ncourse  operators.  At 40%, the total levy  collected  by\r\n\r\nCCs/RCs  and  PA  remains lower than the private  sector.\r\n\r\nThe  CCs  and  RCs continue to give good support  to  the\r\n\r\ncourse operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the course fees, the CCs and RCs have agreed\r\n\r\nto  PA's appeal to hold course fees at current level  for\r\n\r\nat  least  six months until February 2004.  Beyond  that,\r\n\r\ncourse  fees  will  depend  on  the  willingness  of  the\r\n\r\ncustomers to pay.  However, the course operators need not\r\n\r\nincrease course fees to cover the 10% levy if they do not\r\n\r\nwant   to,   because  they  could  recoup  by  increasing\r\n\r\nproductivity,  such  as by taking two  or  perhaps  three\r\n\r\nadditional participants per course.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  the Minister of State aware that some of  these\r\n\r\noperators  have  contractual agreements  which  would  be\r\n\r\nvalid  beyond 1st January 2004?

While tempered\r\n\r\nglass  is  able to withstand stronger impact than  normal\r\n\r\nglass,  it  can  still break, if used improperly.   Rough\r\n\r\nusage  may  cause chipping of the glass.  Over time,  the\r\n\r\nchips may develop into cracks, causing the glass to break\r\n\r\nsuddenly when they widen to a certain crack width.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to pinpoint the actual cause of the\r\n\r\nbreakage  after  the  incident.   Nevertheless,  in  some\r\n\r\ninstances,  there  are  signs  that  would  indicate  the\r\n\r\npossibility of rough usage.  These include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Cracks on the brackets holding the frameless\r\n\r\nglass  door, which may be caused by repeated slamming  of\r\n\r\nthe glass door;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Dislodgement of the frame holding the fixed\r\n\r\nglass panel from the outer frame;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Chips at the glass edge on the unbroken glass;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Scattering of glass fragments over a big area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the shower screens are installed using\r\n\r\nspecialised systems, according to the prevailing industry\r\n\r\nstandard.

Sir,  tempered  glass  is  a  standard  building\r\n\r\nmaterial.

The purpose of that exercise  was\r\n\r\nto inspect for the quality of the hinges and the fixtures\r\n\r\nthat  were  used  to  hold the frameless  tempered  glass\r\n\r\nscreens.   At  the same time, during the inspection,  HDB\r\n\r\nofficers  also  inspected for any  chips  resulting  from\r\n\r\nrough  usage.  At that exercise, some glass  panels  were\r\n\r\nchanged  because they found that some of the hinges  were\r\n\r\nnot  in  order  and we suspected that these  hinges  came\r\n\r\nloose  because of rough usage.  So, we made good all  the\r\n\r\nglass shower screens we thought at that time were not  in\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two accidents came about after the inspection.\r\n\r\nThe  inspection  process does not guarantee  that  future\r\n\r\naccidents would not occur.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, SS341 defines three\r\n\r\nmethods for testing the safety of tempered glass.   SS341\r\n\r\nspecifies  that the glass should go through three  tests.\r\n\r\nThe  first  one is called the impact test, ie, you  break\r\n\r\nthe  glass  upon  a certain impact.  The second  test  is\r\n\r\nknown  as  the fragmentation test.  It is to  pierce  the\r\n\r\nglass  to see how many pieces it breaks into over a small\r\n\r\narea.   The  third  test is the surface compression  test\r\n\r\nwhich  sends  a light ray through the glass and  measures\r\n\r\nthe angle of bending of the glass.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough usage, unfortunately, is quite common in many\r\n\r\nof the instances that we have inspected.  In fact, in the\r\n\r\nincident in Block 130 Edgedale Plains, HDB suspected that\r\n\r\nthe glass broke because of rough usage.  But, having said\r\n\r\nthat, once a shower screen has broken into pieces, it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to ascertain whether it is truly rough usage or\r\n\r\nany other cause.  But based on the inspection on a sample\r\n\r\nsize  of  about 30,000 shower screens last year, we  have\r\n\r\ncome  to the conclusion that rough usage is the principal\r\n\r\ncause of many of the accidents that have happened in  the\r\n\r\nHDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I wonder whether\r\n\r\nit is cost effective and necessary for the HDB to install\r\n\r\nsuch shower screens in completed HDB flats.

Right\r\n\r\nnow, as at June 2003, the amount of arrears with domestic\r\n\r\nconsumers is about $246 million.  In other words, we have\r\n\r\n$246  million that is owing to SP Services and they  have\r\n\r\ncollected  $148 million.  So they do not  make  money  on\r\n\r\nthese deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister of State saying\r\n\r\nthat the deposits collected are, as he has said, in fact,\r\n\r\nused by SP Services for the purchase of oil or fuel?   If\r\n\r\nthat is the case, then it is a misuse of deposits.  As  I\r\n\r\nunderstand it, in law, a deposit is a deposit and it  has\r\n\r\nto  be  returned  when it is due.   You  cannot  use  the\r\n\r\ndeposits for your business purposes. No doubt SP Services\r\n\r\ncan  collect  up to 1.5 months of deposits.   But  is  it\r\n\r\nalso,  in  law, that they can make use of these  deposits\r\n\r\nfor their business purposes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Let me explain it again\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Chiam.  SP Services buys upfront the  electricity\r\n\r\nthat the consumers use.  So, they are out of pocket. This\r\n\r\nis  one part of the transaction.  The other part is  they\r\n\r\nhave  the deposits which they collect from the consumers.\r\n\r\nIt  gets offset.  They do not make any money out of this.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have  said, there are $246 million in arrears  and\r\n\r\n$148 million which they have collected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My question is: do they have a\r\n\r\nright  to  make use of the consumers' deposits for  their\r\n\r\nown  business purposes?  Because, as I understand  it,  a\r\n\r\ndeposit  is  just  a  deposit to offset  any  overuse  of\r\n\r\nelectricity by the consumers. Now the Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nis saying that SP Services takes the deposit and uses it.\r\n\r\nThat  means they are using the consumers' money for their\r\n\r\nown business purposes, which is not right in law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> I am actually puzzled\r\n\r\nwith Mr Chiam's question.

So I do not understand\r\n\r\nwhether,  in  accounting term, we  can  say  we  have  no\r\n\r\ndeposit balance because we have so much arrears.  Can  he\r\n\r\nexplain that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> The issue here is\r\n\r\nwhether or not they earn interest.  I think that  is  the\r\n\r\nintent of the question.  Did they earn interest?  If they\r\n\r\nearn  interest,  can  we  use  this  interest  to  offset\r\n\r\nelectricity tariffs?  What I was saying is that  when  we\r\n\r\nnet it all off, there is no interest that is earned  -  a\r\n\r\n45-day  deposit  against a 45-day credit.   The  separate\r\n\r\nissue  that  Mr Chiam brought up is how can  we  use  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  deposit.  The real issue is that when you  want\r\n\r\nthe security deposit back, when you close the account, do\r\n\r\nyou get it back?

This component has been given\r\n\r\na  renewed  emphasis  following our  review  of  the  CCA\r\n\r\nGuidelines  and Grading Scheme in 2002.  This  scheme  is\r\n\r\nknown  as \"LEAPS\" in our secondary schools, standing  for\r\n\r\nLeadership,   Enrichment,   Achievement,   Participation,\r\n\r\nService.    It   recognises  students'   involvement   in\r\n\r\ncommunity  work as a separate category; in  other  words,\r\n\r\nthey  can obtain recognition for the number of hours they\r\n\r\nput  into community involvement and earn CCA points.    A\r\n\r\nsimilar  scheme  exists at the Junior College/Centralised\r\n\r\nInstitutes  level, recognising students'  voluntary  work\r\n\r\nwith the community organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also asked about linking project work in\r\n\r\nschools to a community setting. The project work that our\r\n\r\npre-university students are engaged in requires  them  to\r\n\r\ncollect  and  evaluate information from the  real  world.\r\n\r\nTheir  projects  typically involve them  collecting  data\r\n\r\nthrough  observation, by interviewing people, or  through\r\n\r\nsurveys.   The  design  of  the project  work  curriculum\r\n\r\ntherefore  helps keep them in touch with the  issues  and\r\n\r\nconcerns  of  the community in which they live.   At  the\r\n\r\nprimary  and secondary levels, schools also engage  their\r\n\r\nstudents  in  a  whole host of projects, including  those\r\n\r\nwhich involve working with the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of holistic character development for\r\n\r\nstudents,   many  schools  have  embarked  upon   Service\r\n\r\nLearning.  Service\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning  is  an  extension of the Community  Involvement\r\n\r\nProgramme   (CIP).   Service  Learning   integrates   the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of the school curriculum, both  the  academic\r\n\r\ncurriculum  as well as the CCA curriculum with  community\r\n\r\nservice and project work.  By applying the knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills they learn in schools to their community projects,\r\n\r\nstudents  engage  in activities that benefit  the  school\r\n\r\ncommunity and the community at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I ask the Minister whether his\r\n\r\nMinistry could ensure that the CCA does not increase more\r\n\r\nstress  to  our students as the present load  is  already\r\n\r\nvery high?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the inclusion of\r\n\r\ncommunity projects does not lead to an increased load  of\r\n\r\nCCA  but  increased breadth of CCA.

To ask the Acting Minister for Education whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  trend which shows that students, especially\r\n\r\nthose in the higher level, are increasingly succumbing to\r\n\r\nstress  arising from relationships and studies  and  what\r\n\r\nare the measures being taken to address these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Question No. 9, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Acting Minister for Education):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  a  short answer to Mdm Ho's  Question  is\r\n\r\n\"no\".  There is no evidence that students at  the  higher\r\n\r\nlevel   are   increasingly  succumbing  to  stress   from\r\n\r\nrelationships  and  studies.   Stress  is,  in  fact,   a\r\n\r\ncomplex phenomenon with multiple causes.  How individuals\r\n\r\nrespond to stress also varies widely from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual    to   individual,   depending    on    their\r\n\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education adopts a comprehensive\r\n\r\napproach  to provide psychological and emotional  support\r\n\r\nfor  students.  We believe that prevention is better than\r\n\r\ncure.   Hence,  all  pupils are taught lifeskills,  which\r\n\r\ncover topics on personal and interpersonal effectiveness.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the focus of sexual education for  students\r\n\r\nat  the  JC/CI level, implemented this year, is  also  on\r\n\r\ninterpersonal relationships, covering topics such as self-worth in courtships, dating, conflicts and the importance\r\n\r\nof   family  support.   This  helps  our  students  build\r\n\r\nsatisfying  relationships  and  cope  with  life  changes\r\n\r\neffectively   as   they  grow  up.    Complementing   the\r\n\r\nstructured  teaching  of lifeskills,  schools  also  have\r\n\r\nsystems  to  facilitate  the  early  identification   and\r\n\r\nsupport  of  students who need help, and refer  them  for\r\n\r\ncounselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers are now first-line caregivers and are\r\n\r\ngiven  training in basic counselling skills so that  they\r\n\r\nmay  provide  immediate basic counselling to students  in\r\n\r\nneed.  Students with more difficult problems are referred\r\n\r\nto  teacher counsellors in their schools.  In fact, there\r\n\r\nare  two  of  them in each school. Students  with  severe\r\n\r\nneeds   are  referred  to  the  Ministry  of  Education's\r\n\r\neducational  psychologists and  guidance  specialists  or\r\n\r\nexternal counsellors engaged by the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools provide support for the students, the\r\n\r\nsupport  from  the  home  is  also  very  important.   In\r\n\r\nestablishing a warm and nurturing relationship with their\r\n\r\nchildren, and maintaining it into their late adolescence,\r\n\r\nparents  lay  the  foundation  to  develop  strength   of\r\n\r\ncharacter  in them.  Parents can help their children  set\r\n\r\nrealistic  expectations and model healthy problem-solving\r\n\r\nstrategies.   Schools and parents can  work  together  to\r\n\r\nachieve this for their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have  any schemes in place to  detect  early\r\n\r\nsuicidal cases in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents who suffer from a lot of stress in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> As I have said, this depends on\r\n\r\nthe  observation  by  the teachers.

I\r\n\r\nam  wondering whether the Ministry would put in  place  a\r\n\r\nmore proactive scheme to work with the students regularly\r\n\r\nto  detect  and  sieve out the students  who  have  great\r\n\r\ndifficulties in managing relationships or work stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I do not think I can give such an\r\n\r\nassurance.

So students\r\n\r\nwho have difficulties can raise their problems with their\r\n\r\nteachers.   Or  if they raise their problems  with  their\r\n\r\nfriends,  their friends may be able to raise the problems\r\n\r\nwith the teachers, and the teachers follow up from there.\r\n\r\nOur  best assurance is to have teachers trained in  basic\r\n\r\ncounselling  skills so that they will be able  to  detect\r\n\r\nproblems.  This has already been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State just now mentioned that there  is  no\r\n\r\nindication  that  students  in  the  higher   level   are\r\n\r\nsuccumbing to stress.

An increase in number can be due to a greater\r\n\r\nwillingness   to  see  psychologists,  not  the   problem\r\n\r\nbecoming greater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for numbers of the last few years, I do not have\r\n\r\nthem  with  me  at  the moment, but I  did  see  it  this\r\n\r\nmorning.  It is more or less steady, and it has gone down\r\n\r\na  little  in  the  last 2-3 years.   If  the  Member  is\r\n\r\ninterested, we can share those figures with him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have a list of formal indicators. As I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  we  depend  on  teachers  who  are  in   the\r\n\r\nfrontline.  We teach them how to observe signs of  stress\r\n\r\nas  well as problems.  If it goes beyond a certain level,\r\n\r\nit will be detected and follow-up action will be taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as stress is concerned, I do believe that in\r\n\r\nall  forms  of  learning, there is some form  of  stress.\r\n\r\nStress  is generated as we go into areas that are unknown\r\n\r\nor  uncertain.  Learning, by definition, is  to  go  into\r\n\r\nareas that are unknown so as to know more.  So, a certain\r\n\r\namount  of  stress in the learning process is  inevitable\r\n\r\nand,  in fact, necessary to provide the drive.  If  there\r\n\r\nis  no  stress, all of us will become very lethargic  and\r\n\r\nlacking  in drive.  But the important thing is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat when stress goes beyond a certain level, is becoming\r\n\r\ndysfunctional and the student is unable to cope, the case\r\n\r\nis detected and followed up on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stress exists in our education system. We do not\r\n\r\ndeny it.

Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, notwithstanding the various reasons for a person to\r\n\r\nattempt  or  commit  suicide, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State to give an idea of what the schools and\r\n\r\nMOE  are  doing to reach out to parents and the community\r\n\r\nto have a collective effort of trying to deal with stress-related  issues of our students, because  they  are  very\r\n\r\nprecious  resources  for  us.   And  I  think  from   the\r\n\r\nindications  given, more needs to be done.

Are  there  really no symptoms  expressed  by  the\r\n\r\nafflicted  or  are  we,  as a society,  the  school,  the\r\n\r\nteachers,  etc,  not  sensitive enough  to  the  symptoms\r\n\r\nexpressed  by the students?  Maybe the teachers  and  the\r\n\r\nschools  need  to be more sensitive, rather  than  saying\r\n\r\nthat the students are not expressing any symptoms at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was responding\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Steve Chia's point about crying for help.   If  a\r\n\r\nperson  cries  for help and we did not  respond  and  the\r\n\r\nperson commits suicide, yes, something is very wrong.   I\r\n\r\nam  saying  that it is not a case of a person crying  for\r\n\r\nhelp and we did not respond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for being sensitive, we have to bear in mind that\r\n\r\nif  our  teachers  become  too sensitive,  they  may  see\r\n\r\nsuicidal tendencies in everybody, and that is not the way\r\n\r\nto conduct a class.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I want to check\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister whether there has been any survey  or\r\n\r\neven a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndialogue  that  has been organised for students  to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom them whether they are indeed going through stress of\r\n\r\nall sorts in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> As I have said, all these may have\r\n\r\nbeen  happening  on  the ground.

I would like to go back  to  my  earlier\r\n\r\npoint  and  say, yes, stress is inevitable in a  learning\r\n\r\nenvironment.   And that stress is motivating.   It  is  a\r\n\r\ndrive.   The point is that if it becomes excessive beyond\r\n\r\nthe level that the person can cope, then intervention  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I could not quite understand\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State's answer  regarding  the  recent\r\n\r\nsuicide  cases.  First, he has dismissed study stress  as\r\n\r\nthe cause.   Then, in the next instance, he says that  we\r\n\r\nshould wait for the police's investigations to come  out.\r\n\r\nBut  what I want to ask him now is that, in view  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there have been several teenage  suicides  in\r\n\r\npast years,  surely, by now, his Ministry would have come\r\n\r\nto  some conclusions as to what were the causes of  these\r\n\r\nsuicides, and do something about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, if we are talking about the\r\n\r\nrecent  suicides,  the investigations  are  still  taking\r\n\r\nplace.

Our proactive approach  involves\r\n\r\ntraining all our teachers in basic counselling skills and\r\n\r\ntraining two teacher-counsellors per school to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe   more  serious  cases,  bring  in  former  education\r\n\r\nofficers who are experienced, train them and deploy  them\r\n\r\nat  cluster level.

This  was  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  a  recommendation by  the  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  that the Government form a CET  body  to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  cope  with economic  restructuring  through\r\n\r\ntraining and skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structural unemployment takes place when segments of\r\n\r\nthe workforce are not able to acquire the suitable skills\r\n\r\nrequired for the new types of jobs created.  The pace  of\r\n\r\nskills upgrading of our workforce must keep up with rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  business  environment.   If  industries\r\n\r\ncannot  find the right type of skilled worker they  need,\r\n\r\nthey  will  not  come here.  And even if they  do  invest\r\n\r\nhere,  Singaporeans  without the  necessary  skills  will\r\n\r\nremain unemployable.  Therefore, the Workforce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Agency (WDA) has a key role in ensuring  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans continually upgrade or develop new skills to\r\n\r\nstay employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Budget Statement, we undertook to\r\n\r\nestablish this new agency within 6 to 9 months from  end-February.  We understood the urgency of this task.  I  am\r\n\r\npleased to report to Members that we are ready to  launch\r\n\r\nWDA  in mid-September, within 61/2 months.  My Ministry's\r\n\r\nefforts  to establish this new agency have culminated  in\r\n\r\nthis  WDA  Bill,  the various clauses  of  which  I  will\r\n\r\nelaborate on later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government started on this journey to\r\n\r\npromote  lifelong learning and workforce  development  as\r\n\r\nfar  back as 1979, when the Skills Development Fund (SDF)\r\n\r\nwas   established.   The  SDF  was  the  first   training\r\n\r\ninitiative  to be driven at the national level.   Several\r\n\r\nother  national-level  initiatives  such  as  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme,  National  Skills   Recognition\r\n\r\nSystem and Strategic Manpower Conversion Programmes, were\r\n\r\nsubsequently put in place.  More recently, two years ago,\r\n\r\nthis House passed a Bill to establish a Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund (LLF).  Let me elaborate  a  bit  on  the\r\n\r\nLifelong Learning Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LLF was launched with an initial contribution of\r\n\r\n$500 million from Government in March 2001, and topped up\r\n\r\ntwice  since  then,  to reach the current  size  of  $1.5\r\n\r\nbillion.  The setting up of the LLF reflects Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment to promote lifelong learning by our workforce.\r\n\r\nThe Government aims to set aside $5 billion eventually to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  secure  and steady stream of  income  to  help\r\n\r\nworkers upgrade and retrain.  The LLF has enabled MOM  to\r\n\r\nimplement  new  programmes and initiatives to  complement\r\n\r\nthose  under  the  Skills Development  Fund  as  well  as\r\n\r\nmanpower  development plans spearheaded by other economic\r\n\r\nagencies.   The Workforce Development Agency will  manage\r\n\r\nboth  the  Skills  Development Fund  (SDF)  and  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning Fund (LLF).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>WDA - Jobs for Singaporeans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have spoken much during these past few\r\n\r\nmonths  about the challenges of globalisation.   We  will\r\n\r\nmeet  these  challenges  head-on.   We  cannot  rely   on\r\n\r\nartificial barriers to protect our jobs.  We must upgrade\r\n\r\nand  give investors an incentive to locate and stay  here\r\n\r\nbecause  of a highly trained workforce. The establishment\r\n\r\nof  WDA  signals Government's strong commitment  to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans stay employable and maintain our lead with a\r\n\r\ndisciplined and technically competent workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, WDA will lead, champion and drive\r\n\r\nadult  education and training in Singapore.  It  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  champion for workforce development.  It  will  build\r\n\r\nupon  current CET capabilities and develop  new  ones  to\r\n\r\nsupport  and  strengthen workforce  competitiveness.   It\r\n\r\nwill  coordinate,  consolidate and  rationalise  existing\r\n\r\nmanpower  development  efforts for  the  adult  workforce\r\n\r\ncarried  out by various Government agencies, for  greater\r\n\r\neffectiveness.  WDA will also sharpen the  nexus  between\r\n\r\nindustry and the Singapore worker so that plans to  train\r\n\r\nand   develop  a  skilled  workforce  for  industry   are\r\n\r\ncoordinated with plans to develop and grow that industry.\r\n\r\nAs  a  statutory board, the Workforce Development  Agency\r\n\r\nwill have a clear mandate as well as operational autonomy\r\n\r\nand  flexibility  in  championing workforce  development.\r\n\r\nThis enables WDA to be nimble and interface with industry\r\n\r\neffectively,  and thus be able to respond  to  industry's\r\n\r\nneeds in a more timely and flexible manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the Workforce Development Agency is\r\n\r\ncompletely pro-Singaporean.  Jobs for Singaporeans is the\r\n\r\nmantra.  The WDA will reach out to all workers, rank  and\r\n\r\nfile,  as  well as professionals and executives, employed\r\n\r\nor looking for jobs.  It will help those who want to work\r\n\r\nto  find  meaningful  jobs, and  those  who  are  already\r\n\r\nworking to become or stay more employable.  WDA will seek\r\n\r\nthrough  CET programmes to equip our workforce  with  key\r\n\r\nemployability  skills  so  that  workers  can  adapt  and\r\n\r\nrespond to volatility in the labour market as well\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas demands of new jobs.  This desired outcome is captured\r\n\r\nin  the vision of the Workforce Development Agency, which\r\n\r\nis to build a resilient, skilled and agile workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key thrusts and strategies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the key thrusts to WDA's\r\n\r\nprogrammes and plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, WDA will ensure that training is relevant\r\n\r\nto the job in the company.  Put simply, we do not want to\r\n\r\ntrain  for  training's sake.  We train and develop  skill\r\n\r\nsets  so  that  Singaporeans can find new  jobs  or  stay\r\n\r\nemployed.  Members had spoken on the need  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthis  connection  between  training  and  industry  needs\r\n\r\nduring  the Committee of Supply in March this year.   WDA\r\n\r\nwill do this systematically by identifying current skills\r\n\r\ngaps  as  well as future skills needs at industry  level.\r\n\r\nWe  will  work  closely  with  leaders  in  industry  and\r\n\r\ntraining  providers to make sure that training programmes\r\n\r\nmeet  correct  needs.  Training must  be  more  industry-oriented and market-driven.  The outcome must be  greater\r\n\r\nemployability  for  the Singaporean  worker  and  greater\r\n\r\nvalue to the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To implement this effectively, the Workforce\r\n\r\nDevelopment Agency must build partnerships with  industry\r\n\r\nplayers  and  other economic agencies.  Work has  already\r\n\r\nbegun.  Over the past few months, my Ministry has engaged\r\n\r\nkey  leaders  in various industry sectors with  available\r\n\r\njobs.   As  a  result, WDA will be able to  launch  these\r\n\r\nIndustry Manpower Development Partnerships in the process\r\n\r\nindustry,  precision  engineering and  infocomm  sectors,\r\n\r\nover  the next few months.  These partnerships will  help\r\n\r\nWDA  to identify where jobs are available and what skills\r\n\r\nemployers  are  looking  for.  We will  place  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  into these jobs and train them with  the  skills\r\n\r\nthey  need.  This approach is currently being adopted  to\r\n\r\nplace  job seekers in the precision engineering  industry\r\n\r\nwhere there are 700 jobs available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WDA will also work very closely with the economic\r\n\r\nagencies such as EDB, to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure workers are trained for the jobs generated by  new\r\n\r\ninvestments.   WDA  will  work  with  other  agencies  to\r\n\r\nredesign  jobs so that Singaporeans will find  such  jobs\r\n\r\nmore   attractive   to  take  up.    We   are   currently\r\n\r\ncollaborating  with  the National Environment  Agency  to\r\n\r\nseek out opportunities in the environmental sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, WDA will strengthen the CET training\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   We  must teach in a  way  that  enables\r\n\r\nadults to learn better and quicker.  During the Committee\r\n\r\nof Supply, Members spoke about this need to enhance adult\r\n\r\ntraining  methods  and curriculum.   We  must  understand\r\n\r\nbetter  how  adults learn. Only then can  we  teach  them\r\n\r\ncorrectly  and effectively.  Therefore, WDA will  develop\r\n\r\nprofessional   expertise  in  pedagogy   and   curriculum\r\n\r\ndevelopment for adult learning, and skills certification.\r\n\r\nA  Member also stressed the importance of regulating  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the  CET  industry.   We  agree.   WDA  will\r\n\r\nestablish  standards for the training industry to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  publicly funded workforce training programmes  will\r\n\r\nbe  useful,  effective and industry-relevant.   Workforce\r\n\r\ntraining   should  also  fit  within  a  broader   skills\r\n\r\nframework  defining  clear  competencies  at  individual,\r\n\r\nindustry  and job levels.  Such a framework  should  have\r\n\r\nclearly  defined skills standards and established  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading roadmaps.  This will help workers to plan their\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading  throughout  their  career  within   an\r\n\r\nindustry  or  across  industries.   In  line  with   this\r\n\r\nobjective,  the  National Skills Centre  currently  under\r\n\r\nSPRING,  which  manages the National  Skills  Recognition\r\n\r\nSystem, will come under WDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency will also be working closely with\r\n\r\ntraining  providers  and  industry  players  to   promote\r\n\r\nholistic  development of CET infrastructure in individual\r\n\r\nindustries.   The  Agency  will  work  with  industry  to\r\n\r\ndevelop      comprehensive     vertically      integrated\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to provide industry-specific training from\r\n\r\nentry into management level.  This includes new industry-based  training  infrastructure, for instance,  specialty\r\n\r\nacademies   such  as  the  Retail  Academy   to   provide\r\n\r\nspecialised training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thrust of WDA is to help retrenched\r\n\r\nSingaporeans find jobs.  This\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgency  and  its partners will provide a more  customised\r\n\r\nsupport to unemployed workers who want to transit back to\r\n\r\nthe  labour  force.  With job displacements or disruptive\r\n\r\nemployment  being key features in our employment  market,\r\n\r\nthere will be greater demand for more job information and\r\n\r\nplacement  assistance.   WDA will  build  up  a  stronger\r\n\r\ncapability  to  disseminate in a  systematic  and  timely\r\n\r\nmanner,  relevant  labour  market  information   to   job\r\n\r\nseekers.  It will also strengthen the capabilities of the\r\n\r\ncentres in the Distributed CareerLink Network, run by the\r\n\r\nCDCs,  NTUC and the self-help groups that provide  career\r\n\r\ncoaching, job placement and training assistance.   During\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  of Supply, a Member suggested  that  more\r\n\r\nattention be paid to career counselling.  I agree.  I  am\r\n\r\npleased   to  report  that  WDA  will  develop   a   more\r\n\r\nprofessional  career  counselling service  to  serve  job\r\n\r\nseekers  that need professional guidance and  more  hand-holding in their job search.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recognise that ultimately, whether we have\r\n\r\nenough jobs depends substantially on new investments  and\r\n\r\nnew  business demands.  But, employment also  depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  willingness of workers to compete for jobs at market\r\n\r\nwages.   At the individual level, it remains the personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the job seeker to get and keep his job.\r\n\r\nBut  by helping our workforce upgrade their skills,  both\r\n\r\nhard   and  soft  skills,  by  searching  out  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  from  current  business  needs   and   new\r\n\r\ninvestments, and helping job seekers to more  effectively\r\n\r\nfind and secure the right jobs, the Workforce Development\r\n\r\nAgency can help workers stay more employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Value to stakeholders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be our value to our stakeholders? To\r\n\r\nemployers  and  businesses, this  Agency  will  be  their\r\n\r\npartner to identify skills needs, support the training of\r\n\r\nworkers, and establish human resource systems to build  a\r\n\r\nworkforce that can sharpen their competitive edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To job seekers, WDA will develop more customised\r\n\r\nsupport and a broader range\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  assistance schemes to help them get jobs.  Those  who\r\n\r\nare  willing to adapt and adjust to the realities of  the\r\n\r\njob  market will find jobs.  They can approach a  network\r\n\r\nof  dedicated CareerLink centres that provide more timely\r\n\r\ninformation on the labour market, such as where  the  job\r\n\r\nopenings  are,  the  type  of  skills  required  and  the\r\n\r\nremuneration  for the jobs.  This Agency will  work  with\r\n\r\nthe CareerLink centres to proactively seek out employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  job seekers and  help  them  overcome\r\n\r\nskills and other barriers to get back to work.  WDA  will\r\n\r\ndevelop   targeted   Place  and   Train   programmes   in\r\n\r\npartnership  with employers to help job  seekers  acquire\r\n\r\nthe skills needed to take up new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the employed, the Workforce Development Agency\r\n\r\nwill  work  with  employers  to strengthen  in-employment\r\n\r\ntraining so that workers can retrain and re-skill  to  do\r\n\r\nbetter  in  their  current jobs, and to  serve  the  fast\r\n\r\nchanging  needs of businesses.  This helps the  workforce\r\n\r\nto stay employable and competitive.\r\n\r\nTo   training  providers  and  institutions   of   higher\r\n\r\nlearning, the Workforce Development Agency will  help  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  greater knowledge on how adults learn,  so  that\r\n\r\ncurriculum  can  be better designed to be accessible  and\r\n\r\neffective  for  the  working adult.  WDA  will  be  their\r\n\r\npartner  in  strengthening  the  nexus  between  training\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and industries, which is  critical  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of continuing education and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Leadership</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the challenges that I have set out for the\r\n\r\nWorkforce Development Agency, we will all agree  that  we\r\n\r\nneed  a strong management team to lead the group of  240-odd  WDA  staff.   I  have therefore asked  my  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary,  Ms  Yong Ying-I, to be the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nWorkforce Development Agency. My Deputy Secretary, Mr Leo\r\n\r\nYip,  will  be  the  Chief Executive  for  the  Workforce\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Agency.  I have also appointed  a  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors from the public and private sectors.  The Board\r\n\r\nmembers have rich and diverse backgrounds in industry,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunion  and  workforce development.  I am  confident  they\r\n\r\nwill  provide a strong stewardship to the running of WDA,\r\n\r\nas  well  as facilitate the networking with its partners.\r\n\r\nAmong  the  Board  of Directors are two Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse, Mayor Teo Ho Pin, who will represent the Mayors of\r\n\r\nthe CDCs and Mdm Halimah Yacob who will represent NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>WDA BILL</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Bill itself. Part I and Part\r\n\r\nII  propose  to  establish and incorporate the  Workforce\r\n\r\nDevelopment Agency as a statutory board under the purview\r\n\r\nof  MOM  and  provide for the appointments  of  Chairman,\r\n\r\nDeputy  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Agency  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Part III sets out the functions and duties  of\r\n\r\nthe  Agency and powers by the Minister to give directions\r\n\r\nand the Agency to form committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV and Part V cater for standard provisions\r\n\r\nrelating  to staff and finance, including the appointment\r\n\r\nof  Chief  Executive  and the investment  powers  of  the\r\n\r\nAgency.  Part VI, read in relation to the First Schedule,\r\n\r\nprovides   for   the   transfer  of   property,   assets,\r\n\r\nliabilities  and  employees from  some  of  the  existing\r\n\r\ndepartments under MOM and SPRING to WDA, as well  as  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  policy  oversight and administration  power\r\n\r\nover   the   Lifelong  Learning  Fund  and   the   Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  to WDA.  Part VII  grants  the  Agency\r\n\r\npower to enforce against offences and to make regulations\r\n\r\nwith the approval of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Workforce Development Agency\r\n\r\nmarks  a  significant milestone in our continuing efforts\r\n\r\nto  strengthen workforce development.  As a small country\r\n\r\nwith  no  natural resources, human capital  is  our  only\r\n\r\nasset.   A  competitive workforce is key  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontinued growth and prosperity.  All of us recognise the\r\n\r\nstrong economic competition Singapore faces but there  is\r\n\r\nno  need for our workers to lose heart.  Singapore  still\r\n\r\nhas a competitive edge.  Our world-class infrastructures,\r\n\r\ninvestments in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation of citizens, a hardworking and highly organised\r\n\r\nworkforce,  are  reasons  that  will  continue  to  swing\r\n\r\ninvestors in our favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way where the entire nation rallied\r\n\r\nbehind   the  Government  to  fight  against  SARS,   the\r\n\r\nWorkforce  Development  Agency  will  require  the   same\r\n\r\nsupport   and  cooperation  of  workers,  employers   and\r\n\r\nstrategic  partners  to tackle workforce  competitiveness\r\n\r\nchallenges  head-on.  Together, we can  renew  heightened\r\n\r\nhope  to our workforce, to help them stay employable  and\r\n\r\neven more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nrecently,  when  I  made visits to  workplaces,  a  union\r\n\r\nleader  remarked to me that it is increasingly  difficult\r\n\r\nthese  days to get a happy conversation going about jobs.\r\n\r\nThere is truth in the comment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, downturns were often cyclical. Today,\r\n\r\nthe  changes  are more structural.  Product lines  become\r\n\r\noutmoded  quickly.   Competitors  move  into  lower  cost\r\n\r\ncountries to sharpen their competitive edge.  Workers are\r\n\r\nreplaced  by  technology  or displaced  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nfactory  relocation.  These structural changes  are  long\r\n\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new, harsh economic realities, which\r\n\r\nglobalisation  has driven, will continue  to  change  our\r\n\r\nsocio-economic  environment.  We have to adapt  and  live\r\n\r\nwith  it.   In view of the situation we are in,  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be vigilant and be nimble to react  to  the\r\n\r\nchanges.   But we must not be incapacitated  by  the  bad\r\n\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is perfectly normal to express insecurity\r\n\r\nover  the  job, a positive outlook in the midst of  these\r\n\r\nbad  time  situations will allow us  to  see  the  silver\r\n\r\nlining when it comes.  Staying positive and possessing  a\r\n\r\nwillingness to work hard and accept responsibilities even\r\n\r\nin areas we have no experience in is a sure way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology may have taken over the job. Companies\r\n\r\nmay relocate to China, or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia,  where workers there do the same job for half  the\r\n\r\nprice.   We have to face this reality squarely and  react\r\n\r\nwith a new mindset and a new willingness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key word is \"mobility\". In a tight labour\r\n\r\nmarket,  the  employee  is seen  to  have  greater  power\r\n\r\nbecause  he can move to another job, and get better  pay.\r\n\r\nIn  a  downturn, the power of the employee  lies  in  his\r\n\r\nskills to perform.  The skills they pick up help them  to\r\n\r\nmove on to other jobs.  How much power he has depends  on\r\n\r\nhis skills level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the workers today have to constantly\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves to remain employable.  If  they  have\r\n\r\nthe  skills that companies need for the future, they will\r\n\r\nbe able to prolong their value worth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of the Workforce Development\r\n\r\nAgency  is  timely.  We expect WDA to be very focused  on\r\n\r\ntraining that is directly relevant to getting and keeping\r\n\r\njobs,  to help and ensure Singaporeans remain employable.\r\n\r\nI  am  very  happy  that WDA will do more  in  developing\r\n\r\ntraining  methods that are suitable for  adult  learning.\r\n\r\nVery  often, we tend to use methodologies that are  meant\r\n\r\nfor  the  young  and students.  We have to  consider  the\r\n\r\nlearning  methodologies  that the  adults  require.   The\r\n\r\nAgency  should devote more resources to find ways we  can\r\n\r\nmake our adult learning and training more effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workforce Development Agency should be open and\r\n\r\nresponsive  in  providing labour market information.   To\r\n\r\nhelp Singaporeans stay employable, the training has to be\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  more  responsive to the  needs  of  labour\r\n\r\nmarket.   I  would like to know what is the plan  of  the\r\n\r\nAgency  in this area.  Are we able to effectively project\r\n\r\njob opportunities available in the short and medium term?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern of the employment situation of\r\n\r\nour  polytechnic  and  university graduates.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  enlighten us on how severe is the  unemployment\r\n\r\nor under-employment situation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our fresh graduates today?  What would WDA do to help\r\n\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, DPM Lee mentioned at the People's Association\r\n\r\nConference  that the Government is ready to do  more  and\r\n\r\ncommit more resources to help the unemployed.  It  is  to\r\n\r\nhelp  needy  Singaporeans get back on their  feet.   What\r\n\r\nwould  WDA do to better coordinate all the agencies,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  CDCs and NGOs, that provide employment services\r\n\r\nin  different locations?  Is there any plan and how would\r\n\r\nthe  WDA  further  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  these\r\n\r\nagencies to help Singaporeans?  Can MOM also confirm  the\r\n\r\nre-employment  rate  of our unemployed?   Does  WDA  have\r\n\r\nplans  to  help improve the chances of re-employment  for\r\n\r\nthe older workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also media reports that some training\r\n\r\nproviders abuse the Government's support.  Does WDA  have\r\n\r\nany   plan   to  ensure  effectiveness  of  funding   and\r\n\r\nrespective Government schemes to help the unemployed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SARS outbreak drew the whole country closer\r\n\r\nand taught us several lessons in overcoming difficulties.\r\n\r\nLet  us tackle the difficulties and challenges ahead with\r\n\r\nthe  same  spirit as we tackled SARS.  Our workforce  has\r\n\r\nbeen  ranked as the No. 1 workforce in the world.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that we will continue to stand tall as a little\r\n\r\nred  dot.   Let us continue to move ahead with a positive\r\n\r\nspirit and strong tripartite collaboration in making  our\r\n\r\neconomy more competitive and worker-friendly.  We have to\r\n\r\nmobilise  every  stakeholder  to  move  together   ahead.\r\n\r\nEmployers need to redesign jobs to produce higher  value-added  jobs so as to compete in a globalised marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe  companies, as corporate citizens, should play a more\r\n\r\nactive role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, looking back over the past 38 years  since\r\n\r\nour independence, Singapore has been able to successfully\r\n\r\nmould  its national human resource policy to provide  the\r\n\r\nneeded\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskills for each phase of our development.  Local training\r\n\r\ninstitutions  progressively  focus  on  technical  skills\r\n\r\ndevelopment   complemented   by   technology   transfers,\r\n\r\nwherever   necessary,  from  institutions  of  the   more\r\n\r\nadvanced countries.  Foreign corporations locating  their\r\n\r\noperations  here were provided with subsidies and  grants\r\n\r\nto set up training programmes which further propelled the\r\n\r\ngrowth of skills training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country then swiftly moved into higher value-added manufacturing. Education reform that emphasises on\r\n\r\ntechnical  and  vocational education  was  buttressed  by\r\n\r\nexpanding  our  polytechnics in response  to  the  demand\r\n\r\ncreated  by the variety of industries set up  here.   Our\r\n\r\nuniversities  too had to undergo transformation  both  in\r\n\r\nareas of curriculum as well as approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we are at the crossroads of charting our\r\n\r\nway to another phase of national development, efforts  to\r\n\r\nmake  our country a leading knowledge-based economy  will\r\n\r\ndemand  new learning and training approaches that  expect\r\n\r\nworkers to be innovative and creative.  With unemployment\r\n\r\nexpected  to  feature more prominently as we continue  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  the  economy, we  need  a  more  coordinated\r\n\r\neffort to help workers who are periodically displaced  to\r\n\r\nget  back  on  their feet and be absorbed back  into  the\r\n\r\nchanging economic landscape as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our past and current success in placing us at\r\n\r\nthe  forefront in an increasingly competitive  world  has\r\n\r\nbeen  our  ability to continually move up  the  education\r\n\r\nladder  and  create and produce a qualified, skilful  and\r\n\r\ncreative people.  To remain at the forefront, there is no\r\n\r\nother  way but to sustain these efforts of improving  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of education and skills training for our citizens.\r\n\r\nThis is the only way for us to keep abreast of and remain\r\n\r\nrelevant  in  the changing world.  As the  world  becomes\r\n\r\nincreasingly   borderless  with  knowledge,   technology,\r\n\r\ntalents   and  capital  moving  freely  across   regional\r\n\r\nboundaries, the need to develop the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotential  of  people to the highest possible  level  has\r\n\r\nbecome even more urgent.  This era rewards those who  are\r\n\r\nin  control of information with power and those  who  are\r\n\r\nthe  leading edge of technology with wealth.   Those  who\r\n\r\nhave  neither of the above are likely to be left  behind.\r\n\r\nConsidering  that our people are our only  resource,  our\r\n\r\nfuture   survivor  solely  depends  on  them.   We   must\r\n\r\ntherefore develop this resource as best as we can.  It is\r\n\r\nalso  the best approach to address the threat of  digital\r\n\r\ndivide which our society is increasingly being confronted\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the International Labour Organisation in its\r\n\r\nGeneral Conference Report of the 88th Session in the year\r\n\r\n2000 quoted:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A critical challenge that faces human society at\r\n\r\nthe   start  of  the  21st  Century  is  to  attain  full\r\n\r\nemployment  and  sustain economic growth  in  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy  and also social inclusivity.  As a country  that\r\n\r\nholds  the  principle  of  meritocracy  close  to  heart,\r\n\r\neducation  is  a crucial vehicle for our social  mobility\r\n\r\nand inclusivity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  phenomenon, with all its ramifications which I  just\r\n\r\nmentioned,  is  universal.  No country in  the  world  is\r\n\r\nspared  from  it.   More  and  more  countries  are   now\r\n\r\nrealising that lifelong learning is the key to  pave  the\r\n\r\nway for sustained employability of their citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I believe the formation of a one-stop\r\n\r\nagency, as proposed under this Bill, with a comprehensive\r\n\r\nrange of human capital development services will be  most\r\n\r\napt  to  develop and unleash the full potential of  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.   The amalgamation of functions,  which  are\r\n\r\nnow  scattered under various Ministries and  administered\r\n\r\nby  several statutory bodies, will provide the new agency\r\n\r\nwith  the  means  to  coordinate and orchestrate   worker\r\n\r\neducation,   skills  training  and  skills  redevelopment\r\n\r\nactivities  under  one  roof.  It should  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nlinkage of our workers to sources of expertise and assist\r\n\r\nthem  in  the most efficient manner as to enable each  of\r\n\r\nthem to make informed choices of what is best for them to\r\n\r\nenhance    their   employability   in   an   increasingly\r\n\r\nsophisticated economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from placing worker interests as the focal\r\n\r\npoint of the Workforce Development Agency's activities, I\r\n\r\nalso envision that this newly created central body\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill lead in restructuring and harmonising our workforce,\r\n\r\norganising  activities that create greater  awareness  of\r\n\r\nshifts  and  changes in our increasingly  knowledge-based\r\n\r\nand  technology-intensive economy, continually  assisting\r\n\r\nour  workforce  in identifying sectors and  job  families\r\n\r\nwhich  are  relevant  to Singapore's current  and  future\r\n\r\neconomic  needs, so that they can make informed decisions\r\n\r\nabout  career  choices and impressing upon the  workforce\r\n\r\nthat innovation and value creation are the way ahead  and\r\n\r\nthat focusing on these will reap the best rewards for all\r\n\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intertwined with all of these, Sir, is the subject\r\n\r\nof  lifelong learning.  I know much has been said on this\r\n\r\nsubject  in  this  House.  But  I  believe  it  is  worth\r\n\r\nreiterating this until its importance is ingrained in the\r\n\r\nminds  of every one of us.  In the current context  where\r\n\r\ncontinuous changes and uncertainty prevail and  represent\r\n\r\nthe  new normal, no country can ensure employment  and  a\r\n\r\njob for every one of its citizens.  The smarter countries\r\n\r\nare  rigorously  promoting lifelong learning  as  one  of\r\n\r\ntheir key agendas recognising that a highly educated  and\r\n\r\ntrained  workforce  leads to sustained  employability  of\r\n\r\ntheir  workforce.  It is a fact that countries  with  the\r\n\r\nhighest  incomes  are also those whose workers  are  most\r\n\r\neducated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist countries create a learning\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  the  International  Labour  Organisation\r\n\r\nintroduced the learning chain to enable a workforce adapt\r\n\r\nboth  to the demands of a knowledge society and the  need\r\n\r\nfor  an improved level and quality of employment.  In it,\r\n\r\nthe  state will have to develop the individual's learning\r\n\r\nabilities  by  offering opportunities  for  learning  and\r\n\r\ntraining  that are tailored to target groups at different\r\n\r\nstages of their lives, young people and unemployed adults\r\n\r\nand  workers  who  are  at risk of  seeing  their  skills\r\n\r\novertaken  by  rapid change.  This new approach  includes\r\n\r\nthree  main  components.  These are  the  development  of\r\n\r\nlocal  learning centres, the promotion of new skills,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, in information technologies, and increased\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransparency of qualifications.  This is where synergy of\r\n\r\npolicies  from our Ministries, such as the Ministries  of\r\n\r\nEducation,  Manpower and Trade and Industry, if  properly\r\n\r\ncoordinated,  could  help produce  a  workforce  that  is\r\n\r\ninformed  and  responsive to the changing  needs  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   Such  a multi-dimensional approach  will  also\r\n\r\nshowcase  our commitment that we, as a nation,  are  avid\r\n\r\npromoters of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a fast changing world, it does not take long\r\n\r\nfor  knowledge  and skills to get outdated very  quickly.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of new knowledge and technological advances\r\n\r\nthat  become  available in the public  domain  every  day\r\n\r\nmakes  it  difficult to keep up with what  is  going  on.\r\n\r\nUniversity  graduates  can expect that  even  their  most\r\n\r\nadvanced  technical knowledge can become  outdated  in  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  months.  Skilled workers need  to  constantly\r\n\r\nadapt  to  new products and techniques, bearing  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  some  careers do not even have a chance to  change.\r\n\r\nThey  simply  disappear.   We must  therefore  constantly\r\n\r\nretool  ourselves and become perpetual students, or  risk\r\n\r\nthe prospect of becoming obsolete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifelong learning is the only way to remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive and maintain our relevance in the job market.\r\n\r\nWorkers  must understand that they need to take  personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in  continually investing  in  their  own\r\n\r\ngrowth  development  and self-renewal,  like  the  way  a\r\n\r\nprogressive company invests in R&D and comes up with  new\r\n\r\nand  better  products or services it  can  offer.   One's\r\n\r\nfuture  employability and appeal as a job  candidate  now\r\n\r\ndepend  on  one's relentless drive to update credentials,\r\n\r\nacquire  new knowledge and skills and staying abreast  of\r\n\r\nwhat is happening in one's own field of expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many unemployed workers groan in not being able to\r\n\r\nfind  jobs  after  going for retraining or  learning  new\r\n\r\nskills.   Many of them feel that it is a wasteful effort.\r\n\r\nThis  perception  must  be quickly  corrected  before  it\r\n\r\nbecomes widespread.  Workers must realise that it is  the\r\n\r\nlow external demand which is not within our control\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  contributes to the current soft employment  market.\r\n\r\nThe   Ministry  of  Manpower  estimates  that  there  are\r\n\r\ncurrently   only  24  jobs  available   for   every   100\r\n\r\napplicants.   One  is  better off with  new  and  updated\r\n\r\nskills,  even  though he may not have a job now,  because\r\n\r\nonce  the  market turns, he will be the first to  benefit\r\n\r\nwith  the new skills in hand.  Make no mistake about  the\r\n\r\nrelevance of knowledge upgrading and reskilling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the process of formal education and training is\r\n\r\nprogressively becoming less of one passing on information\r\n\r\nbut more of an individual's learning to learn so that  he\r\n\r\ncan  discover  for himself.  The relevance  of  knowledge\r\n\r\nabout facts is diminishing while the need to learn how to\r\n\r\naccess, analyse and exploit information and transform  it\r\n\r\ninto  new  knowledge is increasing.  While I know  strong\r\n\r\nefforts are being made to impart such soft skills through\r\n\r\nprogrammes such as CREST, I feel more needs to  be  done,\r\n\r\nparticularly for our mature and older workers.   This  is\r\n\r\nthe  group that is most vulnerable to shifts and  changes\r\n\r\nin our economic structure and, therefore, they need to be\r\n\r\nmore   adequately  prepared  to  be  more  flexible   and\r\n\r\nresponsive to change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond any economic considerations, human\r\n\r\ncapital  development underpins the fundamental values  of\r\n\r\nsociety   -   equity,  justice,  gender  equality,   non-discrimination,  social responsibility and  participation\r\n\r\nof  all  in  economic  and social life.   Human  resource\r\n\r\ndevelopment   and   training   contribute   to   improved\r\n\r\nproductivity  in the economy, reduce skill mismatches  in\r\n\r\nthe  labour market, and promote a country's international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  all of which are vital  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nshort and long-term interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to my next and final point,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the current perception that foreign talent  and\r\n\r\nworkers are wresting away jobs from Singaporeans.  I know\r\n\r\nthis  has  been elaborated on by the Acting Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower  in this House yesterday, but I still feel  this\r\n\r\nis  a  subject worth revisiting.  Owing to our  smallness\r\n\r\nand lack of critical mass, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant for us to keep explaining to Singaporeans  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  tick efficiently  without  foreigners.\r\n\r\nThere are high-end jobs and economic activities where  we\r\n\r\nlack  or do not have the talent to fill, and low-end  and\r\n\r\ninconvenient jobs, such as garbage collection or rotating\r\n\r\nshift  work, where Singaporeans just do not want  to  do.\r\n\r\nWe  need  foreigners  to fill both of  these  categories.\r\n\r\nForeigners  are naturally attracted to the  opportunities\r\n\r\nwe  have created here because of the vacancies that  need\r\n\r\nto  be  filled.   Together with Singaporeans,  they  have\r\n\r\ncontributed to our development and progress.   They  have\r\n\r\nalso  contributed to making our pie bigger.  We can elbow\r\n\r\nthem  out,  but  that would mean that  we  too  would  be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  opportunities for bigger and higher  value-added jobs because multi-national companies with high-end\r\n\r\nactivities  will  not be able to locate their  operations\r\n\r\nhere  because  of  our  lack of talent.   Those  who  are\r\n\r\nalready  here,  especially those  with  capital-intensive\r\n\r\noperations,  such  as  the wafer fab  and  pharmaceutical\r\n\r\nindustries, will not be able to grow if they are deprived\r\n\r\nof  workers needed to run their business activities round\r\n\r\nthe clock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use the analogy of a soccer game to\r\n\r\nillustrate  my point.  As our nation of young footballers\r\n\r\nreadies itself for a game against the adept skills of  an\r\n\r\nestablished international team, there are but a few  ways\r\n\r\nto  come out the winner.  Using protectionist methods  by\r\n\r\nhaving  an  umpire that is biased or by  brute  force  to\r\n\r\ndefeat the opponent could get us a point or two, or  even\r\n\r\na  win,  but  not for too long.  The game's international\r\n\r\naudience would pick up on this, leaving us a team without\r\n\r\na  league  to  play  in.  By improving  our  skills  set,\r\n\r\nenhancing  our capabilities and gradually progressing  to\r\n\r\nthe  same level as our opponents, we earn the respect  of\r\n\r\nour peers and that of our competitors.  A soccer game  or\r\n\r\nan  8-hour  workday  will be more of  an  interaction  of\r\n\r\nminds,  ideas  and cultures, rather than the anticipation\r\n\r\nof  the final whistle.  We should not allow ourselves  to\r\n\r\nbe  unduly overcome by the present emotions arising  from\r\n\r\nthe  current state of unemployment and lose sight of  the\r\n\r\nbig picture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we need to move away from this issue,\r\n\r\nif I may call it a polarised \"dual workforce\".  By this I\r\n\r\nmean  our local workforce and foreign talents, especially\r\n\r\nin  the middle and middle to lower income brackets, which\r\n\r\noften  evolve  into  a sensitive topic  and  stir  heated\r\n\r\ndebates whenever we have an economic slowdown.  To strive\r\n\r\nto  amalgamate this \"dual workforce\" should be one of the\r\n\r\npriorities of this new agency.  By evolving to  a  single\r\n\r\nbracket  without  any differentiation between  local  and\r\n\r\nforeign workers, our workforce will signal the coming  of\r\n\r\nage,  where  the  need for employers to hire  beyond  our\r\n\r\nborders  would be purely for reasons of labour or  talent\r\n\r\nshortage, and not because specific skills cannot be found\r\n\r\nwithin our shores.  Employers could then focus solely  on\r\n\r\ngetting the best hands and minds for any job vacancy from\r\n\r\nan  existing pool where any employable resident  here  is\r\n\r\nconsidered equally.  It has to be borne in mind that  the\r\n\r\neconomy of tomorrow will be truly borderless, virtual, to\r\n\r\nsome  degree,  and driven by solutions and results.   Our\r\n\r\nchallenge  is  how  do  we build an inclusive  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhere    Singaporeans   and   foreign   residents   could\r\n\r\ncollectively  share a bigger and ever-growing  pie  which\r\n\r\nwill be win-win for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the ethos of this new Bill as the creation of\r\n\r\na  homogenous  workforce  in the  long  term,  comprising\r\n\r\nlocals  and  foreign  residents with  a  shared  goal  of\r\n\r\ncontributing  jointly  and effectively  to  our  nation's\r\n\r\ncontinued growth and prosperity.  I am confident that the\r\n\r\nstrategy  of  continually  improving  the  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining of our workforce will make us better prepared to\r\n\r\nconfront   the   challenges   of   globalisation,    cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of our businesses, and arrest the fear of\r\n\r\nunemployment in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support this Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, this Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nincorporate a public body to be named Singapore Workforce\r\n\r\nDevelopment Agency (SWDA), and to consolidate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin  the Agency the functions, properties, liabilities\r\n\r\nand employees of the departments within the Human Capital\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Division and the Labour  Market  Development\r\n\r\nDivision  of  the Ministry of Manpower,  and  the  Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  Secretariat,  the  Critical   Enabling\r\n\r\nSkills  Training  (CREST) Secretariat  and  the  National\r\n\r\nSkills   Recognition  System  (NSRS)   Centre,   of   the\r\n\r\nStandards, Productivity and Innovation Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exercise of consolidating various departments\r\n\r\ninto  one  corporation is in line with  the  Government's\r\n\r\noverall  policy  of  making all Government  organisations\r\n\r\nslim  and trim.  I am certain that with this new  Agency,\r\n\r\nproductivity  will go up.  But, at the same  time,  I  am\r\n\r\nalso  certain  that there shall also be  job  losses.   I\r\n\r\nwonder  what  the  unions have to say.  Have  the  unions\r\n\r\nliaised  with the Government to redeploy the workers  who\r\n\r\nmay  have  been  made  redundant  as  a  result  of  this\r\n\r\nexercise?   If  not, have the unions asked  for  adequate\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits for those workers  who  have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir jobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question uppermost in my mind is: will this\r\n\r\nexercise,  bringing  the various  departments  under  one\r\n\r\nroof,  so  to  speak, create benefits and  jobs  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers?  I would like to ask the Minister:  what  is  it\r\n\r\nunder the old set-up that the Government could not do  or\r\n\r\ndo  just  as  well as under this new Agency  when  it  is\r\n\r\nformed?  One would also ask: if the Government is  unable\r\n\r\nto  do  much for workers in the old set-up, what can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment achieve with this new Agency?  Some people may\r\n\r\nspeculate that under these difficult economic times,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  expected  to do  something  to  show  the\r\n\r\nworkers that it is concerned and is doing something.  But\r\n\r\nI  think  this  reorganisation exercise  of  transferring\r\n\r\nvarious   Government  departments  to   a   newly-created\r\n\r\nstatutory body shall not help the workers very much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing of names will not do much. It is a case of\r\n\r\ncalling a spade by another name.  How can calling a spade\r\n\r\nby  another  name increase the usefulness of  the  spade?\r\n\r\nYou  cannot.   A spade by any other name shall  remain  a\r\n\r\nspade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Bill itself, I see that its main\r\n\r\nthrust is to promote adult education and training.  As  a\r\n\r\nformer teacher, I can say that the promulgation of  adult\r\n\r\neducation by the Government is something not new  to  me.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has adult education programmes  from  the\r\n\r\nearly  days  since it came into power in  1959.   In  the\r\n\r\n1960s,  almost everyone then was familiar with the  adult\r\n\r\neducation  programme carried out by the  Government  body\r\n\r\ncommonly known as \"Lembaga\", which means \"institution\" or\r\n\r\n\"board\" in Malay.  The word \"Lembaga\" is a short form for\r\n\r\nthe  Adult Education Board.  In those days, it  was  more\r\n\r\nfashionable to use names of Government bodies  in  Malay.\r\n\r\nHence,  in  the early days, the Malay word \"Lembaga\"  was\r\n\r\nused,   and  not  its  proper  English  name,  the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board.\r\n\r\nAs  mentioned  earlier, the main function of  the  Agency\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  areas of adult continuing  education.   It\r\n\r\nwould   appear  that  the  Government's  adult  education\r\n\r\nprogramme  has come a full cycle. When the PAP came  into\r\n\r\npower,  it rightly embarked on a vigorous adult education\r\n\r\nprogramme  and after 38 years, when Singapore has  joined\r\n\r\nthe  ranks  of  the first world countries, we  are  still\r\n\r\nmaking  new laws to ensure that our adult workers  get  a\r\n\r\ndecent  education  and training. I hope  that  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  make  sure that this time round,  the  Government\r\n\r\ngets it right - to provide the right and meaningful adult\r\n\r\neducation to our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one issue which I am concerned is the\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against the older workers.  I  have  often\r\n\r\nheard  complaints  in  my  meet-the-people  sessions   by\r\n\r\nresidents who are 40 years old and above. They said  that\r\n\r\ntheir  applications  for  jobs  were  often  unsuccessful\r\n\r\nbecause the employers rejected their applications because\r\n\r\nthey  were too old.  These employers preferred to  employ\r\n\r\nyounger  workers.  I certainly want the  Minister  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething  against this current practice in Singapore  by\r\n\r\nemployers  who  discriminate against  older  workers.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge  the Minister to  pass  legislation\r\n\r\nagainst  discrimination of older workers.   If,  for  the\r\n\r\ntime being,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  is reluctant to do so, he  can  still  act\r\n\r\nagainst  employers  who  practise discrimination  against\r\n\r\nworkers  under  clause  11(1)(f) of  this  Bill  when  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  law.  I hope the Minister would do something  to\r\n\r\nprotect the older workers in the job market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong doubted the purpose  for\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of the Workforce  Development  Agency\r\n\r\n(WDA)   and   suspected  that  it  was  meant   for   the\r\n\r\nretrenchment of workers. As the Minister has pointed out,\r\n\r\nthere  are in fact a lot of jobs out there but not enough\r\n\r\npeople  with the relevant skills to fill them.   So,  the\r\n\r\nimportant  thing  is to find out how  to  get  the  right\r\n\r\npeople  for  the  right  post.   He  commented  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Manpower should \"call a spade a spade\". This\r\n\r\nis  not old wine in a new bottle.  It is an entirely  new\r\n\r\nagency. We want our people to change their mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers should learn not to be too choosy with\r\n\r\nthe  jobs  offered to them.     In the old  days,  people\r\n\r\nused  to  say that you could die but you should not  lose\r\n\r\nface. Now, I would say, \"Losing face is not going to kill\r\n\r\nyou.  It is only when you can no longer breathe that  you\r\n\r\nwould die!\"  No doubt, nowadays, it is difficult to  find\r\n\r\njobs,  and many people have different perspectives  about\r\n\r\nit.  The workers who are retrenched, especially the older\r\n\r\nworkers, think retrenchment means the end of the road  to\r\n\r\nthem. The employers, on the other hand, lament that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  get  enough  workers with  the  right  skills  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy their demand. Each has his own perspective on the\r\n\r\nmatter. Mr Chiam See Tong too has his own perspective and\r\n\r\nhis own way of looking at this.  The establishment of WDA\r\n\r\nis a way to help the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister said that he wanted to first\r\n\r\ntake  immediate  action to help certain  sectors  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers.  That gives hope to the people. If  the  workers\r\n\r\nfeel that the Minister is not taking any action, then  it\r\n\r\nis no good.  I agree that some immediate action should be\r\n\r\ntaken\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  help the workers and the industry. We must share  the\r\n\r\nexperience with the various industries and help  to  work\r\n\r\nout  programmes  to  train the workers.  We  should  also\r\n\r\nencourage the  companies to re-engineer their work,  help\r\n\r\nthe workers phase into their new jobs and improve methods\r\n\r\nof  working.   This will ensure that we transit  smoothly\r\n\r\ninto  the  new economy.   We should look at  how  we  can\r\n\r\nredesign the work so that we have the right workers to do\r\n\r\nthe right work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to point out is that we must\r\n\r\nreshape  the image of some of our workers.  In the  past,\r\n\r\nsome  people have a set frame of mind for their work.  We\r\n\r\nshould  change that image.  In the past, some  jobs  were\r\n\r\ntraditionally done only by women. This need  not  be  the\r\n\r\ncase. Men could also do them.  For example, when you talk\r\n\r\nabout telephone operators, the first thing that comes  to\r\n\r\nmind  is the sweet female voice that says, \"Hello!\"  But,\r\n\r\ncome  to  think of it, what is wrong with a rich baritone\r\n\r\nvoice saying the same thing?  Why can the job not be done\r\n\r\nby men as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is taxi-driver. It is traditionally\r\n\r\nconceived that taxi-driving is a man's job.  When a  taxi\r\n\r\ndrives up and one finds a woman at the driver's seat, the\r\n\r\nimmediate reaction is inevitably that, \"Wah! Woman  taxi-driver!\"  What  is  wrong with a woman  driving  a  taxi?\r\n\r\nLikewise,  in  the  past,  all trishaw  riders  were  old\r\n\r\npeople, who spat everywhere. But now we see young  people\r\n\r\nin  colourful  batik shirts, armed with  a  walkman,  and\r\n\r\nhappily  riding  the  trishaw and  speaking  in  English,\r\n\r\nJapanese  or Korean to the European, Japanese  or  Korean\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, even hawker food was divided along\r\n\r\ndialect lines.  The Teochew people would be selling  kway\r\n\r\nteow;  the  Hokkien  would sell fried  noodles  or  prawn\r\n\r\nnoodles  while the Hainanese would sell chicken rice.   I\r\n\r\nthink  such division is no longer found among the various\r\n\r\ndialect  groups  in Singapore nowadays.   This  has  been\r\n\r\nextended beyond ethnic groups.  For\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample, satay was typically a Malay food but now we  see\r\n\r\njust  as many Chinese hawkers selling satay too!  We even\r\n\r\nfind  Indians singing in the Chinese wayang stage  during\r\n\r\nthe  \"Hungry Ghost\" festival. There is nothing wrong with\r\n\r\nall this integration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the WDA would have some very creative\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  so that they can change the  mindset  of\r\n\r\nthese workers. So long as they are willing to work,  they\r\n\r\nshould be able to do it.  If they cannot do it, we  would\r\n\r\nhelp them to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on adult education, Mr Chiam mentioned Lembaga.\r\n\r\nI  learnt  Malay  from  Lembaga (Adult  Education  Board)\r\n\r\nduring  my younger days, and now I can converse  with  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots in Malay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long term, it is important that we place\r\n\r\nmore  emphasis on adult education.  It is not the Lembaga\r\n\r\nof  the  old days. We want to help our workers learn  new\r\n\r\nskills.  That is an important point.  It is said that  if\r\n\r\nwe have a skill, we can be employed forever.  Now we need\r\n\r\nto be multi-skilled so that we have better employability.\r\n\r\nWe  could  also  think of the ways in  which  the  adults\r\n\r\nlearn. We should make it easier for the adult workers  to\r\n\r\nlearn  by  tailoring the learning to suit their aptitude.\r\n\r\nThis  way, we can encourage the older workers to continue\r\n\r\nlearning,  and  acquiring new skills, so  that  they  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be employable. It is not a matter  of  \"just\r\n\r\nsitting there and waiting to die\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the short term, of course, we\r\n\r\nsee many people are unemployed.  If we can encourage them\r\n\r\nto  be less choosy and take up jobs that are available to\r\n\r\nthem, we would have succeeded 50% already.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This is in order that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nworkforce  of today can stay relevant and competitive  in\r\n\r\nthe  harsh new global economy, dominated by rapid changes\r\n\r\nand a new work order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a step in the right direction in\r\n\r\naddressing   an  array  of  heart-tugging   events   like\r\n\r\nretrenchments  and  announcements on restructurings  that\r\n\r\nhave  been advocated in recent months.  These range  from\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring  to  wage  restructuring  to  CPF\r\n\r\nrestructuring    and    pre-emptive    layoffs.     These\r\n\r\nrestructurings  are  like dosages of medicine  that  have\r\n\r\ncome one after another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans feel rather sedated by these continual\r\n\r\ndosages of medication for the economic ills that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  through.  At the same time, they also look forward\r\n\r\nto  recover  before the next dosage.  As a reprieve  from\r\n\r\nthe  over dosage, hopefully, this Bill will give a breath\r\n\r\nof  fresh air to Singaporeans and a sense of hope for the\r\n\r\nlong haul.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of revitalising and promoting\r\n\r\ncontinuing   adult  education  and  training,  employment\r\n\r\nfacilitation and developing the HR industry through  best\r\n\r\npractices in human capital management in an ever changing\r\n\r\noperating  environment, I would like to put forward  some\r\n\r\nsuggestions   for   consideration   to   facilitate   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constantly changing operating environment means\r\n\r\nskills  and  knowledge get obsolete  at  a  faster  pace,\r\n\r\nmaking  it  necessary  to unlearn, relearn,  reskill  and\r\n\r\npursue upgrading in skills and knowledge.  It calls for a\r\n\r\ndrastic  change  in mindset for both the  individual  and\r\n\r\nemployer.   This is a sure way for Singaporeans  to  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  employable, and  for  businesses  to  stay\r\n\r\nviable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I envisage that such an Agency will contribute\r\n\r\nto  the  economic progress of Singapore and help build  a\r\n\r\nskilled, adaptable, enterprising and resilient workforce.\r\n\r\nOf  particular importance is the Agency's quick  response\r\n\r\nto  facilitate  employment  for  the  unemployed  and  to\r\n\r\npartner  the  human  capital professional  institutes  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  promulgate best practices in human  capital\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we embark on this journey of re-making our\r\n\r\nworkforce,  it  is important to nurture and  enhance  not\r\n\r\nonly  a  pro  workforce development culture but  also  to\r\n\r\ninculcate   an  adaptable  mindset,  not  only   in   the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workforce, but also in business  owners  and\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent press sentiments, for example, the\r\n\r\narticle  in Today, 8th August 2003, headlined  \"Too  many\r\n\r\nstatutory boards spoil the show\", implied that businesses\r\n\r\nand  people  are  not benefiting from  the  70  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  in  Singapore.  The article argues that Singapore\r\n\r\ncan do with less of such regulatory bodies in order to be\r\n\r\nnimble, proactive and quick-thinking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the new statutory board has its roles to play,\r\n\r\nit  is  therefore important to dispel some of  the  mixed\r\n\r\nfeelings  and  the  notion that the  creation  of  a  new\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  would add costs  and  inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nbuilding up our manpower capability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I would advocate that clarity of vision and\r\n\r\noutcomes  arising from the establishment of the  SWDA  be\r\n\r\nproperly articulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the functions, duties and powers of SWDA are\r\n\r\nwell  defined.   What  is  more  important  for  the  new\r\n\r\nstatutory board to evolve, in the implementation  process\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach of the functions, is transparency in respect of  the\r\n\r\ninformation and data the public needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important from the point of view of the\r\n\r\nbenefits  that  Singapore and Singaporeans  would  derive\r\n\r\nfrom  an integrated continual adult education and further\r\n\r\ntraining   infrastructure  that  incorporates   effective\r\n\r\nemployment facilitation and creation of jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a pro workforce development culture must be\r\n\r\ninculcated   to  spur  on  the  further  development   of\r\n\r\ncontinual  adult  education and further training  of  our\r\n\r\nSingaporean workforce.  I am therefore happy to note that\r\n\r\nthe SWDA will put in place, support and infrastructure to\r\n\r\nprovide  the necessary funds/incentives, and will  induce\r\n\r\nemployers and manpower development players to collaborate\r\n\r\nin initiatives and measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, can the SWDA seek ways to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the  weaker  segments,  the  unemployed  and   the\r\n\r\neconomically  inactive population, of the  workforce  are\r\n\r\nhelped   to   level  up  their  knowledge,   skills   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  to  ensure them  of  equal  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SWDA has many challenges and issues to\r\n\r\novercome.  For example, in the area of unequal employment\r\n\r\nopportunities,  can  the  SWDA  muscle   in   to   remove\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  practices  in  employment,  promote   the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  the mature workforce,  especially  in  an\r\n\r\nageing  population, promote innovative and new  workplace\r\n\r\npractices, flexi-work arrangements and family-friendly HR\r\n\r\npolicies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the SWDA needs to provide\r\n\r\ndirections  to support a work culture that, for  example,\r\n\r\ndoes   away   with  retirement  age  because  an   ageing\r\n\r\npopulation dictates a need for financial independence and\r\n\r\ncareer options through continuous working.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill should throw light on how the SWDA would\r\n\r\nfocus on a healthy and productive workforce among the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmature  workforce  and  how to incentivise  employers  to\r\n\r\nprovide  jobs to the mature workforce.  Perhaps a  higher\r\n\r\nfunding  mechanism  or tax incentives for  employers  who\r\n\r\ninvest  on  further training and who employ  more  mature\r\n\r\nworkforce,  can  tip the scale towards  being  pro-mature\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an adaptable mindset for both the\r\n\r\nindividual  and  the organisation calls for  an  attitude\r\n\r\nthat  will go the extra mile to acquire the aptitude that\r\n\r\nwill ultimately determine the altitude of attainment  and\r\n\r\nsuccess.   In other words, so long as there  is  a  right\r\n\r\nmindset  with relevant skills, Singaporeans will overcome\r\n\r\nand prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am hopeful that employers will also look into\r\n\r\njob re-design to facilitate the employability of the less\r\n\r\nskilled  mature employees.  I am pleased to know  that  a\r\n\r\ncareer  counselling service is being  considered  by  the\r\n\r\nSWDA to help the job seekers.  Similarly, I would like to\r\n\r\nurge that this be expanded to provide a proactive service\r\n\r\nto employers to assure them that the retrenched employees\r\n\r\nare not necessarily bad hats.  And employers with jobs to\r\n\r\noffer  should  not  shun them.  A dedicated  match-making\r\n\r\nrole  may  be adopted by SWDA, so that it can  assist  to\r\n\r\nchange the perception that the unemployed retrenched  are\r\n\r\nmarginal performers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having followed the recent discourse on the\r\n\r\nparticipation of our local residents in the newly created\r\n\r\njobs,  I would like to offer this humble opinion:   There\r\n\r\nare  non-exportable  service jobs in  the  local  retail,\r\n\r\nhairdressing, hotel and horticulture sectors.  There  are\r\n\r\njobs  as  drivers  in the local transport  and  logistics\r\n\r\nindustry.  There are jobs as nurses, care attendants  and\r\n\r\ntechnicians  in healthcare and medical welfare  industry.\r\n\r\nThese  jobs  command quite decent salaries  ranging  from\r\n\r\n$1,500 to $2,000 and they are performed by a large number\r\n\r\nof non-local residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not be perceived well in these difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.  It would seem to me that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  of the more urgent tasks for SWDA is to increase the\r\n\r\nparticipation rate of Singaporeans in these jobs that are\r\n\r\nmostly filled by non-residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also other lower-end jobs that\r\n\r\nare  not  filled  because they are paid ridiculously  low\r\n\r\nrates,  eg,  jobs  in the construction and  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsectors,  which  explain the low number  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndoing these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another observation is the need for a national\r\n\r\ndatabank  on  jobs  and on the unemployed  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\ntogether   with   a  breakdown  in  terms   of   sectors,\r\n\r\nindustries, executives and non-executive types.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to   reiterate  the  points  of  my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  that the perception on the ground  indeed  is\r\n\r\nthat foreigners are taking away the jobs from locals, and\r\n\r\nthat policy makers are not listening because they are not\r\n\r\nexperiencing  the  pain  that  Singaporeans   are   going\r\n\r\nthrough.   We need to change this perception.  A national\r\n\r\ndata  bank  will  allow a more dedicated approach  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a good start would be to review the\r\n\r\nstatistics collected under the Labour Force Survey.   Are\r\n\r\nthere  other  statistics which need to  be  compiled  and\r\n\r\npresented so that researchers and the public can be  more\r\n\r\ndiscerning in using the statistics for studies,  analysis\r\n\r\nand policy formulation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to dwell on several questions\r\n\r\nthat I have with regard to the provisos in the Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How does the transfer of the Human Capital\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Division and  the Labour Market  Development\r\n\r\nDivision from the Ministry of Manpower to the new Agency,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the transfer of the SDF Secretariat,  the\r\n\r\nCREST  Secretariat, and the NSRS Centre of SPRING  better\r\n\r\nhelp  achieve  the  objectives of the Government  in  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  workforce training and  development?  What\r\n\r\nsynergies  will  be  gained by  placing  them  under  the\r\n\r\nauspices of the new Agency?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) One of the new Agency's mandate is to expand\r\n\r\nindustry-focused CET development.  Does this mean that it\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneglect  more  generic  skills, like  general  management\r\n\r\nskills,   human  resource  skills,  and  basic   computer\r\n\r\nliteracy  to the workforce in general? Furthermore,  what\r\n\r\nsteps  will the new Agency take to ensure that  there  is\r\n\r\nthe integration of industry needs with that of curriculum\r\n\r\ndevelopment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Some of the industry sectors targeted by the\r\n\r\nproposed  new  Agency  already has  established  training\r\n\r\nproviders.   For  example,  there  is  SHATEC  in   hotel\r\n\r\nindustry,   Nanyang  Polytechnic  in  the   health   care\r\n\r\nindustry,  and  so on. How will these training  providers\r\n\r\nbenefit   from  the  development  of  CET   systems   and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure?  Will there be duplicated development and\r\n\r\nhow  can  resources  be streamlined and  optimally  used?\r\n\r\nWill  the new Agency help new training providers come  to\r\n\r\nthe  fore to offer new and better training programmes  to\r\n\r\nindustry players?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In view of the relatively high percentage of\r\n\r\nunemployed  executives, professionals and managers,  what\r\n\r\nare some of the initiatives and programmes that will help\r\n\r\nthem  to cushion their existing plight?  What plans  does\r\n\r\nSWDA  have to continue with existing programmes  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  career  placement and workskills training programmes\r\n\r\nthat have proven to be of benefit to the white-collar job\r\n\r\nseekers.   What  plans  does SWDA  have  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nexisting   employment  facilitation  infrastructure   and\r\n\r\neffort  rendered  by  the CDCs, SPEC  and  the  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) What plans does the SWDA have for the Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP) in general, in terms of the\r\n\r\nnumber of training places by industries, types and  jobs?\r\n\r\nWhat improvements or refined work would the SWDA make  in\r\n\r\nterms of the often expressed sentiments that Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntend to go through many cycles of retraining because  the\r\n\r\ntraining is free and they are reluctant to take  up  jobs\r\n\r\nfor which they have been trained for?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In view of the high number of unemployed and\r\n\r\ntheir  lack of labour market skills and knowledge,  would\r\n\r\nthe  SWDA  consider  extending the  life  and  workskills\r\n\r\nprogrammes as they are serving a critical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed under the current high unemployment situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the important point is that we have to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  those  who have gone for retraining will eventually\r\n\r\ntake  up jobs offered to them.  A monitoring system  that\r\n\r\nwill   penalise   those  who  decline  job   offers   and\r\n\r\nincentivise  those  who  retain  their  jobs  should   be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Some important industry sectors seem to be\r\n\r\nmissing from the ones targeted for help and for action by\r\n\r\nthe  Agency,  for  example,  the  financial  sector,  the\r\n\r\neducation  sector,  information  technology,  the   media\r\n\r\nsector,  and  the  arts sector.  Would  the  Agency  also\r\n\r\nconsider working closely with executives in these sectors\r\n\r\nto ensure that their training needs are provided for, and\r\n\r\nthat there is sufficient choice out there for people  who\r\n\r\nwant to pursue further adult education in these sectors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) In involving itself with employment\r\n\r\nfacilitation, can the Agency elaborate on how the  Agency\r\n\r\nwill  integrate and streamline with the self-help groups,\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs and the MOM CareerLink Distributed Centres such\r\n\r\nthat  we will not see duplication of resources?  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nhas been confusing to Singaporeans.  Many who are looking\r\n\r\nfor   simple  information  or  answer  feel  that   their\r\n\r\nexperience is like looking for a needle in the  haystack.\r\n\r\nWe need to be clear on who is in charge of what and where\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can go to to look for this service provider.\r\n\r\nWDA needs to be clear here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask the Minister on the basis and\r\n\r\ncriteria for the composition of the members of the  Board\r\n\r\nof  Directors of the Agency?  The Minister has cited rich\r\n\r\ndiverse  experience of the Board that he has  identified.\r\n\r\nBut  we  would  like  to  know more  specifics  on  these\r\n\r\ncriteria.  There are a number of credible employer groups\r\n\r\nand  professional bodies with resources that the WDA  can\r\n\r\ntap   on.   Combined,  these  institutions  represent   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  number  of companies and professionals  that\r\n\r\ndeal with human capital issues as their main\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness.  In my opinion, the Agency would have much more\r\n\r\nto gain to have them on the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the Agency incorporating my\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  On this note, I would like to  support  the\r\n\r\npassing of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  fully support the Bill for the formation of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Workforce Development Agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a trade unionist, I am deeply concerned and\r\n\r\ninvolved  in workers' training.  I am very glad  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  now  have a Government agency that would look  into\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading, training and retraining of our workers\r\n\r\n-  the  only natural resource of the nation.  It is  very\r\n\r\ntimely  and  appropriate  under  the  current  industrial\r\n\r\nenvironment  where  workers  need  to  keep   pace   with\r\n\r\ntechnological  changes and the structural change  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  It would also add emphasis on the importance of\r\n\r\ntraining  and  retraining of workers  to  the  employers.\r\n\r\nAnd,  especially  now, Sir, when we are  experiencing  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  retrenchment  of  workers  in  the  various\r\n\r\nindustrial  sectors, the relevance and  urgency  to  have\r\n\r\nsuch an Agency is very obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to outline some of the areas that\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Agency would give additional attention  when\r\n\r\ncarrying out its functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provide training for older workers on jobs that\r\n\r\nare available in the industry and suit their age profile;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Identify needed skills in the various industries and\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities for multi-skill training  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers which would enhance their employability;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To equip professionals and executives with relevant\r\n\r\nskills needed for the emerging economy;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Explore the possibility of providing entrepreneurial\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;training;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Collaborate with the training providers, adult\r\n\r\neducation agencies and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers  to  formulate a training schedule  that  would\r\n\r\nsuit  and  allow  the shift workers  to  be  trained  and\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills and potential.  In  this  respect,\r\n\r\nSir; I wish to say that this has been a perennial problem\r\n\r\nfor the shift workers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) To explore the possibility of setting up a database\r\n\r\nwith  information  on  the structural  and  technological\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  employment and business sectors,  which\r\n\r\ncould  be  used  as  a guideline in formulating  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  would  suit  the  requirement  of   the\r\n\r\nindustries  and hence the employability of  the  workers.\r\n\r\nEmployers  have a greater role to play in  this  respect,\r\n\r\nwith the unions helping to motivate the workers to accept\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most important challenge facing us today is\r\n\r\nthe  plight  of  the  low income  workers.   Despite  the\r\n\r\naffluence  that we seem to see around us, we  still  have\r\n\r\napproximately  400,000  workers with  low  education  and\r\n\r\nskills and amongst them, there are quite a number earning\r\n\r\njust above the poverty line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need persistent efforts and find innovative\r\n\r\nways  to  help  these  groups of  workers,  who  are  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, to break out of the poverty trap and  to  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  have  a stake in the economic progress  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.    Macro-level  policy  of  providing   training\r\n\r\nfacilities  and subsidies alone will not be effective  to\r\n\r\nthese  workers.  A much more holistic approach is needed,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  providing skills training during working  hours\r\n\r\nand make provision so that family commitment will not  be\r\n\r\na  stumbling block for them to go for training.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that a special task force be set up  within  the\r\n\r\nAgency  to  address this problem not only  at  the  macro\r\n\r\nlevel but also at the individual worker's level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before concluding, I wish to also highlight\r\n\r\nanother  issue of work redesigning.  This has  become  an\r\n\r\nimportant  issue with the number of retrenchments  taking\r\n\r\nplace and the number of Singaporeans out of work.  I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Agency  will  give  its due  consideration  for  job\r\n\r\nredesigning and retraining of workers so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans could take up jobs currently  done  by\r\n\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for this Agency to succeed in its mission, I\r\n\r\ncall  upon the employers to play a greater role and  give\r\n\r\nevery  assistance  and  adopt  a  proactive  approach  to\r\n\r\nworkers' training and retraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Agency must set up certain targets for\r\n\r\nitself,  otherwise it will be just words and  statements.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would  like  the Agency to come up  with  targets,\r\n\r\nespecially for the 400,000 workers who have below Primary\r\n\r\n6 education and low-skilled.  They should set up targets,\r\n\r\nand  after one year, in this House, we should take  stock\r\n\r\nof  what  the Agency has done for such workers.  Then  we\r\n\r\nwill be really approaching the problem head-on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, I would like to focus\r\n\r\non  two  vulnerable groups which need particular help  to\r\n\r\ncope  with the ongoing economic restructuring.   The  two\r\n\r\ngroups are women and older workers, especially those with\r\n\r\nlower skills.  I would like to urge the WDA to factor  in\r\n\r\ntheir concerns in their planning and programmes.  Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the women. Women, especially those above 40,\r\n\r\ntend  to  be hit harder by economic restructuring because\r\n\r\nof  their  relatively lower level of skills.   They  also\r\n\r\ntend  to  be  more concentrated in sectors  sensitive  to\r\n\r\ninternational demand conditions, such as the  retail  and\r\n\r\ntravel-related sectors, and in production jobs which  are\r\n\r\nmigrating  to  cheaper locations.  Women are  also  over-represented in clerical and administration jobs and  they\r\n\r\nare often the first targets of downsizing measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another trend: employers are more and more looking\r\n\r\nfor  workers  who  are willing to do shift  work  in  the\r\n\r\nevening, late night or weekends.  Women find it  hard  to\r\n\r\ntake on these shifts and these demanding jobs because  of\r\n\r\ntheir family responsibilities.  They have to go home  and\r\n\r\ntake care of their children or their ageing parents.   It\r\n\r\nis especially hard for divorced women and widows who have\r\n\r\nto support their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren, and also single women who have to support their\r\n\r\nageing parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason - their family commitments - these women find it hard to enrol for skills upgrading\r\n\r\ncourses.   They  have not gone for training  not  because\r\n\r\nthey  do not want to or because they do not see the  need\r\n\r\nfor  it,  but because they need to go home after work  to\r\n\r\ncare for their family.  As a result, these women are left\r\n\r\neither  without a job, or with a low-wage and low-skilled\r\n\r\njob with little prospects of improvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it harder for them, there is also the\r\n\r\nprevailing  notion that women are secondary earners  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, perceived to be more dispensable in the labour\r\n\r\nmarket.   At the same time, more and more, we  see  women\r\n\r\nneeding  to  join the labour force to help  maintain  the\r\n\r\nhousehold,  especially  when their  husbands  are  losing\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.  And, more and more, we see women with  low-skilled jobs being haunted by job uncertainty.  Just last\r\n\r\nnight, it came to my attention that two sisters, in their\r\n\r\n40s  and 50s, lost their jobs over one weekend.  That was\r\n\r\na big blow to their family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to make it easier for women to take up\r\n\r\nthe  job  opportunities and to stay  employable.   It  is\r\n\r\nespecially  important  for  women  to  work  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible  as they have a longer life expectancy  and  may\r\n\r\nnot  have  enough savings for their old age.   But  these\r\n\r\nwomen  may  face  work and training  barriers  that  have\r\n\r\nnothing to do with their attitudes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big barrier for women, especially the low-skilled\r\n\r\nwomen,  is  the  lack  of  good  quality  yet  affordable\r\n\r\nchildcare arrangements.  The long-term solution  to  this\r\n\r\nproblem   is   to   supply   more  affordable   childcare\r\n\r\nfacilities.   But in the short-term, we can  help  reduce\r\n\r\nthis  barrier by providing a childcare subsidy  to  women\r\n\r\nwho  take  on training courses and need to find childcare\r\n\r\narrangements for their children.  The subsidy should  end\r\n\r\nwhen the training course ends.  This childcare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubsidy  should be incorporated into the training package\r\n\r\nfor  low-skilled  women, and perhaps also  for  women  in\r\n\r\ngeneral.    Such  a  scheme  would  help  support   skill\r\n\r\ndevelopment and the labour force participation of women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, women are a resilient lot. In the past, when\r\n\r\nfaced  with hard times, women would on their own  go  out\r\n\r\nand hawk food.  They would set up shop to cater food from\r\n\r\nhome.  But these days, such jobs are no longer available.\r\n\r\nIt  requires a heavy investment upfront to get  a  hawker\r\n\r\nstall and just to run a little shop at home to sell  food\r\n\r\nrequires  getting  different licences from  the  relevant\r\n\r\nagencies.   They need training and help to negotiate  the\r\n\r\nmore  complex self-employment landscape today.  While  we\r\n\r\nare  integrating the different bodies into a new  agency,\r\n\r\nthere is also a need to integrate our economic and social\r\n\r\nagendas  and  not  see this as a MCDS problem  or  a  CDC\r\n\r\nproblem.   It  is also a MOM problem.  We want  women  to\r\n\r\nwork  and  upgrade  their skills,  and  yet  raise  their\r\n\r\nfamilies as the primary caregivers.  We do not want  them\r\n\r\nto  rely too much on foreign maids, yet we want women  to\r\n\r\nhave  more children.  At the same time, we lecture  women\r\n\r\nwhen  we see that they do not want to take shift work  or\r\n\r\nwork overtime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the new Agency to take responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  developing  a strategic plan for women's  employment\r\n\r\nand  training,  taking into account the women's  role  as\r\n\r\nprimary  carers  at home and also their  qualities.   The\r\n\r\nproper  infrastructure and facilities should  be  put  in\r\n\r\nplace so that they can take part in the labour market and\r\n\r\nall the opportunities that will be created.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Agency should also be the lead agency in the\r\n\r\ndrive  towards  more  flexible working  arrangements  and\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on older workers. We continue to hear, until\r\n\r\ntoday, complaints from older workers that they could  not\r\n\r\nfind  a  job  because of their age.  I think many  of  my\r\n\r\nfellow  MPs  have  raised this and the  Government  often\r\n\r\ncites  the  People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme  as  an\r\n\r\nexample of what has been done to help\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  workers  above  40.  I know the  statistics.   The\r\n\r\nprogramme  has  helped almost 12,000 older  workers  find\r\n\r\njobs.   But  this is actually a small drop in the  ocean.\r\n\r\nSomehow,  talking to older workers, they do not see  this\r\n\r\nscheme  as  helping  them.   And  so  they  continue   to\r\n\r\ncomplain.   Perhaps this is because of ignorance,  or  it\r\n\r\ncould  also  reflect the limitations of this  scheme.   I\r\n\r\nwould urge the WDA to embark on the kind of exercise that\r\n\r\nthe   Education  Ministry  did  to  change  the  public's\r\n\r\nperception  of  the  Institute  of  Technical   Education\r\n\r\n(ITEs), that is, to invite MPs and grassroots leaders and\r\n\r\nthe  media  to  visit companies which  support  the  PJTP\r\n\r\nscheme  and see for themselves how useful it has been  in\r\n\r\nhelping  older  workers.  Otherwise, the scepticism  will\r\n\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Agency should work with the\r\n\r\nrelevant agencies, including the labour movement, to push\r\n\r\nthe  effort  to  redesign jobs for older workers  and  to\r\n\r\ncreate better working conditions for them.  We talk about\r\n\r\nupgrading the skills of workers but it must go in  tandem\r\n\r\nwith upgrading the conditions at work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know one beehoon factory in Defu Lane which hires\r\n\r\nabout  50  workers, and most of the workers are above  45\r\n\r\nand lower-educated.  They are still short of workers.  In\r\n\r\nthis  factory, all the workers are lined  up  in  a  row.\r\n\r\nThey  blow-dry,  cut and pack the beehoon.   I  know  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  and so the unemployed residents that  come  to\r\n\r\nsee  me and beg for a job, I will just refer them to this\r\n\r\nemployer of the beehoon factory.  When they come  to  me,\r\n\r\nthey  always  tell me, \"I will do the job.  Any  job  you\r\n\r\ngive  me  I will do.  I am that desperate.\"  But  at  the\r\n\r\nbeehoon  factory, none stayed beyond  a  few  days.   The\r\n\r\nreason:  the factory has no air-condition.  It cannot  be\r\n\r\nair-conditioned,  the  employer  tells  me,  because  the\r\n\r\nbeehoon  cannot  be damp before sealing.   He  said  that\r\n\r\nfactories  in  the region are also without  air-condition\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of packing the beehoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the one hand, we cannot expect Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwho  are used to a certain comfort, to go and work  in  a\r\n\r\nsweatshop.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut,  on the other hand, I think we need to try and  help\r\n\r\nthese  workers  by  helping SMEs to upgrade  the  working\r\n\r\nconditions to see how they can fit the environment around\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It is like you have been for a  long  time\r\n\r\ntrying  to  smash  a  round peg into a  square  hole  and\r\n\r\ngetting really frustrated at this round peg.  Why  is  it\r\n\r\nnot  fitting?   But I think we should also  look  at  the\r\n\r\nsquare hole and see whether we can make it more round and\r\n\r\nif  we  can find a mid-way to meet the two.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  must moderate the expectations of workers,  of\r\n\r\ncourse.   But  I  think  SMEs  especially  need  help  to\r\n\r\nredesign  the jobs and upgrade the working conditions  so\r\n\r\nthat Singaporeans can take on those jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour movement is now working with 50\r\n\r\nemployers to redesign jobs and is working hard behind the\r\n\r\nscenes.  I urge the WDA to promote the need for more  job\r\n\r\nredesigning among more employers so that we can have more\r\n\r\njobs created for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about creating jobs for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   I just want to add one last  point  about\r\n\r\nthis  issue.   I hope that in the process of  emphasising\r\n\r\nthe  need to create more jobs for Singaporeans  -  and  I\r\n\r\nsupport  this fully  -  we would not send a wrong  signal\r\n\r\nto  foreigners  that they are not welcomed in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  we  keep on saying that, yes,  we  are  only\r\n\r\ncreating jobs for Singaporeans, if I were a bright kid in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, China, India or Australia, I would think  twice\r\n\r\nabout  coming  to  Singapore  to  study.   Because  after\r\n\r\ngraduating,  will I find a job or will  the  priority  or\r\n\r\npreference be given to Singaporeans?  It would affect  my\r\n\r\ndecision whether to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that, while it is populist and perhaps\r\n\r\nsounds very good to say that we only want to create  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans, we must also be careful about  sending\r\n\r\nthe right signal.  Because foreigners who come here, they\r\n\r\ndo  help Singapore to grow, and eventually, some of  them\r\n\r\nmay  strike  roots  and  become  Singaporeans   -    like\r\n\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  another group of workers.  According to  MOM's\r\n\r\nLabour   Market  Report  for  the  first   quarter,   job\r\n\r\nretrenchment is fast extending beyond the older and  less\r\n\r\neducated  to include better educated, mid-career workers.\r\n\r\nThis   is   reflected  by  statistics  that   show   that\r\n\r\nprofessionals, managers, executives and technicians  form\r\n\r\n43%, the largest group of locals retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two other significant pieces of information in\r\n\r\nthis  Report  bear  out further the changing  profile  of\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.  One third of those retrenched  were\r\n\r\neither  degree or diploma holders. And 60% of  those  who\r\n\r\nlost  their jobs were people in their 30s and 40s.  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  this.  Degree and diploma  holders  are\r\n\r\npeople  the State has invested most heavily in over  many\r\n\r\nyears  through  our  education  system.   Those  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed in their 30s and 40s are people in  the  prime\r\n\r\nof  their  lives.  Many with heavy financial  commitments\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty in seeing through when they  lose  their\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more alarming is the difficulty with\r\n\r\nwhich  these  people can find new jobs.  In general,  re-employment  prospects for all those who lose  their  jobs\r\n\r\nhave deteriorated in the past few months.  Around half of\r\n\r\nthose  retrenched  remain unemployed  after  six  months.\r\n\r\nDegree holders are the worst off.  The re-employment rate\r\n\r\nfor  those  in the 40s is 41% and those in their  50s  is\r\n\r\nonly 33%.  In other words, more than half do not get  re-employed even after six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these people are friends of mine. And\r\n\r\nI  can  feel their sense of loss.  They too have invested\r\n\r\nheavily in their earlier education, in terms of time  and\r\n\r\nmoney.  And, today, they have been told that they are  no\r\n\r\nlonger required.  And the reason given to them is a  very\r\n\r\nloose    term    that   we   nowadays   call    \"economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring\".   It  is  a  very  high-sounding  word  - \"restructuring\".    But   to   many   people    nowadays,\r\n\r\nrestructuring is a dirty word, that means bad  news.   It\r\n\r\nis  like when your banker calls on you and tells you that\r\n\r\nit  is  time to restructure your loan, you know that  you\r\n\r\nare in trouble.  To such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople, labelling their predicament as an exercise in pre-emptive  layoff,  as we now call it, and  describing  the\r\n\r\nprospects  of  being  re-employed as  dim,  even  if  the\r\n\r\neconomy turns around, because of what is now termed as  a\r\n\r\npossible  jobless  recovery, is like  rubbing  salt  into\r\n\r\nwound.   However  you  describe it  and  no  matter  what\r\n\r\nreasons  you  give, no matter how you  tell  people  what\r\n\r\ndrastic changes the whole world is undergoing, a loss  of\r\n\r\njob to someone means a loss of income and the ability  to\r\n\r\nfeed  himself and his family.  It is a loss of  your  own\r\n\r\ndignity when you lose your job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when the Asian financial crisis\r\n\r\nfirst   hit   us  some  years  ago,  we  had  our   first\r\n\r\nretrenchment  exercises  in many  years.   In  the  early\r\n\r\nstages,  there  were actually people  who  did  not  mind\r\n\r\ngetting  retrenched because they had a  golden  handshake\r\n\r\nand  many even went on a holiday first because they  knew\r\n\r\nthat they could get another job when they came back.  But\r\n\r\nas  reality  set in, that the economy would  not  recover\r\n\r\nthat fast, people then began to fear that they would lose\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.   Today,  the unemployed  harbour  no  false\r\n\r\nillusion  that  a job is round the corner  and  many  are\r\n\r\nprepared to work for lower wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the challenge that faces us today is not\r\n\r\njust to get people to change their mindset about the type\r\n\r\nof  wages they can look forward to in future.  I think it\r\n\r\nhas to do also with getting people to understand that  in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  big changes, as we are now going through,  the\r\n\r\nbiggest change that will have to take place is to be with\r\n\r\noneself.   In  practical terms, how do  you  convince  an\r\n\r\naccountant, or an engineer, or a bank officer in his 40s,\r\n\r\nwho  has  lost his job, that he has to reinvent  himself,\r\n\r\nand what new skills can you ask him to pick up?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, I think this would be one of the\r\n\r\nchallenges facing the new statutory board, the setting up\r\n\r\nof  which  must  receive the full support of  the  House.\r\n\r\nRetraining our workers and equipping ourselves  with  new\r\n\r\nskills is not a panacea for all our ills.  But it will go\r\n\r\na  long way in ensuring that our people become employable\r\n\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economy  turns  around.  Retraining  our  workforce,\r\n\r\nupgrading their skills, these are not new things  to  us.\r\n\r\nWe  already  have  a  slew of programmes  -  work  skills\r\n\r\ntraining programme, People-for-Jobs Traineeship, WISE and\r\n\r\nBEST  -  and  multiple agencies ( EDB,  SPRING)  and  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement handling all these programmes.  But as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  even if the number of people  going  for\r\n\r\nretraining  has  increased over  the  years,  demand  for\r\n\r\nretraining still falls below available training places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principal tasks of this new agency will\r\n\r\nbe  to  ensure that the demand for places is kept up;  in\r\n\r\nother   words,  people  want  to  continue   to   upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.   And  I would say that we  would  need  some\r\n\r\ncoordination of our efforts.  To achieve this,  WDA,  now\r\n\r\nthat it is an amalgamation of many agencies offering  the\r\n\r\ndifferent programmes, must be able to communicate clearly\r\n\r\nto workers what types of available programmes match their\r\n\r\nlearning  abilities and aptitudes so that  we  can  equip\r\n\r\nthem with the right skills that will make them employable\r\n\r\nin  the  future.   While retraining must cut  across  all\r\n\r\nlevels of the workforce, I hope that the Agency would pay\r\n\r\nstrong   focus   on  these  people  who  are   mid-career\r\n\r\nprofessionals and executives as they are likely to be the\r\n\r\none  group  which  would be the hardest  to  retrain  and\r\n\r\nrematch with jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this statutory board, in my opinion, is\r\n\r\nprobably the most important one that we are setting up in\r\n\r\nrecent  times.  I was very encouraged to hear the  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister  conclude  yesterday in his statement  that  his\r\n\r\nmission is to get the jobs back for Singaporeans.  And  I\r\n\r\nam sure that all Members of the House would also want him\r\n\r\nto succeed in this mission fast.  Therefore, I would like\r\n\r\nto  urge  the  House  to give this Bill  its  unqualified\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n<br>4.55 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, I rise to speak in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Singapore Workforce Development  Agency\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is an extensive range of workforce\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes and initiatives being  managed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Manpower and the Standards, Productivity\r\n\r\nand   Innovation  Board  (SPRING).

The People Developer  programme\r\n\r\noffers  a quality standard on Human Resource Development,\r\n\r\nwhich  is one of the stated functions of WDA, and On-the-Job  Training  programme is an initiative  for  employer-based training to equip employees with skills to meet the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of the new economy.  Will SPRING continue  to\r\n\r\nrun  them,  perhaps in collaboration with  WDA,  or  will\r\n\r\nthese programmes cease to be offered altogether?  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask why these two programmes should not be  also\r\n\r\ntransferred to WDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, SPRING is only a couple of\r\n\r\nyears old and before SPRING has the chance to spring,  or\r\n\r\nbe  sprung, we are now taking away from it three  of  the\r\n\r\nmore important human capital development and productivity\r\n\r\ninitiatives.  Why are some initiatives being moved across\r\n\r\nto  WDA  and some being retained in SPRING?  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  use the opportunity offered by this Bill  to  set\r\n\r\nthis straight.  Otherwise, we will have to do a reshuffle\r\n\r\nagain in a couple of years' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I am wholeheartedly supportive of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  Due to the recent increase in the number  of\r\n\r\nretrenchments, there is now more of an immediate need  to\r\n\r\nreskill  the  unemployed and the retrenched.   One  group\r\n\r\nthat  would benefit greatly from retraining would be  the\r\n\r\nlow-skilled, less educated in their 30s and 40s who  have\r\n\r\na  potential of at least another 20 working years or  so.\r\n\r\nThese are the people who have dependants, possibly at all\r\n\r\nthree  levels - parents, spouse and children - to support\r\n\r\nand, to top it off, various loan obligations to meet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many, the economy has evolved bewilderingly in\r\n\r\nsuch  a way that, contrary to their earlier expectations,\r\n\r\ntheir  skills  are  no longer relevant in  a  marketplace\r\n\r\nwhich  prizes higher skilled workers.  However,  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  very  group  of people who are the least  likely  to\r\n\r\nundertake   continuing  education   due   to   inadequate\r\n\r\nknowledge of programmes available and lack of funds.  The\r\n\r\nWDA must find ways to reach out to them and convince them\r\n\r\nof  the  benefits  of  training and  reskilling  at  this\r\n\r\ndifficult and frustrating time in their life.  It is  the\r\n\r\ntask of the Agency to devise relevant programmes, through\r\n\r\ncareful   studies   and  close  consultation   with   the\r\n\r\nindustries, to cater to this group by equipping them with\r\n\r\nthe  tools  to rise from the doldrums of unemployment  to\r\n\r\nbetter  opportunities in the workplace through retraining\r\n\r\nand  reskilling.  The WDA must also not forget that,  for\r\n\r\ntheir programmes to truly benefit this group, they should\r\n\r\naim   unwaveringly  to  provide  easily  accessible   and\r\n\r\nunderstood information, better incentives and funding for\r\n\r\nthis group of low-skilled older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to focus on another group of\r\n\r\nworkers  who  can be helped if we have clearer  standards\r\n\r\nfor  the  various  trades  and businesses.   In  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  companies have to be nimble,  must  retain  the\r\n\r\nflexibility to downsize, right-size, or up-size, to  meet\r\n\r\nthe changing demands of the economy.  This will result in\r\n\r\nmore and more dislocation among workers and more and more\r\n\r\npeople becoming self-employed, contracting to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide specific services and engaging in freelance  non-full  time independent jobs, either for a temporary  part\r\n\r\nof  their  working life or their whole working life.   In\r\n\r\nour  daily  lives,  we  come across  various  people  who\r\n\r\nprovide  different  services from white-collar  ones  who\r\n\r\nprovide business consultancy, financial planning advisory\r\n\r\nservices,  even private tuition, to blue-collar  services\r\n\r\nlike   plumbing  and  gardening.   For  the  professional\r\n\r\nservices,  I  think  the consumer  would  take  time  and\r\n\r\nexercise care to gauge, find out and agree on the quality\r\n\r\nof service that he wants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if you want to engage a plumber, tailor,\r\n\r\ntuition  teacher, computer repairman, swimming instructor\r\n\r\nor  local  domestic help, how do you assess and find  out\r\n\r\nwhat  skills that person has and how good are his  skills\r\n\r\nand  the  quality of his work other than through word-of-mouth recommendation or by trial and error?  The consumer\r\n\r\nis,  hence, wary about engaging freelancers and, in turn,\r\n\r\nthis   consumer   distrust  limits  the   potential   and\r\n\r\nopportunities  available  to the  freelancers.   To  grow\r\n\r\nthese  trades and help these individuals who  have  these\r\n\r\nskills to find an income, I believe we have to reduce the\r\n\r\npresent  obstacles  of the absence of consistent  quality\r\n\r\nand standards, and the lack of avenues for resolution  of\r\n\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you are skilled in IT and\r\n\r\nretrenched, how do you publicise your services to provide\r\n\r\nfreelance IT consultancy?  As a consumer, if you  need  a\r\n\r\nPC  doctor to fix a bug in your home computer,  how  sure\r\n\r\nare you of his skills?  Would you have more confidence if\r\n\r\nhe  proudly  wears a badge that tells you that  he  meets\r\n\r\nwith   certain  standards  established  by  a   reputable\r\n\r\norganisation and governed by its code of ethics?  What if\r\n\r\nthe  repairman  is  backed by an  organisation  that  can\r\n\r\nprovide assurance of a certain quality to its consumers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other developed countries like the United\r\n\r\nStates,  there  is a multitude of such organisations  and\r\n\r\nassociations,  and  their members proudly  display  their\r\n\r\nbadge  of identification.  We have imported some of these\r\n\r\nforeign  organisations  with their established  standards\r\n\r\ninto our community.  The Agency can fulfil its role in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping this section of the workforce by roping in  or\r\n\r\nhelping  to  set up more such local private  associations\r\n\r\nthat  represent the various trades who can then establish\r\n\r\nand  maintain the standards, have a strong code of ethics\r\n\r\ngoverning   its   members,  provide   training   courses,\r\n\r\nrecognised  skills  accreditation, skills  upgrading  and\r\n\r\ncontinuing education of its members and resolve  disputes\r\n\r\nand  complaints concerning its members.  This  will  help\r\n\r\npromote  the  \"cottage industries\" of  the  new  economy.\r\n\r\nOnce  these  associations  are properly  established,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be easier for those who wish to acquire new skills\r\n\r\nand enter a fresh trade whether to tide over a period  of\r\n\r\nunemployment or on a more permanent basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Dr  Lee\r\n\r\nBoon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, even though Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  is  expected to recover in  the  coming  months,\r\n\r\nthere  is  still no cheer in sight for the jobless.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  and many companies continue to warn  of  more\r\n\r\njob  losses,  corporate  restructuring  and  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More worryingly, this phenomenon of a jobless\r\n\r\nrecovery is not peculiar to Singapore.  USA, the  world's\r\n\r\nlargest  and  strongest  economy,  has  not  been  spared\r\n\r\neither, as even executive jobs are at risk of being moved\r\n\r\noutwards  to lower-cost countries like China  and  India.\r\n\r\nFor   all   its  promises,  there  is  a  dark  side   to\r\n\r\nglobalisation and the new knowledge economy and, that is,\r\n\r\nhigher  and speedier job obsolescence and, thus,  chronic\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.05 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist notes in a recent issue: \"America's\r\n\r\neconomy  is  now supposedly on the road to recovery,  but\r\n\r\nsomebody  forgot  to  tell the labour  market.\"   Merrill\r\n\r\nLynch  notes  in  the same article: \"If the  early  1990s\r\n\r\nupturn  was  the jobless recovery, this is  the  job-loss\r\n\r\nrecovery.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As structural unemployment is set to become a staple\r\n\r\nof  the new economy, the establishment of a single agency\r\n\r\nto  focus on continuing education and training of  adults\r\n\r\nand employment assistance comes none too soon.  This will\r\n\r\nensure   that   all  the  well-intentioned  but   perhaps\r\n\r\nsometimes disparate efforts by different agencies will be\r\n\r\nbetter organised for greater effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Agency to take cognisance of the\r\n\r\nfollowing four main concerns as it pushes ahead with  the\r\n\r\ntwo   key   objectives  of  employment   assistance   and\r\n\r\ncontinuing education and training for adults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under employment assistance, I would like to\r\n\r\nhighlight two key issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Agency should look at ways to further\r\n\r\nimprove its job-matching schemes and optimise the use  of\r\n\r\nlimited  resources  available.   Despite  the  tremendous\r\n\r\nresources poured in for job matching, the success rate of\r\n\r\nsuch  efforts  has remained low, at less than  20%.   The\r\n\r\nends do not seem to have justified the means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Agency is to become the coordinating body for\r\n\r\njob-matching efforts, I would like to find out  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister   how   the  Agency  plans  to  undertake   such\r\n\r\ncoordination  with the various CareerLink Centres.   What\r\n\r\nwould  be their roles and duties as against those of  the\r\n\r\nAgency?   I  understand, for instance, that each  of  the\r\n\r\ncentres   has  different  job  databases.   One   of   my\r\n\r\ngrassroots members, who was recently retrenched, told  me\r\n\r\nthat  he  was given different listings when  he  went  to\r\n\r\ndifferent  centres.  It appears that many job  applicants\r\n\r\nare now going all over the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nisland  to the different centres to apply for jobs.   So,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  job requests recorded at  the  different\r\n\r\nCareerLink Centres may be significantly lower,  if  these\r\n\r\nmultiple visits are discounted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Agency to set up a centralised national\r\n\r\njob database, so that an applicant need only to go to one\r\n\r\ncentre to apply for a job.  This would not only save  the\r\n\r\ntime,  effort and money of the applicant, but also  avoid\r\n\r\nduplication of work, wastage of scarce resources, as well\r\n\r\nas  improve  efficiency.  This centralised  database  can\r\n\r\nalso  be  used  to  help the CDCs better  link  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  to  job  placements.   Those  who  repeatedly\r\n\r\nreject  jobs must be counselled to find out their reasons\r\n\r\nfor rejecting jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some jobs, which have traditionally been the domain\r\n\r\nof  foreign workers, are shunned by Singaporeans  because\r\n\r\nof  the  low  pay, which is deemed insufficient  for  the\r\n\r\nworker  to  support even himself, let alone  his  family.\r\n\r\nBesides  job redesign, Singaporeans may be encouraged  to\r\n\r\ntake  up such jobs and, at least, catch some of the  fish\r\n\r\nthemselves,  if the Agency could work together  with  the\r\n\r\nMCDS and tie a subsidy or financial assistance scheme  to\r\n\r\nthe job placement of the worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, feedback from one of my residents who\r\n\r\nhad  been  retrenched and recently found a job  is  that,\r\n\r\nwhile  the job-matching efforts of the CareerLink Centres\r\n\r\nare  commendable,  they  could  perhaps  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  job placement agencies  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsuccess rate.  This resident shared with me that  he  had\r\n\r\neventually  gotten  a job through a  private  sector  job\r\n\r\nagency.   He  said that the agency, no doubt incentivised\r\n\r\nby  a  commission  for  successful  placement,  was  very\r\n\r\nproactive  in  helping him identify a suitable  job.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  they had taken an active role and even helped  him\r\n\r\nnegotiate  with the prospective employer  to  consider  a\r\n\r\nslightly higher salary as a delivery driver, even  before\r\n\r\nthe interview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the Agency should consider outsourcing at\r\n\r\nleast part of the job-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatching  efforts to private sector job agencies.   These\r\n\r\nagencies  already  have  the  expertise  to  handle   job\r\n\r\nmatching,  and  their  skills and  experience  should  be\r\n\r\ntapped.  Why re-invent the wheel?  Outsourcing could help\r\n\r\nto  minimise  the  necessity for the  various  CareerLink\r\n\r\nCentres  with  limited  budget  to  expand  their   staff\r\n\r\nstrength and increase resources for job matching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Agency should continue to help change\r\n\r\nthe mindsets of both employers and employees to match the\r\n\r\ncurrent  employment  landscape.  The Government  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers have constantly cited the poor attitude of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  for the job mismatch and high unemployment  rate\r\n\r\neven  while  we have more foreign workers than unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   There is obviously truth  to  this.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  a  resident  in my constituency  whom  we  had\r\n\r\nsuccessfully placed in a firm, came back to tell me  that\r\n\r\nshe  had quit her job after one week as she found working\r\n\r\nat  a  computer,  for which she is unfamiliar  with,  too\r\n\r\ndifficult.   And  this was in an air-conditioned  office.\r\n\r\nShe  asked me to help her get a stall in a school canteen\r\n\r\ninstead,  as  she  had figured that this  would  be  much\r\n\r\neasier work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, anecdotal evidence suggests that many\r\n\r\nlaid  off  Singaporeans are now willing to  change  their\r\n\r\nexpectations,  take significant pay  cuts,  and  work  in\r\n\r\nindustries which they might have previously shunned.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  I came across a 50-year-old resident  who  has\r\n\r\ndiplomas   in   both  computer  studies  and   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  and  was previously a computer support  staff.\r\n\r\nHe  now works as a security guard earning about $1,000  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   He said that he has been rejected for many  jobs\r\n\r\nbecause   of  his  age.   He  has  encountered   numerous\r\n\r\nprospective  employers who tell him over the  phone  that\r\n\r\nthey need someone much younger.  He was not even given  a\r\n\r\nchance to be interviewed!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM has tried to encourage employers to employ older\r\n\r\nworkers  by  providing a subsidy for six months,  if  the\r\n\r\nfirm  hires a worker above 40 years old.  However,  there\r\n\r\nare still employers who are averse\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  hiring older workers even with the subsidy.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister what further plans the Ministry has to encourage\r\n\r\nemployers  to give older workers a fair chance to  secure\r\n\r\njobs.   For a start, the Agency could work together  with\r\n\r\nall  the  Government Ministries and agencies to encourage\r\n\r\nthem to employ older workers whenever possible.  Does the\r\n\r\nMinister  know  how  many  older retrenched  workers  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Ministries and agencies have employed  in  the\r\n\r\nlast two years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tales also abound of employers who prefer to employ\r\n\r\nforeigners as they work longer hours, do not have  to  go\r\n\r\nfor  reservist training and are not entitled to  CPF.   A\r\n\r\nparticipant in a feedback group I chaired shared that  in\r\n\r\nthe media industry she works in, she feels that between a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  and a foreigner with similar qualifications,\r\n\r\nthe  foreigner is usually preferred.  As evidenced by the\r\n\r\nrecent  Straits Times poll, most Singaporeans acknowledge\r\n\r\nthat foreign talent has a role to play in Singapore.  So,\r\n\r\nthey   are   not   saying  \"Foreigners   -   no   entry\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we  do  not want to  impose  labour  market\r\n\r\nrigidity by limiting foreign workers, especially for  the\r\n\r\nhigher  skilled jobs and, in the process, make  Singapore\r\n\r\nunattractive to business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a period of an all-time 15-year high\r\n\r\nunemployment rate, there is a real need to relook at  our\r\n\r\nforeign   worker  policies  to  balance  the   legitimate\r\n\r\nconcerns  of the citizens as against those of businesses,\r\n\r\nthe  economy  and, yes, foreigners.  Without compromising\r\n\r\non  the  premise  that  foreign talent  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nsupplement   our  local  talent  and  boost   Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy, I think drastic times call for drastic relook at\r\n\r\nexisting  measures, at least on a temporary  basis.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, the foreign worker quota could be reviewed  and\r\n\r\nvaried  during periods of high unemployment  where  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  an adequate number of locals for  hire.   The\r\n\r\nratio, for example, could be tied somehow to the rate  of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  within  a certain  band,  to  give  policy\r\n\r\nflexibility, but generally moving up when unemployment is\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  moving down when the opposite happens.  I  note  the\r\n\r\nMinister  did  say  yesterday that  the  quota  would  be\r\n\r\nmonitored and reviewed periodically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to highlight two key issues under\r\n\r\nthe  Agency's second strategic thrust of adult continuing\r\n\r\neducation and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, industry consultation and collaboration.\r\n\r\nReading  Part III of the Singapore Workforce  Development\r\n\r\nAgency  Bill  gives the impression, rightly  or  wrongly,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Agency  will  be in competition  with  private\r\n\r\nsector  organisations  offering education,  training  and\r\n\r\nupgrading programmes, as well as with professional groups\r\n\r\nlike  the Singapore Human Resource Institute which  seeks\r\n\r\nto develop HR best practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough has been said about public sector crowding\r\n\r\nout  private  sector initiatives when this House  debated\r\n\r\nthe  Temasek  Charter last year.  I urge the Minister  to\r\n\r\nassure  the  public  that this is  more  perception  than\r\n\r\nreality.   Efforts  should  therefore  be  made  whenever\r\n\r\npossible to collaborate with professional bodies,  course\r\n\r\nproviders  and  other  appropriate organisations  in  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  the  workforce.  These  specialised  bodies\r\n\r\nwould  know the state of the industry and understand  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  workforce much better than  a  Government\r\n\r\nagency tasked with a diverse range of functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the real estate industry with which I am\r\n\r\nfamiliar,  I have previously come across instances  where\r\n\r\nattempts  to  initiate  standards and  training  for  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing  education of real estate practitioners  by  a\r\n\r\nGovernment agency have been based on inadequate  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  the  ground because not all relevant  organisations\r\n\r\nwere  identified and consulted.  This would lead to  time\r\n\r\nwasted,   unnecessary  costs  incurred,  and  less   than\r\n\r\ndesirable  outcomes.  In its efforts to develop  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes, the Agency should be mindful not to duplicate\r\n\r\nand  compete  with private sector efforts and initiatives\r\n\r\nbut,  rather,  to facilitate any on-going programmes  and\r\n\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsourcing, so widely practised by the private\r\n\r\nsector,  should  be the norm rather than  the  exception.\r\n\r\nAlready, there have been murmurings about what SPRING  is\r\n\r\ndoing in conducting educational courses in alliance  with\r\n\r\noverseas   institutes,  something   which   the   private\r\n\r\neducation industry has been carrying out for a long time.\r\n\r\nSecondly, like my colleagues before me, I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntalk  about  training of older workers.  Adult continuing\r\n\r\neducation  and  training  would provide  useful  learning\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  older workers, especially  the  lowly\r\n\r\neducated  ones whose livelihoods are more at risk.   This\r\n\r\nis  particularly  crucial  in  the  light  of  an  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation  and  a longer life expectancy.   In  fact,  a\r\n\r\nspecial  task force within the proposed Agency should  be\r\n\r\nset  up to focus on this group of older workers who  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  adequately  prepared to meet  the  drastically\r\n\r\nchanged circumstances. Their fishing skills are outmoded.\r\n\r\nAs  testimony of the urgency to help older workers, based\r\n\r\non  MOM's  data as at the first quarter of 2003,  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  75,000  unemployed then, those  aged  40  and  above\r\n\r\nformed  the  largest group at 43%.  Moreover,  of  these,\r\n\r\nmore  than  half  (15,900) have  below  secondary  school\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task force can work together with the private\r\n\r\nand  people  sectors as well as Government Ministries  to\r\n\r\nidentify  and/or re-engineer jobs to make  them  suitable\r\n\r\nand  more attractive for older workers. Training  courses\r\n\r\nto help older workers obtain the skills for jobs in these\r\n\r\nsectors  can  then  be designed and promoted.   The  task\r\n\r\nforce should look at ways to encourage employers to  hire\r\n\r\nthese  older workers, but nonetheless competent and able.\r\n\r\nIt   should   also   look  into  ways  to   prevent   age\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  of  such workers.  The  plight  of  these\r\n\r\nworkers has to be championed as this problem is likely to\r\n\r\nremain with us for a long time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time not too long ago when Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere  enjoying high economic growth and, in the  process,\r\n\r\nbecame   asset-rich  and  cash-rich.    Then   came   the\r\n\r\nunprecedented and prolonged period of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuncertainty  starting  from the Asian  financial  crisis,\r\n\r\nfollowed by a series of shocks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have, in the last few years, lamented\r\n\r\nthat  they are both asset-less and cash-less, or  perhaps\r\n\r\nnow  more  appropriately, \"asset-loss\"  and  \"cash-loss\".\r\n\r\nNow,  for  the  typical Singaporean, there is  the  added\r\n\r\ndread  of yet another loss, \"job-loss\", if they  are  not\r\n\r\nalready in this state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping Singaporeans to get jobs, retain jobs and\r\n\r\nremain  employable over their working life should clearly\r\n\r\nbe  one  of  the Government's key objectives.   Hitherto,\r\n\r\nother  than  defence and national development,  education\r\n\r\ntakes up the biggest share of our national budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without minimising the importance of training of our\r\n\r\nyoung  for  the  future,  brutal  global  competition  is\r\n\r\nhammering  home  the point that the adult  workforce,  by\r\n\r\nsheer  numbers and current contribution to  the  economy,\r\n\r\ndeserves  as  much,  if  not  more,  attention  and   the\r\n\r\ncollective  efforts  of  the  Government,  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I therefore support the setting up of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Workforce Development Agency.  This signals the\r\n\r\nGovernment's commitment to ensure that Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nremain employable in the face of dramatic changes in  the\r\n\r\nemployment landscape.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  welcome  the proposed establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Workforce Development Agency that  will  bring\r\n\r\ntogether  various divisions of the Ministry  of  Manpower\r\n\r\nand  SPRING  Singapore.   The  issues  that  need  to  be\r\n\r\naddressed in tackling the challenges that lie ahead of us\r\n\r\nin ensuring employment opportunities for Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nmulti-faceted and it will be good to have one agency that\r\n\r\ncan focus its entire attention and energies on this task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM and SPRING Singapore must be given kudos for the\r\n\r\nmany and varied training and reskilling programmes that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have already developed and introduced in the recent\r\n\r\ncouple  of years, even without the existence of the  WDA,\r\n\r\nand the generous funding that they have made available to\r\n\r\nsupport these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the support and provision of training and\r\n\r\nreskilling  programmes is only one small part,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe first step in the whole picture and process.  What we\r\n\r\nwant and need is ultimately, that the worker is placed in\r\n\r\na  job,  that he stays in the job, that he makes  a  good\r\n\r\ncontribution  to his employer and that he  earns  a  wage\r\n\r\nthat  allows  him to discharge his financial  obligations\r\n\r\nand maintain a reasonable living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other factors that will significantly\r\n\r\nimpact  on WDA's effectiveness and ability to deliver  on\r\n\r\nthis ultimate goal.  These include Singaporeans' mindsets\r\n\r\nand  attitudes towards work, both as individuals as  well\r\n\r\nas  a  society; the realities that Singaporeans  face  in\r\n\r\nearning a viable living in the face of the complex impact\r\n\r\nof  CPF contributions on take-home pay and the ability to\r\n\r\npay  mortgages on the one hand, and the issue of business\r\n\r\ncost  on  the other; and finally what we can  do  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole area of self-employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Singaporeans' attitudes and expectations with\r\n\r\nregard  to jobs, we hear different stories from different\r\n\r\nquarters.  I am sure that all the stories are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ntrue and factual and simply reflect both the diversity of\r\n\r\npeople's  backgrounds  and  experiences,  as  well  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety which is in transition from having known so  many\r\n\r\nyears  of high growth and full employment to one  dealing\r\n\r\nwith a much less certain future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had spoken in this House before on the very\r\n\r\npositive experience of all parties when you have a  happy\r\n\r\nconfluence  of  determined  and  adaptable  workers   and\r\n\r\nemployers  willing  to take on mature  employees  in  the\r\n\r\ninstance  of our experience in healthcare.  We must  find\r\n\r\nthe  occasion to highlight more of such success  stories.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a long way to go yet to encourage many\r\n\r\nother  Singaporeans to adjust their mindsets with  regard\r\n\r\nto  what constitutes an acceptable and worthy occupation.\r\n\r\nThis applies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  both individual Singaporeans looking for jobs as well\r\n\r\nas Singaporeans as a society in how we view workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent encounter reminded me both of the progress\r\n\r\nmade  as  well as the way yet ahead. This has to do  with\r\n\r\nthe area of domestic services.  I served in early 1997 on\r\n\r\nthe  Back-to-Work  Committee  of  the  then  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour.   We  had  identified  domestic  services  as  an\r\n\r\nindustry  which  had  potential  to  solve  two  problems\r\n\r\nconcurrently.   It  is  a great example  of  the  win-win\r\n\r\nsolutions we are always looking for. We thought it  would\r\n\r\nhelp  solve  the  problems of working  women  juggling  a\r\n\r\ncareer and housekeeping responsibilities, without further\r\n\r\nincreasing our reliance on foreign maids on the one hand,\r\n\r\nand  providing opportunities for other women  wanting  to\r\n\r\nget  back  to  work in an area that they would  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary skills and aptitudes on the other.   Since that\r\n\r\ntime,  quite  a  number  of  companies  have  sprung  up,\r\n\r\nproviding  housekeeping services and  they  are  doing  a\r\n\r\nbooming business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the services of such a company to help keep my\r\n\r\napartment in habitable condition.  They send two  workers\r\n\r\nin  a team to do the cleaning and they actually do a very\r\n\r\ngood  and professional job.  Just last week, I discovered\r\n\r\nthat  both the workers assigned to my apartment are  non-Singaporeans.  I was rather taken aback because I had, up\r\n\r\nto  then,  always thought happily that the work that  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  that  I had served on, and our recommendations\r\n\r\nhad  made  some  contributions  towards  encouraging  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of a sector that provided good opportunities  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  As it transpired, the picture was not that\r\n\r\nbad.  On talking to the owner, who was surprised to get a\r\n\r\ncall  from  me,  I  found that, in  fact,  70%  of  their\r\n\r\nworkforce  is local.  So we have created some  good  jobs\r\n\r\nthere.   However,  they  do face  significant  difficulty\r\n\r\nfinding  and  keeping Singaporeans.  In fact,  they  have\r\n\r\njust done a review.  In a recent 7-month period, they had\r\n\r\nhired  160  Singaporeans and put them through  structured\r\n\r\ntraining.   At the end of that period, regretfully,  only\r\n\r\n20 of this group have stayed on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons is the same as the one that my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Ms Irene Ng,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   just  brought  up.  They  relate  to  the   working\r\n\r\nconditions,  such  as a non air-conditioned  environment.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is also another factor that comes into  play,\r\n\r\nwhich relates to whether the house owner would be at home\r\n\r\nor   out  when  the  housekeepers  come.  The  latter  is\r\n\r\npreferred, as the workers do not like to be seen at their\r\n\r\nwork, being shy of being identified.  The job is not  one\r\n\r\nthat they are proud to be identified with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where, as a society, we must move from\r\n\r\nmouthing  platitudes about the dignity of  honest  labour\r\n\r\ntowards truly according the appreciation and respect that\r\n\r\nwe  should have for any worker who discharges his or  her\r\n\r\nduties  competently and responsibly,  regardless  of  the\r\n\r\nnature  of the work itself. These are mindset issues  and\r\n\r\nthe  WDA  will  have  an impossible task  if  we  do  not\r\n\r\nconsciously work on our attitudes and behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next come the realities of what a displaced worker\r\n\r\nneeds in terms of earning a viable living. The company  I\r\n\r\nspoke  of starts their housekeepers at $1,000.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  range moves up, when you get to be a supervisor,  to\r\n\r\n$1,800.   This is actually not bad when you  look  at  it\r\n\r\nthat  way.   But a simple and clear illustration  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems Singaporean workers face, with regard to salary,\r\n\r\nwas  given  by  a Mr Jack Sim, who wrote to  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes'  Forum  page  last week.  He gave  a  very  simple\r\n\r\nillustration of why he employed Malaysian workers  rather\r\n\r\nthan Singaporeans and further of why it was difficult   - he  was not casting aspersions on Singaporean workers   - for  a  Singaporean worker to manage on the  same  salary\r\n\r\nthat  his Malaysian counterpart would be happy to accept.\r\n\r\nHe  used a simple calculation of $1,000, which is easy to\r\n\r\nwork  in terms of percentages.  It is simply that at  the\r\n\r\nstarting salary of $1,000, the Malaysian worker costs  Mr\r\n\r\nSim  $1,030 ($1,000 + $30 levy) and a Singaporean  worker\r\n\r\ncosts  him $1,160 ($1,000 + $160 CPF). That is  from  his\r\n\r\nperspective as an employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of the Singaporean worker, he\r\n\r\nonly gets $800 as take-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhome pay ($1,000 less $200 employee's contribution).   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the $1,000 that the Malaysian counterpart  brings\r\n\r\nhome  gets  him  a  lot further than the  $800  that  our\r\n\r\nSingaporean worker takes as take-home pay.  This is not a\r\n\r\nsession on CPF, but I think that what he does bring home,\r\n\r\nthis  re-tuning of the CPF scheme, which is being  mooted\r\n\r\nby  various quarters recently, is certainly badly needed.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the question is whether it is a re-tuning  that\r\n\r\nis required or a fairly major overhaul because the issues\r\n\r\nare  so  intertwined  and complex as to  the  conflicting\r\n\r\ndemands  that we need to see addressed.  In this context,\r\n\r\nall  that I wanted to say is that even as the WDA  pushes\r\n\r\nahead  with the issues of training and reskilling,  which\r\n\r\nthe  Agency will, in fact, move this in parallel,  as  it\r\n\r\ncertainly  will have impact on the success, or otherwise,\r\n\r\nof the ultimate goal of jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to turn attention to another approach, ie,\r\n\r\nself-employment.  Much effort will go into creating  jobs\r\n\r\nin which Singaporeans may be employed.  But I trust WDA's\r\n\r\nremit  also includes looking into supporting the creation\r\n\r\nof  opportunities for self-employment or freelancing,  as\r\n\r\nmy  colleague, Mr Ong Kian Min, has just earlier referred\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM had sponsored a course last year on \"How to\r\n\r\nstart  and  run your own business\". This was co-organised\r\n\r\nby  the PSB Academy and DEW Credit Cooperative.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  trained,  in  the period of 3-6 months  last  year,\r\n\r\n1,200  people.   How about supporting this effort  beyond\r\n\r\nsponsoring  the training?  How about, firstly,  extending\r\n\r\nthis  effort  to  minimising rules and  regulations  that\r\n\r\nprohibit  or that are not helpful to helping  people  who\r\n\r\nactually  want to go out there and do some small business\r\n\r\nor  provide some services on their own? This principle of\r\n\r\nhelping you how to start and run your own business is the\r\n\r\nprinciple that we always use, as an analogy, of  teaching\r\n\r\npeople how to fish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be helpful then in that scenario to make\r\n\r\nsure  that we are not putting a lot of \"no fishing\" signs\r\n\r\non all the bodies of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwater that may exist.  What is the point of teaching them\r\n\r\nto  fish  and  then at every pond, every pool  and  every\r\n\r\nlittle  rivulet you have this \"no fishing\"  sign  on  it?\r\n\r\nWith  regard  to  these \"no fishing\" prohibitions,  I  am\r\n\r\nreminded  of a story.  I recently heard from  one  of  my\r\n\r\nlong-time  serving Parliamentary colleagues  who  had  to\r\n\r\nplead for 10 years before finally being able to secure  a\r\n\r\nlicence for a constituent to set up a little corner in  a\r\n\r\nmarketplace  outside  a  clothing  shop  to  do  clothing\r\n\r\nalterations.  This constituent is a woman who  is  single\r\n\r\nwith  a  sick  mother, whom she has to take  for  medical\r\n\r\nappointments  and whom she has to stay home  periodically\r\n\r\nat  short notice to take care of.  So for her, the  ideal\r\n\r\nsolution  was  the  flexibility  of  a  part-time  income\r\n\r\ngeneration  job. She was not asking for a  handout.   She\r\n\r\nhas  this  skill.  But  it took that  long  to  get  this\r\n\r\nlicence.  Presumably, the appropriate authority was  very\r\n\r\nmindful  of  the  tidiness  of the  environment  in  that\r\n\r\nmarketplace,  in a bigger context.  But I think  you  can\r\n\r\nsee  that  it was not really helpful for this woman,  who\r\n\r\nwas trying to make a living and not having to depend on a\r\n\r\nhandout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a case to be made. We are now\r\n\r\nfacing  a situation that is complex and we want  all  the\r\n\r\ndiverse  solutions that we can get.  Apart from  creating\r\n\r\njobs in big and small and medium sized companies, I think\r\n\r\nwe  should find a way so that individuals with skills can\r\n\r\nhave lots of flexibility to set up and provide their  own\r\n\r\nservices.  This too, I trust, will be something that  WDA\r\n\r\nwill champion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  rise  in support of the Singapore  Workforce\r\n\r\nDevelopment Agency Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we all know that Singapore is experiencing\r\n\r\nthe  most  difficult period of growth and development  in\r\n\r\nits  journey  as a young nation.  The country's  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  turned sharply negative in the second quarter  of\r\n\r\n2003,  falling to - 4.2% from positive growth of 1.7%  in\r\n\r\nthe first quarter.  The volatility of Singapore's economy\r\n\r\nis becoming more and more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napparent.    I  believe  that  the  Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nrealises that an economy that is overly dependent on only\r\n\r\nelectronics, shipping and financial services is prone  to\r\n\r\nsharp  swings.   Hence,  over  the  years,  and  more  so\r\n\r\nrecently,  its  courtship  included  chemical  companies,\r\n\r\npharmaceuticals  and drug manufacturers,  biotech  firms,\r\n\r\nhealth and nutrition companies in the Government's bid to\r\n\r\ndiversify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I hope no one is still holding his breath,\r\n\r\nhoping   against  hope  that  the  years  of  rapid   and\r\n\r\nexponential  growth will return soon.   This  realisation\r\n\r\nmust  set  in,  so that we can move forward  effectively.\r\n\r\nThe  main story is not whether the cycle is slowing  down\r\n\r\nor not, but that the economy has become more difficult to\r\n\r\npredict.   Moving  forward will  not  be  an  easy  task,\r\n\r\nbecause the rules of the game have changed.  The problems\r\n\r\nthat we are currently facing are different from the past,\r\n\r\nhence requiring different solutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two main issues that we need to look at, which\r\n\r\nwere  clearly  articulated by  the  Acting  Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower, are job creation and workers' employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTI quarterly review recently pinpointed the\r\n\r\nloss  of  more than 20,000 jobs in the last quarter,  the\r\n\r\n8th   straight   quarterly  decline  in  employment   and\r\n\r\nsignificantly more than the 4,000 jobs lost in the  first\r\n\r\nthree  months  of  the  year.  This trend  will  probably\r\n\r\ncontinue  through 2003, and a recovery in the job  market\r\n\r\nis  only expected in 2004, if we are lucky.  Exporters in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  been slashing jobs and some  are  moving\r\n\r\nproduction  to  countries such  as  China,  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nThailand,  which have lower land and labour costs.   Wage\r\n\r\ncosts  in  China,  on  average, are much  lower  than  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Some of the sobering examples, just to cite a\r\n\r\nfew,  are Japan's Seiko Epson Corporation, Sanyo Electric\r\n\r\nCompany  and  Hitachi Limited, and have all cut  jobs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we all know that everyone needs a job.\r\n\r\nGenerating   jobs   has   always   been   an    important\r\n\r\npreoccupation  of  our Government.  Bringing  in  foreign\r\n\r\ndirect investments (FDI) into our economy has,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong   other  things,   created  jobs  for  our  people.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this  tried and tested formula does  not  yield\r\n\r\neffective  results today.  The reasons  are:  first,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  jobs  FDIs  bring  in  is  significantly  and\r\n\r\ncomparatively smaller.  Second, the profile  has  changed\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the specific skill set that is  required.\r\n\r\nThird,  an issue which is quite sensitive at the  present\r\n\r\ntime,  foreigners may be more suitable at the end of  the\r\n\r\nday,  either  because they have the experience,  fit  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  or they are basically cheaper  to  hire  or\r\n\r\nsimply more willing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An over dependence on FDIs is not ideal. We all\r\n\r\nacknowledge the need to develop our local industries, our\r\n\r\nhome-grown  entrepreneurs  and  companies  that   provide\r\n\r\nemployment.   While  we  encourage  FDIs,  we  must  also\r\n\r\nseriously commit to developing home-grown businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not enough, to further complicate\r\n\r\nmatters,  there is the destabilising effects of  security\r\n\r\nor rather insecurity in the region that must now be taken\r\n\r\ninto  account.   We  know  that  such  developments  will\r\n\r\ninfluence  investors' sentiments and  decisions.   Moving\r\n\r\nforward, it is going to be tougher to get FDIs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads us to the most vital question: what about\r\n\r\nour   workers?    Are  Singaporeans  keeping   up   their\r\n\r\nemployability?   Even  if  there  are  enough  jobs,   do\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have the know-how or skills to  carry  them\r\n\r\nout?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning new skills can mean new job opportunities.\r\n\r\nAre Singaporeans willing to match employers' expectations\r\n\r\nin  terms of salaries, or are employers compelled to hire\r\n\r\nforeigners to cut cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way ahead is to equip our workers with the\r\n\r\nskills,  the knowledge and the know-how so that they  can\r\n\r\nlook at the employers in the eye and tell them, \"Anything\r\n\r\na foreigner can do, I can do better.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a need to be reminded time and\r\n\r\ntime again that like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhills  and the open grounds, we are constantly  swept  by\r\n\r\nthe  winds  of change.  Progress will not come unless  we\r\n\r\nhave  changed.   I  guess we realise its  importance  and\r\n\r\nRemaking  Singapore  is indeed the  right  thing  to  do.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  as  the economy undergoes restructuring,  the\r\n\r\n\"worker\", being the basic unit of the economy,  needs  to\r\n\r\nbe redefined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, to me, the ideal worker is the\r\n\r\n\"superworker\",  one  who  possesses  the  versatility  to\r\n\r\nperform  any  task  required of him  or  her  because  of\r\n\r\nchanging   conditions.   The  master-of-all-trades,   the\r\n\r\nsuperworker,  may not materialise, but a generalist  with\r\n\r\nsome value-added expertise to offer is very possible,  if\r\n\r\nonly   the  worker  would  change  his  attitude  towards\r\n\r\nlearning. Hence, to the workers, I would say the  biggest\r\n\r\nopportunity  probably lies under their own  feet,  be  it\r\n\r\ntheir  current job, industry they are in, their education\r\n\r\nor experience.  So, do something about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that economic evolution is inevitable.\r\n\r\nCompanies  will always pursue the lowest cost  structure,\r\n\r\nbecause of the tide of globalisation, because competition\r\n\r\nhas  suddenly become tougher and cutting cost becomes the\r\n\r\nonly way to survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, you may say that the superworker, which I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, is ideal but not realistic.  The point\r\n\r\nis,  the  worker needs to understand that  jobs  are  not\r\n\r\n\"safe\"  any  more, even skilled jobs of the  white-collar\r\n\r\ntype,  as highlighted by the other Members earlier,  once\r\n\r\nconsidered safe are not safe any more.  Thus, our workers\r\n\r\nneed to recognise that the careers that they studied  for\r\n\r\nmay not be able to maintain them throughout their working\r\n\r\nlives,  because someone in India or China may be able  to\r\n\r\nperform the same thing for a lot cheaper.  Those who have\r\n\r\nspent  years  establishing themselves and  their  careers\r\n\r\nwould have reached a comfort level and cannot imagine how\r\n\r\nall of that can now be at risk.  Well, let me remind them\r\n\r\nthat it can  -  all in the name of cost-cutting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring or Remaking, the message being sent\r\n\r\nout  is clear: the people need to change before it is too\r\n\r\nlate.  By\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,   I  mean  the  employer,  the  employee  and   the\r\n\r\nestablishment.   We  need  to  have  a  broadly  educated\r\n\r\nworkforce that keeps on learning.  With the establishment\r\n\r\nof   the  Singapore  Workforce  Development  Agency,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has institutionalised life-long learning  for\r\n\r\nthe workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It represents an earnest and proactive effort by the\r\n\r\nauthorities  to  help the people and the  economy  become\r\n\r\nmore  resilient and increase the possibility of life-time\r\n\r\nemployability.  However, I hope the Agency will not  make\r\n\r\nits  operations a labyrinth of rules and regulations that\r\n\r\nit becomes a hurdle rather than a door for the workers to\r\n\r\nenter  and  realise their ambitions.  The  Agency  should\r\n\r\njudge  its success not by the monies it has amassed  from\r\n\r\nfees, grants and donors, but by the number of workers  it\r\n\r\nhas reached out to and assisted them in their retraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is probably appropriate also to remind employers\r\n\r\nthat  they should not see the birth of the Agency as  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of the end of their role in employee  training\r\n\r\nprogramme. We know of many workers who have gone  further\r\n\r\nup  the career ladder than they thought they could.  Why?\r\n\r\nFor some, it is because they know their own potential and\r\n\r\nthey  develop it.  But for others, it is because  someone\r\n\r\nelse,  often  the employer, thought that  they  have  the\r\n\r\npotential  to  go higher and gave them the  training  and\r\n\r\nsupport.    This  is  where  employers,  human   resource\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  should continue to  look  out  for  these\r\n\r\npeople, and render them the support and encouragement  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills and knowledge to enable them to move\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should also shift their thinking and be\r\n\r\nmore  magnanimous towards training and  upgrading.   With\r\n\r\nthe  opening of new opportunities as Singapore  undergoes\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring, employers should be  sympathetic\r\n\r\ntowards  workers  who seek training in  an  area  perhaps\r\n\r\nquite  unrelated to their field of work.  Employers  must\r\n\r\novercome any selfish thoughts of denying the workers  the\r\n\r\ntraining for fear of losing them in the months ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are people who have undergone one\r\n\r\nform of training in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  past, trudging to change career path midway  through\r\n\r\nlife, holding the view that he has perhaps gone down  the\r\n\r\nwrong  road.   I feel that if someone is going  down  the\r\n\r\nwrong road, then he does not need motivation to speed up.\r\n\r\nWhat  he  needs  is education and training  to  turn  him\r\n\r\naround to the lane where he will excel and thus become  a\r\n\r\nmulti-disciplined worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I urge the Agency, the workers and\r\n\r\nemployers  alike  to please take full advantage  of  this\r\n\r\nopportunity, as a platform for everyone to move in tandem\r\n\r\nwith  the Government's role to remake and take our nation\r\n\r\nto a new era of economic development and growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Singapore Workforce Development  Agency\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every parliamentary sitting in the last year and\r\n\r\na  half  or  so,  we  hear  Members'  concern  about  the\r\n\r\nunemployment   conditions   facing   Singaporeans.    The\r\n\r\nunemployment rate has been creeping up steadily from 2.4%\r\n\r\nin  March  2001 to 4.5% in March this year, and   we  are\r\n\r\ntold that it may still go up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various schemes have been put in place - from the\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance programmes for  those  affected  by\r\n\r\nretrenchments   and   unemployment  to   the   employment\r\n\r\nassistance   programmes  like  the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme   (SRP)  and  the  People-for-Jobs  Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme  (PJTP).  We have also heard  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower  giving  figures of how many  Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nbenefited from these programmes.  But the reality remains\r\n\r\n-    75,000   or  more  Singapore  residents  are   still\r\n\r\nunemployed,  with one-third remaining unemployed  for  at\r\n\r\nleast  six  months.  We have seen the impact of prolonged\r\n\r\nunemployment  on  their self-esteem and on  their  family\r\n\r\nmembers  -  most importantly, on their survival and their\r\n\r\nability to meet basic needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes the setting up of an Agency that\r\n\r\nwill  consolidate the efforts targeted  at  ensuring  the\r\n\r\nSingapore resident workforce is competitive in the global\r\n\r\nmarket.  The Agency also aims to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure that Singaporeans remain employable for as long as\r\n\r\nthey  are  able  to. This is important at  a  time  where\r\n\r\nstreamlining  and retrenchments seem to be the  order  of\r\n\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of streamlining and consolidation, the\r\n\r\nproposed Agency brings together several divisions of  MOM\r\n\r\nand  other  related secretariats.  It is hoped that  this\r\n\r\nwill  further  enhance  our  efforts  at  addressing  the\r\n\r\nemployment  and  unemployment issues comprehensively  for\r\n\r\nthe whole must be bigger than the sum of its parts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the issues we are facing, and thus facing the\r\n\r\nWDA, go beyond helping Singaporeans remain employable and\r\n\r\ncompetitive.    No  one  wants  to  be  nor   to   remain\r\n\r\nunemployed.  The social support system that is  currently\r\n\r\nin  place is not a disincentive to work.  It is sometimes\r\n\r\nconfusing  when we read in media reports that  there  are\r\n\r\njobs  out  there but there are no takers, ie, the  common\r\n\r\ncomplaint  that Singaporeans are choosy and fussy.   Such\r\n\r\nattitude  is  apparently changing and it is certainly  an\r\n\r\nencouraging sign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the fundamental issue today is that there\r\n\r\nare  just  not  enough  jobs to go  around.   The  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister  tried very hard yesterday to explain  that  the\r\n\r\nfundamental issue is to bring the jobs back to Singapore.\r\n\r\nMOM's labour market report for the first quarter of  2003\r\n\r\nshowed that as at March this year, there were only 24 job\r\n\r\nvacancies  for  every  100  unemployed  persons.   If  we\r\n\r\nexclude the construction industry, the ratio was 21  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  every 100 unemployed persons.  I hope the figures  I\r\n\r\nam  citing are correct for they are obtained from the MOM\r\n\r\nwebsite, and I hope I am interpreting them correctly too.\r\n\r\nThe  reality today is \"jobs no enough\".  So no amount  of\r\n\r\nchanging  attitude towards jobs is going to help  if  the\r\n\r\njobs are just not available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Madam, WDA should seriously look at\r\n\r\nself-employment as an option for the unemployed.  We know\r\n\r\nthat the Self Employment Training Programme, or SET,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been introduced to help entrepreneurial Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  self-employment, creating jobs for themselves and for\r\n\r\nothers  in  the  process.   The  programme  is  currently\r\n\r\nmanaged  by  SNEF and I think WDA should further  enhance\r\n\r\nthe   outreach  of  this  programme  to  more  unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  In this regard, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  how successful has the programme  been  so  far\r\n\r\nsince  its  launch and what further support is needed  by\r\n\r\nthe budding entrepreneurs to facilitate their efforts  at\r\n\r\nstarting  up  a  business.  Will WDA look into  enhancing\r\n\r\nthis  programme  by  meeting the  other  needs  of  these\r\n\r\nbudding  entrepreneurs?  WDA should also look at  setting\r\n\r\nup  a  one-stop information and consultancy service where\r\n\r\nthese   budding  entrepreneurs  can  seek  the  necessary\r\n\r\nassistance.  For example, the unemployed who  intends  to\r\n\r\nstart   a   small   business  may  need   assistance   in\r\n\r\nparticipating in a simple tendering process.  WDA  should\r\n\r\nalso continually monitor and review governmental policies\r\n\r\nand  procedures that inhibit the process  of  setting  up\r\n\r\nsmall businesses here - the \"No Fishing\" sign highlighted\r\n\r\nby Dr Jennifer Lee earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in the last year or so, I have\r\n\r\nlost  count  of  the number of times  I  have  spoken  to\r\n\r\nresidents   about   the  importance   of   training   and\r\n\r\nretraining.  It has been a cliche, somewhat.  I  find  it\r\n\r\nhard  to  believe that while 80,000 people have benefited\r\n\r\nfrom   the  SRP,  we  still  have  thousands  who  remain\r\n\r\nunemployed.  It is not clear the proportion of those  who\r\n\r\nhave  undergone SRP through surrogate employers like NTUC\r\n\r\nand  the  other  self-help groups.  But official  figures\r\n\r\nshow very few participate in SRP through their employers.\r\n\r\nWhat  is clear is that I have heard repeatedly the lament\r\n\r\nof  many  residents about having gone for training  under\r\n\r\nthe  SRP but not able to secure jobs after that.  To such\r\n\r\nindividuals,  prolonged unemployment,  despite  conscious\r\n\r\neffort to train, retrain and seek jobs, will affect their\r\n\r\nsense of self-esteem and hope immensely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I think one weakness in the present provision\r\n\r\nfor training assistance is the catch-all, rigid structure\r\n\r\nof the training and retraining programmes.  Training\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes are developed by the authorities, MOM,  SPRING\r\n\r\nand  NTUC and while they design these programmes with the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the concerned industry in mind, they  may\r\n\r\nnot   be   fully   in  sync  with  the  latest   industry\r\n\r\nrequirement.   This is reflected in the Employer  Support\r\n\r\nTraining  2001 Survey conducted by MOM.  It was  reported\r\n\r\nthat  only  16% of the employers who sent their employees\r\n\r\nfor  training,  sent them under the  SRP.   It  was  also\r\n\r\nreported  that 48% of employers who sent their  employees\r\n\r\nfor  training and another half of those who did not  send\r\n\r\ntheir employees for training, gave the irrelevance of the\r\n\r\ntraining as the reason for not utilising the SRP.   Thus,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  send the employees for  training  or  not,\r\n\r\nalmost half find the training programmes not relevant  to\r\n\r\ntheir operations.  This, despite the SRP supporting  more\r\n\r\nthan  1,300  course  modules in  more  than  30  industry\r\n\r\nsectors!  Are we barking at the wrong tree?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, staying abreast of new industrial trends is\r\n\r\nimportant  as  most industries nowadays  face  a  shorter\r\n\r\nshelf-life of skills, hence relevant skills at a  certain\r\n\r\npoint  of  time  may  quickly become obsolete.   Training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  reflect  and address  the  varying  and\r\n\r\nconstantly  changing  demands  of  industries  are   thus\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several examples in the region that we can\r\n\r\nstudy  and  perhaps emulate in this regard.  Hong  Kong's\r\n\r\nEmployee  Retraining Board's \"Tailor-Made Programme\"  and\r\n\r\nAustralia's  \"New Apprenticeship\" programme are  examples\r\n\r\nwe  can  look at to better tailor training programmes  to\r\n\r\nsuit   industries'   needs.   Hong   Kong's   Tailor-Made\r\n\r\nProgramme   consists  of  ERB  and  the   training   body\r\n\r\ncollaborating  to  develop a training scheme  that  would\r\n\r\nequip  trainees with the exact skills most vital  to  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  and competitiveness of the industry.  The  \"New\r\n\r\nApprenticeship\" programme in Australia employed a similar\r\n\r\napproach  as  there  is  close  partnership  between  the\r\n\r\ntraining  bodies, the employers and employees  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthe  relevance  of the training programmes  and  for  all\r\n\r\nthree parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, another aspect of training and\r\n\r\nretraining  that the new Agency needs to address  is  the\r\n\r\nextent to which the workforce and the industry are  aware\r\n\r\nof  these  training and support programmes.   In  another\r\n\r\nMOM's  study  titled  \"Adult Re-training  2000\",  it  was\r\n\r\nreported  that only 33% of those surveyed  had  gone  for\r\n\r\ntraining.   Amongst these, only 12.5% reported  utilising\r\n\r\nfunding  from  the Government, primarily the  SDF.   More\r\n\r\nthan  one  third  had self-funded their  training,  while\r\n\r\nclose  to  60% had received partial or full support  from\r\n\r\ntheir  employers.  The perception, perhaps, is  that  one\r\n\r\nhas to find one's own funds to be trained or retrained  - thus  the lower rate of participation in training due  to\r\n\r\nlack  of  personal  funds.  This  lack  of  awareness  of\r\n\r\nsupport  programmes seems prevalent among  the  employers\r\n\r\ntoo,  with more than one third reporting not being  aware\r\n\r\nof the SRP, as reported in the 2001 survey on employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this is going to be the umpteenth time I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to  call  on  employers to do their  part  in  the\r\n\r\ntraining  and  employment  equation.   The  MOM's  survey\r\n\r\nhighlighted  that only 22% of the firms  surveyed  had  a\r\n\r\nformal  training  policy.  There is a strong  association\r\n\r\nbetween  having  a  formal training  policy  and  sending\r\n\r\nemployees for training.  I urge WDA to work closely  with\r\n\r\nthe  employers  and formulate some clear  guidelines  for\r\n\r\nemployers to have such policies.  Such guidelines  should\r\n\r\nalso  ensure  the  minimum period of  continual  training\r\n\r\nemployees  should be entitled to in a  given  year.   The\r\n\r\nwork place must provide the environment that promotes the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  lifelong learning to ensure that  the  workers\r\n\r\nconsequently internalise these values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, whenever a new agency or body is set up, much\r\n\r\nhype  and  hope  often surround it.  Discussions  revolve\r\n\r\naround stretching its potential and maximising its reach.\r\n\r\nWe  must  ensure  that this new agency lives  up  to  its\r\n\r\nmission  of  being a catalyst for the workforce  and  not\r\n\r\njust another bureaucratic set-up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, related to this issue is the current lack of\r\n\r\na  comprehensive  and complete database for  storing  job\r\n\r\nseeker's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation.   The  database  at  CareerLink   does   not\r\n\r\ncomprehensively  track  the  history  of  employment  and\r\n\r\ntraining   offered  to  a  job  seeker   with   essential\r\n\r\ninformation like detailed information of the courses  the\r\n\r\njob  seeker had attended, the personality profile or  his\r\n\r\nlevel of employability.  This results in difficulties  in\r\n\r\nprofiling  the  job seeker.  Without detailed  profiling,\r\n\r\nemplacement will be harder as the placement officer  will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to attain a good job match and placement due\r\n\r\nto  the lack of information.  I urge WDA to address  this\r\n\r\ngap in the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Agency will enhance the existing\r\n\r\nsystem  of assisting our unemployed workers.  This system\r\n\r\nmust  assist  the  workers  overcome  their  barriers  to\r\n\r\nsecuring employment.  It must ensure that programmes  and\r\n\r\nservices  are accessible.  It is not sufficient to  match\r\n\r\nthe qualification and experience of the job seeker to the\r\n\r\navailable jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for more qualified job counsellors\r\n\r\nto  provide a more comprehensive and systemic approach in\r\n\r\nhelping the job seeker be placed in a job.  There must be\r\n\r\na  thorough assessment process that will provide a better\r\n\r\npicture of the needs of the job seeker.  Indeed, the  job\r\n\r\ncounsellors  must  not  just facilitate  but  attempt  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the job seeker overcomes whatever  barriers\r\n\r\nthat are in his way of getting a job.  In this regard, we\r\n\r\ncan  study  the  examples  of Hong  Kong's  Job  Matching\r\n\r\nProgramme  and the UK's New Deal programme in  which  job\r\n\r\nsearch  support  follows up and monitors a  job  seeker's\r\n\r\nprogress till emplacement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, these barriers go beyond the need to improve\r\n\r\nthe  individual's skills set.  That can  be  overcome  by\r\n\r\nensuring that he gets the necessary training.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso  other  real  barriers that  arise  from  the  costs\r\n\r\nassociated  with  job  search.   Transportation  for  job\r\n\r\ninterviews,   work  clothes,  interpersonal   skills   in\r\n\r\npresenting oneself at job interviews are real barriers to\r\n\r\nthe  man  in the street seeking employment.  The barriers\r\n\r\nare heightened with increasing period of unemployment,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  his  self-esteem lowered and sense of  helplessness\r\n\r\nand frustration raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times, his financial obligation to his\r\n\r\ndependants  forms the bulk of his thought process  as  he\r\n\r\nconsiders  what job to take.  The Agency must  work  with\r\n\r\nthe  relevant  social support agencies in assisting  such\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is easy for us to tell the people to\r\n\r\ntighten  their  belts,  spend  less,  do  not  use  their\r\n\r\nairconditioning,  do not allow their  children  to  watch\r\n\r\ntelevision  too much, and take whatever job  that  comes.\r\n\r\nThe latter is a perennial problem encountered by many  of\r\n\r\nus  who  meet them - they are not willing to take up  the\r\n\r\njob  that is offered because sometimes it is hard to live\r\n\r\non  an  income of $1,000 or less as a cleaner, having  to\r\n\r\nsupport  a  wife and four school-going children.   Having\r\n\r\nbeen unemployed for some time, the arrears to some of the\r\n\r\nhousehold  expenditure  would already  have  accumulated,\r\n\r\nmaking the financial hardship more acute.  These are real\r\n\r\nissues  faced by the unemployed.  The WDA must  recognise\r\n\r\nthese   issues   and  make  available  a  more   systemic\r\n\r\nassessment of the needs of the unemployed for  it  to  be\r\n\r\neffective.  It must work closely with the CDCs and  other\r\n\r\nsocial   service   providers.    Today,   the   financial\r\n\r\nassistance schemes are pegged to the person's  effort  at\r\n\r\nseeking  employment.   It must  go  beyond  that.   Given\r\n\r\nsevere  shortage of jobs available, and to encourage  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  \"not  to  be  choosy\",  financial  assistance\r\n\r\nprogramme should address the shortage of the funds needed\r\n\r\nby the family to continue its functioning, even after the\r\n\r\nunemployed head of household accepts a job offer that may\r\n\r\npay  lower than his previous salary.  These are the  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  the  foreigners come here to do.  We can  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to take up these jobs.  Yes, it is  what  is\r\n\r\nleft on the buffet table as the Acting Minister suggested\r\n\r\nyesterday.  Yes, it may still be nutritious, but  it  may\r\n\r\nnot be enough for him to ta pau (pack) back and place  on\r\n\r\nthe dinner table for his family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, today financial assistance is generally\r\n\r\nstopped  once  the  person  is gainfully  employed.   The\r\n\r\nassistance for such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindividuals  must be provided based on the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   There  is thus a need for closer  collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween WDA and the CDCs and others in the social service\r\n\r\nsector  in this regard.  Otherwise, WDA will have a  hard\r\n\r\ntime  understanding  why the unemployed  individuals  are\r\n\r\nunwilling  to accept a particular job offer -  ending  up\r\n\r\nlabelling them as unmotivated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Madam, we have and are still going\r\n\r\nthrough  a  very  difficult patch in our country's  life.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  struggling to make  ends  meet.   Even\r\n\r\nthose who have jobs are struggling with pay cuts and  the\r\n\r\nthreats  of  retrenchment.  The setting  up  of  the  WDA\r\n\r\nprovides  a  ray of hope - with a more comprehensive  and\r\n\r\nsystematic effort at making our workers more world-ready.\r\n\r\nWe  have  asked  much  of  the people.   They  have  been\r\n\r\nswallowing  pills after pills, no matter how bitter.   We\r\n\r\nmust  understand and empathise with their  position.   We\r\n\r\nmust  provide an infrastructure that enhances their sense\r\n\r\nof  competence  in  managing the challenging  environment\r\n\r\nthrough this comprehensive programme of giving them  jobs\r\n\r\nand   assistance  wherever  necessary.   They  must  feel\r\n\r\nmastery over their destiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus imperative that the WDA work closely with\r\n\r\nthe   social   support  agencies  in  setting   up   this\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   system  that  will   achieve   the   dual\r\n\r\nobjectives  of ensuring the unemployed Singaporeans  take\r\n\r\nup the jobs and still be able to support their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we may teach them how to fish and they may\r\n\r\ntry hard to fish, but let us help them when the season is\r\n\r\nbad  and there is very little fish to catch for that  day\r\n\r\nand  what  they  catch is not sufficient  to  feed  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  It will give them the sense that life can  and\r\n\r\nshould  go  on,  and that tomorrow may be brighter,  with\r\n\r\nmore fish to catch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy   Speaker,  we  are  facing  the   challenges   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation.  There are two options open to us.  First,\r\n\r\nwe can be an ostrich and bury our head in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsand,  with the hope that when we take our head out  from\r\n\r\nthe  sand,  everything will be back to normal.   Then  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to become an ostrich again.  The next option\r\n\r\nis  to become the legendary phoenix.  Legend has it  that\r\n\r\nthe  phoenix jumped into the fire, and after the  baptism\r\n\r\nof  fire, it became born-again and re-emerged a glamorous\r\n\r\nand  dynamic \"fire phoenix\". Our choice is very  obvious.\r\n\r\nWe  want  to  be  a  phoenix.  But why?   We  often  hear\r\n\r\nSingaporeans complain about their unwillingness to take a\r\n\r\nmore difficult choice or embark on a more difficult task.\r\n\r\nYes, no doubt, it is difficult to make hard decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Workforce Development Agency\r\n\r\n(WDA)  now  is very timely. This will help our  workforce\r\n\r\nmake  the difficult but correct choice, thereby be a part\r\n\r\nof  our transformation to the new economy, and face   new\r\n\r\neconomic   challenges   associated  with   globalisation.\r\n\r\nHowever,  helping  our workforce to make  the  choice  of\r\n\r\ntransformation is never easy. First of all, the WDA  must\r\n\r\nproduce results to prove to our workforce and our workers\r\n\r\nhere,  to  persuade them that transformation is  possible\r\n\r\nand  restructuring is inevitable.  This is  something  we\r\n\r\nhave  to do, because this is the only way to ensure  that\r\n\r\nour   workforce   has  its  heart  in   Singapore.    All\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will be able to continue to have  jobs  and\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  good standard of living.  That is the only  way\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the attitude of the older workers and\r\n\r\npersuade  them to embrace lifelong learning  is  quite  a\r\n\r\ndifficult job.  But this is something we must do, whether\r\n\r\nwe  like it or not.  WDA is established with this  target\r\n\r\nin mind to convince Singaporeans to re-visit the offer of\r\n\r\njobs  and  the opportunity of retraining and  re-skilling\r\n\r\nwhich  they have previously declined.  However,  the  WDA\r\n\r\nmust first show some results through some real action  to\r\n\r\nbe  convincing. Only then, can they succeed  in  changing\r\n\r\nthe mindset of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the WDA should have a correct focus on our\r\n\r\nemployment   situation.   To  forecast  on   the   future\r\n\r\nemployment scenario is very difficult.  As the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister has said, we have to cooperate with the EDB  and\r\n\r\nother  Government  agencies  to  touch  ground  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  industries, so that we know their needs and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment trends in the various industries. Only  then,\r\n\r\ncan  we develop programmes to train our workers and equip\r\n\r\nthem  with  the  appropriate skills to  meet  the  future\r\n\r\nchallenges.   Otherwise, the training would be  in  vain.\r\n\r\nFor  example, if we manage to convince the workers to  be\r\n\r\ntrained  in   biochemistry which was thought  to  be  the\r\n\r\nindustry with great potential, and suddenly we find  that\r\n\r\nthis  industry  is not taking off, all the sacrifices  by\r\n\r\nthe  workers and resources invested therein  will  be  in\r\n\r\nvain. What is going to happen to the poor workers who are\r\n\r\nnow armed with irrelevant skills and no jobs?   This will\r\n\r\nthen  give  rise  to  yet  another  round  of  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the WDA should strive to\r\n\r\nprovide a one-stop service for all our workers.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, if Singapore workers want to learn, upgrade their\r\n\r\nskills or acquire new skills, they do not know whether to\r\n\r\ngo  to NTUC, SHRI, MOM, SPRING, IDA, or CDC. There are so\r\n\r\nmany  agencies  to  go to before they  can  identify  the\r\n\r\ncourses suitable to them. When they go to a website  they\r\n\r\nlook  at the SRP, OJT, PJTP, SMC and what have you, there\r\n\r\nis  a  whole  string  of acronyms.   There  are  so  many\r\n\r\ndifferent   training  schemes.   They  are  puzzled   and\r\n\r\nconfused.   As such, WDA must provide a one-stop  service\r\n\r\nwhich  is user-friendly. There should be specialists  who\r\n\r\nare  able to understand the market requirements and would\r\n\r\nbe  able to help the workers with proper counselling  and\r\n\r\nadvice,  and  match  them  with the  jobs  available  and\r\n\r\nsuitable to them. Arrangement should also be made to keep\r\n\r\na  register of those who are looking for a job, with  all\r\n\r\nthe  particulars fed into a database. Only then, will  it\r\n\r\nbe  encouraging  for the workers to accept  training  and\r\n\r\nembrace the culture of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I believe that most Singaporeans want to\r\n\r\nbecome phoenixes.  WDA is the agency that will help  them\r\n\r\nbecome phoenixes.  I firmly believe that so long\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas we have confidence in this transformation, despite the\r\n\r\ndifficulties and frustrations, we will be able to  remake\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and our workforce will become  even  stronger\r\n\r\nand  more competitive, to justify our ranking as a world-class workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Madam, when I\r\n\r\nfirst  read  the  name of the new Agency,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Workforce  Development Agency,  I  thought  it\r\n\r\nsmacks   a   little   bit  of  the  1960s.    But   after\r\n\r\ndeliberations in this House earlier and when  the  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister for Manpower ensured the House that this  Agency\r\n\r\nwill  be devoted to the mission of developing Singapore's\r\n\r\nhuman  capital and add value to our workforce, I am  much\r\n\r\nheartened, and I fully support this Bill with  no  change\r\n\r\nof  name because I think a rose with any name is just  as\r\n\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human capital, without doubt, is the most valuable\r\n\r\nhuman  resource we have in Singapore and WDA is entrusted\r\n\r\nwith  the  role  of enhancing the value of  our  national\r\n\r\nwealth.   We  very  much support that  from  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   There  are discussions from yesterday  and  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  today where many of us lament on the  loss  of\r\n\r\njobs  in  Singapore.  This is a mega trend affecting  not\r\n\r\nonly Singapore but in the US and there is little that  we\r\n\r\ncan  do  as a nation and we have to look at the  positive\r\n\r\nside  on  how  to  increase  the  employability  of   our\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we really do not want to see, after the\r\n\r\nformation of WDA, is a society in Singapore where we  are\r\n\r\nchasing papers.  We could get more training, we could get\r\n\r\nmore  certificates, but it would be very dampening if  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  result in the outcome which we want, which  is\r\n\r\ncontinual  employability.  In order to do what  WDA  sets\r\n\r\nout  to do, which is to enhance our human capital and get\r\n\r\nthem  employed, I think we need to change  not  only  the\r\n\r\nmindset  on the part of the WDA, in terms of its mission,\r\n\r\nbut also on the part of our local talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have earlier spoken widely about the\r\n\r\ntraining and retraining of women, the blue collar as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell  as the elderly.  I would just want to spend  a  few\r\n\r\nminutes  talking about the white collar.  The first  wave\r\n\r\nof  unemployment that has hit the US was the loss of jobs\r\n\r\nfor  the  blue  collar, which is what we  have  faced  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The next wave of job losses in the US is  the\r\n\r\nloss of jobs for the white collar and something which  is\r\n\r\non  the horizon for the Singapore workforce.  So I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  spend a few minutes talking about  the  mindset\r\n\r\nchanges that we need to make for the local talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw in the papers recently that many young\r\n\r\ngraduates  are  still not employed.  Many  graduates  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals are finding it difficult to get jobs, and I\r\n\r\nhave   seen   over   a  hundred  Bachelor   of   Business\r\n\r\nAdministration and MBA programmes in the market.   People\r\n\r\nare  being  upgraded and they are getting  educated,  but\r\n\r\nthey  still  cannot find jobs.  How do  we  address  this\r\n\r\nissue?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major part of the change in the mindset of the\r\n\r\ngraduates  and the professional workforce  is  that  they\r\n\r\nmust  realise  that jobs now do not move  on  a  vertical\r\n\r\npath, meaning that you do not get a job because you  have\r\n\r\na  certain  degree  or qualification and  you  expect  to\r\n\r\nprogressively move up the organisational structure.   The\r\n\r\nprofessional  workforce must realise that  they  have  to\r\n\r\ndevelop distinct competencies other than the degrees  and\r\n\r\nbeing  able to work in project groups because the careers\r\n\r\nof the future actually move along a horizontal bend where\r\n\r\nthe  professionals group together looking  for  projects,\r\n\r\nthey  succeed  in  the  projects,  make  themselves  more\r\n\r\nmarketable,  and  they can get on to  bigger  and  better\r\n\r\nprojects, thereby enhancing their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scenario of the future, very much like in\r\n\r\nthe  movie-making business.  Nobody employs all the movie\r\n\r\nstars, all the technicians, all the crew members all  the\r\n\r\ntime.  The studios cannot afford to do that.  Every  time\r\n\r\na new movie is being contemplated, a cast is put together\r\n\r\nand that cast works together for 10 months, 24 months, it\r\n\r\nneeds to make the movie, the cast disbands and moves  on.\r\n\r\nI think\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity for the white collar of  the  future  is\r\n\r\nvery much going to be project-based.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is that whilst we are talking about\r\n\r\nenhancing the employability of our local talent, we  also\r\n\r\nmust  be mindful that, whilst the Government and the  EDB\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  bring jobs to Singapore  by  encouraging\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  Singapore, this is not going  to  be  the\r\n\r\neasiest  route.   So  I  hope WDA would  also  look  into\r\n\r\ntraining  our  Singapore  talent  for  the  regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational markets.  Singaporeans must feel that  they\r\n\r\nhave  that distinct competency, the skills, the knowledge\r\n\r\nset  that  they  can go out of Singapore  to  find  jobs,\r\n\r\ndevelop even more skills and experiences and come back to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  thereby enriching our Singapore  talent  pool\r\n\r\nwith  more  depth  and  breadth.   So  that  would  be  a\r\n\r\nchallenge  our  local talent needs to develop.   And  for\r\n\r\nthose of our local professionals and white collar who are\r\n\r\nstill  employed, they must continue to enrich  themselves\r\n\r\nand  think  about  re-engineering themselves  and  adding\r\n\r\nvalue   to  the  workplace.   Very  few  companies  would\r\n\r\nretrench  a  staff who can continuously bring new  value,\r\n\r\nideas  and  new markets to the company.  And one  of  the\r\n\r\nbest  ways of avoiding retrenchment is to make sure  that\r\n\r\nyou are not obsolete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of WDA, I have no doubt, would be much more\r\n\r\nefficient  than  what  we  have now,  which  is  multiple\r\n\r\nagencies  working in collaboration for the same  outcome.\r\n\r\nThe problem-solving abilities of the management team that\r\n\r\nWDA has put together, I have no doubt that it would be  a\r\n\r\nvery capable team.  But in today's competitive world,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  enough to be just efficient.  I would hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  team  at WDA will not be happy by asking themselves:\r\n\r\nare  we doing things right?  Because in this day and age,\r\n\r\ndoing  things right, you can still go very  wrong.   What\r\n\r\nthe  team should be looking at is asking themselves:  are\r\n\r\nwe   doing   the  right  thing?   Because  the   business\r\n\r\nenvironment changes tremendously and fast these days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WDA team, we hope, would develop a much more\r\n\r\nconceptual and strategic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthinking  mindset  and  always  asking  not  only   about\r\n\r\nefficiency,  but what other values that we can  bring  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  value  of our human capital  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBecause  we need to look at employability, not  only  for\r\n\r\nthe  current industries, current jobs, but also for newer\r\n\r\nchallenges and future jobs.  We hope that the team  would\r\n\r\nscan  the  environment regionally and internationally  to\r\n\r\nfind   new   niches  and  to  study  these   new   market\r\n\r\nopportunities and study their feasibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read, and my colleagues have mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  that in the US nowadays, white-collar jobs  are\r\n\r\nmoving  offshore.   They are moving to India  and  China.\r\n\r\nWhilst  our wages may not be as competitive or as low  as\r\n\r\nin  China  and India, I think Singapore and the Singapore\r\n\r\nbrand  of professionals do carry a premium value.  So,  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge SWDA to consider a study into the possibility\r\n\r\nof  forming large manpower firms.  If jobs are not coming\r\n\r\nto  Singapore, we have to go out and find  the  jobs  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Can we form these big manpower  firms,  go\r\n\r\nto  the  US  and compete for the outsourcing  of  certain\r\n\r\nbusiness functions that the US firms now want to contract\r\n\r\nout  because the cost of conducting these services in the\r\n\r\nUS is too expensive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, we have known that US firms and banks\r\n\r\nare  sending  out  all  the backroom  operations  in  the\r\n\r\nbanking  industry to India.  Cost centres have  now  been\r\n\r\nset up in India and the Philippines.  The next wave would\r\n\r\nbe the outsourcing of specific HR, finance and accounting\r\n\r\nfunctions.  There are opportunities and we should look at\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of these manpower firms that will compete\r\n\r\nwith   Chinese  and  Indian  counterparts   to   be   the\r\n\r\noutsourcing   centres  for  some  of   these   functions.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  a terrific brand name, our  professionals\r\n\r\nare  recognised worldwide for their competencies,  and  I\r\n\r\ncan  envisage  that, if we try to develop these  manpower\r\n\r\nfirms,  we  can  successfully compete for,  for  example,\r\n\r\naccountancy services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Singapore's cost will still be higher than\r\n\r\nthose in India and China, but if we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  able to produce superior customer service, companies\r\n\r\nin  the  US  may  be willing to pay a 15-20%  premium  to\r\n\r\noutsource the services to Singapore companies rather than\r\n\r\nthe ones in India or China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWDA has put together a very long list of things\r\n\r\nthat it wants to do, and whilst I appreciate the ambition\r\n\r\nof  SWDA  to be a one-stop shop to satisfy the  training,\r\n\r\njob matching and employment-seeking activities in today's\r\n\r\ndifficult environment, I would like to urge SWDA to focus\r\n\r\non  policy  issues  and on looking  for  new  niches  and\r\n\r\nopportunities,  and to work with the  private  sector  in\r\n\r\nfulfilling some of these needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the Singapore Workforce Development\r\n\r\nAgency  is  indeed  timely as Singapore restructures  its\r\n\r\neconomy  to  cope  with globalisation.   With  increasing\r\n\r\ncompetition,  there is an urgent need  for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  new  niches in its only key strategic  resource,\r\n\r\nie,  human  resource.  The formation  of  the  SWDA  will\r\n\r\nprovide a one-stop agency to help Singaporeans to develop\r\n\r\ntheir skills to enhance their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of the Skills Development Fund,\r\n\r\nCritical  Enabling Skills Training (CREST)  and  National\r\n\r\nSkills Recognition System (NSRS) as proposed by the Bill,\r\n\r\nwill   further   facilitate  skills   development   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The Agency will have more flexibility  and\r\n\r\nbe  able  to respond much faster to global market changes\r\n\r\nwhich  affect  our  economy and our  workforce.   In  the\r\n\r\nglobal  economy,  speed of change is of  the  essence  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  competitive  advantage  and  increase  business\r\n\r\nprofitability.   In  Singapore, we  have  to  continually\r\n\r\nstrive to keep our business cost competitive and, at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, focus our efforts to enhance the value of  our\r\n\r\nhuman capital.  Otherwise, our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  will not be able to command a reasonable  salary\r\n\r\nto sustain a good quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Singapore is faced with an aging workforce\r\n\r\nand  increased  competition  from  many  countries.    To\r\n\r\nsustain  its long-term economic growth, we must  identify\r\n\r\nniche  areas  in  both our local market  and  the  global\r\n\r\nmarket.

But  is  our  present\r\n\r\nworkforce ready to support and drive these two industries\r\n\r\nto world-class standards?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the experience of the Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  in job assistance services, we find  that  many\r\n\r\njob seekers, especially those aged 45 years and above, do\r\n\r\nnot  have the relevant skills or appropriate mindset  for\r\n\r\nmany  jobs  in the manufacturing and services industries.\r\n\r\nThis  is a real concern.  Employers also find these older\r\n\r\nworkers to be slow in learning and some are unwilling  to\r\n\r\nwork in certain work environments, such as shift work  or\r\n\r\nclean  rooms.   This situation will worsen  if  companies\r\n\r\ncontinue to improve their business operations with higher\r\n\r\ntechnology, and our older workers remain slow in learning\r\n\r\nthe  relevant skills.  At present, we are faced with such\r\n\r\nskills and mindset mismatch problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rapid globalisation, industries and companies\r\n\r\nwill change more rapidly in the future.  Our workers will\r\n\r\nface  structural unemployment more frequently, if  we  do\r\n\r\nnot   plan   the  skills  development  of  our  workforce\r\n\r\nproperly.   Therefore, we need to adopt  a  flexible  and\r\n\r\nsustainable approach towards developing our human capital\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  We must develop a quality workforce which\r\n\r\nis  of  world-class standard.  The desired outcome  of  a\r\n\r\nworld-class  workforce should be one  that  is  diligent,\r\n\r\npositive  and  flexible.   Our workforce  must  have  the\r\n\r\nability to respond quickly to the changing needs  of  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace.  With an agile workforce, we will be able to\r\n\r\nseize more opportunities in the global economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, how do we enhance the employability of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  We need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  adopt three different strategies for three categories\r\n\r\nof adult learners/workers, namely:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The employed, ie, the existing workers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The unemployed job seekers; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The potential entrants to our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective, we must understand the needs and\r\n\r\naspirations of these three groups of adult learners.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we must help them overcome  the  various\r\n\r\nconstraints  they  face  and  facilitate  their  learning\r\n\r\nprocesses.   I would like to suggest three strategies  in\r\n\r\ntraining and nurturing a world-class workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Place and Train schemes for unemployed job\r\n\r\nseekers.  We should place more emphasis to encourage more\r\n\r\ncompanies to adopt Place and Train schemes, such  as  the\r\n\r\nPeople-on-the-Job Traineeship scheme (PJTP).   This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  our  unemployed  job  seekers  to  return  to   the\r\n\r\nworkforce as quickly as possible.  I understand that more\r\n\r\nthan  5,000  firms have participated in the PJTP  scheme,\r\n\r\nbenefiting  over  12,000 Singaporeans.   We  can  further\r\n\r\nexpand  this  scheme  to  all  strategic  industries   to\r\n\r\nencourage more Singaporeans to upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More support and incentives should be given to firms\r\n\r\nwhich  are  providing on-the-job training.  Such  schemes\r\n\r\nwill  provide  better opportunities for  job  seekers  to\r\n\r\nlearn  new  skills faster and apply them  immediately  in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  jobs.  It will  also  enable  the  job\r\n\r\nseekers  to  earn  an  income  while  undergoing   skills\r\n\r\ntraining.  This will provide better incentives  for  them\r\n\r\nto   make   changes  and  adjustments   in   their   work\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Besides providing incentives for firms,  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  render support to job seekers who  take  up\r\n\r\nPlace  and Train jobs.  I would like to propose giving  a\r\n\r\nspecial   or   start-up  allowance  to   encourage   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  join  those strategic  industries  with\r\n\r\nPlace and Train schemes.  In addition, the Government can\r\n\r\nsupport   firms   to   recognise   their   long   service\r\n\r\ncontribution of their workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Continuing Skills Development for the\r\n\r\nemployed,  ie,  existing  workers.   In  order  to  avoid\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment, we need to develop a passion for\r\n\r\nlifelong learning among our workers.  Both employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees  must constantly identify new skills to  learn,\r\n\r\nso  as to keep pace with developments in their respective\r\n\r\nindustries.   Continuing  skills  development  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  among  workers so as to  keep  our  workforce\r\n\r\nequipped  with  the relevant skills for  competition  and\r\n\r\nemployability  purposes.  But, how do we  facilitate  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing  skills development efforts  of  our  workers?\r\n\r\nAnd how can we incentivise employers to continually train\r\n\r\nand upgrade the skills of their employees?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we need to allow more flexibility for workers\r\n\r\nto  learn new skills, both within and outside their  work\r\n\r\nenvironment.  One key motivation of any adult learner  is\r\n\r\nthe recognition of the skills they learn.  We must review\r\n\r\nour  National  Skills Recognition System to increase  its\r\n\r\nacceptance  among employers.  At the same time,  we  must\r\n\r\nalso  have better quality control of the training service\r\n\r\nproviders  and  the respective testing bodies  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat high standards are attained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies must also make efforts to adopt best\r\n\r\npractices and document their work processes to facilitate\r\n\r\ntraining  and  retraining of their staff.   In  addition,\r\n\r\nthey  should be encouraged to continually redesign  their\r\n\r\nwork  processes  so as to enhance the value  of  work  of\r\n\r\ntheir workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, self-learning for potential entrants to\r\n\r\nworkforce.   To be a world-class workforce,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nwiden  the scope of learning of our workforce, especially\r\n\r\nnew entrants to the industry.  Lateral thinking, creative\r\n\r\nlearning  and various self-improvement skills  should  be\r\n\r\nintroduced to adult learners more comprehensively.  These\r\n\r\nlearning  opportunities  must be  readily  available  and\r\n\r\nflexible enough to allow adult learners to seize.   Faced\r\n\r\nwith various constraints, such as work and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamily commitments, adult learners often cannot find time\r\n\r\nto  self-learn new skills or knowledge.  There is a  need\r\n\r\nto  set up a network of physical and virtual training  or\r\n\r\nlearning  institutions.  The use of IT  will  provide  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  platform for self-learning.  More  interactive\r\n\r\non-line  learning  should  be introduced  so  that  adult\r\n\r\nlearners can expand their knowledge and expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must provide more opportunities for our\r\n\r\nworkers  to  learn  creative and self-improvement  skills\r\n\r\nearly,  especially  when they are  young  and  energetic.\r\n\r\nThis will enable them to apply these skills in their work\r\n\r\nearlier  and gain more experience to add value  to  their\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the Bill, and I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Workforce Development Agency will  provide\r\n\r\nan  integrated solution to nurture the development of our\r\n\r\nhuman resource.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, I will make this speech as  short  as  I\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I support the SWDA Bill, and I believe that\r\n\r\nit  will  allow better focus to be placed on training  of\r\n\r\nour workforce so that they remain relevant.  As an Agency\r\n\r\nsolely dedicated to oversee the welfare of our workforce,\r\n\r\nit  will definitely be in a better position to facilitate\r\n\r\nemployment   and  implement  measures  to   protect   the\r\n\r\ninterests of Singaporeans, both in terms of employment as\r\n\r\nwell as business sustainability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over yesterday's session, we had heard many Members\r\n\r\nvoice concerns that foreigners are taking away jobs  from\r\n\r\nthe  locals.   However, I would like to  present  another\r\n\r\nview, ie, the view as seen from the business sector.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, I would like to quote the example of  local\r\n\r\ntextile  companies.  I know that this  is  an  unpleasant\r\n\r\ntaboo  subject, but I feel the need to speak up on  their\r\n\r\nbehalf because they do play a part in our economy as well\r\n\r\nas provide employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore, the textile industry is viewed as a sunset\r\n\r\nindustry.  It is not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nglamorous,  and  certainly not  hip.   Most  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould not want to work in such companies.  However,  some\r\n\r\nof  these  firms are profitable, and whatever  employment\r\n\r\npolicy  we  implement, we should make an effort  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that such companies stay afloat.  I personally know\r\n\r\nof  one  local  textile company which employs  about  900\r\n\r\nworkers.  Of these, 600 are locals and the remaining  300\r\n\r\nare  Malaysians.  This  company  has  been  operating  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for more than 20 years now. Many of these  600\r\n\r\nlocal workers have been with the firm for a long time now\r\n\r\nand  most  are  close to retirement.  When these  workers\r\n\r\nretire, younger ones need to be recruited. This is  where\r\n\r\nthe  firm  has  been facing an uphill task in  recruiting\r\n\r\nlocals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss told me that when they tried to employ\r\n\r\nthose  retrenched  workers from the  hi-tech  industries,\r\n\r\nsuch   as   the  electronics  industry,  many  were   not\r\n\r\ninterested to join them and often, the reason  cited  was\r\n\r\nthat  these Singaporeans felt that working in  a  textile\r\n\r\ncompany is just not the \"in\" thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that their workers earn wages ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  $1,500  to  $3,000 a month per  worker,  with  8-10\r\n\r\nworking hours per day on the average.  They are facing  a\r\n\r\nmajor  problem in recruiting workers, while they continue\r\n\r\nto  receive  good  orders from the USA and  Europe.  This\r\n\r\ncompany is earning money from overseas and bringing  this\r\n\r\nmoney back to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remain competitive and maintain profitability,\r\n\r\nthey  need a minimum workforce. Unfortunately,  over  the\r\n\r\npast  few years, the number of workers employed here  has\r\n\r\nfallen  from  1,200  to  900  due  to  an  ageing   local\r\n\r\nworkforce.   The alternative is for the firm to  wrap  up\r\n\r\nhere  and move elsewhere totally.  However, the boss  has\r\n\r\nnot  pulled out altogether, because he is considerate for\r\n\r\nhis  long-time local employees and he knows that once  he\r\n\r\ncloses down his factory here, these 600 workers would  be\r\n\r\nout  of  job.   Hence,  while  he  expands  his  business\r\n\r\noverseas,  he  hopes to continue to operate  his  factory\r\n\r\nhere for as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may think that such companies belong to the\r\n\r\nsunset industry, but we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust recognise that they do play a role here in providing\r\n\r\nemployment,  as  well  as inject into  the  economy.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the company ships all their textiles  overseas.\r\n\r\nHence, they need transportation and shipping companies to\r\n\r\nhandle  their  goods. This creates business opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  these associated business partners and, in turn,  it\r\n\r\nalso provides employment opportunities. In addition,  the\r\n\r\nannual  revenue is more than S$100 million.   Thus,  they\r\n\r\nalso,   for  example,  provide  good  business  for   the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector.  I would like to know how WDA can  help\r\n\r\nsuch companies in their workforce problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the WDA would not only focus on the\r\n\r\ninterests of the local workers and partnership with  MNCs\r\n\r\nand  services industries, but also consider the  business\r\n\r\ninterest  of some local SME companies, such as this.   If\r\n\r\nwe do not take care of this type of business, there is no\r\n\r\nemployment  to  talk  about in the first  place  and  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing retraining effort would be irrelevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, my friends in the private sector complain\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Government is overly-protective of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  workers  and  hence,  we  have  cultivated   a\r\n\r\npopulation  that  is picky and spoilt when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\nworking conditions and environment.  I hope that the  WDA\r\n\r\nwould  seek inputs from the private sector when it  comes\r\n\r\nto  recommending policies that would affect not just  the\r\n\r\nSingapore workforce, but also the business sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that WDA would put some of these old\r\n\r\nindustries in their radar screen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, as Members have\r\n\r\nbeen asked to be brief, I should try to be equally brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply heartened by the overwhelming positive\r\n\r\nresponse  from  the many Members who have supported  this\r\n\r\nBill.   I think we have all agreed that we need a central\r\n\r\ncoordinating  body  such  as  the  Workforce  Development\r\n\r\nAgency.  I  have been heartened by Members' comments  and\r\n\r\npositive  response.   In fact, I was  keeping  a  running\r\n\r\ncommentary of the adjectives on the Workforce Development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgency.  Adjectives  have been used - timely,  necessary,\r\n\r\nbetter  focus  for  training, unqualified  support,  much\r\n\r\nheartened.  We have been called \"a breath of fresh  air\",\r\n\r\n\"a  ray  of  hope\", \"a rose\", except one,  when  we  were\r\n\r\ncalled  \"a  spade\".  To Mr Chiam, the WDA does  not  mind\r\n\r\nbeing  a  spade if it helps him to dig a hole  in  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir.   We  would be a spade to help his  residents  get\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many suggestions, too many. In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  think  my staff downstairs are  now  scratching\r\n\r\ntheir  heads and going crazy and saying, \"My golly!  What\r\n\r\nhave  we  gotten ourselves into?\"  We would have to  take\r\n\r\ntime to take all these numerous suggestions, look at them\r\n\r\nseriously,  compartmentalise them,  priortise  them,  and\r\n\r\ndecide what we can do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like just to spend a few minutes explaining\r\n\r\nwhat our main role is.  As a Member quite rightly pointed\r\n\r\nout,  we cannot be all things to all men.  Employment  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  single agency's objective.  It is many  agencies.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are  very clear on what WDA's main role  is.  We\r\n\r\nwould   be   the  champion  for  Singaporeans'  workforce\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Yes, as Ms Olivia Lum said, there would  be\r\n\r\nother agencies that need to champion various sectors  and\r\n\r\nvarious  industries remaining in Singapore.  But  we  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  pro-Singaporeans because this is the  way  we\r\n\r\ncan  help Singaporeans keep their jobs.  But it does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that,  as an overall administration, we  would  not\r\n\r\nalso help other sectors remain here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WDA seeks to be the hub that would bring all these\r\n\r\nspokes  of  training,  all  these  various  agencies,  in\r\n\r\nalignment,  so that training would be better coordinated.\r\n\r\nAs a hub, it seeks to provide an integrated framework for\r\n\r\nall  the  training  providers to articulate  the  various\r\n\r\nparts  can  fit into a whole.  It is Singaporean  worker-centric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I understand some concerns about what we\r\n\r\nare  taking  from SPRING and what we are leaving  behind.\r\n\r\nSPRING would continue to exist as it focuses on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies at national level.  But when it comes to worker\r\n\r\ntraining,  we  would put the integrated programmes  under\r\n\r\none whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about changing mindsets and\r\n\r\nimparting   attitudes.   I  agree.  That  is   absolutely\r\n\r\ncritical.   But as I have realised, that is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nhardest aspects to do and it is not a point in time  when\r\n\r\nyou  can  say  that  you have done  it  and  people  have\r\n\r\nunderstood.  It is a continuous process.  So  while  much\r\n\r\nof  that has to go on, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon said, lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning,  Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Ong Kian Min,  Dr  Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee,  of  trying  to  change the  mindset  of  employees,\r\n\r\nemployers,  changing stereotypes, WDA would  continue  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on certain aspects.  As I have said, we will build\r\n\r\nthe  skills, resilience and the agility of the workforce.\r\n\r\nWe  will  have to map skills. Yes, we will also  have  to\r\n\r\nteach  Singaporeans  both the  hard  and  soft  skills  - literacy  skills,  critical  thinking  skills,  teamwork,\r\n\r\ninternationalisation  skills.  As   Dr   Gan   See   Khem\r\n\r\nsuggested,   we  have  a  Strategic  Manpower  Conversion\r\n\r\nProgramme for internationalisation efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of it, we must make training not only\r\n\r\nmore  effective  but more believable.  Singaporeans  must\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  training  makes  a  difference.    I   can\r\n\r\nunderstand why Mr Chiam See Tong feels that it may not be\r\n\r\neffective.    We  would  not  discriminate  against   his\r\n\r\nresidents  in Potong Pasir and, in fact, I encourage  his\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers in Potong Pasir to come  to  WDA  and\r\n\r\nprove  him  wrong that if we can find them a  job,  train\r\n\r\nthem, it would make him believe.  At the end of the  day,\r\n\r\nthat is what must be delivered. We must stop training for\r\n\r\ntraining's sake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all of you have said, we must be market-responsive, industry-relevant. We have to take this very\r\n\r\nseriously because, at the end of it all, there may not be\r\n\r\nenough jobs for new entrants if we do not upgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we will strengthen this nexus between\r\n\r\ntraining and employment and we will place priority on job-seekers and target them to fill specific positions. We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill work with the industry.  Yes, as Dr Teo Ho Pin said,\r\n\r\nwe  will put more place and train programmes and we  will\r\n\r\nfind  people jobs and give them the relevant skills  they\r\n\r\nneed.  We will tie training with financial assistance and\r\n\r\nother measures that he has talked about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to focus on some special groups that\r\n\r\nMembers   have   mentioned.   Yes,  we  will   focus   on\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  executives, managers to  cope.  We  would\r\n\r\nalso  help  those  who  want  to  be  self-employed,  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, the older workers. All this  needs  to  be\r\n\r\ndone.   They are too numerous and I do not intend  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  details.  But they are on our radar screen  and  we\r\n\r\nwould take all your comments into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end off by saying that the WDA cannot be\r\n\r\nall  things  to  all  men.  In  fact,  that  would  be  a\r\n\r\ndisastrous  starting point. We want to be  very  focused.\r\n\r\nYes,  the  point  of  focus  would  be  how  do  we   get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans jobs.  We must never lose sight of it.   But\r\n\r\nwe  are  also mindful that to fulfill that objective,  we\r\n\r\nwould need to work with many agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would reiterate my\r\n\r\nlast  point  that  we  would require the  same  unanimous\r\n\r\nsupport   and  cooperation  of  workers,  employers   and\r\n\r\nstrategic  partners to tackle this problem  of  workforce\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and  unemployment.   We  must  meet  our\r\n\r\nchallenges head-on, but together, we can renew heightened\r\n\r\nhopes  to our workforce to help them stay employable  and\r\n\r\neven more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can the Minister please comment\r\n\r\non   this  issue  of  discrimination  against  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, we understand\r\n\r\nthe dynamics that occur at the workplace and our approach\r\n\r\nis that, yes, there is a preference for certain employers\r\n\r\nas they do.  We do not think legislation is the way to go\r\n\r\nnow.   We  believe  in  equipping the  workers  with  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  skills, sometimes, we may want  to  aid  them,\r\n\r\nlike our People-for-Jobs Traineeship Scheme where we  pay\r\n\r\nhalf the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsalary for six months, and that is to allow the worker to\r\n\r\nprove  himself,  because  that is  sustainable.  We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  these efforts and with some  success,  we\r\n\r\nhave  placed  12,000 workers in that scheme.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat we can do much more in those fields.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Dr Ng Eng Hen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 50 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Schedule ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Schedule -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Acting Minister for Manpower has\r\n\r\ngiven  notice  of  an  amendment to this  Schedule.

The deletion of sub-paragraph (b) to\r\n\r\nthe  section was originally proposed, as a new  statutory\r\n\r\nboard   is   intended  to  be  the  primary  organisation\r\n\r\nresponsible for development and upgrading of  skills  and\r\n\r\nexpertise of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkforce.
