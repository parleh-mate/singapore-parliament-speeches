In the first five months  of  this\r\n\r\nyear  509 teachers, or only 2.6 per cent of the entire\r\n\r\nteaching  force of 19,200 teachers, were  transferred.\r\n\r\nOf  this  number, 352 transfers, or 70 per cent,  were\r\n\r\neffected  during the first two months as a  result  of\r\n\r\ntransfers  of  pupils at the request of parents.  Such\r\n\r\ntransfers  are  unavoidable because my Ministry  makes\r\n\r\nevery  effort to satisfy the wishes of parents in  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of school for pupils who are entering  primary\r\n\r\nor  secondary school for the first time. Consequently,\r\n\r\nthe number of classes authorised and the corresponding\r\n\r\nnumber of teachers assigned to each school at the  end\r\n\r\nof  the  previous  year have to  be  adjusted  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of each school year. Moreover, the choice of\r\n\r\na  second  language and the number and type of  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  teachers needed for a particular school  can\r\n\r\nonly  be ascertained when the pupils have settled down\r\n\r\nafter the transfer exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these unavoidable transfers at the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of the year, there are other reasons  which\r\n\r\naccount for transfers on a small scale throughout  the\r\n\r\nyear.  These  include the secondment  of  teachers  to\r\n\r\nother  Ministries and statutory boards; adjustment  in\r\n\r\nthe  staffing quota as a result of trainees  qualified\r\n\r\nas  trained  teachers and, consequently, taking  in  a\r\n\r\nfull teaching load; changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  curriculum  resulting in  different  staffing\r\n\r\nneeds; and requests from the teachers themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers at an instant's notice by telephone calls\r\n\r\nare made only when the situation warrants such action,\r\n\r\nas  when  a  vacancy is created by death or unexpected\r\n\r\nretirement, or when teachers are rendered redundant in\r\n\r\none school while classes in another school are without\r\n\r\nteachers as a result of a mass transfer of pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of my Ministry is to keep transfers of\r\n\r\nteachers  down to a minimum consistent with the  needs\r\n\r\nof  the  schools  and the interest of the  pupils.  To\r\n\r\nminimise   the  number  of  transfers,   my   Ministry\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  new  scheme last year  whereby  primary\r\n\r\nteachers with at least five years' teaching experience\r\n\r\ncould  opt for a transfer to a school of their  choice\r\n\r\non  the  understanding  that the  Ministry  would  not\r\n\r\ntransfer  them  out for the next five years,  and  the\r\n\r\nteachers  themselves  would not  ask  for  a  transfer\r\n\r\nduring these five years unless the circumstances  were\r\n\r\naltogether exceptional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 257 teachers who applied, 200 were accepted\r\n\r\nunder this five-year no transfer scheme. However, with\r\n\r\nthe  greater  emphasis  on  technical  and  vocational\r\n\r\neducation, the consequential transfer of students from\r\n\r\nthe  academic to the technical stream and the proposed\r\n\r\nconversion   of  vocational  schools  into  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining  centres, more transfers of teachers  in  the\r\n\r\nnext two or three years will be inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCHOOL PRINCIPALS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Duties)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

During  the first five months  of  this  year,\r\n\r\nschools  were  requested  to  submit  a  total  of  82\r\n\r\nreturns. This cannot by any stretch of the imagination\r\n\r\nbe  regarded as an unduly large number in view of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  my  Ministry administers 593 schools  with\r\n\r\n19,160  teachers, 2,550 non-teaching staff and 530,000\r\n\r\nstudents. The majority of the returns are of an annual\r\n\r\nrecurrent nature, such as those relating to staff  and\r\n\r\nstudent   data  for  the  purpose  of  compiling   the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  statistical bulletins, nominal  rolls  for\r\n\r\nthe  four  streams  for  15  school  examinations   at\r\n\r\ndifferent   levels  -  the  Primary   School   Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination, the School Certificate, the Higher School\r\n\r\nCertificate,    the   Secondary   Vocational    School\r\n\r\nCertificate,   the   National   Language   Certificate\r\n\r\nexaminations;   returns  in  respect   of   bursaries,\r\n\r\nscholarships and training awards; and returns  seeking\r\n\r\nthe   schools'  proposals  for  special  or  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  the preparation of the  next  year's\r\n\r\nbudget  estimates.

That is to  say,  Pre-University  I  students in non-English  schools\r\n\r\nare doing Secondary III English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Since 1965 special in-service courses in the\r\n\r\nteaching  of English as a second language  have\r\n\r\nbeen  conducted for teachers of English in non-English  schools. Of the 1,292 English teachers\r\n\r\nin   Chinese  schools,  794  have  successfully\r\n\r\ncompleted  the  course  and  another  402   are\r\n\r\ncurrently undergoing training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Of the 212 teachers of English currently\r\n\r\nteaching  in 21 Chinese secondary schools  with\r\n\r\nPre-University classes, 26 are graduates;  five\r\n\r\nhave   had  special  training  abroad  in   the\r\n\r\nteaching  of English as a second language,  and 14  \r\n\r\npossess  the Higher School Certificate.

Accordingly, the small drains  around\r\n\r\ncongested  hawker areas in Joo Chiat  and  Katong  are\r\n\r\nflushed every day, while in some less congested  shop-houses  and residential areas, flushing of the  drains\r\n\r\nonce or twice a week is carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm water drains receiving no sullage water do not\r\n\r\nrequire  any  flushing, while in  big  outlet  drains,\r\n\r\nflushing is not effective, as the small jets of  water\r\n\r\nfrom the flushing hoses cannot move the refuse in  big\r\n\r\ndrains, let alone dislodge obstructions in them.  This\r\n\r\nis because the combined inertia of the great volume of\r\n\r\nwater  and  the big mass of refuse in such big  outlet\r\n\r\ndrains  rapidly  dissipates the energy  of  the  small\r\n\r\nwater jets of the flushing hoses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that only about 10 per cent of all\r\n\r\ndrains  in  built-up  areas  in  Singapore  are  being\r\n\r\nflushed  as  proper  cleansing  work  cannot  be  done\r\n\r\nbecause of obstructions or hindrances on or over these\r\n\r\ndrains, using about 350,000 gallons of water per  day.\r\n\r\nIf  all  drains, including outlet drains, in Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  to  he flushed, as suggested by the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor Joo Chiat, this would require at least 3.5 million\r\n\r\ngallons of water every day going down the drain.  This\r\n\r\nwould  cost the Government $3,500 in water  bills  per\r\n\r\nday; an expenditure which is not only unnecessary, but\r\n\r\ncompletely unjustifiable as the precious water in  our\r\n\r\nisland  republic should never be allowed to be  wasted\r\n\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flushing of drains, accordingly, is not the\r\n\r\nanswer.  The  solution, therefore,  is  not  to  allow\r\n\r\ndrains   to   be   choked   with   ref   use,   thrown\r\n\r\nindiscriminately   and   thoughtlessly   by   hawkers,\r\n\r\nshopkeepers and householders alike.

Due\r\n\r\nto the large numbers of such litter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbins  that must be bought and fixed, the provision  of\r\n\r\nsuch litter bins is being done in phases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was decided to give priority to the fixing of\r\n\r\nlitter  bins  at bus stops. The fixing of such  litter\r\n\r\nbins  to  all the bus stops in the city area has  been\r\n\r\ncompleted,  and similarly all bus stops  in  the  main\r\n\r\nthoroughfares  in  the  rural  areas  have  also  been\r\n\r\nprovided with such litter bins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the next phase of the operation is\r\n\r\nunder  way,  in which litter bins are being  fixed  at\r\n\r\nroad  junctions and along busy streets  especially  in\r\n\r\nthe  shopping  areas and near and around  cinemas  and\r\n\r\npicture  halls. To date, a total of 1,660 litter  bins\r\n\r\nhave been installed in such places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being aware that a lot of littering is taking place\r\n\r\nin  areas  where hawkers congregate, hawkers  are  now\r\n\r\nrequired  to provide refuse bins; collection bins  for\r\n\r\nsuch   refuse   exist   at   all   authorised   hawker\r\n\r\ncongregations.

But it is to be appreciated that while\r\n\r\nthe  Government  can provide refuse  bins  and  litter\r\n\r\nbins, the provision of such facilities alone would not\r\n\r\nprevent  littering if the public were not to make  use\r\n\r\nof  them,  in order that Singapore can be the cleanest\r\n\r\ncity  in South-east Asia, such indiscriminate throwing\r\n\r\nof  litter  should he actively discouraged,  and  more\r\n\r\neffective use would have to be made of the litter bins\r\n\r\nthat have been provided by the Public Health Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DUMPING GROUND FOR BULK</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REFUSE FOR JURONG</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for Health if\r\n\r\na dumping ground\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  bulk  refuse can be provided near to  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Estate,  as great expense  is  at  present\r\n\r\nbeing  caused to Jurong factory owners on  haulage  of\r\n\r\nbulk  refuse to the nearest dumping ground at Tampines\r\n\r\nwhich is about 25 miles from Jurong Town, and as  more\r\n\r\nand  more  industries  are being  established  in  the\r\n\r\nEstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for\r\n\r\nthe  sanitary  disposal of both  domestic  refuse  and\r\n\r\ntrade  waste from the Jurong New Town and  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Estate has been envisaged  in  the  health\r\n\r\nplanning requirements of the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is realised that the long haulage for disposal at\r\n\r\nthe  Tampines  Dumping Ground for refuse collected  in\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong Industrial Estate has caused inconvenience\r\n\r\nand  extra  expense to the Jurong factory owners.

The Airport\r\n\r\ntaxi service racket, whereby taxis did not use meters,\r\n\r\nhas  been  stopped. Since late last year  the  Airport\r\n\r\nPolice and a representative of the Taxi Association at\r\n\r\nthe Airport have undertaken supervision to ensure that\r\n\r\nmeters are used. Those taxi drivers who did not comply\r\n\r\nhave  had  their  permits to operate  at  the  Airport\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  At  the Port of Singapore  Authority,  the\r\n\r\ntransport  service  is  also  satisfactory.   Adequate\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  taxis are allowed into the  harbour  area\r\n\r\nwhen  a  passenger vessel is in port  and  the  police\r\n\r\nensure that meters are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourists are also given alternative transport\r\n\r\nfacilities  such  as a bus service direct  to  Raffles\r\n\r\nPlace.  But once outside the Airport or harbour  area,\r\n\r\nthere  is little control on unscrupulous taxi drivers.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Registrar  of Vehicles  has  powers  to\r\n\r\nrevoke or suspend licences issued to taxi drivers  who\r\n\r\nare  found guilty of malpractices or improper conduct.\r\n\r\nEducating  the taxi drivers is important. The  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board will in future he working closely with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the various taxi  associations  to\r\n\r\nminimise cheating and discourtesy to tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the taxi drivers, there are the shop-keepers who can be equally unscrupulous, if not more\r\n\r\nso.   The   Tourist  Promotion  Board,   through   its\r\n\r\ncounterpart  in  the  private  sector,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTourist  Association, has taken steps to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nsome  130 of its members in the retail trade follow  a\r\n\r\ncode  of ethics. These shops display conspicuous price\r\n\r\ntags  and issue receipts for purchases made,  so  that\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  cheating  could  be  investigated  and\r\n\r\nredressed, if possible. My Ministry intends to ask the\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board to take steps to ensure  wider\r\n\r\nacceptance of the code of ethics by a larger number of\r\n\r\nretailers who are not members of the Singapore Tourist\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  to  consider  instituting  sanctions\r\n\r\nagainst those found guilty of unscrupulous fleecing of\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides transport and shopping, the Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  is  now  looking into all  aspects  of  service\r\n\r\nfacilities  provided  by the  private  sector  to  the\r\n\r\ntourists. These services will have to be up-graded  in\r\n\r\nterms of quality and honesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board will soon be setting up a\r\n\r\ncomplaints   bureau  to  attend  to  complaints   from\r\n\r\ntourists  as  well as those involved  in  the  tourist\r\n\r\ntrade.

We are the first Government to do this\r\n\r\nin  South-east  Asia, possibly in the whole  of  Asia.\r\n\r\nWomen officers have been accorded terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof   service  similar  to  those  applicable  to  male\r\n\r\nofficers  in  Government service.  These  include  the\r\n\r\ncondition  relating  to age of retirement.

Women\r\n\r\nofficers, in the light of the equal treatment  policy,\r\n\r\nare  therefore allowed to opt to accept the men's  age\r\n\r\nof  retirement, that is, 55 or 60 years, especially in\r\n\r\nthe case of those women officers who were appointed to\r\n\r\nthe  service before 1st March, 1962, or who  were  re-appointed after resignation on account of marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that under the Pensions Ordinance there is\r\n\r\nalso  provision  for those women officers  in  service\r\n\r\nbefore  1st  July, 1956, to retire on their  attaining\r\n\r\nthe  age of 45 years if they have so elected, but  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of such women officers has dwindled to  a  few\r\n\r\nnow, with the passage of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience has shown that women officers are\r\n\r\ngenerally  not in favour of remaining in  the  service\r\n\r\nuntil the same retirement age as men.

Notwithstanding the death  of  the\r\n\r\nperson  injured, an action can be brought in court  by\r\n\r\nhis  executor  for the benefit of his  wife,  husband,\r\n\r\nparent  and child, and in every such action the  court\r\n\r\nmay give such damages as it thinks fit proportionately\r\n\r\nto   the  loss  resulting  from  such  death  to   the\r\n\r\ndependants respectively for whom and for whose benefit\r\n\r\nsuch  action was brought. In the present state of  the\r\n\r\nlaw, however, any damages awarded by a court would  be\r\n\r\nreduced  by  the  amount of any  pension  or  gratuity\r\n\r\npayable  on  the death of the deceased. The  court  in\r\n\r\nreducing an award follows well-established common  law\r\n\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the operation of these rules often\r\n\r\ngives rise to hardship. The dependants of the deceased\r\n\r\nwho are entitled to receive the pension or gratuity on\r\n\r\nhis  death  are,  in  fact, placed at  a  disadvantage\r\n\r\ncompared to the dependants of a deceased who  are  not\r\n\r\nso  entitled.  This is not difficult to appreciate  if\r\n\r\none  recalls  that the person entitled  to  receive  a\r\n\r\npension  normally  earns a reduced salary  during  his\r\n\r\nworking  life  to  compensate for the pension  element\r\n\r\npayable  when  lie  ceases to work,  and  it  is  this\r\n\r\nreduced  salary  that the court uses as  a  basis  for\r\n\r\nassessing damages for the loss of future earnings. The\r\n\r\ndependants  are  further penalised because  the  court\r\n\r\ndeducts from the total amount of damages to be awarded\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  pension that is to  be  paid  to  the\r\n\r\ndependants.  You will appreciate, Sir, that  in  cases\r\n\r\ninvolving  the  award  of  substantial  damages,   the\r\n\r\ndependants  could,  therefore, suffer  a  considerable\r\n\r\nloss by the operation of these common law rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is, therefore, designed to remedy\r\n\r\nthis state of affairs and to give statutory relief  in\r\n\r\nthe manner described in clause 2 to the dependants  of\r\n\r\ndeceased persons whose death is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncaused in the circumstances contemplated by section 12\r\n\r\nof   the   Ordinance.  The  effect  of  the   amending\r\n\r\nlegislation will accordingly be that the court will be\r\n\r\ndebarred   from  taking  into  account  any   pension,\r\n\r\ngratuity  or  other payment which may  be  payable  on\r\n\r\ndeath  when  making an award under the above-mentioned\r\n\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill does not introduce a\r\n\r\nnovel  principle  into  the law.  Section  12  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance already provides that the court, when making\r\n\r\nan  award, shall not take into account any sum payable\r\n\r\nto  dependants  of  the deceased under  any  insurance\r\n\r\npolicy. In this context, there is little difference in\r\n\r\nprinciple between the payment of insurance monies  and\r\n\r\nthe  payment of a pension or gratuity as a  result  of\r\n\r\ndeath. The Government, therefore, considers that as  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  relief  to  dependants,  pension   monies\r\n\r\npayable as a result of death should be treated in  the\r\n\r\nsame  way  as insurance monies and not, therefore,  be\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account by the court  when  an  award  of\r\n\r\ndamages  is made under that section of the  Civil  Law\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TREASURY BILLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 2 of\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Treasury  Bills Ordinance  (Chapter  69),\r\n\r\nresolves  that the Minister for Finance be authorised\r\n\r\nto borrow by the issue of Treasury Bills in Singapore\r\n\r\na  sum  not exceeding Singapore one thousand  million\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 24th of May, 1967, Parliament resolved,\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with section 2 of the  Local  Treasury\r\n\r\nBills  Ordinance  (Chapter 69), that the  Minister  be\r\n\r\nauthorised to borrow by the issue of Treasury Bills in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic from $150 million to sums not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$500 million in amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for Treasury Bills is increasing and the\r\n\r\napproval  of  this House is, therefore,  requested  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  limit  to  $1,000  million.

Mr Speaker, Sir, a reference\r\n\r\nto  the  comparative  table will  show  that  only  10\r\n\r\nclauses or, roughly, six per cent of the total  number\r\n\r\nof clauses in the Bill are new. It follows, therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  some  94  per cent of the clauses  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nmerely re-enact existing labour legislation. A few  of\r\n\r\nthe  old clauses have been modified or refined to meet\r\n\r\nthe   objectives  of  increased  productivity  or   to\r\n\r\ngenerate new employment or to iron out anomalies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet some enthusiastic critics, unaware of this fact,\r\n\r\nhave attacked some of these re-enacted clauses in  the\r\n\r\nbelief  that these were innovations to deprive workers\r\n\r\nof their hard-earned rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the overall impact of the new provisions in\r\n\r\nthe Bill, it will cut into some of the fringe benefits\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by a minority of the total working population\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  - the organised sections of  the  white\r\n\r\ncollar   workers.   Even  here,   as   a   result   of\r\n\r\nrepresentations   made   by  N.T.U.C. leaders,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment    has    agreed   to   consider    certain\r\n\r\nmodifications  to  the  Bill  as  it  was   originally\r\n\r\npresented. This is in order to enable these workers to\r\n\r\nadjust  themselves to the fact that  labour  laws  and\r\n\r\npractices should aid and not restrict rapid industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth and economic expansion. Let me state here  that\r\n\r\nwe   are  not  restricting  certain  types  of  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits either because we want to make life miserable\r\n\r\nfor  workers or because, as it is alleged, we want  to\r\n\r\nenrich the rich at the expense of the poor. We in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are not going to get a cent for  ourselves\r\n\r\nby enriching the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  On the contrary, if, as politicians,  we\r\n\r\nhad  wanted to ensure the popularity of our party  and\r\n\r\nthus  assure ourselves of a longer political life,  it\r\n\r\nwould  have been in our interests to have presented  a\r\n\r\nBill  the opposite of what is now under consideration.\r\n\r\nIn  many newly independent countries, politicians  out\r\n\r\nto  be popular with the people, and particularly  with\r\n\r\nthe workers because they happen to be in the majority,\r\n\r\nhave   invariably  persecuted  and  impoverished   the\r\n\r\ncapitalists  in  the belief that as  the  rich  become\r\n\r\npoorer, the poor would become richer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied these examples with great interest\r\n\r\nand in every case the result has been contrary to what\r\n\r\nwas  expected:  the capitalists certainly  have  grown\r\n\r\npoorer  but the poor have grown poorer still. We  need\r\n\r\nonly  look  around  us  for  evidence  of  this.   The\r\n\r\neconomies  of  all these countries are in  ruins;  the\r\n\r\nrich   maintain   their  wealth  and  profit   through\r\n\r\ncorruption, loot and reckless exploitation of the poor\r\n\r\nwhich  yearly grow in size and in the measure of their\r\n\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because we have learnt from the bitter\r\n\r\nexperiences  of those who promised prosperity  without\r\n\r\ntears  and  without  effort that we  have  decided  to\r\n\r\npromise  prosperity the only practical  and  effective\r\n\r\nway - the hard way. It is not a popular way - that  is\r\n\r\npopular with a weak and effete people. But we  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve that our people are weak or effete. We  belief\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  can  be told the hard  facts  of  life\r\n\r\nhonestly  and  bluntly,  they  will  respond  to   the\r\n\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people will respond provided they are\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  the effort and difficult  adjustments\r\n\r\ndemanded   are  really  directed  towards   eventually\r\n\r\npromoting the well-being of the people as a whole  and\r\n\r\nnot  merely  to enrich a privileged few - whether  gay\r\n\r\nand  fun-loving political leaders or the  racketeering\r\n\r\nruffians with whom they are allied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have brought this Bill because we believe that\r\n\r\nthough  it  will prevent the misuse of certain  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits enjoyed by some categories of workers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  will  nevertheless ensure the  long-term  economic\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  all  the workers  and  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with specific clauses in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I discuss the provisions of the Bill, I would\r\n\r\nlike to state here that consultations have taken place\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government, the Employers' organisations\r\n\r\nand    the    N.T.U.C.,   following   which    certain\r\n\r\nmodifications  and  refinements  have  been  made   by\r\n\r\nGovernment to some provisions in the Bill with which I\r\n\r\nshall deal in detail later on. The Member for Bukit Ho\r\n\r\nSwee  has  also tabled notice of amendments  which  he\r\n\r\nproposes to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill abolishes the current statutory definition\r\n\r\nbetween clerks, industrial clerks, shop assistants and\r\n\r\nworkmen.  It  brings within its scope all persons  who\r\n\r\nare  employed under a contract of service, other  than\r\n\r\nthose   employed   in  a  managerial,   executive   or\r\n\r\nconfidential  position,  all  of  whom   would   enjoy\r\n\r\nstandardised  working conditions. Further,  Government\r\n\r\nemployees will not be affected unless declared by  the\r\n\r\nPresident to be employees for the purposes of the Act.\r\n\r\nThe  provisions of the Bill will not apply to domestic\r\n\r\nservants   unless   the  Minister   so   declares   by\r\n\r\nnotification in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 on notice of termination of contract has\r\n\r\nbeen the subject of criticism by certain quarters. The\r\n\r\npoint   has  been  missed  that  the  notice   periods\r\n\r\nprescribed apply only in the absence of any  provision\r\n\r\nfor  notice  in the contract of service.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nworthwhile  to point out that the notice  periods  are\r\n\r\nsimilar  to those provided in the British Contract  of\r\n\r\nEmployment   Act,  1963,  and  if  such  periods   are\r\n\r\nconsidered  fair and reasonable by the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nworkers,  then there seems to be no reason  why  these\r\n\r\nperiods  should  be  considered a retrograde  step  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill prohibiting the employment of a\r\n\r\nperson  after the age of 55 years was made  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the unproductive and inefficient do not continue\r\n\r\nin  employment  at the expense of more productive  and\r\n\r\nable youngsters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  labour  market. However, this  provision  has\r\n\r\nevoked  fears  amongst  older workers  and  a  certain\r\n\r\namount  of  misgivings from employers  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nolder   workers   whom  they  consider   skilled   and\r\n\r\nexperienced and essential to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these apprehensions, the Government will\r\n\r\ngive  consideration  to the amendment  which  will  be\r\n\r\nformally  moved by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee  at  a\r\n\r\nlater stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill on rest days, hours of work,\r\n\r\nholidays and other conditions of service apply only to\r\n\r\nworkmen  and other employees who are in receipt  of  a\r\n\r\nsalary not exceeding $750 a month or such other amount\r\n\r\nas may be fixed from time to time by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 stipulates that the weekly rest day shall\r\n\r\nbe  Sunday  or  any  other day as  determined  by  the\r\n\r\nemployer  by  way  of  a monthly roster.  However,  to\r\n\r\nenable  flexibility in the arrangement  of  shifts,  a\r\n\r\nrest  day  of a continuous period of 30 hours  may  be\r\n\r\nsubstituted  for the usual rest day of 24 hours  which\r\n\r\nis  normally from midnight to midnight. Work  on  rest\r\n\r\ndays  has  two other facets: one is where an  employee\r\n\r\nworks  on  a rest day at the request of his  employer,\r\n\r\nand  the  other where the employee works  at  his  own\r\n\r\nrequest on a rest day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 seeks to ensure that where an employer\r\n\r\nrequires  work  of an employee on a rest  day,  he  is\r\n\r\nobliged  to pay an extra day's salary at the  ordinary\r\n\r\nrate  of  pay  for the day's work in addition  to  the\r\n\r\nordinary rate of pay for that day, which means that an\r\n\r\nemployee  would  receive  not  more  than  double  his\r\n\r\nordinary rate of pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is no justification for a\r\n\r\nworker  to demand double pay for work performed  on  a\r\n\r\nrest  day  if  he works for his employer  at  his  own\r\n\r\nrequest. We have had instances of this in the past and\r\n\r\nit is necessary that there must not be a recurrence of\r\n\r\nsuch undesirable practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that where an employee employed\r\n\r\nby  the  Government or a statutory body in any of  the\r\n\r\nessential services as defined under Part V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1955, works on a rest day or part of a rest day at the\r\n\r\nrequest  of his employer, the worker shall be given  a\r\n\r\nday off in substitution for such rest day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will be making amendments to\r\n\r\nthis  clause to ensure that where an employee  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or a statutory board is required  to  work\r\n\r\nfor part of a rest day he shall only be entitled to  a\r\n\r\npart  of a day off in substitution. This provision  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  work essential to the  community  is\r\n\r\ncarried  on  every day of the week, but  the  employee\r\n\r\ndoes not lose his right to a weekly rest day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to add in this context that the\r\n\r\nprovisions   of  section  35  of  the  existing   Shop\r\n\r\nAssistants  Employment Ordinance  requiring  shops  to\r\n\r\nclose completely on either Friday or Sunday is not re-enacted.  The  basic  idea underlying  this  provision\r\n\r\nstemmed first from the Weekly Holidays Ordinance (Cap.\r\n\r\n156)  enacted in 1950, to ensure that a shop assistant\r\n\r\nenjoyed a weekly rest day. In the circumstances, there\r\n\r\nis  no reason why a provision requiring shops to close\r\n\r\nshould  continue  to remain if the  law  ensures  shop\r\n\r\nassistants a weekly rest day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 on hours of work standardises the hours of\r\n\r\nwork  for  all  classes of employees. In standardising\r\n\r\nworking  hours  and other conditions of employment  of\r\n\r\nboth   clerical   and   non-clerical   workers,    the\r\n\r\ndiscrimination that had hitherto existed  between  the\r\n\r\nwhite-collar and the blue-collar workers is eradicated\r\n\r\nonce and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of our youths is in industry and the\r\n\r\ncontinuance    of    the   existing    practices    of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination would only dissuade young  people  from\r\n\r\ntaking  up  jobs in industry. A prerequisite  for  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of an industrial society is respect and status\r\n\r\nfor  those who work with their hands as well.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  iniquitous that those on the factory  door\r\n\r\nand  in the servicing industries whose creative skills\r\n\r\nare  required  for  economic  growth  are  given  less\r\n\r\nfavourable terms than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who sit in offices. The only group of employees\r\n\r\nthat  have  enjoyed a 39-hour week hitherto  has  been\r\n\r\nclerks, but the provisions of clause 39 do not prevent\r\n\r\nclerical  employees and other employees continuing  to\r\n\r\nwork  a  39-hour  week. However, overtime  rates  will\r\n\r\nbecome  operative only after an employee, irrespective\r\n\r\nof  the  group he belongs, completes 44 hours  in  one\r\n\r\nweek.  There  is, however, a restriction  on  overtime\r\n\r\nwork  in  that  an employee shall not be permitted  to\r\n\r\nwork  for  more than 48 hours in one month unless  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  by  notification in the  Gazette,  declares\r\n\r\nthat  the  relevant  provisions  shall  not  apply  to\r\n\r\nemployees in any particular industry or undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that hon. Members will\r\n\r\nagree  that  excessive overtime  must  be  controlled,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is a grievous anomaly and a  travesty  of\r\n\r\njustice that some employees should earn more than  200\r\n\r\nper  cent of their substantive pay as overtime at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of many of our unemployed citizens who have as\r\n\r\nmuch  right  as they to work, earn and live reasonably\r\n\r\ncomfortable lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, an urgent need that the\r\n\r\nexcessive  benefits  enjoyed  by  some  workers   from\r\n\r\novertime earnings should be spread over a wider  field\r\n\r\nto  cover more persons. This is one of the clauses  in\r\n\r\nthe Bill which should generate greater employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standardisation of conditions of employment,\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether an employee is a workman, shop\r\n\r\nassistant, clerk or industrial clerk, will now  enable\r\n\r\nall  to enjoy the same number of holidays in one year.\r\n\r\nEleven holidays have been specified. Only clerks  have\r\n\r\nhitherto  enjoyed  more  than  11  holidays  a   year.\r\n\r\nHowever,  all  this  will  change  and  every  one  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,    including    Ministers,    Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries and Government officers will have only  11\r\n\r\nholidays in one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embodied in clause 42 on this subject, however, is\r\n\r\none  significant change. Triple pay for work on public\r\n\r\nholidays will disappear. This is something unheard  of\r\n\r\neven in industrialised countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  practice cropped up in Singapore  because  of  a\r\n\r\nHigh   Court  decision  on  the  matter.   The   Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  now  provides  that  if  an  employee   is\r\n\r\nrequired  by  his employer to work on any holiday,  he\r\n\r\nshall  be  paid only an extra day's salary in addition\r\n\r\nto his ordinary rate of pay for that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if a holiday falls on a half working day,\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary rate of pay payable shall be that  of  a\r\n\r\nfull  working  day. This provision does  away  with  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of confusion that has existed over  the\r\n\r\nprovision in the existing law about what the  ordinary\r\n\r\nrate  of  pay should be if a holiday fell  on  a  half\r\n\r\nworking  day,  i.e., a Saturday. In  this  respect  as\r\n\r\nwell, there is provision that an employee employed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  or a statutory body  in  any  of  the\r\n\r\nessential  services as defined under  Part  V  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,  1955,\r\n\r\nwho  is required to work on any holiday or part  of  a\r\n\r\nholiday shall be given a day or part of a day  off  in\r\n\r\nsubstitution. The words \"part of a holiday\" and  \"part\r\n\r\nof  a  day off\" have found their way in the clause  by\r\n\r\nway of amendments that are now being moved, to meet  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where an employee is required to  work  for\r\n\r\npart of a day on a holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that an employee who absents\r\n\r\nhimself   from  work  on  a  working  day  immediately\r\n\r\npreceding or immediately succeeding a holiday  or  any\r\n\r\nday substituted therefor without the prior consent  of\r\n\r\nhis employer or without reasonable excuse shall not be\r\n\r\nentitled to any holiday pay for that holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  will  recall  the  malpractices  that\r\n\r\nexisted  amongst  certain sections of the  daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers not very long ago in this regard. It is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  this provision will eradicate once and  for  all\r\n\r\nmalpractices of this nature in the future. I might  as\r\n\r\nwell  mention here, in this connection,  that  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision is not foreign to labour legislation, as  in\r\n\r\na  number of other countries such a provision is  more\r\n\r\nor less the general practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifications have also been introduced in respect of\r\n\r\nannual leave. Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members are aware\r\n\r\nthat existing legislation provides 14 days paid annual\r\n\r\nleave  to  clerical employees and seven  days  to  all\r\n\r\nothers.  The  standardisation  of  annual  leave,   as\r\n\r\nembodied  in  clause 43, now means that all  employees\r\n\r\nshould  enjoy  the same number of days  for  every  12\r\n\r\nmonths'  continuous  service with the  same  employer.\r\n\r\nHowever, the refinements that have been introduced are\r\n\r\nthat where an employee has less than 10 years' service\r\n\r\nhe would be entitled to seven days leave per year. But\r\n\r\nwhere  an employee has worked for 10 years or more  he\r\n\r\nwould   be   entitled  to  14  working   days.   These\r\n\r\nrefinements  favour the vast majority of workmen  who,\r\n\r\nunder  the existing law, will only enjoy seven working\r\n\r\ndays  irrespective of their period of service.  Clause\r\n\r\n43  would  now enable the vast majority of workers  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  14  days'  paid annual leave  after  they  have\r\n\r\ncompleted  a period of 10 years' service or more  with\r\n\r\nthe  same  employer. However, clerical  employees  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  completed 10 years will stand to lose,  but\r\n\r\nfor  those  who have completed 10 years or  more,  the\r\n\r\nposition would remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if an employee absents himself from work\r\n\r\nwithout  permission or without reasonable  excuse  for\r\n\r\nmore than 20 per cent of the working days in the year,\r\n\r\nhe shall forfeit his entitlement to such leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44 introduces another change from the existing\r\n\r\nlaw in respect of sick leave. It provides for 14 days'\r\n\r\nsick  leave if no hospitalisation is necessary and  28\r\n\r\ndays  including  the  14  days if  hospitalisation  is\r\n\r\nnecessary. An employee is also required to inform  his\r\n\r\nemployer  of  his sick leave within 48  hours  of  his\r\n\r\nfalling sick. Hon. Members will be aware of the abuses\r\n\r\nof  sick leave by some workers in the past. Absence on\r\n\r\nfictitious  medical  certificates have  been  frequent\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  looseness of the  provision  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting law whereby a worker could be examined by any\r\n\r\nregistered  medical practitioner if the  employer  has\r\n\r\nnot appointed one for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis looseness in the law has now been tightened up so\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  employer  does not  appoint  a  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner  to  examine his employee,  the  employee\r\n\r\nconcerned  will have to see a medical officer  who  is\r\n\r\ndefined in the Bill as a medical practitioner employed\r\n\r\nby the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, will consider the amendment\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the Member for Bukit Ho Swee for  60  days'\r\n\r\nsick   leave  in  each  year  if  hospitalisation   is\r\n\r\nnecessary,   inclusive  of   the   14   days   if   no\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  is necessary when  this  is  formally\r\n\r\nmoved later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 on the payment of retrenchment benefit is\r\n\r\nanother new provision. It does not entitle an employee\r\n\r\nhaving  less than three years' service with  the  same\r\n\r\nemployer  to retrenchment benefit. It is necessary  to\r\n\r\nhave   such  a  provision  in  this  Bill  to   ensure\r\n\r\nstability,   particularly  in   new   and   developing\r\n\r\nindustries.  With  emphasis on production  for  export\r\n\r\nmarkets,  it may be necessary for factories to  engage\r\n\r\nworkers  on a temporary short-term basis. It would  be\r\n\r\nmanifestly  unfair if these new industries would  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  retrenchment benefits to  such  workers  once\r\n\r\ntheir services are no longer required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46 provides that an employee having less than\r\n\r\nseven years' continuous service with the same employer\r\n\r\nshall  not be entitled to any retirement benefit other\r\n\r\nthan  that  payable under the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The Government, will, however, consider the\r\n\r\namendment to be moved by the Member for Bukit Ho  Swee\r\n\r\nat a later stage to reduce the period to five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 disallows the payment of I onus or any\r\n\r\nother ex-gratia payment other than as an incentive  to\r\n\r\nan  employee  to  increase his productivity  or  as  a\r\n\r\nreward  for his performance and prohibits a collective\r\n\r\nagreement from containing any provision otherwise than\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with this principle. This  clause  was\r\n\r\nmade   restrictive  as  pressures  put  on   new   and\r\n\r\ndeveloping  industries, whose profit margins  will  be\r\n\r\nnegligible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  at  all, can have disastrous consequences  on  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   programme.   It   is,   therefore,\r\n\r\nimperative  that uninhibited demands for bonus  should\r\n\r\nbe curbed. The Member for Bukit Ho Swee, however, will\r\n\r\nbe  moving  amendments to this clause. The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  consider  very carefully his arguments  in  this\r\n\r\nregard when he formally moves the amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 of the Bill makes an employer liable to the\r\n\r\npunishment  prescribed in the Bill if  he  employs  an\r\n\r\nemployee  contrary to the provisions  of  Part  IV  or\r\n\r\nfails  to  pay  any  salary in  accordance  with  such\r\n\r\nprovisions.  The Member for Bukit Ho  Swee  has  given\r\n\r\nnotice  that he will move an amendment to this clause.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has  already given  notice  to  amend\r\n\r\nclause 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX of the Bill gives legal recognition to the\r\n\r\nEmployment Exchange run by the Ministry of Labour  and\r\n\r\nthere   is  provision  to  enable  the  Minister,   by\r\n\r\nnotification  in the Gazette, to require employers  to\r\n\r\nnotify vacancies to the Commissioner for Labour and to\r\n\r\nprevent  employers  from  engaging  employees   except\r\n\r\nthrough the Employment Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X of the Bill on Employment of Women remains\r\n\r\nsubstantially  similar  to  the  provisions   in   the\r\n\r\nexisting  law, but with one exception. This  exception\r\n\r\nis  that  the  benefits are now  restricted  to  three\r\n\r\nconfinements only. It is illogical, Mr Speaker,  that\r\n\r\nwhile,  on  the one hand, we are actively  pursuing  a\r\n\r\npolicy to encourage family planning, on the other,  we\r\n\r\nshould through our labour laws, nullify our efforts in\r\n\r\nthis  direction.  If  our  population  growth  is  not\r\n\r\ncontained,  it  is obvious that the  measures  we  are\r\n\r\ntaking to bring about economic growth and social well-being  will be ineffective. The restriction  to  three\r\n\r\nconfinements is, therefore, meant to discourage rather\r\n\r\nthan prohibit large families. The result would be  not\r\n\r\nthe  creation of hardships but of better  and  happier\r\n\r\nconditions of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XIII of the Bill includes provision for the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour to collect more comprehensive\r\n\r\nmanpower data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XVI enables the Commissioner for Labour to\r\n\r\ninquire into and decide any dispute or claim for wages\r\n\r\narising  out of the provisions of this Act or  out  of\r\n\r\nany  term  in  a  contract of service, in  respect  of\r\n\r\nworkmen and other employees whose monthly salary  does\r\n\r\nnot exceed $750 or in respect of employees who, before\r\n\r\nthe  coming  into force of the Act, were  entitled  to\r\n\r\nlodge  a complaint with the Commissioner under any  of\r\n\r\nthe    three   existing   Ordinances.   However,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  may not inquire into a  claim  involving\r\n\r\nmatters  arising earlier than one year from  the  date\r\n\r\nthe  claim is lodged or the termination of a  contract\r\n\r\nof  service  of  the claimant. Claims  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nmatters  arising  out  of  or  as  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\ntermination of a contract of service have to be lodged\r\n\r\nwithin  six  months of such termination. Provision  is\r\n\r\nnow  made  for  the Commissioner to charge  a  nominal\r\n\r\nregistration fee as provided in Schedule C of the Bill\r\n\r\nin respect of such claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts, as I have outlined so\r\n\r\nfar,  far from bear out the wild allegations that this\r\n\r\nBill  has sold out the rights of the workers and given\r\n\r\nthem  over, bound hand and foot, to the tender mercies\r\n\r\nof  vengeful employers. True, it cuts into some of the\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits which, as I said, only a minority  of\r\n\r\nwhite-collar workers by and large enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Bill will bring to the large\r\n\r\nmajority  of blue-collar workers benefits  which  they\r\n\r\ndid not enjoy before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not a case of the Bill withdrawing\r\n\r\nfringe benefits altogether. What the Bill seeks to  do\r\n\r\nis  to  prevent the abuse of fringe benefits -  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits  being  used as cover for malpractices  which\r\n\r\nhamper rapid growth in productivity; which protect the\r\n\r\ninefficient  and  which obstruct industrial  expansion\r\n\r\nand accelerated economic expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to make is that the\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill should be read in conjunction with the\r\n\r\ntwo other Bills I introduced today - the Industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations  (Amendment) Bill and the Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund  (Amendment)  Bill.  The  first  Bill  reinforces\r\n\r\nmanagement's powers to manage - powers which have been\r\n\r\neroded over the years and without which efficient  and\r\n\r\ndynamic industrial growth would be seriously hampered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand, adds to the pay packet of workers by  way\r\n\r\nof   extra  contributions  by  employers  to  workers'\r\n\r\nsavings  on  retirement or to make it possible  for  a\r\n\r\ngreat many workers to purchase their own home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who read the Employment Bill carefully will\r\n\r\ndiscover  that  it  in no way precludes  workers  from\r\n\r\nseeking   their  due  and  just  share  in   expanding\r\n\r\nprosperity.  But,  first,  there  must  be   expanding\r\n\r\nprosperity  and  this  cannot  be  brought  about   by\r\n\r\ndividing   and   sub-dividing  a   static   level   of\r\n\r\nprosperity. That is why this Bill relates rewards, not\r\n\r\nto  some  abstract and arbitrary principle of justice,\r\n\r\nbut  to  more tangible and more meaningful norms  like\r\n\r\nefficiency,  effort, productivity and so  on.  Rewards\r\n\r\nwhether  by way of profits or wages should be  related\r\n\r\nto economic growth and efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions under which our labour laws and the\r\n\r\nattitudes  of  workers and entrepreneurs  were  shaped\r\n\r\nover  the  years no longer exist. These attitudes,  if\r\n\r\nunchanged,  will instead become factors  for  economic\r\n\r\ndisaster  and political anarchy in the seventies  when\r\n\r\nthe British withdraw. We can no longer order employee-employer relations, as we have hitherto done,  in  the\r\n\r\nbelief   that   the   ultimate   responsibility    for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic well-being and for its  military\r\n\r\ndefence  will rest on the shoulders of a comparatively\r\n\r\naffluent  Britain. The British are scheduled to  leave\r\n\r\nSingapore  by 1971 and all the responsibility  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect  from  them  would be  their  good  wishes  and\r\n\r\nprayers  for  our  continued  prosperity  and   safety\r\n\r\n- perhaps  a bit more if there is a change in the  tide\r\n\r\nof British fortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic well-being and survival after 1971 is in\r\n\r\nour hands. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest we can hope for if our economy collapses would be\r\n\r\nthat  some  kindhearted  nations  will  send  us  food\r\n\r\nparcels   and   cast-off  clothing   to   avert   mass\r\n\r\nstarvation.  And in an island like Singaore  where  we\r\n\r\ncan  grow no food or plant cotton and where one square\r\n\r\nmile has to keep alive and sustain 8,000 Singaporeans,\r\n\r\na stagnant economy means starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I am sure, is not the future we want for\r\n\r\nourselves or our children. This Bill, is, therefore, a\r\n\r\ndeliberate and planned effort, taken well in  advance,\r\n\r\nto  get our people to make adjustments now to take  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic, political and military shock of British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal. Three years do not give us sufficient time\r\n\r\nbut  the  British have decided to make  a  precipitate\r\n\r\nwithdrawal and there is no use our trying to solve our\r\n\r\nproblems  by sitting down and beating our  breasts  in\r\n\r\ndespair. Somebody has said that there are two kinds of\r\n\r\npeoples -there are the rabbits who, when cornered, die\r\n\r\neasily  and  there are the cats who will  scratch  and\r\n\r\nclaw their way out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are cats and this Bill will give us the\r\n\r\nclaws  and  the strength to fight our way out  of  the\r\n\r\ncoming difficulties in the seventies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be as well, here, to mention some of these\r\n\r\ncoming  difficulties  besides  which  problems   about\r\n\r\nbonus,  rest  days, and other alleged  suffering  will\r\n\r\nappear trivial when the moment of reckoning comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, with the withdrawal of British Forces\r\n\r\nsome  21,000  Singapore citizens out  of  some  25,500\r\n\r\ncivilians  directly employed by the  British  will  be\r\n\r\nwithout  jobs.  These 21,000 citizens  are  today  not\r\n\r\nworrying about bonus or sick leave or holidays.  Their\r\n\r\nimmediate  fear  is  that between now  and  1971  they\r\n\r\nwould,  if  we do not take stern measures now,  be  on\r\n\r\nindefinite  holiday without pay.  For  21,000  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  their  major  preoccupation  is  not  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits but jobs in order to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor must we forget the additional thousands of\r\n\r\ncitizens who earn a living\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby doing service to base civilians and British soldiers - such as domestic\r\n\r\nservants, taxi drivers, shop-keepers, restaurants and bar workers and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add to this the unemployed that now exist. According\r\n\r\nto  the  Sample Household Survey of 1966, they  number\r\n\r\n52,000. Add to this the 25,000 who annually enter  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market. By 1971, therefore, for  some  120,000\r\n\r\npeople  -  our  citizens - the struggle for  existence\r\n\r\nwould not be debate over fringe benefits but getting a\r\n\r\njob,  any  kind of job just to feed, clothe and  house\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  their  families.  The  problems   and\r\n\r\nconditions of this 120,000 require our prior attention\r\n\r\nand   concern   rather  than  the   relatively   minor\r\n\r\ntribulations of other categories of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those trade unionists and workers lucky enough to\r\n\r\nhave   a  job  would  do  well  to  ponder  over   the\r\n\r\nconsequences for them of massive unemployment  coupled\r\n\r\nwith economic stagnation. When there are thousands  of\r\n\r\nworkers  battering  at employers' doors  for  any  job\r\n\r\nunder  any conditions, then the door is open for  real\r\n\r\nexploitation  and  the progressive  weakening  of  the\r\n\r\nauthority and influence of organised trade unions  and\r\n\r\norganised  workers. It is, therefore, in the interests\r\n\r\nof   trade  unions  to  support,  whatever  the  cost,\r\n\r\nmeasures  designed to reduce unemployment by fostering\r\n\r\nsustained economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, in effect, is an attempt to tackle the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  finding jobs for as many of this  120,000\r\n\r\nforgotten  and largely inarticulate group of citizens.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  saying that we can solve the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem altogether. But we can contain it and minimise\r\n\r\nthe   tragedy  and  real  suffering  which  only   the\r\n\r\nunemployed can know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the unemployment problem, we are going to\r\n\r\nlose  some $450 million spent annually by the  British\r\n\r\nArmed   Forces  in  Singapore  and  which  constitutes\r\n\r\napproximately  14  per  cent  of  our  gross  domestic\r\n\r\nproduct. This will tail off to almost zero after 1971.\r\n\r\nTo fill this gap and avoid recessionary effects to our\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  will  have to spend an  additional  $900\r\n\r\nmillion between now and 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all these we must add the economic burden that\r\n\r\ndefence  will impose on us. After 1971 the  centuries-old  British  shield (paid for and maintained  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish) will no longer be here to protect us.  If  we\r\n\r\ndo  not develop a defensive armour of our own, then  a\r\n\r\nrich and strategically valuable island like ours is  a\r\n\r\ntempting  prize to seize - particularly if, out  of  a\r\n\r\nmisplaced sense of thrift, we deprive ourselves of the\r\n\r\ntooth and claw to deter the freebooter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these might appear formidable problems - and so\r\n\r\nthey are, Mr Speaker. But no problem is insoluble and\r\n\r\nin  so far as our economic problem is concerned -  and\r\n\r\non which hinges our political and military viability - we  may  not find complete solutions. But we can  with\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  hard  work  and  long-term  planning  and\r\n\r\norganisation make reasonable progress despite the many\r\n\r\ndifficulties  ahead. This is no idle  boast.  When  we\r\n\r\nwere  asked  to leave Malaysia, there were  those  who\r\n\r\npredicted  economic disintegration  and  collapse  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  predicted an  island  seething  with\r\n\r\ndiscontent  and  revolt -and  a  ready  prey  for  the\r\n\r\nimitation  Maos  now prowling about in  the  caves  of\r\n\r\nVictoria Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These predictions have been proved wrong because\r\n\r\nafter  separation we got down immediately to  tackling\r\n\r\nthe  difficult economic and other problems  following\r\n\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So once again we must start planning now to meet and\r\n\r\novercome,  this time, the economic consequences  of  a\r\n\r\nprecipitate British withdrawal. If we are to meet  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of unemployment, make good the $450  million\r\n\r\nthe  British  Armed  Forces have been  spending,  then\r\n\r\nthere   must   be   massive   industrial   expansions;\r\n\r\naccelerated economic growth through stimulation of our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade, tourism, shipping and so  on.  To  do\r\n\r\nthis  quickly,  we  must  attract  local  and  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  - foreign investments because  we  cannot\r\n\r\nmobilise  enough domestic savings except by a ruthless\r\n\r\nlowering of living standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill should, therefore, be seen in the\r\n\r\ncontext of the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems an independent Singapore faces. There must be\r\n\r\na climate of industrial peace and stability to attract\r\n\r\nboth  local  and foreign capital. It is  essential  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the   productivity  of  our  workers,   the\r\n\r\nefficiency of entrepreneurs, so that our products  can\r\n\r\ncompete in the stiff competitive export markets of the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the intent and purpose behind this Bill. How\r\n\r\nfar  this Bill will succeed in its purpose will depend\r\n\r\non   both   workers  and  employers  placing  national\r\n\r\ninterests before sectional interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware, too, that like some workers\r\n\r\nthere  will be some short-sighted and stupid employers\r\n\r\nwho  will try to take advantage of this Bill,  not  to\r\n\r\npromote  economic expansion, but unjustly  to  squeeze\r\n\r\nworkers for personal gain. I know that one or two such\r\n\r\nemployers  have already, through a selfish  misreading\r\n\r\nof the Bill, started wielding the big stick. They have\r\n\r\nproposed cuts and reductions, not because of financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties, but because the proprietors want to  get\r\n\r\na bit more spending money for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I inform such employers that the Government will\r\n\r\nnot  stand idly by and watch them sabotage our efforts\r\n\r\nto  bring  about industrial peace and stability.  They\r\n\r\nare  not  the only ones who can wield the big stick  -and their stick could, when it comes to the crunch, be\r\n\r\nbroken like a rotten twig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Bill does not provide for all\r\n\r\nsituations,  for all sorts of contingencies  that  may\r\n\r\narise in what is a rapidly changing area of the world.\r\n\r\nSo  the  Government  will in the light  of  experience\r\n\r\nreview the Bill when defects come to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, unless this Bill is studied in the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  our  formidable  economic  and  political\r\n\r\nproblems,  its essential purpose and objectives  might\r\n\r\nwell  be lost sight of in the debate. These formidable\r\n\r\nproblems cannot be tackled without painful adjustments\r\n\r\nthough  the Government has made every effort to reduce\r\n\r\nto  a  minimum  the  pain by sweetening  the  medicine\r\n\r\nsomewhat,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that this Bill, with the\r\n\r\namendments,  still remains the most progressive  piece\r\n\r\nof labour legislation in this part of the world. There\r\n\r\nis  as  yet  no country in this region which  provides\r\n\r\n(together with the proposed amendments to our  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund laws) benefits and terms  better  than\r\n\r\nwhat the workers of Singapore will enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\nyou  will  recall, one of the most popular slogans  in\r\n\r\nBritain  in the late fifties was: \"You have never  had\r\n\r\nit so good!\". It is perhaps not inappropriate to apply\r\n\r\nthis  to Singapore today. We boast of the highest  per\r\n\r\ncapita income in the region. We have a strong currency\r\n\r\nand  our balance of payments is extremely healthy.  In\r\n\r\nshort,  we  are going through a period of  prosperity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some people may be wondering, what have we  to\r\n\r\nworry  about? Indeed, if we are and can afford  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent, we have nothing to worry about,  at  least\r\n\r\nfor  the  time  being. However, we  are  no  longer  a\r\n\r\nsubjugated  people who have no control  over  our  own\r\n\r\ndestiny,  nor  are  we a soft-headed  people  who  are\r\n\r\nincapable  of  planning or anticipating events  beyond\r\n\r\ntomorrow. We are committed to building a nation of our\r\n\r\nown  which we are determined should last not  for  the\r\n\r\npresent generation alone but for generations to  come.\r\n\r\nAs  such,  we  must constantly look forward  and  plan\r\n\r\nahead making the necessary material sacrifices and re-adjustment in our mental attitudes from time  to  time\r\n\r\nso  as  to  ensure that our children and grandchildren\r\n\r\nwill  enjoy,  if not a higher standard of  living,  at\r\n\r\nleast  a  standard  equal to our own.  As  responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  parents, I am sure  that  this  is  one\r\n\r\ncommitment  we  are not afraid of and should  have  no\r\n\r\nhesitation  in  entering into.  Sir,  it  is  in  this\r\n\r\ncontext that I feel that the Employment Bill should be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice before us is the choice between temporary\r\n\r\nhigher  income and long-range economic security.  With\r\n\r\nthe projected withdrawal of the British Forces and the\r\n\r\nconstant  population pressure upon  our  very  limited\r\n\r\nnatural  resources, as I see it, our economic security\r\n\r\nis being seriously threatened, and unless something is\r\n\r\ndone  about it within the short time available to  us,\r\n\r\nbetween  now and 1971, I am doubtful that we would  be\r\n\r\nable  to  maintain  the high per  capita  income.  The\r\n\r\ndirection  and the manner in which we are  to  counter\r\n\r\nthe  anticipated  recession have been made  abundantly\r\n\r\nclear by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nand  the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  on  more than one occasion and  I  would  not,\r\n\r\ntherefore, elaborate. Suffice it to say here that  for\r\n\r\nour  national  survival and economic  well-being,  the\r\n\r\nemphasis for the years ahead of us lies in raising the\r\n\r\neconomic  productivity  of  our  people.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nthrough a reputation for high productivity that we can\r\n\r\nhope  to attract more foreign investors to participate\r\n\r\nin our industrial programme. It is only through higher\r\n\r\nproductivity  that  we  can  hope  for  our   existing\r\n\r\nindustrial  concerns to secure a  fair  share  of  the\r\n\r\nfiercely  competitive world market.  But  so  long  as\r\n\r\nanomalies  are  allowed  to  exist  in  the  area   of\r\n\r\nindustrial   relations,  it  will  be  difficult   for\r\n\r\nproductivity to be raised beyond a mediocre  standard.\r\n\r\nWith  the  passage of the Bill, some of the  anomalies\r\n\r\nthat  have  arisen  during  the  past  years  will  be\r\n\r\nregularised. This, I feel sure, will in time  help  to\r\n\r\nput  us  on  a  stronger footing both in the  race  to\r\n\r\nattract more investors and in the fiercely competitive\r\n\r\nworld market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in perusing the Bill, I do feel that whilst\r\n\r\ncertain disciplines and sacrifices are required of our\r\n\r\nworkers,  they  should not be left without  safeguards\r\n\r\nentirely  in certain areas, bearing in mind  that  not\r\n\r\nall   managements  are  enlightened,   and   not   all\r\n\r\nmanagements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  conscious of their social responsibility and  are\r\n\r\ncapable of identifying their long-term interests  with\r\n\r\nthose of the people and the State.

It\r\n\r\nappears,  therefore, to me that whatever the employees\r\n\r\nmay  lose  on  the  swings,  they  will  gain  on  the\r\n\r\nroundabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, I rise to make\r\n\r\ncertain observations on the Employment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be difficult years ahead and the problems\r\n\r\nconfronting Singapore are immense and call for drastic\r\n\r\nsolutions.

But it  should  be\r\n\r\nmade  emphatically  clear that our acceptance  of  the\r\n\r\nunderlying principles of the Bill does not  mean  that\r\n\r\nwe  unreservedly  accept  the  manner  in  which  such\r\n\r\nprinciples  are translated into the actual  provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Bill. We do not expect the unpleasant policies\r\n\r\nof the Government as embodied in the Bill to be sugar-coated  for  our easier acceptance but,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,   we  do  not  expect  the  Bill  to   be   made\r\n\r\nunnecessarily bitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill, as it stands, has certain\r\n\r\ndeficiencies. It is feared that unscrupulous employers\r\n\r\nwill  take  advantage of these deficiencies  to  cause\r\n\r\nunnecessary hardships and difficulties to the workers.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our fear that once this Bill is passed  as  it\r\n\r\nstands it may run contrary to the desired objective of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  and,  instead of giving  solutions  to  our\r\n\r\nproblems,  would  create additional problems  such  as\r\n\r\nwidespread  industrial unrest. While we may  not  have\r\n\r\nserious    objections   to   prospective    investors,\r\n\r\nparticularly  foreign investors, who  seek  to  commit\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars  to  new  enterprises   in   the\r\n\r\nRepublic, wishing to be assured of trouble-free labour\r\n\r\nrelations  and  of the absence of any  possibility  of\r\n\r\nunnecessary  prohibitive  labour  costs  making  their\r\n\r\nproducts uncompetitive in international markets,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe must confess that we find it extremely alarming and\r\n\r\ndisturbing that there are employers, particularly  our\r\n\r\ncitizen employers, in well-established firms and small\r\n\r\nbusiness concerns who are thinking of taking advantage\r\n\r\nof the Employment Bill and treating it as a licence to\r\n\r\nexploit labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in brief, this is the main\r\n\r\nconsideration for the N.T.U.C.'s decision  to  propose\r\n\r\namendments  to the Employment Bill through the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Bukit Ho Swee, who is the Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, in a general way, point out the\r\n\r\nobjections of the trade union movement to clauses  15,\r\n\r\n43,  44,  46  and 53 of the Employment Bill  which  we\r\n\r\nthink will not help in any way as it stands at present\r\n\r\nto  give  effect  to  the Government's  objectives  in\r\n\r\nintroducing the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take clause 15. It seeks to restrict the\r\n\r\nemployment  of persons after the age 55 years.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  clause  15 provides for  approval  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour of the employment  of  persons\r\n\r\nafter  the  age  of 55 years. But does the  Government\r\n\r\nreally  believe that many employers, even if  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  use the provision as a pretext of getting rid  of\r\n\r\nlong-service  employees with their  relatively  higher\r\n\r\nwages,  will  bother  entangling themselves  with  the\r\n\r\nunnecessary red tape of getting such approval? Such  a\r\n\r\nprovision,  if  allowed  to  stand,  would  in  effect\r\n\r\ncondemn  a  substantial number of workers,  leading  a\r\n\r\nhand-to-mouth  existence with family  obligations  and\r\n\r\nwithout  any  life  savings, to  great  hardships  and\r\n\r\nperhaps,  figuratively speaking, to a lingering  death\r\n\r\nby starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that such horrible consequences cannot be\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  the  Bill. Why  then  is  clause  15\r\n\r\nincluded in it? Is it to compel an employee to  retire\r\n\r\nat  the  age of 55 so that he has to make  way  for  a\r\n\r\nyounger unemployed citizen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  may  not have occurred to the Government that,  in\r\n\r\nforcing  employees at the age of 55 to retire for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  presumably of making way for a  corresponding\r\n\r\nnumber  of  young  unemployed  citizens,  it  may  not\r\n\r\nachieve  the desired effect of reducing the extent  of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  because the young  unemployed  citizens\r\n\r\nare not likely to possess the skills and experience of\r\n\r\nthose  forced  to retire at 55 years.  What  will,  in\r\n\r\neffect, be the result is that a different category  of\r\n\r\ncitizens will become unemployed, mainly those reaching\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 55 in addition to the existing number  of\r\n\r\nunemployed citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask, is this not\r\n\r\nunnecessarily cruel? It is indeed pitiful  that  young\r\n\r\ncitizens are unemployed, but they are usually  without\r\n\r\ndependants  and  can perhaps scrape an existence  from\r\n\r\nparents and relatives for a reasonable length of time.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand,  the old citizens  are  rendered\r\n\r\nunemployed  because they have reached the age  of  55.\r\n\r\nThose who are strong and able to work can perhaps make\r\n\r\na  significant and useful contribution to our national\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Moreover,  they  are  likely   to   have\r\n\r\ndependants  whose  well-being and survival  depend  on\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood. What is this magic figure \"55\"  that\r\n\r\nwill  determine that men will no longer become  useful\r\n\r\nto  society  and must wither away from  the  scene  of\r\n\r\nactive life? Does it make sense to say that amongst us\r\n\r\nin this House the two most senior Cabinet Ministers in\r\n\r\nterms of age, namely, the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nand  Minister for Labour and the Minister for Defence,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  reach the age of 55 in a few  years,  will\r\n\r\nbecome  decrepit  and must leave their  portfolios  to\r\n\r\nyounger  men? Judging from the healthy disposition  of\r\n\r\nthese  two gentlemen and their mental agility, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to believe that they will be more than fit, both\r\n\r\nphysically  and mentally, to be with us in this  House\r\n\r\nlong  after they reach the age of 55. With the passing\r\n\r\nof  time,  they  will grow in wisdom, and  with  their\r\n\r\nadditional years of valuable experience they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill remain to help chart the course of the Republic's\r\n\r\nprogress and destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we in the trade union movement look forward\r\n\r\nto  many,  many years of happy confrontation with  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour over the labour problems that  may\r\n\r\narise  when  the Employment Bill and other new  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation  come  into  force.  It  is  not  in   the\r\n\r\nRepublic's  interest if men with skill and experience,\r\n\r\njust  because  they reach the age of 55,  must  retire\r\n\r\nwhen  at this juncture of our national development  we\r\n\r\nare  looking towards our workers acquiring more skills\r\n\r\nand ability in order to make a success of our economic\r\n\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44 has been ostensibly worded to minimise\r\n\r\nabuses to the provision of sick leave by irresponsible\r\n\r\nworkers.  But  it should be made clear to  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  any  attempt  to paint a picture  of  prevailing\r\n\r\nwidespread  practice among workers who  use  the  sick\r\n\r\nleave provision as a means of getting extra paid leave\r\n\r\nis largely un-warranted. The small percentage of black-sheep amongst workers who behave irresponsibly in this\r\n\r\nmanner  must  be viewed in the correct perspective  of\r\n\r\nthe large percentage of workers who are proud of their\r\n\r\nrecord  of  seldom being on sick leave. In any  event,\r\n\r\nthe  restriction of sick leave without hospitalisation\r\n\r\nto  a  maximum  of 14 days a year should  satisfy  any\r\n\r\nemployer with an obsession that his employees on  sick\r\n\r\nleave  are not very sick. But we are of the view  that\r\n\r\n28  days  a  year is insufficient to provide  for  the\r\n\r\nhospitalisation of an employee. I am of the view  that\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  period  for  hospitalisation  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased  from  28  days to 60  days  at  least.  Our\r\n\r\nconsideration  is that the stringent requirements  for\r\n\r\nan  employee to be granted sick leave for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  hospitalisation leave no scope  for  any  possible\r\n\r\nabuse  and,  secondly, medical science and  technology\r\n\r\nhave not advanced to a stage where an employee can  be\r\n\r\nimmune  from being incapacitated for one or two months\r\n\r\nby a serious illness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46 of the Bill states that the qualifying\r\n\r\nperiod in respect of an employee's entitlement to  any\r\n\r\nretirement  benefit payable by his employee  is  seven\r\n\r\nyears  of  continuous service with  that  employer.  I\r\n\r\nshare the view that the period should be reduced  from\r\n\r\nseven   to  five  years  on  the  grounds  that   most\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements have provided that an  employee\r\n\r\nis eligible for retirement benefit after five years of\r\n\r\nservice. To extend such qualifying period is to impose\r\n\r\nunnecessary hardship on the workers who, unlike  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in  the civil service,  do  not  have  a\r\n\r\npension  to  look forward to on their retirement.  The\r\n\r\nretirement benefit, which is an ex-gratia payment  for\r\n\r\npast  services,  serves  as enforced  savings  for  an\r\n\r\nemployee's retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 of the Bill makes bonus a non-negotiable\r\n\r\nissue  between  an  employer and a  trade  union,  and\r\n\r\nrelates  the  payment of bonus to the productivity  of\r\n\r\nperformance  of the workers. The weakness  of  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision  is  that  it is not only impracticable  but\r\n\r\nalso  unrealistic. It takes for granted, as proved  to\r\n\r\nbe   true   and  correct,  several  propositions   the\r\n\r\nsoundness   of  which  is  highly  questionable.   One\r\n\r\nproposition is that an employer would not cut off  his\r\n\r\nown  nose  to spite his own face by refusing  to  give\r\n\r\nincentive  payments to his workers. Our experience  is\r\n\r\nthat  some employers would go to extraordinary lengths\r\n\r\nto  avoid  giving  workers their  just  dues.  Another\r\n\r\nproposition  is that productivity and profits  can  be\r\n\r\neasily  and  conveniently measured or determined.  Our\r\n\r\nunderstanding is that these two subjects form areas of\r\n\r\nmuch  controversy. I share the view,  therefore,  that\r\n\r\nbonus  should  be  made a negotiable  issue  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of one month's salary of an employee and  that\r\n\r\nany bonus over the amount of one month's salary is  to\r\n\r\nbe  payable  at the discretion of an employer  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  incentive or a reward for the employee.  By\r\n\r\nallowing  bonus to be negotiated on the present  basis\r\n\r\nbetween the employer and a trade union subject to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  one  month's salary,  the  necessity  and\r\n\r\ndifficulty of determining what is productivity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  what are profits are obviated. This will help  to\r\n\r\nminimise  industrial  friction  arising  out  of   the\r\n\r\nquestion of bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 of the Bill re-enacts the existing\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Clerks Employment Ordinance, the Labour Ordinance and the Shop Assistants Employment\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  As the provisions of clause 53 now  stand,\r\n\r\nthere  is  some  confusion as to the  effect  of  this\r\n\r\nclause.   The  confusion  arises  mainly  out   of   a\r\n\r\nmisinterpretation of Government statements on the Bill\r\n\r\nto  the  effect that the provisions of the  Employment\r\n\r\nBill  are  intended to place a maximum  limit  on  the\r\n\r\nterms   and  conditions  of  service  of  workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is shown to be erroneous when the Bill\r\n\r\nwas  read  for  the  First  time.  Nevertheless,  such\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  may persist and some  employers  may\r\n\r\nuse  it as a pretext for not giving to their employees\r\n\r\nmore  favourable terms and conditions  of  service  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the Employment Bill. We have accordingly\r\n\r\nsought  to clarify these provisions so that  it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be an offence to grant more favourable terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, in brief, Mr Speaker, Sir, are some of the\r\n\r\ngrounds  for our proposed amendments to the  Bill.

They  have  grievances  over\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service and salary structures  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  service, and these have been referred  to  the\r\n\r\nSalaries Commission which has considered them and  has\r\n\r\nsubmitted  its report to the Government.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will   table  the  report   before   this\r\n\r\nParliament as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that at the present\r\n\r\nstage of nation building in Singapore we must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput special emphasis on the development of our economy\r\n\r\nin  order to meet the expenditure on defence,  social,\r\n\r\nand  educational requirements.

This\r\n\r\nis a very ambitious task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, first and foremost, become an advanced\r\n\r\nindustrialised society in this region. To achieve this\r\n\r\nobjective,   we   must,  besides  attracting   foreign\r\n\r\ncapital, give due regard to our products which must be\r\n\r\nlow in price, good in quality and modern in design  so\r\n\r\nas   to  compete  with  other  countries.  Unless   we\r\n\r\naccomplish  this, we cannot compete with  products  of\r\n\r\nother  countries in the international market, and  our\r\n\r\nattempt  to make Singapore an industrial society  will\r\n\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore will not relax in their\r\n\r\nefforts  nor will they shirk their responsibility  for\r\n\r\nthe development and growth of our national economy. In\r\n\r\nthe  past  few years they have been able to check  and\r\n\r\novercome  unfavourable conditions. They have  accepted\r\n\r\nand  supported  the economic policy  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party since it came into office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of industrial relations, we have done\r\n\r\naway  with  strikes and have curbed  disturbances  and\r\n\r\noutbreaks of violence which characterised the 1  950s.\r\n\r\nIndustrial disputes have become things of the past. We\r\n\r\nare  now  enjoying good weather after the  storms  and\r\n\r\nturbulence of the past few years. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust publicise the fact to foreign industrialists that\r\n\r\nconditions  here  are stable, that our  society  is  a\r\n\r\npeaceful  one  and  that our workers are  enlightened.\r\n\r\nThey  will  then be willing to extend their operations\r\n\r\nto  our country. They will be willing to invest in and\r\n\r\nexpand   our   industries.  I  fully  understand   the\r\n\r\nimportance  of large capital investment  and  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  this country, because  these  factors\r\n\r\nwill  create  more  employment opportunities  for  our\r\n\r\ngrowing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of some of the points which I have\r\n\r\nenumerated  that our Government has now  formulated  a\r\n\r\nsound  long-term policy by introducing the  Employment\r\n\r\nBill.  I  support and welcome this Bill in  principle.\r\n\r\nBut   there  are  some  provisions  in  it  which  are\r\n\r\nunnecessary,  impractical and harsh. In spite  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  detailed explanation of  the  purposes  of\r\n\r\nsome  of  the provisions, I am still not satisfied.  I\r\n\r\nregard  them  as stringent, and many people  share  my\r\n\r\nview.  We  must  therefore advance our views  for  his\r\n\r\nconsideration. I have said just now that I accept this\r\n\r\nBill  in principle. But because of the risk that  some\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions may be abused by  some  employers,\r\n\r\nthereby distorting the original purpose of the Bill, I\r\n\r\nmust air my views and criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now enumerate some of the provisions which I\r\n\r\nregard as unsuitable. The Member for Moulmein has also\r\n\r\ntouched on them. But his views may not be entirely the\r\n\r\nsame  as what I am going to express on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past as well as at present, business\r\n\r\norganisations  and enterprises regard the  payment  of\r\n\r\nbonus  as  a  means to encourage workers  to  be  more\r\n\r\ndiligent in their work. It has become an incentive for\r\n\r\nincreased  productivity  and this  has  achieved  good\r\n\r\nresults.  We  all  know that bonus is  not  merely  an\r\n\r\nincentive to the workers but that employers also  earn\r\n\r\nmore  profits  as  a  result  of  the  diligence   and\r\n\r\nincreased  productivity  of the  workers.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the  workers are entitled to a small percentage\r\n\r\nof the profits. This is only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasonable and justifiable. Moreover, in the past  few\r\n\r\nyears,  employers have never grumbled about  paying  a\r\n\r\nbonus  to their employees. This is an undeniable fact.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  rather strange that the Government,  as  a\r\n\r\nthird   party,  should  now  step  in  and  take   the\r\n\r\ninitiative  of introducing a provision to abolish  the\r\n\r\npayment   of  bonus  and  giving  employers   absolute\r\n\r\ndiscretion  in this connection. This will  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where the payment of bonus to  the  workers\r\n\r\nwill  depend  entirely  on the employer.  It  is  like\r\n\r\nreceiving  charity from him. Of course,  when  I  give\r\n\r\nthese  views, I do not mean to encourage irresponsible\r\n\r\nunions  to abuse the bonus issue and create industrial\r\n\r\nstrife  over  it. But my point is that we  should  not\r\n\r\nhave a rigid law to abolish the payment of bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a very brief provision in the Bill\r\n\r\nregarding bonus. It says that the payment of  a  bonus\r\n\r\nto  a  worker  should  be  an  incentive  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity or as a reward for good performance. This\r\n\r\nprovision  negates all past awards on the  payment  of\r\n\r\nbonus  and  has  entirely abolished the provision  for\r\n\r\nbonus  in the collective agreements reached.  Thus  it\r\n\r\nwill  lead to a situation where thousands of employees\r\n\r\nwill  have  no alternative but to request  for  salary\r\n\r\nincreases in order to incorporate the bonus that  they\r\n\r\nhave  lost  into their salary scales. Only  thus,  can\r\n\r\nthey  remedy  the  loss  of a bonus.  Without  such  a\r\n\r\nremedy,  the industrial peace and stability  which  we\r\n\r\nare enjoying now will be difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are dazzled by the term \"bonus\", we may\r\n\r\nchange  it  to  the  term  \"rate  of  distribution  of\r\n\r\nprofits\".  If an enterprise or a company  has  made  a\r\n\r\nprofit,  the workers and the employer can  share  this\r\n\r\nprofit  according to a specified rate of distribution.\r\n\r\nThey  should share it at a set rate. I think  this  is\r\n\r\nthe best means to increase productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to deal with retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits. This provision is a great boon to employers.\r\n\r\nOf course, we must stop the small group of workers who\r\n\r\nabuse such benefits, for example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  deliberately carrying out a work-to-rule policy or\r\n\r\nby  indulging  in  absenteeism or  by  disobeying  the\r\n\r\norders of the management with the purpose of provoking\r\n\r\nthe  employers into sacking them so as to benefit from\r\n\r\nsuch a provision. But I must say that I cannot support\r\n\r\nthe  drastic change proposed by this provision.  Those\r\n\r\nwith a service of less than two years are not entitled\r\n\r\nto retrenchment benefits according to the provision in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  Such  a grave problem which  involves  the\r\n\r\nworker  and  his family is glossed over by  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nThis will offer a very good opportunity to an employer\r\n\r\nto  misuse  this provision and to fire  his  employees\r\n\r\nwithout taking into consideration whether his business\r\n\r\nis  making money or is running at a loss, and  without\r\n\r\ntaking  into  consideration whether such  retrenchment\r\n\r\narises  from  the  need  to reorganise  his  business.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  nepotism is very prevalent in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Some employers tend to fill  positions  in\r\n\r\ntheir  organisations with their relatives.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  workers are placed in a very precarious position.\r\n\r\nHence,   I  would  like  the  Minister  carefully   to\r\n\r\nreconsider   this   provision   and   make   necessary\r\n\r\namendments  to  it so as to make it  better  and  more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the provision of\r\n\r\ncompulsory retirement of employees at the age  of  55.\r\n\r\nThe Minister has promised to review this provision, so\r\n\r\nthat   a  worker's  retirement  will  depend  on   his\r\n\r\ncapability to work and not on his age. Such a move  is\r\n\r\nvery   encouraging.  We  must  not  forget  that   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  now  propounding a  social  philosophy\r\n\r\nwhich  puts a premium on a rugged and strong  society.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the significance of this philosophy?  We  can\r\n\r\nsay  with  certainty  that what we  strive  for  is  a\r\n\r\nhealthy   body.  Moreover,  our  medical  and   health\r\n\r\nservices,  although they cannot be regarded  as  among\r\n\r\nthe  foremost  in the world, are, we can  safely  say,\r\n\r\nsecond  to none in Southeast Asia. With such excellent\r\n\r\nmedical and health services, the average\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife  span  of our people is longer than that  of  any\r\n\r\nother country in Southeast Asia. The average life span\r\n\r\nhere is 63 years. If we make it an inflexible law that\r\n\r\na  worker  should retire at the age of 55, and  if  we\r\n\r\ntake  $200  per  month as the average  income  of  our\r\n\r\npeople, then the total income earned in a working life\r\n\r\nof  from 20 years to 55 years will be $84,000. If this\r\n\r\namount  is  spread out over a period of  43  years  as\r\n\r\nhousehold expenditure, it will work out to $162.80 per\r\n\r\nmonth. Thus, if this provision is put into effect, our\r\n\r\nliving standard will be reduced by one-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

While the citizens of Singapore are\r\n\r\nenjoying prosperity, there are, in their midst, people\r\n\r\nwho  are suffering because of the uncertainty of their\r\n\r\ncitizenship   status.  They  cannot  be  regarded   as\r\n\r\nMalaysian   citizens  because  they  are  holders   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  blue identity cards in which their  country\r\n\r\nof  birth  is  stated  as Singapore.  They  cannot  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  Singapore citizens as their  citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus  has  not  been  recognised  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment because they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  produce  their birth certificates.  They  have\r\n\r\neither  lost  them or are unable to establish  exactly\r\n\r\ntheir  dates  of birth. Their efforts to  trace  their\r\n\r\ndates of birth in the Registry of Births were in  vain\r\n\r\nbecause their dates of birth were forgotten. In  other\r\n\r\ncases  the name of the child was not recorded  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  reporting the birth of that child. Only  the\r\n\r\nnames  of  parents were registered. For these reasons,\r\n\r\nofficials  at  the Registry of Births were  unable  to\r\n\r\nissue  Extracts  of  Certificates of  Birth  and  they\r\n\r\nadvised   these   people  to   apply   for   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Unfortunately, when these people  applied\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore citizenship, they had to  wait  for  as\r\n\r\nlong   as   two  years  or  more  without  any   reply\r\n\r\nforthcoming.   In  order  to  obtain   employment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Singapore citizenship is necessary, or  the\r\n\r\napplicant  for  a  job  must be  in  possession  of  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Birth in Singapore. What then  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  fate  of these people and their families  if  the\r\n\r\nissue  of citizenship papers is further delayed?  They\r\n\r\nare,  thus, deprived of the benefits enjoyed by  other\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens.  If  they  leave  Singapore   for\r\n\r\nMalaysia, they will not be accepted there and will  be\r\n\r\nineligible   for  the  rights  enjoyed  by   Malaysian\r\n\r\ncitizens. Their applications for Malaysian citizenship\r\n\r\nwill   similarly   be  rejected   by   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if these unfortunate people cannot\r\n\r\nmake  a living either in Singapore or Malaysia,  where\r\n\r\nelse  can they go to earn an honest living? Unable  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  their families, they might, in  desperation,\r\n\r\ntake  to  crime and steal and rob. Who  then  will  be\r\n\r\nblamed?  It  is also possible that these people  might\r\n\r\ncommit  suicide rather than see their families suffer.\r\n\r\nSuch  a  thing did happen and it was reported  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times of 25th June, 1968, at page  6  and  on\r\n\r\n26th  June, 1968, at page 5. This should be  food  for\r\n\r\nthought  for us all and make us ponder on  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  allow such a state of affairs to  continue  or\r\n\r\nwhether  we should do something about it. Such  people\r\n\r\nand their families must also live like other Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Certainly it is not their wish to  see  the\r\n\r\nlot of their children becoming worse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noff  in  the future.

Only time will  tell  when\r\n\r\nthey will be consigned to the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will consider this problem\r\n\r\nsympathetically  and  relax the regulations  in  order\r\n\r\nthat    these    people    may   obtain    employment.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,    the   Government   should    provide\r\n\r\nfacilities   to   enable  them   to   surmount   their\r\n\r\ndifficulties and establish citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government and\r\n\r\nI  are  well  aware of the problem to which  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Geylang Serai has referred. We sympathise,\r\n\r\nof course, with the difficulties of people who are not\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens, but we have  to  sympathise  even\r\n\r\nmore with the difficulties of Singapore citizens. This\r\n\r\nis a dilemma which, if things were otherwise, we could\r\n\r\nsolve.   But  we  have  also  thousands  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are making demands for jobs,  for  homes\r\n\r\nand  for  houses, and every non-citizen who  is  given\r\n\r\ncitizenship  not  only  gets  a  job,  but   all   the\r\n\r\nprivileges and commitments that we have made in regard\r\n\r\nto all our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the national registration exercise, it was\r\n\r\nrevealed that there were many people who claimed birth\r\n\r\nin  Singapore but who, on further investigation,  were\r\n\r\nfound  not to be born in Singapore. If we do not  have\r\n\r\nsome  criteria for judging proof of birth in Singapore\r\n\r\nand if we just relax or ignore the law, qualifications\r\n\r\nand  evidence  required  to  prove  citizenship,  then\r\n\r\nhaving regard to the conditions prevailing around  us,\r\n\r\nwe might have thousands of people coming here who were\r\n\r\nnot  born  in  Singapore. They  cannot  produce  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates or any other evidence of their  birth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  sympathise with the people  who  claim\r\n\r\nthat  they  were born in Singapore, but who  obviously\r\n\r\ncannot produce any evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that during the re-registration\r\n\r\nexercise,  holders of the old 1948 and  1949  identity\r\n\r\ncards whose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace of birth was shown as Singapore were issued with\r\n\r\npink  identity  cards. We would like to assist  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  undoubtedly  in great difficulties,  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to relax our law on this at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe  would like to do the right thing for one  who  was\r\n\r\nreally  born in Singapore but without any evidence  to\r\n\r\nprove  it.  But  there  is no  way  of  distinguishing\r\n\r\nbetween  him  and one hundred others who just  destroy\r\n\r\nall papers and say that they were born in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do everything we can to make life easier for\r\n\r\nnon-citizens.  For example, people claiming  birth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  without any documentary evidence  can,\r\n\r\nfirst  of all, apply for Singapore citizenship in  the\r\n\r\nnormal  way  as  any other non-citizens  who  ask  for\r\n\r\nconsideration  on the basis of long residence  or  any\r\n\r\nother qualifications. Non-citizens who are holders  of\r\n\r\nblue identity cards can get jobs in Singapore provided\r\n\r\nthey obtain work permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a man holds a blue identity card and says he was\r\n\r\nborn    in    Singapore   and   has   the    requisite\r\n\r\nqualifications,  I  am quite sure that  he  will  have\r\n\r\nprior consideration with regard to the issuing of work\r\n\r\npermits than a non-citizen who was born elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult problem and we sympathise with\r\n\r\npeople  who  may have been born in Singapore  but  are\r\n\r\nwithout birth certificates to prove it.
