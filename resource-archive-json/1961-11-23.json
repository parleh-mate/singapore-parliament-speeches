Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  said  yesterday  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  the merger issue to find out (a)  exactly\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Barisan  Sosialis decided  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger  plan on the basis of autonomy in education  and\r\n\r\nlabour should be branded as phoney and a sell-out;  and\r\n\r\n(b)  when the puppet masters who manipulate the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis decided on the new line of full merger on  the\r\n\r\nbasic  of  automatic Federal citizenship for  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you recollect, Sir, I quoted a letter from Mr Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong,  dated 24th June, in which  he  indicated\r\n\r\nthat merger should not involve a setback for the people\r\n\r\nnot only in terms of freedom and democracy but also  as\r\n\r\nregards  autonomy in labour and education. He  did  not\r\n\r\nthen  (i.e., 24th June) brand the P.A.P.'s  demand  for\r\n\r\nmerger on the basis of autonomy in labour and education\r\n\r\nas phoney or a sell-out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we can determine, Sir, the constitutional\r\n\r\nstand  of  the  Barisan Sosialis leaders  in  June  was\r\n\r\ninternal self-government, not merger, because they then\r\n\r\nbelieved,  presumably on the basis of consultation  and\r\n\r\nclarification with the U.K. Commission, that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntype   of  merger  would  not  be  acceptable  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation  and that, therefore, the P.A.P. would  have\r\n\r\nno   choice  but  to  fight  for  full  internal  self-government and the abolition of the I.S.C.,  which  are\r\n\r\nthe  aims  not only of the Barisan Sosialis, but  as  I\r\n\r\nshall   show  later,  of  the  M.C.P.  That   was   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  stand of the Barisan Sosialis  in  June\r\n\r\nand July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However on 25th August, the Singapore and Federation\r\n\r\nGovernments issued a joint statement agreeing to merger\r\n\r\non  the basis of autonomy in education and labour.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis prophets and Brains Trust  discovered\r\n\r\nthat  they had miscalculated - and not for the first time\r\n\r\neither.   They   had   miscalculated   in   taking   an\r\n\r\nuncompromising stand on the basis of fighting for  full\r\n\r\ninternal self-government. What they believed improbable\r\n\r\nand impossible had happened. Therefore, as I have said,\r\n\r\nSir,  there  was  a  state of befuddlement,  which  was\r\n\r\nexemplified,   as   I  indicated  yesterday,   in   the\r\n\r\n\"Declaration  of meeting of convenors  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\",  dated 3rd September. Things  had  moved  so\r\n\r\nfast  that they were not quite sure what was happening.\r\n\r\nThey  knew there was a race on, but they did  not  know\r\n\r\nwho  were  in the race or what the race was all  about.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in the declaration under the heading,  \"Our\r\n\r\nstand on the constitutional future\", they decided  that\r\n\r\nthe safest thing under the circumstances was to back as\r\n\r\nmany  horses  as possible. So, Sir, under the  heading,\r\n\r\n\"Our  stand on the constitutional future\" they declared\r\n\r\nthat the way ahead, therefore, for a real reunification\r\n\r\nof  our  people  and of our country is in  one  of  two\r\n\r\ndirections:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) immediate full and complete merger with\r\n\r\nSingapore  joining  the  Federation  as  a  constituent\r\n\r\nState, like Penang or Malacca;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) as an autonomous unit within a confederation with\r\n\r\nthe Borneo territories coming in when possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June the Barisan Sosialis was not yet formed,\r\n\r\nbut  it  was  already  a twinkle in  the  eyes  of  its\r\n\r\nparents.  In June, Sir, it was internal self-government\r\n\r\nminus  the I.S.C. - a negation of merger. But  after  it\r\n\r\nbecame obvious that merger on the basis of autonomy  in\r\n\r\nlabour and education was possible, the gentlemen of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis did a triple somersault and fell  fiat\r\n\r\non their faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they had stopped short of what they suggested\r\n\r\nwas  one  of two courses - immediate, full and  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  with  Singapore joining  the  Federation  as  a\r\n\r\nconstituent State like Penang and Malacca: or (it  does\r\n\r\nnot  matter  what it is) an autonomous  unit  within  a\r\n\r\nconfederation  with  the Borneo territories  coming  in\r\n\r\nwhen possible - then we,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever  much we might have disagreed with the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, would never have called into question whether\r\n\r\nthey are for or against merger. We would have said that\r\n\r\nat  least,  however badly they miscalculated when  they\r\n\r\nleft the P.A.P., they did not miscalculate the trend of\r\n\r\npolitical  events  in Singapore. But, Sir,  immediately\r\n\r\nafter  all  these professions of enthusiasm for  merger\r\n\r\nand  confederation, they go on, in the  last  paragraph\r\n\r\nentitled \"Conclusion\", - after a long rigmarole, we  are\r\n\r\nnow  presented with the \"Conclusion\". Having said  that\r\n\r\nthere  are two courses for Singapore - complete  merger,\r\n\r\nor  confederation, they conclude - nothing. I think this\r\n\r\nis a classic example of how the thinking of the leaders\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis differs from ordinary mortals.\r\n\r\nHaving  said that there are two courses open - complete\r\n\r\nmerger  or  confederation, they conclude,  and  I  will\r\n\r\nread, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The immediate task, therefore, is to acquire the\r\n\r\nright  of  self-determination and achieve full internal\r\n\r\nself-government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the conclusion. The logic is this. The way\r\n\r\nahead  is in one of two directions - complete merger  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  Penang and Malacca,  or  confederation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we conclude that the Barisan Sosialis should\r\n\r\nfight  for  internal self-government.  Full  merger  is\r\n\r\ngood;  confederation is good; therefore, let  us  fight\r\n\r\nnot for merger or confederation, but for internal self-government  and  the  abolition  of  the  I.S.C.  This,\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  Members  of  the Barisan  Sosialis  would\r\n\r\nclaim,  is the logic higher dialectical materialism,  a\r\n\r\nclassic example of progress -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chim (Nee Soon)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Yes, Sir.

This is very much like the  young  and\r\n\r\nnervous  lawyer who concluded his speech  to  the  jury\r\n\r\nwith   the  words,  \"Gentlemen,  these  then  are   the\r\n\r\nconclusions on which I base my facts.\" The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown took 7\u00bd hours to tell us the conclusions on\r\n\r\nwhich  he based his facts. We discovered that  when  he\r\n\r\nconcluded his speech on Tuesday. After saying  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  for  merger and that he was prepared to sacrificed\r\n\r\nnot  only Mr Lim Ching Siong but possibly also the  12\r\n\r\nor  13  other anxious Members in this Assembly  in  the\r\n\r\ncause  of merger, he said. \"But if all this fails, let\r\n\r\nus  fight  for full internal self-government minus  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council.\" So far as we can determine.\r\n\r\non 3rd September, the stands of the Barisan Sosialis on\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional future were complete merger on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  Penang and Malacca, confederation, and  full\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government minus  the  I.S.C.  Like  the\r\n\r\nScarlet   Pimpernel, they  were   here,   there   and\r\n\r\neverywhere.  They were animal, vegetable  and  mineral.\r\n\r\nThey  were  atheists, monotheists and pantheists.  They\r\n\r\ncould  not possibly go wrong - so they thought. The  ways\r\n\r\nof mice and men!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st September, one of their stands collapsed. It\r\n\r\nhad  to be abandoned. This was their stand on full  and\r\n\r\ncomplete merger on the basis of Penang and Malacca. The\r\n\r\ntragedy - if I may so call it - occurred in the course  of\r\n\r\na radio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforum    in    which   the   Member   for   Queenstown\r\n\r\nparticipated - together with the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nand.  I  believe,  the Member for Hong Lim - prompted.  I\r\n\r\nhave no doubt, more by valour than discretion. There he\r\n\r\ndiscovered  to his horror that merger on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca would have meant that  only  about\r\n\r\nhalf   of   Singapore's  citizens  would  automatically\r\n\r\nqualify for Federal citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, I understand that the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  has developed a kind of phobia about  radio\r\n\r\nforums. Perhaps it is not the Member for Queenstown  so\r\n\r\nmuch  as  his  colleagues who sweat at the  thought  of\r\n\r\nhaving to let him loose at radio forums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after this disastrous radio encounter, the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  full and complete merger on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nPenang  and Malacca - I repeat on the basis  of  Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca - was quietly dropped but was  heard  all\r\n\r\naround. Everybody knew. Just as the late Mr Stalin was\r\n\r\ndisinterred  and  buried outside  the  grounds  of  the\r\n\r\nKremlin, so did this Party pillar vanish from the  hymn\r\n\r\nbook  of  the Barisan Sosialis. Since then, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  choir  has rearranged the  merger  music.  We\r\n\r\nhear, Sir, more and more about something called Article\r\n\r\n22 and, of course, automatic Federal citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a rendering of this new choral arrangement\r\n\r\nfrom the robust throat of the Member for Queenstown for\r\n\r\nthe best part of 7\u00bd hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So today the new tune, the new line is automatic\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship for all Singapore citizens.  As  I\r\n\r\nexplained  yesterday,  Sir, this demand  for  automatic\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship is being put forward  not  with  a\r\n\r\nview to enhancing the prospects for merger, but to make\r\n\r\nsure  that merger does not come about, so that we would\r\n\r\nbe  forced to adopt the true and only objective of  the\r\n\r\nreal  leaders of the Barisan Sosialis - a self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore minus the I.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis leaders are genuinely\r\n\r\ndetermined  to achieve merger, then let them repudiate,\r\n\r\nwithout  any qualification, their objective of internal\r\n\r\nself-government for Singapore, because  internal  self-government  is a complete negation of the objective  of\r\n\r\nmerger. If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey are really for merger, if they claim that they are\r\n\r\ninterested in the reunification of the two territories,\r\n\r\nand  if  they claim that they are in the mainstream  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  nationalism, then let them say  that  internal\r\n\r\nself-government  is  not  their  objective  under   any\r\n\r\ncircumstances. If they are prepared to do that, then on\r\n\r\nthis  side  of  the  House, many people, many  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists  will not taunt them by saying  that  they\r\n\r\nare not sincere when they ask for merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the Barisan Sosialis should really\r\n\r\nstick  to  section 5 of the declaration  that  the  way\r\n\r\nahead  for  a  real  reunification of  our  people  and\r\n\r\nterritories  is  in  one of two directions-full  merger\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore joining the Federation as a constituent\r\n\r\nState  or  a  Confederation. Let them put  forward  two\r\n\r\nchoices  both  of which would lead to merger,  but  not\r\n\r\nthree.  Therefore, I propose that the three points  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis should consider are - merger as outlined\r\n\r\nin  the White Paper proposals; merger as put forward by\r\n\r\nthem on the basis of automatic Federal citizenship; and\r\n\r\nrepudiation of full internal self-government  with  the\r\n\r\nT.S.C. abolished. Then the choice will be not  between\r\n\r\nmerger  and no merger, but between different  kinds  of\r\n\r\nmerger. That is the true choice. That is the choice  of\r\n\r\nanyone  who claims to be a Malayan nationalist and  who\r\n\r\nclaims to be interested in the reunification of the two\r\n\r\nterritories.  Scrap  this constant demand  which  boils\r\n\r\ndown to this: let us have full internal self-government\r\n\r\nminus  the I.S.C. In fact, that is a choice which every\r\n\r\nSocialist  and  nationalist repudiates  as  unbecoming.\r\n\r\ndangerous and anti-nationalistic. Let us therefore  put\r\n\r\nforward  the  two  choices  to  the  people  for  their\r\n\r\nconsideration: merger as outlined in the White Paper -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Phoney merger!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - or merger as demanded by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis with automatic Federal citizenship for all. If\r\n\r\nthat  is the choice - we for our own part believe that\r\n\r\nour  proposals will be acceptable to the Federation and\r\n\r\nto  the  people  of  Singapore - if the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nbelieve, as they say, that it is a phoney merger,  well\r\n\r\nand good.

For example, Sir, it was reported  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times of 22nd November, 1961, that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  after a long and passionate  plea  for\r\n\r\nmerger and after shedding a lot of tears about how  the\r\n\r\ntwo peoples are separated and how our blood brothers in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation have been inhumanly kept apart  h3  the\r\n\r\nBritish  colonialists - we shall  come  to  the  Barisan\r\n\r\ncolonialists  later, but, anyway, for  the  time  being\r\n\r\nBritish colonialists - said [22nd November]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"We must therefore reject the merger proposals.

After 7\u00bd hours of  oration\r\n\r\nand consultation, the Barisan Sosialis have reached the\r\n\r\npre-determined  conclusions  on  which  it  based  its\r\n\r\narguments - that if we cannot get merger,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  let us reject the White Paper proposals;  let  us\r\n\r\nreject  the P.A.P. proposals for merger and bet  us  go\r\n\r\nback to internal self-government minus the I.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown spent practically all\r\n\r\nhis  7\u00bd hours telling how terrible things would be for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans. Singaporeans, he said, would  be  second-class  citizens. There would be apartheid. Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould be treated like social outcastes, not fit and not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  mix  with our brothers in the  Federation.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   he   said,  would   he   treated   like\r\n\r\nillegitimate citizens. Singaporeans would be treated as\r\n\r\nthough   they  were  suffering  from  some   infectious\r\n\r\ndisease.  And  all  these, Sir, come  from  people  who\r\n\r\nbelieve  in merger! They were saying that merger  is  a\r\n\r\nwonderful  thing, but if a P.A.P. type of merger  comes\r\n\r\nabout,  then there would be apartheid, and Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould be treated like social outcastes, not fit to  mix\r\n\r\nwith their brothers in the Federation, and treated like\r\n\r\nsomebody suffering from an infectious disease. This  is\r\n\r\nthe  propaganda  of men who want to sell  the  idea  of\r\n\r\nmerger. We know, Sir, that it is just the opposite, and\r\n\r\nthat this fits in with our thesis - that they dread  and\r\n\r\nare terrified of merger; not them but their mentors are\r\n\r\nterrified  of merger. It is like those matchmakers  who\r\n\r\ngo  around  and, if they do not want someone  to  marry\r\n\r\nsomeone  else, they say. \"Yes, we are not in a position\r\n\r\nto  get a very good girl.

The same cry was raised. \"Let  us  resist\r\n\r\nthis  new  Constitution granting  independence  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  because  lots of people  are  going  to  be\r\n\r\nsecond-class  citizens.\" And since the Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis claim to be on the side of history, to\r\n\r\nlive with history, to sleep with history, they would do\r\n\r\nwell  to ponder over the fact that all the hue and  cry\r\n\r\nover second-class citizens failed to halt the advent of\r\n\r\nMerdeka  in  the Federation. Today not even the  P.P.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  find it profitable to revive the  question  of\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizenship, simply because there was very\r\n\r\nlittle  to this cry. So the Barisan Sosialis, who  are\r\n\r\nnever  original (you can see. Sir, that they even  have\r\n\r\nthe  same colours as the Party that they left; in fact,\r\n\r\nthey  have a circle for their symbol but they have  not\r\n\r\nquite dared to complete it, so they put a star in)  are\r\n\r\nmerely repeating the tactics (well, there is no harm in\r\n\r\nrepeating tactics) which were unsuccessfully  tried  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  in  the hope of halting  independence.\r\n\r\nToday  the  Barisan  Sosialis  are  also  committed  to\r\n\r\nhalting  independence through merger for Singapore.  So\r\n\r\nlike  the gentlemen who failed in the Federation,  they\r\n\r\ntoo  are  raising  a  hue  and cry  about  second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of his speech on Tuesday, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown tried to create fears and doubts\r\n\r\nabout   merger   in   the  minds  of  civil   servants,\r\n\r\ncontractors,  students, businessmen and bus  companies.\r\n\r\nThis he did, not by saying in what way these categories\r\n\r\nof people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  suffer under the citizenship proposals contained\r\n\r\nin  the  White Paper, but by simply asking a number  of\r\n\r\nquestions  and  hoping to leave behind  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  all  these  people would suffer under  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger proposals. For example, in the speech  he\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would not this segregation and isolation of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore from the people of the Federation\r\n\r\nlead to a further widening of differences that existed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  did  not  say  that  it would.  But  he  asked  the\r\n\r\nquestion. He did not reply. He did not say, \"Yes,  that\r\n\r\nwould be so.\" Then he asked,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What would the civil servants gain with merger?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Again a question. No reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would they get more opportunities for promotion in a\r\n\r\nwider  service under the same terms existing, or  under\r\n\r\nbetter terms?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Again a question. No answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would bus companies be allowed to operate freely on\r\n\r\nnew routes in the Federation?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Question - no answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would they be treated equally with others?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Question - no answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would contractors get the same opportunities for\r\n\r\nbusiness in the Federation as in Singapore?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Question - no answer.

Singapore  businessmen,  Singapore  civil\r\n\r\nservants, and contractors would not be able to  survive\r\n\r\neconomically in Singapore, let alone in the Federation.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the logical outcome of the Barisan  Sosialis'\r\n\r\nrhetorical  questions - what will happen  to  this?

So   do   Singapore\r\n\r\ncontractors.  In  so  far as there  is  preference  for\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens in the matter of Government  jobs  or\r\n\r\ncontracts, may I point out that in Singapore too  there\r\n\r\nis  priority  for Singapore citizens in the  matter  of\r\n\r\ncertain types of Government jobs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, under the Barisan Sosialis' type of\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger,  I  can provide the  answers  to  the\r\n\r\nquestions   that  the  Member  for  Queenstown   asked.\r\n\r\nSingapore's civil servants definitely will suffer -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

There is this obsession on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Queenstown and his Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\ncolleagues then .somehow they are men of destiny by the\r\n\r\nmen  whom the regard as God, to lead the people of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  into the Promised Land. Somehow  they  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they  are the saviours. This is an  obsession,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  which  is well worth studying  by  students  of\r\n\r\npsychology. In fact, the Member for Queenstown harped a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal on this aspect of the matter: that  somehow\r\n\r\nSingapore  politicians must save  the  natives  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation;   that   without  their   guidance, their\r\n\r\nbenevolent influence, the people of the Federation  are\r\n\r\ndoomed to relapse into the dark ages. He harped  on  it\r\n\r\nfor  so long that I got the distinct impression  - and  I\r\n\r\nonly  meant that it was only an impression - that  there\r\n\r\nwere  a  lot  of  10-carat Messiahs  dissatisfied  with\r\n\r\nhaving  to operate within the confines of the Singapore\r\n\r\nparish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we of the P.A.P. are sometimes accommodating and\r\n\r\nwe  have  been  considerate enough in the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals  to provide opportunities for Messiahs  whose\r\n\r\negos are too big to find expression within the confines\r\n\r\nof  a  small  island.  Under our  proposals.  Singapore\r\n\r\npoliticians  can  help to shape national  politics  and\r\n\r\npolicies through the 15 seats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallotted to us in the Federal Legislature.

Policies  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federal  Parliament,  or  for  that  matter   any\r\n\r\nParliament, are 1101 decided on a territorial  line-up.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a question of 15 Singapore representatives\r\n\r\nganging up against Penang and Pahang representatives on\r\n\r\nany issue.

What would be  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  Singaporeans  under  full  internal   self-government? They would still be Singapore citizens.

In rejecting merger and  posing  self-government   as  the  alternative, the   great   anti-colonialists of the Barisan Sosialis find themselves in\r\n\r\nthe  ludicrous and humiliating position  of  having  to\r\n\r\nadmit publicly - that is, not yet but soon they will have\r\n\r\nto  - that they would rather be British nationals  than\r\n\r\nFederation  nationals;  that  they  would  rather  have\r\n\r\nBritish  control over our foreign affairs  and  defence\r\n\r\nthan  that  of  the Federation, their  blood  brothers,\r\n\r\ntheir  kith  and  kin, for whom they  feel  such  great\r\n\r\nconcern.

Sir,  you can imagine  the  laughter  that\r\n\r\nwould  resound  in anti-colonial Asia and  Africa  when\r\n\r\nthey  learn  that  in  Singapore we  have  great  anti-colonialists   who   prefer  British   nationality   to\r\n\r\nFederation nationality, who are fighting to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  control of foreign policy and defence  remains  in\r\n\r\nBritish hands rather than be transferred to the Federal\r\n\r\nParliament in which Singaporeans would be represented -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S.

Mr Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, these are inferences which I\r\n\r\ndraw from the logic of what would happen if we followed\r\n\r\nthe policy of internal self-government. Let me say here\r\n\r\nthat there will be a time when the gentlemen concerned\r\n\r\nwould be forced as anti-colonialists to say publicly - and I shall be glad to wait for that day - \"We will be\r\n\r\nBritish nationals or work towards a situation where we\r\n\r\nwill continue to be British nationals rather than\r\n\r\nFederation nationals.\" That day will come, Sir, as many\r\n\r\nthings have come to pass which the Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis did not expect. Anyway, I am just\r\n\r\ntrying to save the few anti-colonialists who are still\r\n\r\nleft in the Barisan Sosialis. To follow the policy they\r\n\r\nadvocate of full internal self-government, the logic of\r\n\r\nevents must inevitably lead them - as it has already led\r\n\r\nthem, as their speeches have indicated; the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown spent a great deal of time yesterday and the\r\n\r\nday before saying that we were going to be social\r\n\r\noutcastes and lepers - to Singapore citizenship with British nationality;\r\n\r\nthat Singapore citizens prefer that defence and foreign\r\n\r\naffairs should be run by the British without Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens having a say in determining foreign policy and\r\n\r\ndefence. But under our proposals which they regard as\r\n\r\nphoney and which they say are terrible, at least we\r\n\r\nbecome Federal nationals, the same as our brothers in\r\n\r\nthe Federation. We have a say in determining defence\r\n\r\nand foreign policy. Sir, that then is the position to\r\n\r\nwhich they must inevitably drift. They will have to put\r\n\r\nthemselves in the humiliating position of appearing, in\r\n\r\nthe eyes of anti-colonial Asia and Africa, to fight for\r\n\r\na situation where they will have to ensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat they would rather that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinue to the British subjects and Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens, than be Singapore citizens, and Federation\r\n\r\nnationals.

Member:</b> We never go there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Simply because they are holding on to\r\n\r\nan untenable and illogical position in resisting\r\n\r\nmerger. To put it more bluntly, Sir, the real and only\r\n\r\nobjective of the M.C.P. is to secure the abolition of\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council so that Singapore can be\r\n\r\nconverted into a base for Communist operations in this\r\n\r\npart of the world. Merger frustrates this plan. Merger\r\n\r\ndenies them this opportunity. Therefore, merger must be\r\n\r\nresisted, but without giving the appearance of\r\n\r\nresisting merger, and this is not an easy thing to do,\r\n\r\nsimply because the motive force behind merger is the\r\n\r\npowerful and irresistible force of Malayan nationalism,\r\n\r\nand by an unhappy combination of circumstances in\r\n\r\nMalaya, the M.C.P. has been put in the position of\r\n\r\nhaving to combat not colonialism, but the force of\r\n\r\nMalayan nationalism. We do not know, Sir, whether this\r\n\r\nis the decision of the top brains of the M.C.P. or only\r\n\r\nof its sergeant-majors, but whoever made this decision,\r\n\r\nthe fact remains that the Barisan Sosialis have been\r\n\r\nmanoeuvred into an untenable position of having to\r\n\r\nresist the irrestible force of Malayan nationalism. It\r\n\r\nmay be that many Members of the Barisan Sosialis may\r\n\r\nnot he aware of this. But two facts should make it\r\n\r\nclear to most of them, that in embarking on a trail of\r\n\r\nstrength with the force of Malayan nationalism, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  chosen the wrong opponent. The first fact is that\r\n\r\nthough  the  real leaders of the Barisan Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nmade  every  effort  since June to stop  the  drift  to\r\n\r\nmerger,  they have failed. Let them ponder  over  that.\r\n\r\nThey  have  used  every device from betrayal  of  their\r\n\r\ncomrades to attempts to capture the government and  yet\r\n\r\nthey have failed. Let them ponder over this. Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Federation, the M.C.P. thought they could\r\n\r\ncapture the place. They came quite close to it, but the\r\n\r\nday   that   the   British   granted   the   Federation\r\n\r\nindependence,  the  M.C.P. leaders  became  wise.  The\r\n\r\nM.C.P. decided  that  they were taking  on  the  wrong\r\n\r\nenemy -  Malayan nationalism - and so for the  time  being\r\n\r\nthey abandoned the terrorist war. They knew that anyone\r\n\r\nwho  fights  the force of Malayan nationalism  must  be\r\n\r\ncrushed.  The  colonialists discovered it.  The  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  discovered it. There were a lot of  people  at\r\n\r\nthat  time  who said that it was a phoney  independence\r\n\r\nand  that  Tunku  Abdul Rahman  was  a  stooge  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish. But do you remember, Sir, the question put  by\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku to Chin Peng, \"Do you regard me as a British\r\n\r\nstooge?\"  The  answer was, \"No, I  regard  you  as  the\r\n\r\nleader  of Malayan nationalism.\" Immediately after  the\r\n\r\nBaling talks, the M.C.P. armed revolt -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order.

I  will\r\n\r\ncome back to the main trend of my argument, though that\r\n\r\nshould  not  prevent them from cogitating over  what  I\r\n\r\nhave said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, in embarking on a trial of strength\r\n\r\nwith  the force of Malayan nationalism, the Members  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSosialis - or  at least those who direct its  destinies - have  chosen  the wrong opponent and that explains  why\r\n\r\nafter making every effort - betraying the trust that was\r\n\r\nplaced  in  them - they have not been able to  stop  the\r\n\r\ndrift  towards  merger. Those of  them  who  have  read\r\n\r\ntoday's  newspapers must realise that they are standing\r\n\r\nin  the way - and here I am quite sure that there  will\r\n\r\nbe   no   interjection - of  what  Lenin   called   \"the\r\n\r\nlocomotive of history\". Sir, Lenin - would I be straying\r\n\r\nfrom  the  point?  - a man who happened to  have  written\r\n\r\nbooks  (the others are people who only read  the  front\r\n\r\npages  of  his  books) said that  there  are  times  in\r\n\r\nhistory when what he called \"the locomotive of history\"\r\n\r\ngets  into motion, and you can determine it by  knowing\r\n\r\nwhether  the  force which is going forward  is  on  the\r\n\r\nascendancy  or  not. Sir, those of  us  who  have  read\r\n\r\ntoday's  newspapers will know that the fateful  day  is\r\n\r\ncoming nearer and nearer. We are now coming on to 1962.\r\n\r\nThe drive for merger is not P.A.P.'s or anybody else's,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  part  of  history - \"the  locomotive  of\r\n\r\nhistory\".  Any  gentleman who  stands  in  front  would\r\n\r\nperhaps  be  unrecognisable  when  \"the  locomotive  of\r\n\r\nhistory\" has passed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Except the British!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Another evidence of the\r\n\r\nmiscalculation of the Barisan Sosialis is the  stand - as\r\n\r\nI  said  earlier -  which leads them to favour a  British\r\n\r\nnational  status  and  British  control  over   foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  and defence. How is it that they  are  put  in\r\n\r\nthis false position? It is simply because their initial\r\n\r\nassumptions   were   wrong.  They  have   based   their\r\n\r\ncalculations  and efforts on the wrong  force - a  dying\r\n\r\nforce - in resisting merger. Merger is of the future. But\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis are trying to preserve  something\r\n\r\nthat  belongs to the past. Therefore, because  of  that\r\n\r\nand  not  because  of the P.A.P.'s  cleverness  or  the\r\n\r\nTunku's  cleverness. (we are with the tide of  history)\r\n\r\nthat  they have picked the wrong opponent and they have\r\n\r\ntaken  the wrong stand. Therefore, they find themselves\r\n\r\nin  this  predicament of having to humiliate themselves\r\n\r\nby saying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublicly, \"I would rather be a British national than\r\n\r\na Federal national.\" We are not saying that you are\r\n\r\nfighting for it.

They may believe otherwise. Today  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate  it  will  be possible for the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis to dismiss them as fairly tales.  They\r\n\r\ncan dismiss our contention today - it may be tomorrow: it\r\n\r\nmay  be  the  day  after  tomorrow - that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis is lighting the M.C.P. battle against  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalism  as  a fairy tale. They can  laugh  it  oil\r\n\r\ntoday. But there will come a time very soon when merger\r\n\r\nis  finally realised and the M.C.P. gives the signal to\r\n\r\nlaunch  a  do-or-die offensive. The signs  of  such  an\r\n\r\noffensive  are already here. When that time comes,  the\r\n\r\nbattle  lines will be clearly drawn. There will  he  no\r\n\r\nequivocation  then, because there will be no  no-man's-land.  There will only be a thin red line dividing  the\r\n\r\nforces of Malayan nationalism from the anti-nationalist\r\n\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959, when we were fighting the British\r\n\r\ncolonialists, there was a vast stretch of no-man's-land\r\n\r\nbecause the light then was between the pro-colonialists\r\n\r\nand  the anti-colonialists. The ideological lines  were\r\n\r\nblurred and therefore there were rescue parties to  let\r\n\r\nout of gaol those who had made false moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this is 1961 and not 1959. The battle is of\r\n\r\na different kind -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Then  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  words but deeds which will decide who is on  which\r\n\r\nside  of the thin red line. Those who oppose merger - and\r\n\r\nthe  time has come when merger obviously can be opposed\r\n\r\nnot by words but by deeds - then cannot say that they are\r\n\r\nreally  nationalists  at heart. They  must  take  their\r\n\r\nchances,  as  I  said, Sir, against \"the locomotive  of\r\n\r\nhistory\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, people can opt out of the battle in the\r\n\r\nnick  of time, provided they get their timing right.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir, that some people are already  passing\r\n\r\nthe  word around that they may cease being students  of\r\n\r\npolitics to take up law or medicine abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate, Sir, that our basic opposition to\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  is not  over  the  question  of\r\n\r\nautomatic   Federal  citizenship  for   all   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. If they can persuade the Federation  and  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore to accept their type of merger,  we\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P., though we stand by  our  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals, would be only too happy to doff our caps  to\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, whatever our  differences  with\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in so far as they sabotage merger and attempt to\r\n\r\nfight  for full internal self-government for Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen  in  our view the Barisan Sosialis is no  ally  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  nationalism and will be fought to the  bitter\r\n\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I end remarks on a happy and hopeful note? I\r\n\r\nremember seeing an anti-war film called \"On the Beach\".\r\n\r\nIn  that film, the whole world is devastated by  atomic\r\n\r\nradiation. All forms of life have ceased to exist.  The\r\n\r\nlast  shot  in  the  film shows  dead  leaves  and  old\r\n\r\nnewspapers  being  wafted over  and  a  Salvation  Army\r\n\r\nbanner  fluttering in the breeze. Sir, it reads, \"There\r\n\r\nis  still  time,  brother\". But in case  it  should  be\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  I am making use of religious  appeals.\r\n\r\nmay I say. \"There is still time, comrade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final piece of hopeful message. May I refer to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown who told us a great deal  about\r\n\r\nthe  rising  Barisan 'Star'? I took the  precaution  of\r\n\r\nlooking up the Free Press to read what the Stars had to\r\n\r\nsay. Perhaps it is a very inappropriate reading.

In the  United  States,  Sir  a\r\n\r\nmodern  civilised  western  democracy, the  capitalist\r\n\r\nPress has so vilified and filthied the word \"socialist\"\r\n\r\nthat  to  many  Americans it evokes a  picture  of  the\r\n\r\ndripping  fangs of Communism fastened on the  quivering\r\n\r\nflesh of capitalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., recognising to what extent propaganda can\r\n\r\nabuse  the  word, have decided to get on the bandwagon,\r\n\r\nand  they have taken the most sacred word in our  local\r\n\r\npolitical dictionary and turned it off its meaning  and\r\n\r\nare  making it apply seemingly to a colonial  transfer.\r\n\r\nIt  is  in this manner. Sir, that the word \"merger\"  is\r\n\r\nbeing used in the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister thought he was clever - and often he is clever - and instead of permitting us to debate, as we should have, the motion of thanks to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on his speech and the amendment thereon, and thereafter to debate the White Paper, had brought in this totally irrelevant motion in the context of today, because he hoped to - what was the Minister for Finance's word? - zugzwang us into voting\r\n\r\nfor  what, on the face of it, appears honest, but  what\r\n\r\nin  the  context  of  its  introduction  is  false  and\r\n\r\nmisleading. The Leader of the House, Sir, informed  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   in   one   of   his   letters   that   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional proposals constitute merger  because  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  voting  for representatives  in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.   The  Finance  Minister  says   that   the\r\n\r\nproposals constitute merger because, in his words,  \"We\r\n\r\nwill share a common political life with our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrothers  across  the Causeway.\" And the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  recognises the illogical stand and  speaks  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger. But the Prime Minister  uses  the  word\r\n\r\n\"Merger\", \"Merger\", \"Merger\", incessantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House to turn its eyes away from the Front\r\n\r\nBench  and  to  see what the Federation Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid, Sir, - I am quoting from the Straits Times - I shall\r\n\r\nbe handing in these papers, Mr Speaker -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir,\r\n\r\nfor your guidance. They are all available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quotation is from the Straits Times, 17th\r\n\r\nOctober,  page  9,  column  2,  the  Federation   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to his Parliament on the Malaysia motion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But one thing is certain, and that is that we cannot\r\n\r\ntake  Singapore  with us in complete merger  without  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of unhappiness and trouble, and so we  must\r\n\r\nfind a middle course.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"We  must  find a middle course\", that  is  to  say,  a\r\n\r\nmiddle    course   between   separation   and   merger.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  Sir, as has already been pointed  out  to\r\n\r\nyou  in  this  House,  at  the  Press  conference  last\r\n\r\nThursday, the Prime Minister of the Federation with his\r\n\r\ntypical  honesty and frankness said to the Press,  \"No,\r\n\r\nyou  can't call these constitutional proposals  merger.\r\n\r\nIt  would be more correct to say a form of every  close\r\n\r\nassociation.\"  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  I  have  known  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime Minister for some ten years.  I  have\r\n\r\nwatched  him closely in his public utterances  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  seven  years, and  I can  say  to  you,  in  all\r\n\r\nsincerity, that I have never known the Federation Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to make one statement that was false. That  is\r\n\r\na  pretty  fine  record. And though, as  a  citizen  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I am ashamed to confess it, I will  say  to\r\n\r\nyou, Mr Speaker, that when it comes to our Government,\r\n\r\nour Prime Minister and our Deputy Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister, the Minister for Culture, and any\r\n\r\nof  the  others,  saying one thing, and the  Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  saying something different,  I  accept\r\n\r\nwithout  hesitation, though ashamed, the truth of  what\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Prime Minister says. It is  unfortunate\r\n\r\nfor  our  people  that  our Government  and  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  seem constitutionally incapable of  achieving\r\n\r\neven  to  some  degree the integrity and the  frankness\r\n\r\nwith  his people that the Federation Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\ncapable of. If our Government had had but a modicum  of\r\n\r\nthe  decency  and  the frankness which  the  Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has always had, we would not have  had,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  motion before us, a motion which,  whatever\r\n\r\nthe  motives  of  the  Government,  is  calculated  and\r\n\r\ncalculated  only to mislead the people. We  would  have\r\n\r\nhad  a  Government come to say to us, \"  Look,  in  our\r\n\r\nview, merger is impossible. We have achieved some  sort\r\n\r\nof closer relationship. This White Paper is that closer\r\n\r\nrelationship.  We urge you to accept  it.\"  That  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  clean;  that would have been  honest;  that\r\n\r\nwould  have been the decent thing to do. But  it  is  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may not accept the White Paper. But the point\r\n\r\nis, if they had come to us in this fashion, I would not\r\n\r\nand I could not criticise them. Though I tried with all\r\n\r\nmy heart, I failed. And they have, in failing, achieved\r\n\r\nmore than I have succeeded in achieving. So I would  be\r\n\r\nthe  last man to have criticised them if they had  come\r\n\r\nto  us quite honestly and said, \"This isn't merger.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse  not. We can't achieve merger. But this  is  the\r\n\r\nmost  we  can do. How about accepting it?\" No. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare  not  permitted  even in these fateful  matters  to\r\n\r\ndebate  the truth without seven veils of filth. Instead\r\n\r\nof  a motion which, we could have understood, which  we\r\n\r\ncould  have  debated, we have this  totally  irrelevant\r\n\r\nmotion in the name of the Minister for Labour - not  that\r\n\r\nI  am  blaming  him, Sir, I know he has to  accept  his\r\n\r\nmaster's voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the context of what the Federation Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has told us, that this is not a merger, as  we\r\n\r\ncan see for ourselves, but a form of closer relation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  can  understand the Barisan Sosialis' amendment  to\r\n\r\nthis motion, an amendment which seeks to restore to the\r\n\r\nword  \"merger\" its true meaning. In fact, Sir, it is  a\r\n\r\nmisnomer  to  call  it  an  amendment  except  in   the\r\n\r\ntechnical   sense,   for  it  is   no   more   than   a\r\n\r\nclarification,  an  attempt  to  restore  to  the  word\r\n\r\n\"merger\", as for the word \"socialist\", the meaning that\r\n\r\nhonest people give it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture, if I may say so\r\n\r\nwithout seeming to be patronising, has indicated  quite\r\n\r\nclearly  his  recognition of the  inappropriateness  of\r\n\r\nthat  word  and  has  sought to change  it  to  \"P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger\". Sir, you just cannot take a word which belongs\r\n\r\nto  everybody and make it a P.A.P. property and give it\r\n\r\nany  meaning you like. But he has not talked of merger.\r\n\r\nHe  has said, however, something that surprises me  and\r\n\r\ndisappoints me. Until I heard him, I had believed  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. all genuinely wanted complete merger,  but,\r\n\r\nnot being able to achieve it. Sir, were bringing us the\r\n\r\nbest they could. But the Minister told us categorically\r\n\r\nyesterday,  Sir, if you will remember, that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndoes  not  believe  in  a complete  merger,  because  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  with Singapore as the  twelfth  State\r\n\r\nwould be harmful to Singapore. Well, of course, Sir, if\r\n\r\nthat  is  so, I can understand them voting against  the\r\n\r\namendment, and I should expect them to vote against the\r\n\r\nmotion. If you do not believe in a merger because it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  harm Singapore, vote against the motion  and\r\n\r\nlet us talk about the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I must say, Sir, although he is not\r\n\r\nhere - perhaps it is better when he is not  here,  since\r\n\r\nI  am  going  to compliment him - I heard with  pleasure\r\n\r\nthe Member for Cairnhill -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He is here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Oh, I beg your pardon - when he said\r\n\r\nmerger  can only mean merger; it can only mean complete\r\n\r\nunification  of our two territories, and  our  citizens\r\n\r\ncompletely identified as citizens of the Federation.  I\r\n\r\nsay  I could not agree with him more. I agree with  him\r\n\r\nwhole-heartedly. That is true. That is the only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhonest,  only real, only meaning of the word  \"merger\".\r\n\r\nHis   phrase,   \"complete  unification   of   our   two\r\n\r\nterritories, and our citizens completely identified  as\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the  Federation\". And that  is  what  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis' amendment is seeking to clarify.  But\r\n\r\nthen, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill went on to say that\r\n\r\nhe was voting against the amendment. I am puzzled, Sir,\r\n\r\nas  in  politics  one is always puzzled.  I  am  not  a\r\n\r\nstudent  even. I am an amateur, and I confess it.  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  he  is  voting  against the amendment  which  says,\r\n\r\n\"genuine   merger   [adding  the  word  \"genuine\"].with\r\n\r\nSingapore  coming in as the twelfth State and Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  being automatically citizens\" - but that  is  a\r\n\r\nclarification of the word \"merger\". If you vote against\r\n\r\nthat,  then you do not want Singapore in as the twelfth\r\n\r\nState; you do not want genuine merger; you do not  want\r\n\r\nour  citizens as citizens of the Federation. Then  what\r\n\r\nare  you voting for when you vote for the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour's motion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he said. \"I am voting against it because it is\r\n\r\ntautologous  and  redundant.\" Lovely  words,  Sir.  But\r\n\r\nforgive  me.  I am sure you know it, if I refresh  your\r\n\r\nmemory   as   to   the  fact  that  \"tautologous\"   and\r\n\r\n\"redundant\" mean the same thing. And anybody  who  uses\r\n\r\nthose two words is himself tautologous or redundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his colleague, the Member for Geylang Serai, put\r\n\r\nhis  finger  on  it  but  in a curious  and  mysterious\r\n\r\nfashion.  He said - this is something I have been  trying\r\n\r\nto understand; these are his words\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- \"Quite bluntly, I cannot vote for the amendment\r\n\r\nbecause it is a political amendment.\" Sir, does he mean\r\n\r\nthat just as the word \"merger\" in the motion is a false\r\n\r\nword,  is an abuse of the word, so the amendment itself\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean what it says, but is being false?  I  do\r\n\r\nwish,  Sir, that he had expanded that, because I should\r\n\r\nhave  liked  to understand him. Sir, to say  \"political\r\n\r\namendment\" - of course, the motion is political. I  mean,\r\n\r\nwe  are discussing a political issue in that motion - the\r\n\r\npolitical issue of merger - so the amendment is naturally\r\n\r\npolitical from that point of view. I repeat, I do  wish\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Geylang  Serai had assisted  us  a  little\r\n\r\nfurther, because let me say this quite frankly, Sir,I\r\n\r\ncannot look into the minds or the hearts of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  I heard some terrible allegations  from  the\r\n\r\nother  side  of the House about them. I have  not  even\r\n\r\nspoken to them. In so far as I am aware, they were  too\r\n\r\nterrified to speak to me! But I do not know.  I  cannot\r\n\r\njudge. All I can judge is from the amendment they  have\r\n\r\nbrought  iii, and to me it looks an honest,  reasonable\r\n\r\nand  proper  amendment to restore to the word  \"merger\"\r\n\r\nits true meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that amendment to me is like somebody moving a\r\n\r\nmotion  that this House believes in the institution  of\r\n\r\nmarriage,   and  somebody  else  moving  an   amendment - \r\n\r\n\"marriage  according  to law\". It is  a  clarification.\r\n\r\nThey  do not mean a common law marriage, but a marriage\r\n\r\naccording  to law. I do not see how anybody can  object\r\n\r\nto the clarification of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the S.P.A. - I trust you will absolve\r\n\r\nme of any suggestion of patronage which I do not intend\r\n\r\nto indulge in, Sir - said in the best speech I have heard\r\n\r\nhim make in this House (and I have heard him make many,\r\n\r\nSir,  which other Members have not), and I believe him,\r\n\r\nSir;  I believe he was sincere, Sir, - he said, \"We want\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger for Singapore. But we cannot have  it,\r\n\r\nand we think that this White Paper is the best possible\r\n\r\nbecause, with the P.A.P. in Government, they could  not\r\n\r\nget  anything better than we could.\" Let us  leave  the\r\n\r\ncontroversial  aspect apart. Let us just  look  at  the\r\n\r\nfirst  part  of  that sentence which he enunciated.  He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"We want complete merger for Singapore.\"  He  is\r\n\r\nspeaking for his Party. Sir. Is it not exactly what the\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  motion  says?  \"We  want   complete\r\n\r\nmerger.\"  These  are  the  words,  Sir.  \"affirms   and\r\n\r\ndeclares  that the first objective of all true patriots\r\n\r\nof  Malaya k to achieve the reunification of these  two\r\n\r\nterritories  in a genuine merger with Singapore  coming\r\n\r\nin   as   the   twelfth   State  and   with   automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\" It is a question of principle. This is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat we want. It is not what we can get. And surely  to\r\n\r\nme,  Sir, one can vote for the principle of the  merger\r\n\r\nmotion as amended and vote for the White Paper. If  you\r\n\r\nbelieve, as he has indicated that he believes, that the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the White Paper are the  best  possible\r\n\r\ntoday, that they are good for Singapore, and  they  go\r\n\r\nsome  way  towards bringing Singapore to  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nrealisation of complete merger. That is an honest view.\r\n\r\nHe is entitled to it. But I am seeking to point out, if\r\n\r\nI  might, to the Members on the Opposition Front Bench,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  completely logical to vote both  for  the\r\n\r\namendment to the motion and for the White Paper.

Sir,  which  our\r\n\r\ntraining  sometimes gives us, that phrase \"on an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis\"  was inserted in that party platform of December\r\n\r\n1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come down, Sir, to recent times, as recently as\r\n\r\nthe  day  of the Anson election, the major part  of  my\r\n\r\nvery  short speech at the Victoria Memorial Hall,  long\r\n\r\nbefore  the  two  Prime Ministers  met  to  talk  about\r\n\r\nmerger, I said - and the quotation is from the back  page\r\n\r\nof the Sunday Mail of the 16th July:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tungku, the stars are smiling on you again as they\r\n\r\ndid  four  years  ago  when you crowned  your  people's\r\n\r\nstruggle for Merdeka. This could be an historic  moment\r\n\r\nnot only for Malaya hut also for the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May you and we and the British he equal to our\r\n\r\nopportunities, rising above the immediate  petty  fears\r\n\r\nand  trivialities to create a united Happy Malaya  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  a dynamic stabilising force for world  peace\r\n\r\nand  a  shining  example  of  genuine  interracial  co-operation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, in the unhappy atmosphere of perhaps not unnatural\r\n\r\nfriction  between parted spouses with the wife throwing\r\n\r\nall  the  kitchen utensils at the running  husband,  we\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten the position of Singapore.  Nobody  has\r\n\r\nfar  put  in  a word about our worth, our  status,  our\r\n\r\nvalue.  We have been reminded by the Government itself,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  in  the  speech of His  Excellency  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the  largest port in  Asia.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nworld's fifth largest port and it is expected to handle\r\n\r\nnext year 70 million tons of shipping. We have a highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped financial and commercial organisation  and  a\r\n\r\ntremendous potential for economic expansion. Even under\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. our revenue has been expanding  fast.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, this will astonish you. For the year 1960 they\r\n\r\npresented a budget that was going to be $14 million  in\r\n\r\ndeficit. They slashed salaries. I am not talking  about\r\n\r\nsalaries,  but I want to remind you that  they  slashed\r\n\r\nthe civil servants' salaries. Then only a few days ago,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  mentioned to this House that I discovered that there\r\n\r\nwas  a  $9  million surplus instead of  a  $14  million\r\n\r\ndeficit, which  made an increase of $23  million  from\r\n\r\nwhat  was  expected. But, Sir, we had  a  supplementary\r\n\r\nsince  that  day and do you know what our  surplus  for\r\n\r\n1960  was?  $34 million. So that there was $43  million\r\n\r\nmore than they expected. That is the way our economy is\r\n\r\nexpanding in spite of the P.A.P., in spite of the  fear\r\n\r\nwhich  we all recognise and which they themselves admit\r\n\r\nwas  created amongst somewhat infantile members of  the\r\n\r\ncommercial community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1956, when I could obtain facts without\r\n\r\nobstruction,  I  was  reliably informed  that  the  per\r\n\r\ncapita  income of Singapore was four times that of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Spreading our annual income over every map,\r\n\r\nwoman  and  child  in Singapore, we were  earning  four\r\n\r\ntimes  more  than  an equal number  of  people  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Singapore is not only one of the wealthiest\r\n\r\nStates in the world, it is also one of the healthiest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a dynamic and industrious people, who are both\r\n\r\npeaceful and friendly, in spite of the attacks from the\r\n\r\nFront  Bench as to our so-called Communist leanings  to\r\n\r\nwhich I hope to come in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Singapore is vital for the Federation.\r\n\r\nThe  Federation is vital to us, and this  is  not  only\r\n\r\neconomically, but also emotionally and culturally. Sir,\r\n\r\nit has been my unhappy lot for long and lonely years to\r\n\r\nseek to awaken the people of Singapore to the fact that\r\n\r\nif  we cannot get complete merger, then we should  not,\r\n\r\nand  I disagree violently with the Barisan Sosialis  on\r\n\r\nthis, seek internal self-government. But we should seek\r\n\r\nindependence.

It says it is going to be  arranged.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister, though, when  dealing  with  this\r\n\r\nHouse perhaps he looks upon the Opposition in the light\r\n\r\nof  nitwits compared to his gigantic brain and does not\r\n\r\nreally  feel  interested in telling us the facts  which\r\n\r\nare  so  important  to  the  people,  but  when  he  is\r\n\r\ndiscussing   things   with   his   pals,   the   Press,\r\n\r\nparticularly over Radio Singapore, which has borne  for\r\n\r\nso  long  his dreary diarrhoea of words, Sir,  then  we\r\n\r\nhave some facts. And one of them, which he ennunciated,\r\n\r\nSir,  and which I learnt through the Press is that  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  arrangement with the Federation is  that  we\r\n\r\ngive  the  Federation one-fourth of our annual  income.\r\n\r\nThe  estimate  for  1961  is $350  million  and  it  is\r\n\r\ngrowing,  so we are going to give the Federation,  Sir,\r\n\r\n$90  million a year. For what? To defend us?

But, now for what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore, I believe, recognise\r\n\r\nthat if we want unity, if we want equal privileges,  we\r\n\r\nmust carry heavy responsibilities. We must recognise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   there   can   be  no  reality   of   unity,   no\r\n\r\nidentification  of the Federation and Singapore  if  we\r\n\r\npursue different policies in education and labour. I do\r\n\r\nhonestly  believe, Sir, that the P.A.P. errs  when  it\r\n\r\nsays  that the people of Singapore will not accept that\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  Malaya  should be  in  control  of  our\r\n\r\neducation  and labour policies. I believe that  if  the\r\n\r\nissue were put to the people of Singapore, \"Do you want\r\n\r\nunconditional merger complete or do you want the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper?\" we would have 90 per cent of the  people\r\n\r\nvoting for unconditional and complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his opening speech to Parliament on merger last\r\n\r\nmonth,  the  Federation Prime Minister is  reported  to\r\n\r\nhave  said  - I  do apologise, Sir, for quoting  from  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  I  have sought and found it  impossible  to\r\n\r\nobtain   the   Official  Reports  of   the   Federation\r\n\r\nParliament  Debates because they have  not  as  yet,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, been printed. I am quoting from the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of 17th October, page 8, col. 5:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...time would come when Singapore would ask for and\r\n\r\nbe  given  independence, and that time is not far  off,\r\n\r\nfor  new  talks on the Constitution are to be  held  in\r\n\r\n1963.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And a little later in that debate, the Federation Prime\r\n\r\nMinister added:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We must prevent a situation in which an independent\r\n\r\nSingapore would go one way and the Federation  another.\r\n\r\nThe  way  Singapore  would go  then  would  be  towards\r\n\r\nanother  camp  which is hostile to the Federation,  and\r\n\r\nthis would be quite unacceptable to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see, Sir, that though the Borneo territories,\r\n\r\nwhich  are much smaller in size, population and wealth,\r\n\r\nare  being  invited to come in as full  brothers  in  a\r\n\r\nMalaysia  family, Singapore is told, \"We will have  you\r\n\r\nas  a junior partner, so we can keep an eye on you,  so\r\n\r\nyou don't give us trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the reasons, Mr Speaker, Sir, for this\r\n\r\ndifferentiation  of  approach  on  the  part   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  towards  Singapore and towards  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories? I know the leader of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nin  a  remarkable effort did touch on  it,  but,  if  I\r\n\r\nmight,  Sir, give my opinions very briefly and  perhaps\r\n\r\nfrom a different point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Prime Minister gave three reasons to\r\n\r\nParliament  which were not repeated in His Excellency's\r\n\r\nspeech to us in the policy statement of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe  three reasons are to be found in the Straits Times\r\n\r\nof the 17th October, page 8, column 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The idea of Kingship, the Malay language and Islam\r\n\r\nas   the   official  religion  would  not  he   readily\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  people  the majority  of  whom  profess\r\n\r\nreligions other than Islam and to whom Malay is  not  a\r\n\r\nlingua  franca, and who moreover have never had a  King\r\n\r\nof their own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we find in the White Paper that, in fact,\r\n\r\nHis  Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong will be our King\r\n\r\nand I have not heard and do not expect to hear a single\r\n\r\nperson  complain  or murmur about it. The  White  Paper\r\n\r\nindicates  that  Islam  will  hold  the  same  honoured\r\n\r\nposition  as  in Malacca and Penang. I  am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nthere  is  not a single person in Singapore  who  would\r\n\r\ncomplain about that, and already, Sir, in Ordinance  52\r\n\r\nof  1960,  Malay has by this very Government been  made\r\n\r\nthe national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the three reasons which were not repeated\r\n\r\nhere have, in fact, disappeared. But this Government in\r\n\r\nthe  speech of His Excellency gave six reasons  why  we\r\n\r\ncannot  have complete merger. Before I refer  to  them,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  refer to paragraph 4  of  col.  11.  To\r\n\r\nunderstand it, they put the preface at the end:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The people must know that these interests [those are\r\n\r\nthe six which I am going to retail] cannot he protected\r\n\r\nin  a  complete merger as a 12th State like one of  the\r\n\r\nother  11  States of the present Federation,  for  then\r\n\r\nautomatically  all these matters will he controlled  by\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government and must follow the pattern  of\r\n\r\nwhat happened in the 11 States of the [Federation].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these matters, Sir, which cannot be\r\n\r\nprotected in a complete merger? Is that the word?  Yes,\r\n\r\n\"these  interests  cannot be protected  in  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger\". Sir, the Minister for Culture is not  here.  I\r\n\r\nhad  hoped that he, who had stressed so much the  civil\r\n\r\nservice aspect, would be here at least so that he might\r\n\r\nbe  able  to assist us. Sir, the first reason given  in\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is to be found in column 10, paragraph 1, is  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of the civil service from the applicability\r\n\r\nof the 4:1 ratio between Malays and non-Malays. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nconfess  to  a rather dreadful thing, to have  to  make\r\n\r\nallegations  that the facts as alleged in so  solemn  a\r\n\r\npolicy statement as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech\r\n\r\nin   a   short   column  arid  a  half  are  repeatedly\r\n\r\ninaccurate. They are simple matters of fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at this 4:1 ratio. It arises from\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of Articles 153 (2) of the  Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution. Ah, the Minister himself! I will be  very\r\n\r\nhappy to table Federation of Malaya Constitution (L. A.\r\n\r\nSheridan) if any Member wishes to consult it.  Article\r\n\r\n153 (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, hut\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the provisions of Article 40 and  of  this\r\n\r\nArticle,  the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall exercise  his\r\n\r\nfunctions  under this Constitution and federal  law  in\r\n\r\nsuch manner as may be necessary -'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It is to the Federal service.

Under  a  full\r\n\r\nmerger,  Sir,  I  say  to this  House  that  all  civil\r\n\r\nservants  of the State of Singapore would be  appointed\r\n\r\naccording  to the qualifications required by the  State\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  The 4:1 ratio would not  apply  to  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  of  the State of Singapore.  It  would\r\n\r\napply  only  to  Federal civil servants.  What  is  the\r\n\r\nposition,  Sir,  indicated in  the  White  Paper?  The\r\n\r\nposition  is that the existing Singapore civil  service\r\n\r\nwill  be retained as a State civil service which  would\r\n\r\napply in any event in a complete merger. However,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  want you to notice that departments which were  Pan-Malayan prior to Merdeka Day will henceforth revert  to\r\n\r\nformer   arrangements.   They   will   become   Federal\r\n\r\ndepartments  and then the Federal ratio  of  4:1  would\r\n\r\napply.  So  wherein  the distinction  between  complete\r\n\r\nmerger - I  would not use the words \"phoney  merger\";  I\r\n\r\nknow it is short and perhaps sweet to some ears - and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. proposals? There is no distinction in treatment\r\n\r\nat  all  between the conditions under which  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  would  work  in  a complete  merger  and  the\r\n\r\nconditions as applicable under the White Paper. I  say.\r\n\r\nSir,  that  it  is  not true, as alleged,  that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for the protection of the civil service  that\r\n\r\nwe  should have the arrangements proposed by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ninstead of a complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next reason given by the Government, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nChinese  parents  who  send their children  to  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  want  a  policy  of equal  treatment  for  all\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education  and  equal  opportunities   for\r\n\r\nemployment.  Sir,  the  P.A.P. seem  harassed  by  this\r\n\r\nChinese  question, because, in this context, I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow why it is necessary to say Chinese parents. I have\r\n\r\nalways  understood in this Assembly since 1956 that  it\r\n\r\nis  all parents of Singapore who would like a policy of\r\n\r\nequal treatment for all streams of education. It was an\r\n\r\nalmost unanimous decision, as far as I can remember. On\r\n\r\nthe question of equal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunities after school - I may be wrong - I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  equal opportunities to a large extent  do  exist.\r\n\r\nThere  are  some exceptions including, of  course, the\r\n\r\nmajor  exception of the Federal civil service.  But  on\r\n\r\nthe main issue of equality of treatment for all streams\r\n\r\nof  education, I agree completely with the inference in\r\n\r\nthe statement in the White Paper that there seems to be\r\n\r\na  radical difference between the policies in Singapore\r\n\r\nand those in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that I learned with some surprise and\r\n\r\ndelight  from the Member for Queenstown that his  Party\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to me, as far as I can understand, a Party that\r\n\r\nrepresents the industrial Chinese worker, I do not know\r\n\r\nabout  the  others -  were prepared to accept  Federation\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  education policy, and I  say  hear,  hear!\r\n\r\n[Interruption].

But though\r\n\r\nwe  may  not  agree  with their  education  policy,  as\r\n\r\ndemocrats  we accept the rule of the majority  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we will seek constitutionally to persuade  the\r\n\r\nFederation or those who disagree with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour view at least to come to some modus vivendi, it  is\r\n\r\nnot the point if we succeed or not. We are prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept   unconditionally   Federation   control   over\r\n\r\neducation policy. But, Sir, the P.A.P. say they are not\r\n\r\nprepared  to accept it. All right, they are a  majority\r\n\r\nof  one. They are a majority still. So I ask them,  ask\r\n\r\nwith  respect, \"If you do not agree that we should give\r\n\r\nthe  Federation control over education, then would  you\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  in  a  complete merger,  all  that  is\r\n\r\nnecessary is for a Federal Act to he passed which  will\r\n\r\nvest  in  Singapore  the  control  over  the  education\r\n\r\npolicy?\" If they can get it under the White Paper, they\r\n\r\ncan  get it, Sir, by virtue of an Act of the Federation\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is in column 10, paragraph 3 of\r\n\r\nHansard  dated  31st October. 1961. I do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nmisquote  them and am sure you will check me if  I  do.\r\n\r\nThe   third  reason  is  that  the  workers  want   the\r\n\r\nparticular labour policy and legislation that they have\r\n\r\nenjoyed  in  Singapore to continue. If  this  were  not\r\n\r\ntragic, Sir, I would laugh. But when I am uncomfortable\r\n\r\nand  when I feel the tragedy of the moment - unlike hon.\r\n\r\nMembers on the Front Bench opposite - I do not indulge in\r\n\r\nhollow  laughter. The workers did believe in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThey  did believe that the P.A.P. was pro-labour.  That\r\n\r\nwas  why they voted P.A.P. But since the elections  two\r\n\r\nand   a   half  years  ago,  where  is  the  pro-labour\r\n\r\nlegislation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T.U.C. Bill introduced by the Government, passed\r\n\r\nby  the  Government, one Reading, two Readings,  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, three Readings, passed; and then they go  to\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and they say,\r\n\r\n\"Stop,  do  not sign.\" Why? Is it unfair, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to suggest - and I do suggest - it seems apparent  on\r\n\r\nthe  face of their conduct that they had hoped by  that\r\n\r\nBill  to  rivet the workers of Singapore to the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolitical  machine and that when they saw a possibility\r\n\r\nof a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsplit with their colleagues who are now opposite,  they\r\n\r\ndecided that maybe the enslavement of the workers would\r\n\r\nnot  be  to  the P.A.P. but would be to the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties and they did not want to\r\n\r\nrisk  it? I do say that. To me, that seems the  obvious\r\n\r\nanswer.  Their  attitude has been one of the  political\r\n\r\nexploitation of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Industrial Arbitration Ordinance. But let\r\n\r\nus  face  it and I am only dealing with it en  passant.\r\n\r\nThe industrial Arbitration Court is good, but it is  no\r\n\r\nmore pro-labour than it is pro-employer. So, Sir, where\r\n\r\nis  the pro-labour policy that the workers of Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  enjoyed?  is it the conduct of the Government  in\r\n\r\nthe  recent  strikes  of non-P.A.P. unions?  But  even\r\n\r\nassuming that there is such a policy of which I am  not\r\n\r\naware - perhaps of my jaundiced blindness to  the  merits\r\n\r\nof  the  gentlemen opposite whose leader has  so  often\r\n\r\nangered - where  is the difficulty, Sir,  in  obtaining\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Federation in a complete merger the transfer\r\n\r\nof such powers to our local Government? [Interruption]\r\n\r\nNot  that  I  want it, Mr Speaker, Sir. Again  for  my\r\n\r\nParty  and  for  myself in answer to the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture,   I  say  - and  I  trust  if  he   needs   any\r\n\r\nclarification   he   will   ask   for   it - we    accept\r\n\r\nunequivocally Federation control over our labour policy\r\n\r\nwith  our constitutional right to seek to persuade  the\r\n\r\nFederation  to modify to such extent as  we  may  think\r\n\r\nproper  and  as they may be prepared to agree  to  such\r\n\r\npolicy. But we as citizens and as democrats accept  the\r\n\r\nrule  of the majority and the control of the Federation\r\n\r\nin a complete merger.

Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to correct one matter, Sir, in  explaining\r\n\r\nthe expanding economy of Singapore. I spoke of the year\r\n\r\n1960 and I should like to correct that to 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, when we adjourned, I was pointing out the\r\n\r\nsix reasons given by Government for not having complete\r\n\r\nmerger  because these interests could not be protected,\r\n\r\nand  I have given three of them. The fourth reason, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, is that the Singapore businessmen, contractors\r\n\r\nand  bus  companies do not want priorities  or  special\r\n\r\nrights  for  anybody. Sir, by the word  \"anybody\",  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intended us to understand that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nwant special rights for the Malays. First and foremost,\r\n\r\nlet  me say that I do not believe that it is true  that\r\n\r\nour people do not want to give special consideration to\r\n\r\nnursing our Malay citizens to participate fully in  our\r\n\r\neconomic  life. The Malays of Singapore,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nhave  had a very raw deal in the last 150 years.  Their\r\n\r\nway  of  life  has  been smashed,  their  culture  deep\r\n\r\nfrozen,  their  education  neglected.  They  have  been\r\n\r\nisolated,   and  we  should  recognise  that.   It   is\r\n\r\nelementary justice that special consideration should be\r\n\r\ngiven to our Malay citizens, and special measures taken\r\n\r\nto  nurse  them  to full partnership  in  our  economic\r\n\r\ncommunity. I do not believe the people of Singapore are\r\n\r\nso  selfish as to be unjust, or so mercenary as  to  be\r\n\r\nmean.  But even apart from the call of justice,  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  unhealthy for our national life  that  an\r\n\r\nimportant   segment   of  our  population   should   be\r\n\r\neconomically isolated. I say: special encouragement  to\r\n\r\nthe  Malays in the economic field is good socialism  in\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am heartened to hear, \"Hear, hear!\"\r\n\r\ninstead of hollow laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And I say that we should, even though\r\n\r\nsome  may  object,  give special encouragement  to  our\r\n\r\nMalay citizens. Such encouragement would invigorate our\r\n\r\neconomy,  and  it  would  not  materially  affect   the\r\n\r\ninterest of any other community. Sir, this is the  good\r\n\r\nfortune  sometimes of being alone - that I' can at  least\r\n\r\nseek  to follow the dictates of justice without  always\r\n\r\nbeing  suspected of grinding a communal axe. But,  Sir,\r\n\r\neven  if our people are not just, even if we are  mean,\r\n\r\neven if we are blind on larger issues, may I point  out\r\n\r\nto  the  Government  that  it  is  not  true  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the contractors, the Singapore businessmen\r\n\r\nand   the  bus  companies  cannot  be  protected  under\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger? The special position of  the  Malays.\r\n\r\nSir,  comes under Article 153, section 2 of the Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution.  It  is  a matter of  discretion  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government, and it is  a  question  of  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  this discretion which in the  context  of\r\n\r\nSingapore could be limited to minimum interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, it makes the most curious and illogical\r\n\r\nreading  in  this nightmarish debate, which  is  almost\r\n\r\nreminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, that,  on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  this  Government says, \"We do not want  complete\r\n\r\nmerger\",  and, on the other, it brings in a  motion  to\r\n\r\nurge  merger. On the one hand, it says. \"We do not want\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  because we would then  have  to  give\r\n\r\nspecial  consideration  to the Malays\".  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it  presents a White Paper in which the  special\r\n\r\nposition  of  the Malays is specifically recognised  in\r\n\r\nthe   new  Constitution,  as  it  should  be.  Do   not\r\n\r\nmisunderstand  me, Mr Speaker, I agree  with  it.  But\r\n\r\nthat  paragraph  7 of the White Paper  quite  obviously\r\n\r\nenvisages  that  a similar protection  for  the  Malays\r\n\r\nshould   prevail  in  Singapore  as  prevails  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, under the P.A.P. proposals, we have\r\n\r\nthe position that would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  identical with that under a merger. So even if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. object to special privileges for the Malays, or\r\n\r\nsay that the people of Singapore object, then I repeat,\r\n\r\nthat  is not true. Even if they do object though, there\r\n\r\nis  no  special  protection for the contractor  or  the\r\n\r\nbusiness man, and it is untrue to say, as the speech of\r\n\r\nHis   Excellency  says,  \"that  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\ncontractor, of the business man, and the bus conductor,\r\n\r\ncannot be protected in a full merger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth reason given by the Government in His\r\n\r\nExcellency's  policy speech is that  the  merchants  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  want a continuance of our free  port  status\r\n\r\nand maintenance of our trade with the whole world. Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  almost  unbelievable. I refuse to believe  that\r\n\r\nthis Government is not aware that there is such a State\r\n\r\nas  the State of Penang. I refuse to believe that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is not aware that Penang is a free  port  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  a  small  part  of the  Federation  Customs\r\n\r\nOrdinance. I refuse to believe that this Government  is\r\n\r\nnot conscious of the fact that the free port status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  could  be  fully  protected  under  complete\r\n\r\nmerger.  So  how is it that they have the  audacity  to\r\n\r\nsay, in His Excellency's speech, that the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  merchants who want a continuance of our free  port\r\n\r\nstatus and maintenance of our trade relations cannot he\r\n\r\nprotected under a complete merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, might I draw your attention to the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper under the fifth head:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the special position of Singapore in relation to\r\n\r\nentrepot trade will he safeguarded. Measures to protect\r\n\r\nthe  interest of Singapore trade overseas will  include\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of  a section  within  any  of  the\r\n\r\nFederal missions as may he necessary to deal with trade\r\n\r\nmatters  of  Singapore.  In any  trade  negotiation  or\r\n\r\narrangements undertaken or entered into by the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment with another country due consideration  will\r\n\r\nhe given to the commercial needs of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  are  administrative matters, Mr Speaker,  which\r\n\r\ncould  and normally would he provided by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Federation need Singapore  as  a  free\r\n\r\nport.  It  would  not be helpful to the  Federation  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  our  free port status. They want to  encourage\r\n\r\nour trade because we would he part of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsinews of the Federation. Here again, Sir, I say to\r\n\r\nyou, it is completely untrue to say, as has been said\r\n\r\nin the Government policy statement, that one of the reasons for not having complete merger is because the\r\n\r\ninterests of the merchants who want our free port\r\n\r\nstatus and who want our trade with the whole world\r\n\r\nprotected could not be protected. It is untrue. What is\r\n\r\nmuch more curious, Sir, is, if you look at the White\r\n\r\nPaper - you know, we were supposed only to give the\r\n\r\nFederation internal security, external defence,\r\n\r\nexternal affairs - under Finance. Mr Speaker, Sir, are\r\n\r\na vast host of items. Who has control? Yes, they know.\r\n\r\nWe have control, Sir, exclusively for Singapore in\r\n\r\ndangerous and in inflammable substances and factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the protection of our free port status and\r\n\r\nour trade with the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this topic of our merchants. I do ask this\r\n\r\nHouse to recognise that there is missing perhaps one of\r\n\r\nthe most important factors which might have induced us\r\n\r\nto accept the proposals, and that is the factor of the\r\n\r\ncommon market. Of course, it is not mentioned there,\r\n\r\nbut as a result of the reply from the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance earlier this Session to my questions, a, reply\r\n\r\nwhich was tabled and which Members have, it is clear\r\n\r\nthat the new proposals will not achieve a common\r\n\r\nmarket. I do not intend to point to Penang, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause let us be quite fair, though the Government has\r\n\r\nmade propaganda hay out of Penang for citizenship\r\n\r\npurposes, I do not intend to point to Penang, it has\r\n\r\nnot got any major industries, but we should face the\r\n\r\nfact that under items 7 (h) and 8 (b) of List I on the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper, the Federation will be able to tax any\r\n\r\ncommodities coming from Singapore, but Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot he able to tax imports from the Federation. I hope\r\n\r\nthat sinks in. Today they move against us. We have\r\n\r\nsomething. But taxation will be in their hands. At the\r\n\r\nsame time, Sir, I think it is fair to accept, At least\r\n\r\nin some measure, the implication in the statement of\r\n\r\nthe leader of the S.P.A. that the closer relationship\r\n\r\nwhich would arise out of an acceptance of these P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals would bring about a climate where a common\r\n\r\nmarket may be quicker achieved, think that is true,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the most crucial of the reasons\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  Government for not having  complete\r\n\r\nmerger,  and  one that has so deeply exercised  the\r\n\r\nleader  of the Barisan Sosialis. Sir, I can  do  no\r\n\r\nbetter.  The  Minister for Culture,  who  does  not\r\n\r\nindulge  in  the  hollow laugh  like  some  of  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  when he is uncomfortable,  nevertheless\r\n\r\ntried  to elide it on the very good principle  that\r\n\r\nattack is the best means of defence. So he counter-attacked.  He said, \"Why? Why do you keep referring\r\n\r\nto Article 22? Of course, we all know Article 22 of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution  permits the  Parliament  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation to give you citizenship. Nobody has said\r\n\r\nanything  different. Why do you harp on  it?  Why?\"\r\n\r\nThe innocent Minister!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you know that constitutionally the most\r\n\r\nsolemn  enunciation of Government policy is in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  a  speech  which the Head  of  the  State\r\n\r\nenunciates  in  the  House  in  the  name  of   the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  the day. I have no doubt  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister, however much subservient to his  master's\r\n\r\nvoice,  had a word in the dictation of this policy,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture must have at  least  read\r\n\r\nit.  If he did not read it, he must have heard  it.\r\n\r\nHe  was here when it was read by His Excellency.  I\r\n\r\nquote from column 11, paragraph 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We do not recommend complete merger because one of\r\n\r\nthe  most important consequences of complete merger\r\n\r\nis   the   application   of  the   more   stringent\r\n\r\ncitizenship laws of the Federation under which over\r\n\r\n350,000  Singapore citizens who were not born  here\r\n\r\nwill  he  disenfranchised and will have to re-apply\r\n\r\nfor registration as citizens.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  with my full sense of responsibility to  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  say  this  is - may I say  false,  Sir? - or\r\n\r\ninaccurate.  They complained that the poor  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis referred to Article 22. Because it is  not\r\n\r\ntrue. It is not true - and it is a terrible thing  to\r\n\r\nsay  of  the Government - that in a complete  merger.\r\n\r\n350,000  Singapore citizens who were not born  here\r\n\r\nwill  be  disenfranchised. And I shall show  it  to\r\n\r\nyou,   Sir,   chapter  and  verse.  The  Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution nowhere has the power to  deprive  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  a  State of the citizenship  of  that\r\n\r\nState,  nor  have the Federation ever tried  to  do\r\n\r\nthat.  Before  merger there were  subjects  of  the\r\n\r\nrulers of Johore, of Kedah, of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelangor,  of  Trengganu, all the nine  States.  We\r\n\r\nwill  come to Penang and Malacca where the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, having  no  legal  consultant,   really\r\n\r\nslipped,  and  the Government made full  propaganda\r\n\r\nplay.  But  let us for a moment look at the  truth,\r\n\r\nSir.  There were nine out of the eleven  States  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation which had subjects of the ruler.  On\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Day, those subjects of the rulers  became\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens  and  remained  subjects  of  the\r\n\r\nrulers.  Nowhere was a single subject  of  a  ruler\r\n\r\ndeprived of his citizenship. It is not true to  say\r\n\r\nthat  on complete merger there is anything  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation which would permit a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  Singapore  to  be  deprived   of   his\r\n\r\ncitizenship of Singapore.

In so far  as  I,\r\n\r\naccording to my light, my training and my work  for\r\n\r\n25  years, am concerned, I believe at least we  can\r\n\r\nhave  an  impartial expert body who can  judge  and\r\n\r\nfrom  whom the people can accept the truth. Let  me\r\n\r\nrepeat. Sir, that I believe, in accordance with  my\r\n\r\ntraining,  my work and my understanding,  that  the\r\n\r\nposition  in  a  complete  merger  would  be   that\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens   would   all   retain   their\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  and that the Federation  Constitution\r\n\r\ndoes  not  permit of any Singapore  citizen  to  be\r\n\r\ndeprived of any of his rights as a citizen  in  the\r\n\r\nState  of Singapore. But, Sir, what has the Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution   done   in   the   Federation?    The\r\n\r\nConstitution  not only made every  subject  of  the\r\n\r\nruler  retain his citizenship of the State, but  it\r\n\r\nmade  every subject of the ruler a Federal citizen.\r\n\r\nIn  a  legally admirable exposition by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law, apart from one major error, which was,  I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure, inadvertent, he drew our attention\r\n\r\nto Part XII of the citizenship of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya  provisions under the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nAgreement of 1949, as amended in 1952, Sir. And  he\r\n\r\nread,  but  did  not emphasise, that  section  125,\r\n\r\nparagraph (a) states:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On and after the prescribed date, the following\r\n\r\npersons  shall  be  citizens of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya by operation of law:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any subject of His Highness the Ruler of any\r\n\r\nState;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the citizens of Singapore are in a position\r\n\r\nanalogous  to  the  subject of a ruler.  Where  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis blundered was in drawing attention\r\n\r\nto  Penang and Malacca. Penang and Malacca, Sir, by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of the fact that they were British colonies\r\n\r\nwith  no rajahs, had no citizens of the ruler. They\r\n\r\nare  the  only two States which had no subjects  of\r\n\r\nthe  ruler, and consequently to speak of Penang and\r\n\r\nMalacca  would  be to invoke not paragraph  (a)  of\r\n\r\nsection 125 but paragraph (b) of section 125  which\r\n\r\nsays  that  all those who were born in  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  would achieve automatic citizenship  which\r\n\r\nwould make, as was quite rightly pointed out by Dr\r\n\r\nGoh Keng Swee, 284,000 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do apologise, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nThank  you. The Minister for Finance. They  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  and  perfectly properly, an  error,  but  the\r\n\r\nunfair-ness of it was that they did not  go  on  to\r\n\r\nsay  that,  in respect of the other States,  if  we\r\n\r\ncame  in  as  Johore,  or  Selangor,  Kelantan,  or\r\n\r\nTrengganu,  then, on the analogous provision.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe citizens of Singapore would all be citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation because we would have the comparable\r\n\r\nposition of being subjects of a ruler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these issues are in fact academic, and this\r\n\r\nis  hardly  a forum for the academic discussion  of\r\n\r\nconstitutional law; because in truth and  in  fact,\r\n\r\nArticle  22,  in  so  far as  new  territories  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, supersedes all other provisions. What  I\r\n\r\nwas  trying  to  show  was  if  we  came  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation  on the same basis as any  of  the  nine\r\n\r\nMalay  States, then we would have all our citizens.\r\n\r\nBut  there is Article 22, and under Article 22,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, it is the will of the Federation Parliament\r\n\r\nas  to the provisions for our admission. But  I  do\r\n\r\nwant  to  point out that it is untrue to  say  that\r\n\r\nunder a complete merger it would necessarily follow\r\n\r\nthat   350,000  of  those  citizens  not  born   in\r\n\r\nSingapore would be disenfranchised. Sir,  why  this\r\n\r\nissue  about citizenship? What is it that makes  it\r\n\r\nso  burning  a question? The leader of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis spoke of second-class citizenship,  and  I\r\n\r\ncompletely agree with the Minister for Culture that\r\n\r\n\"there  ain't no such animal\". Of course, there  is\r\n\r\nnot.  There is no question of second-class citizenship. But why this complaint?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8 (2) of the Federal Constitution says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Except as expressly authorised by this\r\n\r\nConstitution,  there  shall  be  no  discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst  citizens on the ground only  of  religion,\r\n\r\nrace,  descent or place of birth in any law  or  in\r\n\r\nthe appointment to any office or employment under a\r\n\r\npublic authority or...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is why I ask the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nto  read that second section when he read the first\r\n\r\none.  Article 8 provides against discrimination  of\r\n\r\ncitizens only in the Federation. Sir, we would  not\r\n\r\nbe Federal citizens and we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould   quite  properly  be  discriminated  against\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  not  got the  fundamental  right\r\n\r\nguaranteed by section (2) of Article 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at the next Article if you will, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  and that is Article 9. I am not  so  much\r\n\r\ninterested  in banishment, Sir, because  if  a  man\r\n\r\ngets to that stage of being a burden on the country\r\n\r\nwhere  he lives, then I am not interested. But  let\r\n\r\nus get to Article 9 (2):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to any restriction imposed by any law\r\n\r\nrelating to the security of the Federation,  public\r\n\r\norder,   public   health,  or  the  punishment   of\r\n\r\noffenders,  every  citizen has the  right  to  move\r\n\r\nfreely  throughout the Federation and to reside  in\r\n\r\nany part thereof.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not \"every person\", but \"every citizen\", and\r\n\r\ntherefore, only Federal citizens may move freely in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  and  may  reside  freely  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the next article, Article\r\n\r\n10:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'every citizen has the right to freedom of speech\r\n\r\nand expression;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all citizens have the right to assemble peaceably\r\n\r\nand without arms;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all citizens have the right to form associations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not \"every person\", but \"every citizen\", and the\r\n\r\nguaranteed  rights  are  the  rights  to   assemble\r\n\r\npeacefully, to form associations and to freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech and expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they say and they are entitled to ask, what\r\n\r\nis  the  practical  effect of this?  Is  there  any\r\n\r\nimmigration  barrier  between  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation? I think one of them already pointed out\r\n\r\nthat   a  number  of  us  live  and  work  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation. So, what is the excitement about?  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  position  is  this. We  are  not  second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens   vis-a-vis   the   Federation.   We   are\r\n\r\nforeigners. We are in the position of most favoured\r\n\r\nforeigners   and,  by  virtue  of   the   executive\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of the Government as permitted  in  its\r\n\r\nimmigration  laws, are permitted  to  go  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation  without any visas and  work  there.  We\r\n\r\nhave  the  same law applicable to them.  But  these\r\n\r\nrights  are  not  guaranteed by  the  Constitution.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing to prevent the  Federation  from\r\n\r\nraising barriers of immigration against us  now  or\r\n\r\nunder the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir.  But  we could today reciprocate whilst  under\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper, and it is curious to notice  this\r\n\r\nomission, but I believe that under the White  Paper\r\n\r\nimmigration   would  be  in  the   hands   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Sir, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nused  a  layman's phrase, picturesque  but  legally\r\n\r\ninaccurate   when   he  spoke  about   second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens. The position in law, as I see it, is that\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  citizen  is  a  foreigner  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation; there by the grace and courtesy and the\r\n\r\ngoodwill of the Federation Government, but  without\r\n\r\nany   constitutional  right.  But  the   Federation\r\n\r\ncitizen  will  have  a right  to  he  here  and  no\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  can keep  him  out,  for  no\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  will  have  the   power   to\r\n\r\nprohibit  by  immigration  laws  or  otherwise  his\r\n\r\nentry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Article 47 of the Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution  provides that only  Federal  citizens\r\n\r\ncan  sit  in  the Federal Parliament, both  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate. Sir,  will\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore have to vote for  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  represent them,  or  is  the  Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution   going  to  be  amended   to   permit\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens to represent Singapore citizens?\r\n\r\nIt is possible, Sir, and knowing the Federation,  I\r\n\r\nthink that they would naturally wish to be fair  in\r\n\r\nthis  matter. In fairness, I think, though  it  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  indicated, the arrangement will probably\r\n\r\nbe  that  the Federal Constitution would be amended\r\n\r\nin  order to permit our representatives to  sit  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, apart from that one aspect which no\r\n\r\ndoubt would be clarified, the true position is that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  citizens will have no  more  rights\r\n\r\nthan he has today to enter, to live in, to work  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation or to join any political Parties  or\r\n\r\ntrade  unions in the Federation. You see,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave,  for example, branches & the Alliance Parties\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, but no Singapore political Party has\r\n\r\nbranches  in  the  Federation. Nor  under  the  new\r\n\r\narrangement would any Singapore political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty  have  any  right  to have  branches  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Is this, Sir, the position of  Northern\r\n\r\nIreland as has been so repeatedly suggested? is it?\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the answer is \"no\".  The  people  of\r\n\r\nNorthern  Ireland have an identity  of  citizenship\r\n\r\nwith  the United Kingdom. They have every right  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  England, to work in England and to vote  in\r\n\r\nEngland; not that it is important, Sir, that  vote,\r\n\r\nbecause I do not expect masses of our people to  go\r\n\r\nover  to  the  Federation. That I  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture, that the objection  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  go  and vote in Johore or cannot  stand  in\r\n\r\nTrengganu  is in itself trivial. That  is  not  the\r\n\r\npoint.  The point is that we cannot have  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has so aptly called \"a  common\r\n\r\npolitical  life\". We cannot have that,  Sir,  under\r\n\r\nthis new arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation Prime Minister at the Airport\r\n\r\nPress  conference stated he could not recommend  to\r\n\r\nhis  Parliament to grant Federal citizenship to all\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens, because Singapore had been  lax\r\n\r\nin  admitting citizens requiring in some cases only\r\n\r\ntwo   years'   residence,  whereas  the  Federation\r\n\r\nrequired  eight.  I would like to  point  out,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that  the  provision  about  two   years'\r\n\r\nresidence  only applies to Federation citizens  and\r\n\r\nto  British subjects. The British subjects involved\r\n\r\nare  those  who were born in India. But  the  major\r\n\r\nnumber of those who obtained citizenship under  our\r\n\r\nCitizenship Ordinance are those who qualified under\r\n\r\nsection 9, Sir, eight out of the previous 12 years'\r\n\r\nresidence in Singapore. This is somewhat similar to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation provision in Article 17, which  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law read, which requires eight  years'\r\n\r\ntotal  residence.  The provision that  the  Federal\r\n\r\napplicant  should be 45 years old and  should  know\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  language, as was  pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown, was not made applicable  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation until one year after Merdeka Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I come back to the last paragraph\r\n\r\non  page  10  [Hansard]. I would  like  to  refresh\r\n\r\nMembers' memories:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The most important interest that will be protected\r\n\r\nin  a  merger based on the principle of partnership\r\n\r\nis  that  Singapore citizens, whether born here  or\r\n\r\nborn   elsewhere,  will  keep  all  their   present\r\n\r\ncitizenship   rights  and,  in  addition,   acquire\r\n\r\nnational rights as nationals of the new Federation.\r\n\r\nNobody  will  lose any rights. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nevery  citizen will gain new national status  as  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  an  independent  and  larger  political\r\n\r\nunit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have been told, and I will not repeat\r\n\r\nit,  that \"Federal national\" is a phrase which does\r\n\r\nnot  appear in any part of the Federation. This  is\r\n\r\nperfectly true. It was explained to you that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  concept of nationalism which is as distinct\r\n\r\nas  the concept of citizenship, which is also true.\r\n\r\nWhat  you have not been told, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthat a Federal national is a British subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry the Minister for Culture is so\r\n\r\nengrossed  he did not hear that. I shall repeat.  A\r\n\r\nFederal  national is a British subject. That  is  a\r\n\r\ncurious thing to say. Can I prove it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Article 29 (1) of the Federal Constitution:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In accordance with the position of the Federation\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Commonwealth, every person  who  is  a\r\n\r\ncitizen of the Federation enjoys by virtue of  that\r\n\r\ncitizenship the status of a Commonwealth citizen in\r\n\r\ncommon with the citizens of other Commonwealth countries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by virtue, Sir, of section 1 of the British\r\n\r\nNationality  Act, every citizen of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nhas  the  status of a British subject. Our  present\r\n\r\nposition,  Mr  Speaker, is  that  we  are  British\r\n\r\nsubjects. We are citizens of the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nColonies, and are also British subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what would happen, Sir, is that we would be\r\n\r\ncitizens of Malaysia and British subjects under the\r\n\r\nnew  agreement, because \"Federal national\"  is,  by\r\n\r\nits  own  Article  29  and the  equivalent  British\r\n\r\nprovisions,  just  a  phrase which  means  \"British\r\n\r\nsubject\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Well,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  it we want, Mr Speaker, for the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty,  for the people of Anson and for myself'?  I\r\n\r\nsay  that we want a full and unconditional  merger.\r\n\r\nWe  want  to  accept the same responsibilities  and\r\n\r\nenjoy the same privileges. We want to come in as  a\r\n\r\nbrother,  not  a  partner.  Partnerships   can   be\r\n\r\ndissolved  and  can be dangerous.  If  we  talk  of\r\n\r\nIreland,  let us remember the tragedy  of  Southern\r\n\r\nIreland.  We  do  not want even the possibility  of\r\n\r\nsuch a tragedy to occur in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say this quite frankly and very\r\n\r\nclearly. What I honestly and sincerely fear in  the\r\n\r\nvery  marrow of my bones is that an arrangement  of\r\n\r\nthe  character  envisaged, which gives  our  people\r\n\r\ndifferent educational upbringing, gives our workers\r\n\r\ndifferent  treatment as compared to the Federation,\r\n\r\nwould  create  different  types  of  citizens;  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of the overall Federal rule, would  create\r\n\r\nfriction which would all the time be blamed on  the\r\n\r\nFederal Government. There is a very genuine danger,\r\n\r\nSir,I  am sorry to have to put a name  to  it.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we have to face it. There is a very  genuine\r\n\r\ndanger  that  such differentiation in  policies  of\r\n\r\neducation and labour would exacerbate and emphasise\r\n\r\ncommunal differences and would bring about communal\r\n\r\nexplosion and tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that those of us who are genuine about\r\n\r\nmerger  must  accept - I repeat  must  accept - Federal\r\n\r\ncontrol over our education, labour and our internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  We should not seek to be different  from\r\n\r\nany of the other States in matters which affect the\r\n\r\nmood and the character of our citizens. We seek  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  common  citizenship.  The  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  knows only too well his own  efforts  in\r\n\r\nthat  direction. He knows only too well the aim  of\r\n\r\nany  State which must seek a common culture to have\r\n\r\na  common  loyalty. A differentiation in education,\r\n\r\nwhich  seems to be the basis of the P.A.P. policy,\r\n\r\nis  full of danger not only for us but also for the\r\n\r\nFederation.  If you ask, would we be better  if  we\r\n\r\nwere separate - and that is a fair question that  was\r\n\r\nasked, I think, by the Minister for Culture -  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint,  Mr Speaker, is this, that there would  not  be\r\n\r\nthe antagonism directed towards the Federation if there\r\n\r\nwas differentiation whilst we were separate. But whilst\r\n\r\nwe  are associated, where the blame seems to be at  the\r\n\r\nFederation  doorstep  for anything  different  that  we\r\n\r\nthink  is  not  right  because  we  think  it  is   not\r\n\r\nright - whether we think it rightly or wrongly - we  will\r\n\r\nalways be blaming the Federation. That is something  we\r\n\r\ndo not want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have experienced here in Singapore already\r\n\r\nthe tragedy of differentiation of education policy.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that as a result of the meanness of the  Imperial\r\n\r\nGovernment  which did not want to spend money  for  the\r\n\r\neducation  of  immigrants - \"Leave them in  the  gutter.\r\n\r\nTheir own people can look after them. We can only  give\r\n\r\neducation  to fodder for our commercial machine.\"  That\r\n\r\nmeanness,    Sir,   has   brought   about    today    a\r\n\r\ndifferentiation  in  outlook  between  our   respective\r\n\r\ncommunities - the Minister for Education knows that; hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  across  the Floor know that - a  differentiation\r\n\r\nwhich  is the basic tragedy of Singapore today.  Do  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  perpetuate and accentuate,  to  enlarge  this\r\n\r\ndistinction on to the Malaysia scene?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to exaggerate. I cannot\r\n\r\nexaggerate.  But I shall put it very simply.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nSir, I will be quite frank that if education and labour\r\n\r\nwere given to the Federation, the White Paper would  be\r\n\r\nmore  acceptable to me, and I do not care if  it  means\r\n\r\nthe end of my political career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Singapore is the pivot in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation Prime Minister informed U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nthat  the  Federation Malays fear that  they  would  be\r\n\r\nswamped  by our Chinese. That is true, Sir. That  is  a\r\n\r\ngenuine fear. But there does not seem to have been  any\r\n\r\nconsistent effort to explain to them that Singapore  in\r\n\r\na   complete  merger  would  have  no  more   than   25\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Representatives and two\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in a Senate of 30  of  Malaysia.  Sir,\r\n\r\nmany  figures  have  been  given  to  you  - involved\r\n\r\narithmetic in which our Prime Minister excels  - and  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that there is a major error which the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law  failed  to  observe when  he  suggested  that\r\n\r\nproportionate representation is not provided for in the\r\n\r\nConstitution. In fact, Article 116 (3) does provided as\r\n\r\nbetween  a  State  and a country,  whereas  clause  (4)\r\n\r\napplies  to the constituencies in a State. Sir,  clause\r\n\r\n(4)  is not material in this context but clause (3)  is\r\n\r\nmaterial  as between a State and a country. There  must\r\n\r\nbe  given  to that State a proportion of the  seats  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the proportion of its  voters  to  the\r\n\r\ntotal voters of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one of the Members opposite - it may\r\n\r\nwell  be  the  Minister  for Law - gave  us  the  latest\r\n\r\nFederation  figure as 2,345,000 voters. Sir, assuming - as  he said quite rightly -  that in 1964 the Federation\r\n\r\nwill  have a House of 100. So the proportion is 23,500.\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir,  Singapore has 624,000 voters.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are not so far wrong when they tell you  that,\r\n\r\nin fact, the exact number is somewhere about 27 seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

Table\r\n\r\nI  of this Report works out the Federal seats State  by\r\n\r\nState,  and  it  is worked out in this way.  The  total\r\n\r\nFederation  population  is divided  by  the  number  of\r\n\r\nconstituencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are  fixed by Article 46. Article  46  fixes\r\n\r\nthem  at  100.  The total population  is  given  as\r\n\r\n6,278,763.  Now that is divided by  the  number  of\r\n\r\nconstituencies  which are fixed in Article  46.  If\r\n\r\nyou  divide that figure by 100, then you  will  get\r\n\r\nthe population quota of 62,787. In the same way, if\r\n\r\nyou  take  the  total electorate of the  Federation\r\n\r\nwhich  is  2,310,747 and divide that also  by  100,\r\n\r\nthen  you  will get the electoral quota of  23,107.\r\n\r\nThey  do  it this way, Mr Speaker, Sir.  (A)  They\r\n\r\ndivide  the  State  population  by  the  population\r\n\r\nquota - just the overall population figure divided by\r\n\r\n100.  (B) They take the total voting power  of  the\r\n\r\nState  and  divide it by the electoral quota.  They\r\n\r\nhave  a  formula, Mr Speaker, Sir.  They  add  the\r\n\r\nallocation according to the population quota (A) to\r\n\r\ntwice  the  allocation according to  the  electoral\r\n\r\nquota (B) and divide the result by three, State  by\r\n\r\nState.  That is how they get the number of  Federal\r\n\r\nseats for each State. So that I have also worked it\r\n\r\nout  in this way. I checked in the Electoral Office\r\n\r\nthis  morning and I was told that the latest figure\r\n\r\nof  Singapore electors is 619,867. Sir, if you  add\r\n\r\nthe population of Singapore, which is 1,600,000, to\r\n\r\n6,278,763  and  if  you add 619,867  to  the  total\r\n\r\nFederation   electorate  of   2,310,747   the   new\r\n\r\npopulation  quota  will  be  78,787  and  the   new\r\n\r\nelectoral  quota will be 29,306 and  use  the  same\r\n\r\nformula,  you  will get the total of  20.87  or  21\r\n\r\nFederal    seats    for    Singapore - mathematically\r\n\r\naccurate, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Now, Sir, that makes us just  a\r\n\r\nquarter of them, and my arithmetic of a quarter  of\r\n\r\n100  is  25, but of course I do not know the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nway of arriving at figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nway.

You can blame the P.A.P. when they deserve to\r\n\r\nbe  blamed, but blame other people if they  deserve\r\n\r\nto be blamed and not us, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If going by the Constitution those\r\n\r\nfigures are correct, I will accept them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I make the figure, Sir, 25. I would like you\r\n\r\nto  understand  this. Sir. The  fact  that  we  are\r\n\r\ngetting less - I am not making any issue of that - \r\n\r\nis, to my mind, a minor point. But what I am trying\r\n\r\nto  explain is, if the Federation could explain  to\r\n\r\nthese people that there is no swamping and that, in\r\n\r\nfact, if they are worried about 25, we would rather\r\n\r\nhave  15,  I would gladly concede it. If there  was\r\n\r\nreally integration, Sir, I will gladly concede  it.\r\n\r\nThe   Barisan  Sosialis  looked  very   pained   at\r\n\r\nme - sometimes I am a hero, and sometimes I  am  not!\r\n\r\nBut, to my mind, that is the way it works. I am not\r\n\r\nunconscious,  Mr Speaker, that the Federation  has\r\n\r\ngot  its own problems in labour and education which\r\n\r\nare  a  headache, and that it fears that  with  the\r\n\r\nadditions of Singapore it would enhance and magnify\r\n\r\nthese  problems.  And I would add  that  these  are\r\n\r\nlegitimate fears. But the real fear, Sir - that could\r\n\r\nbe  controlled,  I  think, and  could  be  provided\r\n\r\nfor - was given in a short interjection by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Geylang Serai. It consisted of three words.  It\r\n\r\nwas worth a speech. The Member for Queen-town asked\r\n\r\na rhetorical question, \"Why does the Federation not\r\n\r\nwant to accept Singapore in a complete merger?\" And\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Geylang  Serai  said,  \"Too  many\r\n\r\nCommunists!\" Sir, that is the true reason.  Whether\r\n\r\nit  is  right or wrong is not the question. Let  us\r\n\r\nface it. People are afraid of putting names to ugly\r\n\r\nthings. But in this Assembly, I think we should  as\r\n\r\nfar as possible face the facts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  not indulge too much in euphemisms.

That is, if you are a Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen  by  operation  of law,  then  they  cannot\r\n\r\ndeprive you of citizenship. And I say, fair enough.\r\n\r\nThat  is reasonable. Again I am going to be awfully\r\n\r\nunpopular, but for myself, I am prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nthat the citizenship of the people of Singapore  as\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Federation should be deemed  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered Federal citizens under the provisions of\r\n\r\nArticle 17. There is a distinction, Sir. Those  who\r\n\r\nare  citizens  by  operation  of  law,  you  cannot\r\n\r\ndeprive  them  of citizenship. But  those  who  are\r\n\r\ncitizens by registration, you can deprive  them  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship. And I am prepared to accept that: that\r\n\r\nwe  should all have a citizenship that is deemed to\r\n\r\nbe a citizenship under the provisions of Article 17\r\n\r\nby  registration.  So that those  of  us  whom  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  of Malaysia  considers  to  be\r\n\r\ninimical  to the welfare of the State by virtue  of\r\n\r\nour  activities can be deprived of our  citizenship\r\n\r\nin the same way as Federal citizens today under the\r\n\r\nConstitution who are citizens by registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wonder whether those who say that Singapore has too many Communists really mean Communists or mean persons who are, shall we say,\r\n\r\nsympathetic  to Communism. Because  again,  let  us\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  basic fact of  our  life  here - many\r\n\r\npeople  believe,  that a number of  the  industrial\r\n\r\nworkers  of Singapore are sympathetic to Communism.\r\n\r\nSir,  there has been so much misunderstanding about\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese. I should like for a very brief period\r\n\r\nto give what I understand to be the true position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say it is true that by virtue of cultural\r\n\r\nheritage  the  majority of our  industrial  Chinese\r\n\r\nhave  strong emotional attachments to China. I  say\r\n\r\nit is true, in my view, that our idealistic Chinese\r\n\r\nyouth  are attracted to Marxian concepts of  social\r\n\r\njustice.  I  believe it is equally true that  these\r\n\r\nyouth are learning that social justice can only  be\r\n\r\nachieved    by   the   evolutionary   process    of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. They are learning that the\r\n\r\nCommunist procedure of dictatorship,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   brutality,   and  of  destruction   of   human\r\n\r\nliberties, may have been necessary to restore order\r\n\r\nand cohesion in a country of 600 million people who\r\n\r\nare prostrate before the carrion-crows, imperialist\r\n\r\ncommercial  exploiters. But such  a  procedure  and\r\n\r\nsuch  an  ideology is not merely inappropriate  but\r\n\r\nretrograde  and  repressive  where,  as   in   this\r\n\r\nterritory, the democratic process is a fact and the\r\n\r\nrule  of  the majority can be achieved by a patient\r\n\r\nwait of four years at the most. No one believes the\r\n\r\nChinese  to be fools. They are not. I say  to  you,\r\n\r\nthey are a practical people and so are their youth,\r\n\r\nhowever idealistic. They are not unconscious of the\r\n\r\nterrible   price   in   human   suffering,    human\r\n\r\ndegradation  and  inhuman  limitations   which   is\r\n\r\nexacted  by the Communist dictatorship.  They  will\r\n\r\nlearn.  We  all,  not only the  Chinese,  Sir,  are\r\n\r\nlearning   that  human  beings  can  only   develop\r\n\r\nhealthfully  in  conditions  of  respect  for   the\r\n\r\nindividual  within the context of the rule  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority,  with  respect  for  the  minority.   The\r\n\r\nblasphemy  of Communism is that it has  no  respect\r\n\r\nfor the individual. And our people are learning it.\r\n\r\nThey  know from stories they hear from Chinese,  of\r\n\r\nstories  they hear from Hong Kong, that the  people\r\n\r\nin  Communist China are crushed into a common mould\r\n\r\nproducing  men like ants. No one wants  this  here,\r\n\r\nSir. I  know  I  have  heard  sneers - forgive   the\r\n\r\nexpression, Sir, but they sound like it to me  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis want it. For myself, I cannot\r\n\r\nsee it. For myself, I have talked to the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown and the Member for Nee Soon,  and  they\r\n\r\nseem to me genuinely intelligent people. It is true\r\n\r\nI  cannot judge. I cannot look into their hearts. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know.  But  I find it  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that they are not conscious of  the  basic\r\n\r\nfacts  of  life and the inhumanity of the blasphemy\r\n\r\nof Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Let them say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not speaking for them.

Sir, our people want  a  just,  decent\r\n\r\ngovernment, want a fair way of life.

These big\r\n\r\nsix  were  supposedly comrades  of  ours - three  ex-Political Secretaries, the Member for Thomson, who\r\n\r\nis  not in the House at this moment, and two others\r\n\r\nwho are now in the Strangers' Gallery -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

These  forces were quite happy  operating\r\n\r\nunder  a tolerant P.A.P. Left-wing Government which\r\n\r\nensured full exercise of their democratic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrights. The Member for Queenstown took great  pains\r\n\r\nto  point out that there was nothing in \"The  Tasks\r\n\r\nAhead\",  i.e. our  1959 election programme,  which\r\n\r\nstates that immediate merger was a target under the\r\n\r\n1959/1964  programme  of the  P.A.P.  Correct.  The\r\n\r\nforces  behind the Barisan Sosialis talk of merger;\r\n\r\nthat,  of course, they support merger; that  merger\r\n\r\nis inevitable and the whole singsong. But sheer lip\r\n\r\nservice  and  nothing else. Their calculations  are\r\n\r\nnot  for a forseeable merger, but merger which  is\r\n\r\nfar,  far away like the horizon - always there,  but\r\n\r\nnever  reached. Conclusion - no merger. They are  not\r\n\r\nMalayan  patriots.  They have other  designs.  What\r\n\r\nthese so-called great anti-colonialists want is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to live under the British colonialists and\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government as we have now. The  only\r\n\r\ndifference?  No  Internal  Security  Council.  Only\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  security risks fear  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity   Council.   However,   to   make    their\r\n\r\nproposition  appear  more  in  accord  with   their\r\n\r\ncustomary anti-colonial pose, they add the  phrase,\r\n\r\n\"minimum  demands\". But I say that  these  are  not\r\n\r\nminimum  demands. They have always been  what  they\r\n\r\nstood for. The last five months and also after 7\u00bd\r\n\r\nhours of tedious twists and turns by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  he  came back to the same  theme  that\r\n\r\nunder  the  present constitution the Government  is\r\n\r\nrequired to go back to the United Kingdom  in  1963\r\n\r\nand there to reopen talks for \"minimum demands\"  if\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis type of merger as expressed in\r\n\r\nthe  amendment to the motion is rejected. Now, what\r\n\r\nis  the  exact implication of the amendment to  the\r\n\r\nmotion?  It  is  simply a case of a  swing  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis from one extreme  to  the  other,\r\n\r\nfrom  minimum demands to maximum demands, from full\r\n\r\ninternal   self-government  without  the   Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity   Council,  which  is  what  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  really  want, to asking for  unreasonable\r\n\r\nterms for merger with the Federation, which neither\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Singapore nor the Government  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation nor its peoples can accept, at  the\r\n\r\nstage  of  history,  and  therefore,  to  frustrate\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis do not want merger despite\r\n\r\npious  statements  made in  this  Assembly  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown that the Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\nnot  afraid  of merger and not afraid  of  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  being  controlled  by  a  strong  central\r\n\r\ngovernment, ad nauseam. They are empty words  which\r\n\r\nrung   hollow   to   the  ears  of   true   Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister for Health and Law,\r\n\r\nhas  already  explained  fully  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nposition  regarding citizenship, that the amendment\r\n\r\nto the motion seeking automatic Federal citizenship\r\n\r\nfor  all  Singapore  citizens  is  an  unreasonable\r\n\r\ndemand in that we shall be asking for more favoured\r\n\r\ntreatment   for   Singapore   citizens   than   the\r\n\r\nFederation Constitution is prepared to give to  its\r\n\r\nown  local-born  in  the  original  States  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  The principle of jus soli only  became\r\n\r\noperative in the Federation from 31st August, 1957.\r\n\r\nIn  negotiations, one should know in what  position\r\n\r\none  stands.  It  is  not  a  case  of  a  colonial\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya wanting  to  merge  with  an\r\n\r\nindependent   Singapore,   but   a   self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore  under  British  suzerainty  wanting   to\r\n\r\nachieve   independence  through  merger  with   the\r\n\r\nindependent Federation of Malaya. We must  come  to\r\n\r\nreasonable terms with the Federation, and  that  we\r\n\r\nhave.  We  should  discuss  and  talk  reason,  not\r\n\r\nbalderdash.  As  elected  representatives  of   the\r\n\r\npeople,  we  must be responsible and  be  political\r\n\r\nrealists and not hot air slogan shouters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Member for Cairnhill was correct in\r\n\r\ncalling for the unanimous support of the House  for\r\n\r\nthe  motion for merger standing in the name of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  and has  asked  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  to withdraw its amendment to the  motion,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not likely to succeed, he tried  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time to belittle the White Paper, Cmd. 33  of\r\n\r\n1961, as not being a merger at all. We say it is  a\r\n\r\nmerger because if we see Head 5 of the White Paper,\r\n\r\nit  says,  \"Singapore will be a  State  within  the\r\n\r\nFederation  but on special conditions  and  with  a\r\n\r\nlarger  measure  of local autonomy than  the  other\r\n\r\nStates forming the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation.\"  if  we  turn to the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech, that is, Hansard, Vol. 15, No.  1,\r\n\r\ncol.  11, the first sentence of paragraph 5,  which\r\n\r\nthe    Member   for   Anson   referred   to   quite\r\n\r\nconsiderably, it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We do not recommend complete merger...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>for  a number of reasons. So perhaps the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill - unfortunately   he   is   not   in    the\r\n\r\nHouse - should  at least clear in his  own  mind  the\r\n\r\ndifference between the words \"merger\" and \"complete\r\n\r\nmerger\"   and  the  motion  before  the  House   is\r\n\r\n\"merger\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, however, introduces the word  \"genuine\"\r\n\r\nto  merger, which again is different from  complete\r\n\r\nmerger.  The  Barisan Sosialis  type  of  so-called\r\n\r\ngenuine merger goes very much further than complete\r\n\r\nmerger. In the case of complete merger, like Penang\r\n\r\nand Malacca, there can be no autonomy for education\r\n\r\nand   labour,   which  must  go  to   the   central\r\n\r\ngovernment,  and only those born in  Singapore  may\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal  citizens by operation  of  law  if\r\n\r\nagreed  to  by the Federation. Those  not  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would have to apply to be registered  or\r\n\r\nnaturalized   as  Federal  citizens,  which   means\r\n\r\ndisenfranchising  half  of the  present  number  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens. The Barisan Sosialis type of so-called  genuine  merger means  more  than  complete\r\n\r\nmerger, because they want all Singapore  citizens,\r\n\r\nof  which one-half are estimated to be not born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, to be automatically Federal citizens  on\r\n\r\nMerger Day; and not only that but that such Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship be irrevocable. The Minister for Health\r\n\r\nand  Law has already explained the unreasonableness\r\n\r\nof  these conditions. To ordinary people, the  word\r\n\r\n\"complete\"  cannot be qualified. To ask  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  complete  merger as required by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   shows   a   lack   of   sincerity    and\r\n\r\nreasonableness. The term \"genuine merger\"  used  by\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis,  therefore,  has  as  much\r\n\r\nmeaning as counterfeit coins being passed around as\r\n\r\ngenuine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why do we recommend merger with autonomy, in\r\n\r\neducation  and other agreed subjects?  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Queenstown  first  described   our   proposed\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education as a sop  and  later  as  a\r\n\r\nsource  of  disunity and not unity of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nnation,  because  he said we shall  be  pursuing  a\r\n\r\ndifferent educational system from that existing  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, and this received a  Hear,  hear!\"\r\n\r\nfrom  a Backbencher, the Member for Anson, who also\r\n\r\nhas  left  the  House. If the Barisan Sosialis  has\r\n\r\ndescribed  the  Federation's  education  policy  as\r\n\r\nbeing  misguided  and,  on the  other  hand,  wants\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  give up its autonomy  on  education,\r\n\r\nthen  to  suggest that we should follow  what  they\r\n\r\nconsider to be a misguided policy, we have to ask - \r\n\r\nwhat, in fact, are they advocating? My colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Culture, has asked  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - and  that will also apply  to  the  United\r\n\r\nPeople's Party - to indicate categorically to  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  they do fully support the Rahman-Talib\r\n\r\nReport on Education of the Federation with all  its\r\n\r\nimplications. I shall state the position in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, does the Barisan Sosialis accept the\r\n\r\ncondition that Government aid should not be granted\r\n\r\nto  Chinese  secondary schools unless they  convert\r\n\r\nthem  to  national-type schools?  That  is,  where\r\n\r\nChinese as a language of instruction may be used or\r\n\r\ntaught up to one-third of the curriculum time,  and\r\n\r\nstudents are to be prepared for public examinations\r\n\r\nusing the official languages, Malay and English. At\r\n\r\nthis   stage, may  I,  Mr  Speaker,   with   your\r\n\r\npermission, read the English text of the speech  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation's Minister for Education, the  Hon.\r\n\r\nInche Abdul Rahman Bin Haji Talib when he moved the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading of the Education Act, 1961, in  the\r\n\r\nDewan  Ra'ayat, October, 1961. I managed to  get  a\r\n\r\ncopy which I shall later on lay before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon.

So  it  must  be  short\r\n\r\nextracts.  But,  of  course, there  is  nothing  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  Hon.

I will read the last two\r\n\r\nsentences at page 8, paragraph 30:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the interest of national unity, therefore,\r\n\r\nthe   Government   [that   means   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment]  has  decided that  education  financed\r\n\r\nfrom  public funds after the primary stage must  be\r\n\r\nmainly through one of the official languages.  This\r\n\r\nis not a new decision. It has been the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy for five years.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I shall put is: Will the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  support  the  discontinuance  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  of public examinations in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedium for secondary schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is: Is the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nprepared to accept the statement made by the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya in  his\r\n\r\naddress  at  the last Convocation of the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya held at Kuala Lumpur on 10th June, 1961,\r\n\r\npublished in the University of Malaya Gazette  Vol.\r\n\r\n2, No. 3, June 1961, page 8? I shall read the third\r\n\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to add that it is the firm view of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government that any institution  of\r\n\r\nhigher  education in this country must come  within\r\n\r\nour National Structure of Education. The Government\r\n\r\nwill not allow any such institution to grow outside\r\n\r\nthe main stream of our National Education system as\r\n\r\nit  would  obviously be an obstacle to the creation\r\n\r\nand  growth  of  a united Malayan  Nation  with  an\r\n\r\nundivided loyalty to this country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the answers from the Barisan Sosialis to\r\n\r\nthese  three questions? So far, silence,  except  a\r\n\r\ncounter  retort, \"What do you think about it?\"  It\r\n\r\nis   because  we  know  what  those  Questions  and\r\n\r\nproblems mean that we have asked for local autonomy\r\n\r\nin  education. We subscribe to the 1955  Report  of\r\n\r\nthe All Party Committee of the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  on Chinese  Education  which\r\n\r\nfirst  announced  the principle of equal  treatment\r\n\r\nfor the four language streams in Singapore. May  we\r\n\r\nask  what is the educational policy of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis?  Every meeting of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nis  nothing but a denunciation of the P.A.P. and  a\r\n\r\ncall   for  a  general  election.  The  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and indeed the Federation want  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat they stand for and how they propose to achieve\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the great credit of the Tunku and his\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  they appreciate the  position  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and have full confidence in the sincerity\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.  Government to bring about  Malayan\r\n\r\nloyalty    and   consciousness   in   its   present\r\n\r\neducational  policy. I refer, Sir,  to  Part  2 - The\r\n\r\nTasks Ahead, page 4 - \"Spring Source of our Nation\",\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  educational policy  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nissued during the last elections. I shall read just\r\n\r\none paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Since 1955 there has been a considerable change\r\n\r\nin   the   political  conditions  in  Malaya.   The\r\n\r\nFederation is now an independent country. It has  a\r\n\r\nconstitution  which recognises Malay  as  the  only\r\n\r\nnational   and  official  language,   and   for   a\r\n\r\ntransition  period,  English is  to  be  the  other\r\n\r\nofficial language. If the ultimate independence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, to which we aspire, is intimately linked\r\n\r\nwith  a  merger  with  the Federation  then  it  is\r\n\r\nobvious   our  education  policy  must  also   take\r\n\r\ncognisance  of  the fact that we must  also  accept\r\n\r\nMalay  as the national language. The case for Malay\r\n\r\nas the national language has already been presented\r\n\r\nin  detail  in  the P.A.P. souvenir publication  in\r\n\r\nNovember 1958 and again recently in our party organ\r\n\r\n\"Petir\".   Acceptance  of  Malay  as  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage  does not contradict, but on the  contrary\r\n\r\nsupplements  the recommendations of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee on Chinese education. [It should  be  the\r\n\r\nReport of All-Party Committee on Chinese Education.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a  misprint.]  The  study  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  will not only act as a bridge  that  will\r\n\r\nspan  simultaneously our four streams of  education\r\n\r\nbut  it  will also help us to cross the Straits  of\r\n\r\nJohore into the Federation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. therefore had the political foresight\r\n\r\nto  put forward acceptance of Malay as the national\r\n\r\nlanguage    before   our   predominantly    Chinese\r\n\r\nelectorate in the 1959 elections and won by an over-whelming vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only six per cent of the present school\r\n\r\npopulation in Singapore using Malay as the language\r\n\r\nmedium of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstruction, the task of making Malay the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage  de facto is a herculean task which  needs\r\n\r\nboth  time and effort to accomplish. Our record  of\r\n\r\nwork  in  this regard for the past 24  years  bears\r\n\r\ntestimony  to  our  earnestness in  achieving  this\r\n\r\nobjective  at  the  earliest possible  date.  Pious\r\n\r\nprotestations of loyalty are not sufficient. We are\r\n\r\njudged by deeds and actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to avoid all possibility of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  and  unhappiness   over   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore that we insisted  on  local\r\n\r\nautonomy for education in our merger proposals. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown, in criticising our proposed\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education, referred to the  wholesale\r\n\r\ninflux  of  Chinese from the Federation  coming  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  join our schools in  order  to  take\r\n\r\nexaminations  in the Chinese medium, but  expressed\r\n\r\nregret   that  these  certificates  would  not   be\r\n\r\nrecognised outside of Singapore. The moral to  this\r\n\r\nis  clear.  Those  in Singapore who  are  currently\r\n\r\nagitating   against   the   Government   with   the\r\n\r\nmischievous  allegation that \"Chinese education  is\r\n\r\nbeing  eliminated\" when Singapore is the only place\r\n\r\nin  the  whole of South-East Asia to give it  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment, should ponder why many Chinese from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  have  come  and  are  still  coming  to\r\n\r\nSingapore to join our schools, if Chinese education\r\n\r\nis  really  being eliminated, would people  migrate\r\n\r\nhere?  Only  those  who feed on lies,  distortion,\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation and who go out of  their  way  to\r\n\r\nbring about misery and unhappiness pursue this line\r\n\r\nof action, and they are evil men indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown asked whether there\r\n\r\nwould  be a ban on the entry of Federation students\r\n\r\nto  Singapore. This does not arise. We admit to our\r\n\r\nschools   children   of  permanent   residents   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. As for our examination certificates,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  force  others to recognise the certificates\r\n\r\nwe  issue.  But  so  long as we  maintain  adequate\r\n\r\nstandards   in   the   conduct   of   our    public\r\n\r\nexaminations, it is, I consider, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nreasonable  to  assume  that  friendly  governments\r\n\r\nwould  accept the worth of certificates  which  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government is prepared to recognise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is why we pay so much attention to the maintenance\r\n\r\nof  academic standards in our educational institutions,\r\n\r\nand  we  allot one-quarter of our Budget for education,\r\n\r\nbecause Singapore has no natural resources and our only\r\n\r\nassets  are human resources to be educated and  trained\r\n\r\nto the highest pitch possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, before he ended his\r\n\r\nmarathon  speech - for  length  of  speech  and  not  for\r\n\r\nquality of contents - proudly announced the rise of a new\r\n\r\nstar  in the political firmament. Mr Speaker, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthe  late thirties, the world was enthralled with Edgar\r\n\r\nSnow's  account of \"Red Star over China\".  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown has visions of seeing  his  Red\r\n\r\nStar  over  Malaya. I say the Red Star of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is an evil star and bodes ill for  those  who\r\n\r\nfollow its reckless course. On the same note, I say the\r\n\r\namendment proposed by the Member for Queenstown  should\r\n\r\nbe rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  support our Party's amendment to this motion.  This\r\n\r\namendment  is  as  important  as  the  action  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken - to  quit from the Government side.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  country would have no peace if one  side  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  exploit the other side trying to take  away\r\n\r\nthe interests of the people, such as the case of merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and the Federation proposed  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Singapore citizens cannot automatically  become\r\n\r\ncitizens   of   the  Federation.  Mr   Speaker,   Sir,\r\n\r\nexploitation  is  made by man, made by  the  privileged\r\n\r\nclass  against the under-privileged class and the  non-privileged  class. That is why the world has  no  peace\r\n\r\nfor the last few thousand years. These no-peace periods\r\n\r\nin our world are still existing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, citizenship is the fundamental\r\n\r\nright  of the people. Without citizenship, there is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity   to  talk  of  other  rights,  powers   and\r\n\r\ninterests. Merger can only take place if the interests,\r\n\r\nrights and powers of the people are safeguarded. It can\r\n\r\nonly take place\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  people's consent. There will be  no  consent\r\n\r\nwhatsoever if their basic rights are not protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our demands are clear - we want all Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nto become automatically citizens of the Federation once\r\n\r\nmerger  has  taken  place. We also  want  proportionate\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in the Central Government  between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories. These are our minimum demands. If the\r\n\r\npeople  are to be united, we cannot have two  types  of\r\n\r\ncitizens in one country. If such a thing happens, there\r\n\r\nis  sure  to be a conflict between the two territories.\r\n\r\nInstances  can  be cited. Sir. Racial conflicts  always\r\n\r\nhappen in the U.S.A. and South Africa and in some other\r\n\r\nterritories. These instances should have taught  us  to\r\n\r\nchange our minds and bring splits to unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today in every corner of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  can  hear people talking about merger, and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time and at the same place they are scolding  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. It is very interesting, Sir, to  sit\r\n\r\nin the coffeeshops and at hawker stalls on the roadside\r\n\r\nand hear the people gossip about merger. Although it is\r\n\r\ngossip, they mean it. They talk so frankly that we know\r\n\r\nthey  care very much for this merger issue. Why,  Sir?\r\n\r\nBecause  they care for their livelihood. They care  for\r\n\r\ntheir  future generation. They care for the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe  majority of the people in Singapore. They care for\r\n\r\nthe  destiny  of our country, unlike the  P.A.P. which\r\n\r\njust cares for her own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of merger, the people are worrying\r\n\r\nabout the interests of our country. But the P.A.P. only\r\n\r\ncares  for  the  interests of the  Party.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the P.A.P. are above the people,  because\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. comes from the people. Those who  dare  not\r\n\r\nfight  for  the interests of the people on this  merger\r\n\r\nissue  are  fools. If they are not fools they  are  co-wards. They always bow to something for nothing. But  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to tell them that the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill not bow to a ruling clique for nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not forcing the Tunku to accept our demands.\r\n\r\nWe only put down all reasonable facts and arguments for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku and the P.A.P.

Our   demands  can  be  achieved   through\r\n\r\nnegotiations  between  the representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   of   both  territories,  not  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, Sir. After putting our reasonable facts\r\n\r\nand  arguments  before them, the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nstill  continues to ignore the wishes of the people\r\n\r\nand  carries a one-Party conference with the Tunku.\r\n\r\nThen  the P.A.P. must shoulder all consequences  if\r\n\r\nanything happens and not be like Chew Swee Kee  who\r\n\r\nonce  called  himself a man of honour.  After  many\r\n\r\ntalks on merger between the Prime Ministers of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Singapore and in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  of  Malaya,  the  term  \"merger\"  becomes\r\n\r\nclearer. And now the people know what merger means.\r\n\r\nThe  Federation Government has said that she  would\r\n\r\ntake  Singapore in as a partner with  no  power  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  foreign affairs, defence  and  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  Singapore will become, Sir, \"independent\r\n\r\nthrough partnership -\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of of order, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  statement made by the Member for Changi is not\r\n\r\nfactually  correct, i.e., that Singapore  will  not\r\n\r\nhave  any say in foreign affairs, and so on and  so\r\n\r\nforth, when we are represented in the Parliament in\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, that is not a point of\r\n\r\norder.

Is  that  called\r\n\r\n\"independence\"   when  our   powers,   rights   and\r\n\r\ninterests   are   taken  away?   Is   that   called\r\n\r\n\"independence\" when our destiny is  handed  from  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  regime to the P.A.P. ruling clique,  then\r\n\r\nto  a  Right-wing Government in the Federation?  Is\r\n\r\nthat called \"independence\" when our citizenship  is\r\n\r\ndeprived? The people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  not a football that can  be  kicked\r\n\r\nabout.  The P.A.P. has no right to talk  of  merger\r\n\r\nwith  Malaya because the P.A.P. is not  trusted  by\r\n\r\nthe  people  any more. We want a true and  complete\r\n\r\nmerger between Singapore and Malaya that will bring\r\n\r\nall  citizens of Singapore and Malaya to become one\r\n\r\nsingle  Malayan  citizen. These new  citizens  must\r\n\r\nenjoy equal rights. The P.A.P. leaders say that  if\r\n\r\na  true and complete merger proposed by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is accepted by the Federation Government,\r\n\r\nthen  more than half of the Singapore citizens  who\r\n\r\nwere not born in Singapore will be deprived of  it,\r\n\r\nand they must re-apply for new citizenship. Such an\r\n\r\nargument  is very childish because Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\ncountry  and  so is Malaya. They are  two  separate\r\n\r\ncountries,  Sir, -and two separate governments,  if\r\n\r\nthese  two  countries are merged to form  a  bigger\r\n\r\ncountry,  therefore, both sides must have the  same\r\n\r\nrights.  How  can they say that Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nmust  reapply for new Malayan citizenship? If  such\r\n\r\nis  the case, we can also say that Malayan citizens\r\n\r\nmust  also re-apply for new citizenship.  Sir,  for\r\n\r\nboth  sides  to re-apply - [Laughter]  They  laugh,\r\n\r\nSir,  a  cunning laugh. It is nonsensical. But  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  re-apply for new  citizenship  means\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  citizenship  is  inferior  to  the\r\n\r\nother. It means that Singapore must surrender. Sir,\r\n\r\nit is something like a big fish trying to swallow a\r\n\r\nsmall fish. Merger between Singapore and Malaya  is\r\n\r\nnot for the good of Singapore and Malaya alone.  It\r\n\r\nis  for the good of both. They depend on each other\r\n\r\nfor  survival.  But the leaders of the  P.A.P. say\r\n\r\nthat   the  Malayan  Government  will  not   accept\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens,  who  were  born  in   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries.  Why? Are they not citizens, or  second-class  citizens? If not, the Party  in  power  must\r\n\r\npersuade  the  Malayan Government to accept,  since\r\n\r\nthe  Party  in power does not want to  consult  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties about merger. If the  Party  is\r\n\r\nunable  to  fight for the interests of the  people,\r\n\r\nthen  she must resign and return the power  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  How silly the PAP, leaders are by  telling\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Singapore  that  if   they   want\r\n\r\ncitizenship of the Federation they must ask the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party,  the  Socialist  Front  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  to fight for them.

Government stated\r\n\r\nin its policy speech that the Prime Minister of the\r\n\r\nFederation received overwhelming support  from  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  It shows, Sir, that the Tunku had consulted\r\n\r\nat least the Opposition Parties in the House in the\r\n\r\nFederation. But did the P.A.P. Government do  that?\r\n\r\nWhere  is  the  overwhelming  support'?  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   of   Singapore   only   consulted    his\r\n\r\nMinisters - only his Ministers, Mr Speaker. But  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries of the  P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  were still in the dark, and  they  are\r\n\r\nstill in the dark. Sir, for their own interests and\r\n\r\nalso for the people's, the P.A.P. must resign.  And\r\n\r\nif  she  does  not want to do so, the  P.A.P. must\r\n\r\nfight for the demands of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> He.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> There are many types of\r\n\r\nlaughing. Sir. The cunning laugh; the smile is also\r\n\r\na laugh; but their laugh is a cunning laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, Sir, citizenship is the\r\n\r\nfundamental  right  of  the  people.  Without  this\r\n\r\nfundamental   right,   the  people   will   suffer,\r\n\r\nspiritually and materially. Without it,  they  have\r\n\r\nno  future.  Likewise  the children  cannot  go  to\r\n\r\nschool. They cannot apply for Government jobs. They\r\n\r\nalso  cannot  enjoy benefits which  a  citizen  can\r\n\r\nenjoy.   They  also  cannot  take  part   in   many\r\n\r\nactivities.  If  the people lose their  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights,  that is not only a loss to the people  but\r\n\r\nalso  a loss to the State of Singapore. I give  you\r\n\r\none  simple  example,  Sir. Anon-citizen  not  only\r\n\r\ncannot get a job m Government, but also it is  very\r\n\r\nhard for him to find a job in any private firm.  It\r\n\r\nmeans unemployment for him. And these non-citizens,\r\n\r\nin  order  to  struggle for survival, are  sure  to\r\n\r\ncommit illegal acts to get a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese illegal acts are detrimental not only to  the\r\n\r\npeople  but  also to the State. To lose citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  means  to lose everything. If merger  takes\r\n\r\nplace,  the  rights and interest of the people  are\r\n\r\ntaken  away.  I  think  the  people  will  not   be\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  Evil  men lie behind  and  within  this\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction.  This is the  cause  which  brings\r\n\r\nchaos to the people and to the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, who is also a famous lawyer, has explained to us the definitions of \"citizenship\", \"citizens\" and \"nationals\". He said\r\n\r\nsomething like that. These were not the exact words\r\n\r\nhe said - that he could not see the word \"citizen\"\r\n\r\nin  any  Commonwealth constitutional law. He  could\r\n\r\nonly see the word \"national\" in such a law. He also\r\n\r\nsaid that a national of a new Federation would have\r\n\r\nequal rights and responsibilities. But Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  you turn to the memorandum on  merger  on\r\n\r\npage 4, it states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All Singapore citizens will continue to enjoy\r\n\r\ntheir  State right and privileges within Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  citizens  of  Singapore  will  vote  only   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  all these rights we have already enjoyed  and\r\n\r\nare still enjoying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this memorandum we can see that the citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore not only cannot enjoy voting  rights,\r\n\r\nprivileges and other benefits but also cannot enjoy\r\n\r\nmany  benefits  and privileges  which  we  are  now\r\n\r\nenjoying  in Singapore. Equal rights and privileges\r\n\r\nshould  be  defined  in this  way,  Sir  - that  all\r\n\r\nnationals  of  a  new larger Federation,  that  is,\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya, should enjoy all benefits and\r\n\r\nprivileges within the larger Federation. We do  not\r\n\r\nwant  false equal rights and privileges as  defined\r\n\r\nin  page  4  of this memorandum. If we  examine  it\r\n\r\ncarefully,   Sir,   the  so-called   nationals   in\r\n\r\nSingapore would bear the same responsibilities  and\r\n\r\nserve the country within the larger Federation  but\r\n\r\ncannot   enjoy  the  benefits  within  the   larger\r\n\r\nFederation,  but  only enjoy the  limited  benefits\r\n\r\nwithin Singapore. This means that the nationals  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have the duty to serve the  country  but\r\n\r\nhave not the right to enjoy the benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a famous lawyer like our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  yet I am able to  define  the  term\r\n\r\n\"equal  rights and privileges\". Our Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nmay  have  defined wrongly. If not wrongly,  he  is\r\n\r\ntrying to deceive and trying to fool the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  believing that his  definition  is\r\n\r\ncorrect  and  that their rights and privileges  are\r\n\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore want a complete and\r\n\r\nfull  merger between Singapore and Malaya, and  all\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   Malayan   citizens   to    become\r\n\r\nautomatically citizens of a larger, new Federation.\r\n\r\nAll  citizens  of  a larger, new Federation  should\r\n\r\nhave   equal   rights   and  responsibilities   and\r\n\r\nproportionate   representation   in   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment of the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the merger issue becomes\r\n\r\nan  important item in this debate. It is because of\r\n\r\nthis  merger issue that the reactionary  forces  in\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. have become so desperate and so mad. For\r\n\r\ntwo   and  a  half  years  the  PAP, leaders  have\r\n\r\npretended to be sincere democrate and patriots  and\r\n\r\nto  be  different from the S.P.A. Now the truth  is\r\n\r\nout,  and  so  their  political career  has  become\r\n\r\nbankrupt.   In   order  to  save  their   political\r\n\r\nbankruptcy,  they suggest a phoney  merger  in  the\r\n\r\nhope  of  rising on their political platform.  They\r\n\r\ntry  to  drive a wedge between the masses  and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis by telling the  people  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is trying to bring chaos  to  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore. Because the P.A.P. does  not\r\n\r\nbelieve   in  the  strength  of  the  people,   now\r\n\r\ntherefore the people cannot trust the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people voted the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\noffice not because they supported the Party's  plan\r\n\r\nfor  merger alone. I said \"alone\". The people voted\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to office because it has so  many  true\r\n\r\nsocialists  inside  the  Party  and  because   they\r\n\r\ntrusted  these socialists. With this in  view,  the\r\n\r\npeople  thought that the P.A.P. would  bring  unity\r\n\r\namong  all  races,  would raise their  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving,  and would provide more employment for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  That it would give more freedom of speech,\r\n\r\nassembly and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation  to  the  people;  would  give   equal\r\n\r\ntreatment to the four streams of education  and  so\r\n\r\non.  The  P.A.P., therefore, was voted to form  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tunku had on many occasions rejected the\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals. I remember the Tunku  once  said\r\n\r\nthat   unless   the  Leftists  in  Singapore   were\r\n\r\ncompletely  cleaned up, there was no  necessity  to\r\n\r\ntalk  of  merger.  But now the Leftists  are  still\r\n\r\nhere, Sir, and the Tunku wants merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd.

Even the Minister for Education has done that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Member for Changi\r\n\r\ndoes  not  quite  appreciate  the  difference.  The\r\n\r\ndifference is as shown in the Standing Order  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Member shall not read his speech.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, if the Member's eyes are glued to the\r\n\r\npaper  he is reading. But if he is merely referring\r\n\r\nto  his  notes,  he  is  obviously  addressing  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I bow to your ruling, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  But  as  I have said, the  Leftists  are\r\n\r\nstill  here in Singapore and the Tunku  wants  the\r\n\r\nmerger  proposed by the P.A.P. What does it  mean?\r\n\r\nIs  it  because the Malayan Government has  enough\r\n\r\nstrength   to  combat  the  Left-wing  forces   in\r\n\r\nSingapore? Is it because the Left-wing forces  are\r\n\r\nnow armed with weapons to put the P.A.P. down?  Is\r\n\r\nit  because  the P.A.P. Government  is  unable  to\r\n\r\ndefeat the Leftists? The P.A.P. leaders said that\r\n\r\nthe  Leftists were afraid of the strength  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  of  Malaya.  Therefore,  they\r\n\r\nwanted to be ruled by the colonialists. They  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  once Singapore was under  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Leftists could not say  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  fighting for the good of the people, because\r\n\r\nthey  were fighting the Malayan Government elected\r\n\r\nby  the  people, and if Singapore  was  under  the\r\n\r\nhands of the colonialists, then the Leftists could\r\n\r\nclaim  to  be anti-colonial heroes. This  is  what\r\n\r\nthey  said. And that was why we liked the British.\r\n\r\nSir,  this is what the P.A.P. said. This  is  very\r\n\r\nchildish. The colonialists are more powerful  than\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Government,  and  the  people  fight\r\n\r\nagainst them not because they are colonialists  or\r\n\r\nforeigners  but  because  these  colonialists  are\r\n\r\ntrying to exploit the people of Singapore. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  the people are fighting against them.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  because they are foreigners or that they  are\r\n\r\nBritish.  Sir,  history has  taught  us  that  the\r\n\r\npeople will fight against those who try to exploit\r\n\r\nthem.  That  is why the people are now  trying  to\r\n\r\nfight against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Sir, when the British go away from our\r\n\r\ncountry,  our  people may say,  \"Bye-bye\"  to  the\r\n\r\nBritish. But if the P.A.P. go away, there will  be\r\n\r\nno  people  waving hands and saying, \"Bye-bye\"  to\r\n\r\nthe  Party.  What  a pitiful situation  they  will\r\n\r\nface!  Therefore, for the good of the  P.A.P.,  we\r\n\r\nurge  them to resign and go home for a rest.  They\r\n\r\nmust resign for a rest and clear their minds,  and\r\n\r\nthey  must think about the mistakes they have made\r\n\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Yes. The Chairman of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis has moved an amendment to this effect. We\r\n\r\nare  now discussing the amendment proposed by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown.
