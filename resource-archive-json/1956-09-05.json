J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) plans for the Kallang Hospital are\r\n\r\npractically completed but the finalisation  of  the\r\n\r\ndetailed plans, which are under study by the P.W.D.\r\n\r\narchitects  in  consultation with the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth, is dependent upon the site. The site at the\r\n\r\nold    Kallang   Airport   ground   presents    two\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  First, it has been ascertained  that\r\n\r\nthe hospital will be in the \"flight funnel\" for the\r\n\r\ntake-off  and  landing of all civil  aircraft.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  whether the noise created by the aircraft\r\n\r\nwill  be  detrimental to the health of the patients\r\n\r\nhas  been  put before the Medical Advisory Council.\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty is the extra expense in piling,\r\n\r\nfor it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  found that the foundations of  a  multi-storeyed  building will be comparatively  costlier.\r\n\r\nAn    alternative   site   at   Bedok   is    under\r\n\r\nconsideration. The delay in the final  decision  on\r\n\r\nthe site is in no way hampering the planning of the\r\n\r\nbuilding.  It is expected that it will be  possible\r\n\r\nto  start construction of this hospital sometime in\r\n\r\n1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Government has decided to allot the old\r\n\r\nTerminal  Building  to the Singapore  Youth  Sports\r\n\r\nCentre. A detailed study of the requirements  of  a\r\n\r\ncottage  hospital  reveals that  expenditure  on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  project  cannot  be  justified  by  the\r\n\r\nresulting  benefit to the public. It is  considered\r\n\r\nbetter  to  press  forward with  the  plans  for  a\r\n\r\npermanent  district hospital. Government,  however,\r\n\r\nhas been given the Malayan Airways canteen which is\r\n\r\nplanned to be converted into an out-patient  clinic\r\n\r\nand  dispensary. This will be able to cater for 600\r\n\r\npatients  a  day  and  work on that  will  commence\r\n\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  for  his information.

There  has been talk  that  some  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  are waiting for this day to come  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can unleash the fury of their attack. This  is\r\n\r\nindeed,   Sir,  a  very  healthy  sign,   for   our\r\n\r\nparliamentary form of government demands  a  virile\r\n\r\nand constructive Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first business sitting of the\r\n\r\nAssembly since I took office as Chief Minister last\r\n\r\nJune,   and  I  am  therefore  taking  this   first\r\n\r\nopportunity of making a lengthy statement on why  I\r\n\r\naccepted office and what are the Government's plans\r\n\r\nfor Merdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accepted office, Sir, because I believed that I\r\n\r\nhad  the  confidence  of the  public,  and  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  no  indication that this  confidence  has\r\n\r\nwaned.  I believed that there was a job to be  done\r\n\r\nin  the interests of the people and that it was  my\r\n\r\nduty,  as  a Malayan, not to shirk it. I  sincerely\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  it was the desire of  the  people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in this Assembly to  have  another\r\n\r\ncrack at the Colonial Office. I sincerely believed,\r\n\r\nand  still sincerely believe, Sir, that when I lead\r\n\r\nthe   next  delegation  to  London  to  resume  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks, I would have the full support\r\n\r\nand  co-operation of all Parties in this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThese were my beliefs which led me to accept office\r\n\r\nas  Chief  Minister, an office to which,  in  God's\r\n\r\ntruth,  I did not aspire. These beliefs have  given\r\n\r\nme  sustenance in the carrying out  of  a  job,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  two  jobs  which are  onerous  and,  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time, full of difficulties. If my  beliefs\r\n\r\nare unfounded, then I shall have no strength and no\r\n\r\nconfidence left in me to continue working  for  the\r\n\r\ntask that is immediately ahead of us - the attainment\r\n\r\nof   complete  internal  self-government - and  I  am\r\n\r\ntherefore,  Sir, asking this House  to  confirm  or\r\n\r\nshatter those parts of my beliefs as have a  direct\r\n\r\nbearing on them. This motion, Sir, is therefore  to\r\n\r\nbe treated as a vote of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I formed my Government with the same\r\n\r\ncolleagues   who  held  office  in   the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment, without any change in their  portfolio,\r\n\r\nalthough this meant that I have to tackle two jobs - that  of Chief Minister and of Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand  Welfare. I did this, Sir, in order to have the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  continuity of  personnel  to  ensure\r\n\r\ncontinuity  of  policy.  I  did  not  seek  further\r\n\r\ncoalition to strengthen the Government and  sustain\r\n\r\nus in office. The Labour Front Coalition Government\r\n\r\ndo  not  propose to hold office up to 1959, the  natural  life  of  this Assembly  under  the  present\r\n\r\nconstitution.  The  Government  propose  to  reopen\r\n\r\ntalks  with the Colonial Office by April next  year\r\n\r\nfor complete internal self-government. If the talks\r\n\r\nare  successful, a new constitution will come  into\r\n\r\nbeing;  and if we fail, the purpose of my accepting\r\n\r\noffice will have come to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been silent, and deliberately so, on our\r\n\r\nplans for Merdeka because I feel a new strategy  is\r\n\r\ncalled  for  as a result of experience gained  over\r\n\r\nthe  failure of the last talks. This time  we  must\r\n\r\nplan, and plan well, so that we can negotiate  from\r\n\r\na  position  of  strength. In this  planning  there\r\n\r\nwill,  of course, be consultations with Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  with a view to united  effort  and\r\n\r\nunited  action. Let us not play party  politics  in\r\n\r\nthis  great  task. Let us, however, show  that,  as\r\n\r\ntrue  Malayans,  we are united  in  the  fight  for\r\n\r\nMerdeka, because in unity we beget strength and  in\r\n\r\nunity  we  brook  no failure. This is  another  big\r\n\r\nreason,  Sir, which impels me to ask this House  to\r\n\r\ntreat my motion as a vote of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited London last July to attend the\r\n\r\nLabour Administration Conference in Oxford, I  took\r\n\r\nthe   opportunity  offered  me  to  have   informal\r\n\r\ndiscussions with the Secretary of State, and  I  am\r\n\r\nstrongly convinced that if the Government have  the\r\n\r\nfullest support and co-operation of the Opposition,\r\n\r\nthere  can  be no failure when the next  delegation\r\n\r\ngoes to London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have set, Sir, April 1957 as the latest date\r\n\r\nfor  the  reopening of the talks with the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice,  but this date can be advanced  by  two  or\r\n\r\nthree months if our plans are ready by then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am most conscious of the fact that the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and   the   Opposition   are   equally\r\n\r\nrepresented in this House. We are back again to the\r\n\r\n16-a-side. During the previous session of this House\r\n\r\none  hon.  Member was wont to point out at  various\r\n\r\ntimes  that  the  Government Benches  had  only  12\r\n\r\nelected Members against 13 in the Opposition. I was\r\n\r\nquite  aware of the reasons which prompted  him  to\r\n\r\nlaunch this criticism. Today this side of the House\r\n\r\nhas only 11 elected Members, whereas the opposition\r\n\r\nranks  have  increased by one. Be that as  it  may,\r\n\r\nSir, I am not in the least dismayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at present working under the Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution,  a  constitution which  we  have  all\r\n\r\nexpressed a desire to throw out, and I have already\r\n\r\ndescribed  how  best we can achieve  this.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  stated, Sir, that I did not  seek  further\r\n\r\ncoalition to sustain us in office, because the work\r\n\r\nthat  we  set  out to do during our short  term  of\r\n\r\noffice  has, I believe, the support of all  Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House. I know the feeling  of  this  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  towards me and this is not a  challenge  to\r\n\r\nhim at all. It is just a statement of facts and  it\r\n\r\nis  because  I  am most conscious of  these  facts,\r\n\r\napart  from  the  two other reasons  which  I  have\r\n\r\nalready mentioned, that I find it imperative that I\r\n\r\nshould ask this House to treat my motion as a  vote\r\n\r\nof confidence. My colleagues and I are prepared and\r\n\r\nat all times willing to roll up our sleeves and put\r\n\r\nour  heart and soul into the service of the  people\r\n\r\nof  this fair land of ours, if we can feel that the\r\n\r\ngoal of Merdeka has the support and co-operation of\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members, because,  as  I  have  already\r\n\r\nexplained, Sir, it is only with this support and co-operation that Merdeka can be attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite the attention of hon. Members to\r\n\r\nparagraph 62 of the Governor's Address which  deals\r\n\r\nwith  the  relationship  with  the  Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince  I  became Chief Minister, I have  maintained\r\n\r\nclose  and  friendly contacts with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  in order to bring about  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  appreciation  of   our   common\r\n\r\nproblems,  aims and aspirations. I am happy  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to  say that our relationship has  been  most\r\n\r\nfriendly  and fruitful and both of us are  striving\r\n\r\nto keep it so. What I have been trying to build up,\r\n\r\nSir,  has received a setback by the attack  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. on the Federation Government. The  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party, like the Labour Front, stands  for  a\r\n\r\nunited  Malaya, but their method of bringing  about\r\n\r\nthis unity is one which we all deplore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will speak briefly, indeed very\r\n\r\nbriefly, on the plans that the Government  have  to\r\n\r\nbring about a better and a happier Singapore. These\r\n\r\nhave  been  described  in  greater  detail  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Address. I know some hon.  Members  are\r\n\r\nvery  anxious  to  hurl  their  criticisms  and   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  do not propose to prolong the  agony  of\r\n\r\ntheir anxiety. The Government welcome criticisms as\r\n\r\nlong as they are constructive, because we thrive on\r\n\r\ncriticism. I have not elaborated, Sir, on our plans\r\n\r\nat  this stage because we want to hear the views of\r\n\r\nOpposition Members before we get down to  the  task\r\n\r\nof  putting  the Government's policy  into  action.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  I  rise  to  second  the   motion,\r\n\r\nreserving my right to speak at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  most  welcome to note that  the  Government\r\n\r\nrecognises that for national prosperity there  must\r\n\r\nbe cooperation between employers and employees. The\r\n\r\nconstant  preaching  of  this  philosophy  by   the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists during the  past  year  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  in vain, and we hope that the Government will\r\n\r\npursue this policy steadfastly. In contrast to  the\r\n\r\npride  expressed  by the ex-Chief  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nendless number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrikes  last  year, the Government  realises  that\r\n\r\nsuch acts are wasteful and damaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in His Excellency's Address the\r\n\r\nGovernment  stands  for  the  early  attainment  of\r\n\r\ncomplete  internal  self-government.  Although  the\r\n\r\nexpression is exactly the same as that used in  the\r\n\r\nAddress  last  year, we hope that with  more  sober\r\n\r\nleadership  this  will be attained  at  an  earlier\r\n\r\ndate.  The Chief Minister today has asked  for  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of all other Parties in this Assembly  for\r\n\r\nthis   mission.  Merdeka  is  also  our  goal   and\r\n\r\ncertainly  he  will  receive our  support  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of all this, the Government cannot\r\n\r\nescape  criticism on all its omissions, failure  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  its  promises  as  well  as  its   many\r\n\r\nshortsighted policies. In the field of commerce and\r\n\r\nindustry, Government hopes to promote the expansion\r\n\r\nof  industries. It also hopes that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will invest in new projects.  The  other\r\n\r\nhopes   are   that,  as  a  consequence   of   such\r\n\r\nexpressions,   foreign  capital  will   flood   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  market  to increase its  prosperity  and\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities. There are also  hopes  to\r\n\r\nassist    small-scale    manufacturers,    farmers,\r\n\r\nlivestock  rearers and fishermen. It  seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government lives on hopes, but  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to warn our Ministers that mere existence  on\r\n\r\nhopes  will  never bring about the  realisation  of\r\n\r\ntheir  dreams.  Action is needed and  we  need  the\r\n\r\nright type of action as well as approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendly contacts and discussions with our\r\n\r\nneighbours  brought back absolutely  nothing  worth\r\n\r\nwhile   to   Singapore.  Apart  from  the  pleasant\r\n\r\nreception  accorded  to our  trade  delegates,  the\r\n\r\nmission   claimed   that  it  had   persuaded   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government to sell us a few tons of low-grade  rubber. But from the accounts given  by  our\r\n\r\nrubber  dealers  as  well as the  newspapers,  such\r\n\r\ncontracts  for sale were completed even before  the\r\n\r\nmission left the shores of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-standing difficulties of our fishermen\r\n\r\nand   fish   merchants,  fishing  or   working   in\r\n\r\nIndonesian or near Indonesian waters, are still not\r\n\r\nsolved. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurrency  difficulties in connection  with  trading\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia  experienced by our  importers  and\r\n\r\nexporters  are  still formidable  barriers  to  our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade, and therefore to our earnings. Even\r\n\r\nin  the  frequent  discussions  with  our  brothers\r\n\r\nacross  the Straits, the Government have  not  been\r\n\r\nable  to  negotiate anything substantial that  will\r\n\r\nbenefit Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers talk about assisting industries,\r\n\r\nbut  let  me  ask them where our manufacturers  can\r\n\r\nsell their finished products. Singapore has to face\r\n\r\ncompetition  from Hongkong and Japan, and  yet  the\r\n\r\nonly   and   nearest   market - the   Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya - has  not been able to assist such industries\r\n\r\nor  encourage  them. The Government  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\ndespite all its claims, is unable to secure for our\r\n\r\nlocal  manufacturers  preferential  treatment  even\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation of Malaya. Goods manufactured\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  are subject to tax, whereas  if  the\r\n\r\nfactories  are situated in Johore or  Penang  there\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  the  necessity  to  pay  duty.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  take heed  of  this  seriously,\r\n\r\notherwise  any expansion or increase in  industries\r\n\r\nwill  not  take  place  in  Singapore  but  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to exports of local manufactures to\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  I  need not dwell too long  on  it.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  most  of  us  know that  the  import  duties\r\n\r\nimposed  on  such goods range from 50  to  200  per\r\n\r\ncent, and that has pushed our exports to a position\r\n\r\nof insignificance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come to the manufactures for local\r\n\r\nconsumption.   Even   these   are   facing    great\r\n\r\ndifficulties   because  of  keen  competition   and\r\n\r\nsometimes  dumping from our near  neighbours.  Many\r\n\r\nare  struggling on grimly for their existence,  but\r\n\r\nmany  others are faced with the imminent danger  of\r\n\r\nclosing down their factories. Let me just quote one\r\n\r\nexample - the  bee-hoon  manufacturers.  In  previous\r\n\r\nyears  they  not only produced sufficient  for  the\r\n\r\nconsumption of Singapore but they were also able to\r\n\r\nexport  their surplus to the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand the nearby islands. Today\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  faced with such fierce competition  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  soon go out of business.  The  Bee-hoon\r\n\r\nAssociation  have voiced their opinions  and  their\r\n\r\nproblems  in  the  Press. They have  brought  their\r\n\r\nproblems  to  the  attention of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry, and  I  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Works is also  well\r\n\r\ninformed  of  this  subject.  But  what   has   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  done for them? Up to date I believe  it\r\n\r\nis  still absolutely nothing. We are interested  to\r\n\r\nknow  what Government is going to do to assist this\r\n\r\ncategory of small-scale manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of agriculture, apart from the island-wide show that produced nothing but expenditure,\r\n\r\nwhat  encouragement  is Government  giving  to  our\r\n\r\nfarmers? Fertilisers are not sold to the farmers at\r\n\r\ncost.  They have to fend for themselves and to  buy\r\n\r\ntheir  own  fertilisers. Even such  accessories  as\r\n\r\ninsecticides are not readily available to  them.  I\r\n\r\nknow  of  a  brand of insecticide sold by  Imperial\r\n\r\nChemical Industries Limited, but I believe -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> No advertisements, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> but I believe that brand has\r\n\r\nbeen given to someone pretty near the Government as\r\n\r\na sort of monopoly, and it is a real difficulty for\r\n\r\nfarmers to get such an insecticide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem facing the farmers is the\r\n\r\ninsecurity  of tenure of land. We have very  little\r\n\r\nland  for farming. As was stated by the Speaker  of\r\n\r\nthe Federal Legislative Council, when we talk about\r\n\r\nfarmland  we  refer to such places  as  Changi  and\r\n\r\nPonggol  and  not to large stretches of  land  like\r\n\r\nJohore.   [Interruption.]  The   Speaker   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  during  the Commonwealth  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nAssociation meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The life of  the\r\n\r\nfarmer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoday  is not a pleasant one. In fact, he is driven\r\n\r\nfrom   pillar   to  post.  I  wonder  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment would be prepared to grant the  farmers,\r\n\r\nwho  occupy  Crown  land  on  temporary  occupation\r\n\r\nlicences, permanent titles to dispel their sense of\r\n\r\ninsecurity. As I have said before in this Assembly,\r\n\r\nand  I repeat it again, the only possible expansion\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore is towards the sea. Fisheries is the\r\n\r\nonly  feasible  primary  industry.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhopes to encourage it. It invited applications  for\r\n\r\nlicences  for  deep-sea  fishing.  Eight  companies\r\n\r\napplied  for  that,  but only  three  were  granted\r\n\r\nlicences.  No doubt many of them did not  know  the\r\n\r\nconditions  required for securing  a  licence,  but\r\n\r\nthey expressed their willingness to comply with all\r\n\r\nsuch  requirements and yet the licences issued were\r\n\r\nlimited only to three. Let me ask the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry whether another monopoly,  or\r\n\r\nnear monopoly, is to be created? Let me further ask\r\n\r\nhim whether more people engaged in deep-sea fishing\r\n\r\nwill  benefit Singapore? Each licensee is  required\r\n\r\nto train a number of local fishermen. If the number\r\n\r\nof companies granted licences were increased, would\r\n\r\nnot the number of fishermen undergoing training  be\r\n\r\nincreased? I would request the Minister to  make  a\r\n\r\nstatement of policy on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of training local fishermen under\r\n\r\nthe above scheme, it will also be interesting if we\r\n\r\ncan be informed of the number under training. I  am\r\n\r\ncertain  this number will just be a token one  and,\r\n\r\nthis  being the case, what is the Government doing?\r\n\r\nIs  it going to take an active part? Is it going to\r\n\r\nestablish  fishery  schools to start  training  our\r\n\r\nlocal  lads or is it only taking a passive attitude\r\n\r\nand  asking  fishermen to train their  own  men?  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that Government should give this idea of  a\r\n\r\nfishery school some thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the lines of encouraging the fishing\r\n\r\nindustry,  let me ask the Minister in  charge  what\r\n\r\nfacilities  Government is providing for  the  cheap\r\n\r\nlanding  and sale of fish. Now that Nicoll's  Drive\r\n\r\nhas  cut off Clyde Terrace Market from the sea,  it\r\n\r\nis no longer possible to land fish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere.  Instead, fishermen will have to land  their\r\n\r\nfish at Tanjong Rhu and thereafter transport it  by\r\n\r\nlorry  to  Clyde Terrace Market. It may  be  argued\r\n\r\nthat  there  is still the Ellenborough Market,  but\r\n\r\nthis  market was already too small when two markets\r\n\r\nwere  available  for the landing of fish.  Further,\r\n\r\nwith  deep-sea fishing and more off-shore  fishing,\r\n\r\nlarger  boats  will have to be used  and  certainly\r\n\r\nwith  the  many  low bridges over  Singapore  River\r\n\r\nentry  to  Ellenborough Market will not be possible\r\n\r\nfor  these bigger boats. What has happened  to  the\r\n\r\nmuch  discussed wholesale market? Has it gone  into\r\n\r\ncold storage? I recommend that it should be brought\r\n\r\nout  again and the scheme implemented at once. This\r\n\r\nwill  then give a little more encouragement to  the\r\n\r\nfishing  industry as well as lowering the  cost  of\r\n\r\nfish to the people of Singapore by saving transport\r\n\r\nand handling charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the case of prawn ponds. In one\r\n\r\ninstance, an operator did encroach a little on  the\r\n\r\nforest reserve at Jurong. He was immediately  asked\r\n\r\nby   Government   to  remove  his   bunds   without\r\n\r\nconsidering  the  great  financial  loss  he  would\r\n\r\nsuffer. I would like to point out that whereas  one\r\n\r\nGovernment  department encourages fishing,  another\r\n\r\ndepartment is not doing much to encourage it.  Land\r\n\r\nfor productive industries is scarce and it would be\r\n\r\na  help  if some areas of forest reserve  could  be\r\n\r\nutilised   for  prawn  ponds  or  other  productive\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the prospect of business in the\r\n\r\nnear  future is dull. The Government may claim that\r\n\r\nthe  financial position of Singapore is  sound  and\r\n\r\nthat the people are confident of its future, but it\r\n\r\nis   a   well-known  fact  that  capital  has  been\r\n\r\ntransferred  from  Singapore.  National  income  is\r\n\r\nsteadily  diminishing  and  with  the  stoppage  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  trade expansion,  unemployment  is\r\n\r\nsure to mount. We have some interesting figures  of\r\n\r\nunemployment from the Registrar of the Unemployment\r\n\r\nBureau,  but  I am inclined to treat  such  figures\r\n\r\ngiven  as  bogus.  For every man registered  as  an\r\n\r\nunemployed,  there are at least  three  others  not\r\n\r\nregistered. The ever-increasing number  of  hawkers\r\n\r\npoints to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis sorry state of affairs. In the East here  the\r\n\r\npeople  do  not,  as  a  rule,  welcome  Government\r\n\r\ncharity. They will only accept such dole as a  last\r\n\r\nresort, and so when they are out of a job they  try\r\n\r\nto  eke out a living by hawking. If more industries\r\n\r\nare  established, I am sure the number  of  hawkers\r\n\r\nwill decrease. Whilst on the problem of hawkers,  I\r\n\r\nhave heard that the Government intended to set up a\r\n\r\nHawkers  Advisory  Board, but to-date  nothing  has\r\n\r\nbeen   done.   Will  Government  do  something   to\r\n\r\nalleviate the difficulties of the hawkers? They are\r\n\r\narrested  for  obstruction  and  suffer  heavy  and\r\n\r\nfrequent fines. I put it to you, Sir, that  if  you\r\n\r\neliminate hawkers by arresting them, you will  have\r\n\r\nyet  another  problem  on your  hands.  These  poor\r\n\r\npeople  will have no means of supporting themselves\r\n\r\nand  it is more than likely that they will turn  to\r\n\r\ncrime  in  order to secure the money  necessary  to\r\n\r\nkeep themselves alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now turn our attention to what the\r\n\r\nGovernment  terms  as  a  peculiarly  urgent  youth\r\n\r\nproblem. This problem, in fact, arises out  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   policy   of  only   giving   primary\r\n\r\neducation to the masses of our young people. A  boy\r\n\r\nwho  passes Primary VI should be of an average  age\r\n\r\nof  13  years. What can a boy of 13 or  14  do?  No\r\n\r\nemployer  will give him a job because  of  his  low\r\n\r\neducation  as well as his youth. He is forced  into\r\n\r\nwasting his time and obviously sooner or later  his\r\n\r\nexcess  energy will lead him to gang up with  other\r\n\r\nyouths to create mischief. This urgent problem  can\r\n\r\nbe  met if the Government is prepared to extend the\r\n\r\neducation  of the masses to a minimum  standard  of\r\n\r\nForm  III. Only then will such students be able  to\r\n\r\nattain  a  standard of education and be of  an  age\r\n\r\nthat   will   be  more  acceptable  to   employers.\r\n\r\nGovernment may claim that this will mean a  greater\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the taxpayers' money, but this money\r\n\r\nis more suitably employed than when it is spent for\r\n\r\nbuilding  more  criminal courts, for enlarging  the\r\n\r\npolice force, and perhaps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor building more prisons to house young criminals.\r\n\r\nThe  youth of Singapore has received a raw deal  in\r\n\r\nthis  matter and I hope that Government  will  look\r\n\r\ninto  this  problem very seriously and do something\r\n\r\nto correct that shortsighted policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government also admits that it will not be able\r\n\r\nto  supply an adequate number of qualified Malayans\r\n\r\nto  replace  all  expatriates,  especially  in  the\r\n\r\nprofessional and technical posts. With  the  policy\r\n\r\nof  not  building  a  greater number  of  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  the  supply  of such  men  can  never  be\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. I believe that for every ten  primary\r\n\r\nschools   built,  there  must  be  at  least   four\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools. The students who pass  well  at\r\n\r\nthe  primary  level  should not  be  debarred  from\r\n\r\nentering  a  secondary school because  of  lack  of\r\n\r\nplaces.  He should be allowed to continue on  in  a\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  to  a  standard  equivalent   to\r\n\r\nStandard  VII. Now if these secondary  schools  are\r\n\r\nnot built, then the number of students that can  be\r\n\r\nturned out at the School Certificate level will  be\r\n\r\nfew  and selection for the university will then  be\r\n\r\neven fewer. In this manner it will not be easy  for\r\n\r\nus to have local lads to fill all the technical and\r\n\r\nprofessional posts required. Even the University of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  not  doing its share in  assisting  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. In more advanced countries  we\r\n\r\nfind  that  universities  usually  conduct  evening\r\n\r\ncourses  for those who are not fortunate enough  to\r\n\r\nbe  able to attend a full course. The University of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  not doing this. We hope that Government\r\n\r\nwill assist the University further in order that it\r\n\r\ncan  afford  such facilities to our workers.  After\r\n\r\nall,  the  University of Malaya  accepts  only  the\r\n\r\ncream  of Malayan students, yet many other students\r\n\r\nhave  gone  abroad for their studies and many  have\r\n\r\ncome back with first-class qualifications. This  is\r\n\r\nan  indication that we have not fully utilised  the\r\n\r\ntalents  we  have  in  this country.  The  rate  of\r\n\r\nprogress in any country is closely tied up with the\r\n\r\neducational policy, so that whilst it is  essential\r\n\r\nto   concentrate  on  the  problem  of  eradicating\r\n\r\nilliteracy in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis   country   and   also   producing   the   top\r\n\r\nprofessional men, the need for training  people  to\r\n\r\nfill  such  jobs  as  mechanics,  foremen,  masons,\r\n\r\nsalesmen  or even junior executives should  not  be\r\n\r\noverlooked.  In fact, the greatest volume  of  work\r\n\r\nand  the  most  important work  is  done  by  these\r\n\r\nclasses  of people. Two secondary technical schools\r\n\r\nfor  the whole of Singapore are not sufficient, and\r\n\r\nI  hope  that Government will build more to provide\r\n\r\nfacilities   for  the  middle  classes.   This   is\r\n\r\nimportant because unless this is done we will have,\r\n\r\non  the  one  hand, people with high qualifications\r\n\r\nand,  on  the other hand, the half-educated people.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should do its duty to  the  country\r\n\r\nand try and raise the standard of education of this\r\n\r\ncountry to further heights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assurance by the Government to assist the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University is most welcome, but  we  shall\r\n\r\nhave to withhold comment until such time as we know\r\n\r\nwhat  concrete steps Government is taking to assist\r\n\r\nthat institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Address by His Excellency the Governor,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  recognises the  need for  better\r\n\r\ncommunications in the rural areas.  I  shall  quote\r\n\r\none  example of such a need and the manner in which\r\n\r\nthe  Government tackled the problem. I had occasion\r\n\r\nto  bring  to  the  notice of  the  Government  the\r\n\r\nbottleneck that existed and is still existing along\r\n\r\nthe  half-mile  stretch between the 5\ufffd milestone\r\n\r\nand  the  6 milestone Yio Chu Kang Road early  last\r\n\r\nyear. The road is so narrow that it is a danger  to\r\n\r\npedestrians  and  cyclists when two  vehicles  pass\r\n\r\neach  other.  A  number  of serious  accidents  had\r\n\r\nhappened  there.  One year has already  passed  and\r\n\r\nnothing  concrete has been done. The voice  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  living  there, expressed in the  Press  and\r\n\r\nthrough  their  Assemblymen in this  Assembly,  has\r\n\r\nfallen  on  deaf ears. I hope that Government  will\r\n\r\nstir  itself into action and widen the road  at  an\r\n\r\nearly  date.  Instances such as this  reflect  that\r\n\r\nGovernment is ignoring the needs of the people  and\r\n\r\nit reflects badly on the policy of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a glowing note in the Address\r\n\r\nregarding  the  Singapore Telephone  Board,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould like to voice the opinion of the people  that\r\n\r\nthe  progress  of that Board can be  compared  with\r\n\r\nthat of a snail. If the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nand  Works  cares  to  look  into  the  number   of\r\n\r\napplications  for  new  telephones,  he   will   be\r\n\r\nastounded   by  the  number.  Even  the  mechanical\r\n\r\nworking  of  the telephone is none  too  good.  The\r\n\r\npublic of Singapore will agree with me that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot an infrequent experience that when one dials  a\r\n\r\nnumber,  instead  of getting that number,  you  are\r\n\r\nconnected  to the wrong line. It is indeed  not  an\r\n\r\nexaggeration  to  say  that  using  the   telephone\r\n\r\nnowadays is a training in patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Postal Department is having a Five-year\r\n\r\nPostal Services Development Plan, but I would  like\r\n\r\nto  warn  the  Government that the number  of  dead\r\n\r\nletters  will  not  decrease if  the  numbering  of\r\n\r\nhouses  in  the rural areas remains in  that  crazy\r\n\r\nstate.   I  would  like  the  Minister  for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing to  look  into  that\r\n\r\nmatter  and bring some order into the numbering  of\r\n\r\nhouses  in the rural areas. Let me quote  you  some\r\n\r\nexamples.   You  have  small  numbers   off   Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Road,  somewhere near the  end  of  that\r\n\r\nstretch,  and  then after that, the  numbers  start\r\n\r\nvarying  from  larger ones to  smaller  ones.  That\r\n\r\ncrazy  state  of  affairs should be rectified,  and\r\n\r\nrectified  at  once. In fact, I did  send  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber   of   letters  to  people  living   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> During the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not during the elections.\r\n\r\nMany  of these letters addressed to people  in  the\r\n\r\nkampongs came back to me, not because there was not\r\n\r\na  house  but because of the crazy way of numbering\r\n\r\nthe houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the medical services, it is\r\n\r\nheartening to note that Government is starting work\r\n\r\non  a  new  district hospital and  a  hospital  for\r\n\r\nchronic  cases. The Assembly will remember that  on\r\n\r\nmany occasions last year I voiced the need for such\r\n\r\nmeasures. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact,  I  had  put  the  questions  direct  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health. I am glad that the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  taken  note of this, but I am not too  certain\r\n\r\nthat  the line taken by the Government is the  best\r\n\r\none. The General Hospital today is doing the job of\r\n\r\na  specialist hospital, a district hospital as well\r\n\r\nas  a hospital for chronic cases. I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health to know that in a set-up  such\r\n\r\nas  this,  there  is bound to be a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nwastage   of   manpower.  As   I   understand   the\r\n\r\narrangements  in  hospitals, a  certain  number  of\r\n\r\npatients are attended to by a doctor and a  certain\r\n\r\nnumber  of  nurses.  Whereas the  acutely  ill  may\r\n\r\nrequire  the  maximum  of  medical  attention,  the\r\n\r\nconvalescent cases and the chronic cases need  less\r\n\r\nexpert  attention.  There is therefore  a  wastage.\r\n\r\nFrom  the accounts released to the Press,  the  new\r\n\r\ndistrict hospital is going to be a replica  of  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital. Only in this  case  it  will  be\r\n\r\nsmaller  in size. Looking at it from the  point  of\r\n\r\nview of shortage of staff and shortage of funds,  I\r\n\r\nthink this is all wrong. I believe it would be wise\r\n\r\nfor Government not to build such hospitals catering\r\n\r\nfor   all  types  of  cases.  In  fact,  the   best\r\n\r\narrangement would be to build a central  specialist\r\n\r\nhospital that requires specialists who can  act  as\r\n\r\nconsultants  to other hospitals and then  to  build\r\n\r\ncheap  district hospitals situated in all parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to cater for the acutely ill. Of  course,\r\n\r\nwe  should  also  have chronic hospitals.  If  such\r\n\r\narrangements  are made, the only type  of  hospital\r\n\r\nthat  will require specialist attention and special\r\n\r\nequipment  will be the central specialist hospital.\r\n\r\nDistrict hospitals can be built very cheaply on the\r\n\r\nlines of the old Tan Tock Seng Hospital. They  will\r\n\r\nneed  ordinary operating rooms. I believe that  the\r\n\r\nold Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which was built at less\r\n\r\ncost  than  the present type of hospitals installed\r\n\r\nwith  air-conditioning  and  luxurious  rooms,  has\r\n\r\nmanaged to cater for the needs of the people. If we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  have the idea of building  a  grand\r\n\r\ndistrict hospital, then we will not be able to have\r\n\r\nmore hospitals. A hospital's essential function  is\r\n\r\nto treat patients and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto render assistance to the people who are sick. If\r\n\r\nthe  money  can be spread to cover more  hospitals,\r\n\r\nthen  medical care can be given to many more people\r\n\r\nthan  the  number  that  is being  catered  for  by\r\n\r\nGovernment. I am sure that in Singapore today there\r\n\r\nis a large number of people who are sick and who go\r\n\r\nround  to the hospitals but are turned away because\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  lack of bed space. Government  should\r\n\r\nlook into this carefully and decide whether medical\r\n\r\nattention   for  a  large  number  of   people   is\r\n\r\npreferable  or  whether  it  is  better  to   build\r\n\r\nluxurious hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come back now to the problem of youths and it\r\n\r\nis one that is uppermost in the minds of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. As I have said earlier, this problem\r\n\r\nhas been created by the Government policy of under-educating  our  boys  and girls  and  leaving  them\r\n\r\nwithout  further  guidance or  the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nemployment at a tender age. Although Government has\r\n\r\ndeclared  that  it will do everything  possible  to\r\n\r\nencourage  healthy  youth activities  and  training\r\n\r\nfacilities,  as the President of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nBoys'  Clubs.  I  am forced to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\nalthough Government has promised a full loaf to the\r\n\r\nyouth  movement, in actual fact, it is  withholding\r\n\r\nthree-quarters  of  that  loaf.   The   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  know that boys'  club  movements\r\n\r\ncater primarily for the under-privileged youths and\r\n\r\ntheir   activities,   unlike   many   other   youth\r\n\r\nmovements,  are  carried  on  daily,  Sundays   and\r\n\r\nholidays  not,  excepted.  With  the  little   help\r\n\r\nreceived from the Department of Social Welfare, the\r\n\r\nboys' clubs have to rely a good deal on the efforts\r\n\r\nof  voluntary  workers and public  assistance.  The\r\n\r\nmovement  tries  to provide healthy activities  for\r\n\r\nthe   under-privileged  youth,   and   to   produce\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  results, effort  must  be  sustained.\r\n\r\nUnlike other  movements, boys' clubs  are  very\r\n\r\nshort of trained instructors. Some of these leaders\r\n\r\nmay  assist the clubs for some time, but invariably\r\n\r\ntheir interest will slacken and they will drop out.\r\n\r\nIn  order to provide for continuous leadership, the\r\n\r\nFederation of Boys' Clubs have put up a  scheme  to\r\n\r\ntrain leaders and to post them to assist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe various clubs. I must remind this Assembly that\r\n\r\nI  raised  the question of boys' clubs  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget  debate  last year and was promised  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Welfare  that  assistance\r\n\r\nwould  be forthcoming if concrete schemes were  put\r\n\r\nup. Now that the scheme has been put into operation\r\n\r\nand the Government is not assisting it as promised,\r\n\r\nit  will be a pity if the voluntary workers are not\r\n\r\nencouraged  to carry on assisting our  youths  more\r\n\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will remember that the  problem  of\r\n\r\nilliteracy   was   first   tackled   by   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations, and although there was  no  lack  of\r\n\r\ntrained  personnel, this scheme  did  not  flourish\r\n\r\nuntil   full   assistance  was   granted   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If  the  Government  feels  that  this\r\n\r\nmovement  can carry on with ten per cent Government\r\n\r\naid  only,  then  let  the Assistant  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare, who is also the President  of\r\n\r\none  of  the  boys' clubs, tell us  the  degree  of\r\n\r\nsuccess  his  club has achieved.  Believe  me,  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary workers that we have are mostly  salaried\r\n\r\npeople. In addition to giving their services,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to pay for transport, drinks, food and  other\r\n\r\nincidentals.  Enthusiasm in such  cases  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsustained.  The Government should wake up  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter  and  if it still maintains the attitude  of\r\n\r\nwanting  to train our youths to be good and  useful\r\n\r\ncitizens, it should do something more concrete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I must urge the Government not to\r\n\r\nlive  on  hopes,  but  to  carry  on  its  promised\r\n\r\nprogramme diligently. Otherwise it will not be able\r\n\r\nto retain the confidence of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   with  reference  to  paragraph  4   of   His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Governor's Address, where  he  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  the expansion of existing industries  on  the\r\n\r\nisland, I would like to say a few words. It  is  to\r\n\r\nbe  appreciated that the Government  had  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  matter in mind.

It is that the Hon.the  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare is President  of  a\r\n\r\nboys' club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the Governor's Address, I was\r\n\r\nunimpressed  at  the disjointed  catalogue  of  the\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous   administrative  projects   of   the\r\n\r\nvarious Ministries all stuck together by a  lot  of\r\n\r\npolitical platitudes. The one thing for which  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  has taken office, namely the  reopening\r\n\r\nof  the Merdeka talks, was left hanging in the air.\r\n\r\nThis  morning  we  have heard  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\ndeclare  his  stand. He would  have  made  my  task\r\n\r\neasier  if  he  had  declared  his  stand  in   the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Address. We all know  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ncaretaker Government. We all know that we are  just\r\n\r\nmarking  time.  But  unless the  Government  itself\r\n\r\nbears that in mind, it will soon forget the purpose\r\n\r\nfor  which  it has assumed office, and the  purpose\r\n\r\nfor which Opposition leaders and Opposition Parties\r\n\r\nhave declared their support for this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A remarkable feature of the speech of the leader\r\n\r\nof the Liberal-Socialists is the fact that he, like\r\n\r\nthe Address of the Governor, was only interested in\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government just by the way.  He  was\r\n\r\nmore  interested in the crazy numbering of  houses,\r\n\r\nboys'  clubs, the running of hospitals on which,  I\r\n\r\nam sure,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  are  people  more competent  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nMinister,   and  a  whole  host  of   other   petty\r\n\r\nadministrative  matters. We  are  not  saying  that\r\n\r\nthese  matters  of day-to-day administration  of  a\r\n\r\ngovernment are not important or that they should be\r\n\r\nneglected.  But  to ignore the political  realities\r\n\r\nwhich surround this whole Assembly, this Government\r\n\r\nand the whole country is political childishness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case I am accused of being preoccupied with\r\n\r\nthe  political issue of the next Merdeka  talks  to\r\n\r\nthe  exclusion  of the day-to-day running  of  this\r\n\r\nadministration, I took great care to  read  through\r\n\r\nthe whole of this policy speech. As a statement  of\r\n\r\nthe  policy of the Labour Front Government for  the\r\n\r\nsecond  session  of this Assembly,  the  Governor's\r\n\r\nAddress  was poor and feeble. There was no coherent\r\n\r\ntheme,   no   broad  exposition  of  the  country's\r\n\r\neconomic  or  political situation. No master  plan,\r\n\r\nbut  just  a collection of the various departmental\r\n\r\nactivities  puffed up with pious ministerial  hopes\r\n\r\nand  good  intentions. Instead of  specific  plans,\r\n\r\nfigures,  targets, there was only fluff  and  empty\r\n\r\nexhortation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the content was poor, the presentation was\r\n\r\natrocious.   We  can  excuse  the  hollow   opening\r\n\r\nparagraph about the Government's desire to link  up\r\n\r\nits  future  with the achievements - or  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nlack of them-of the last 17 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 2 we are told that \"the Government\r\n\r\nstands   for  the  early  attainment  of   complete\r\n\r\ninternal self-government\", with a platitude that it\r\n\r\n\"recognises that successful self-government must be\r\n\r\nbased   on   national   prosperity   and   national\r\n\r\nsolidarity\".  But  after that  promising  stand  we\r\n\r\nexpected  to hear the Government tell us  how  they\r\n\r\nproposed  to  achieve this; what were their  plans;\r\n\r\nwhat  steps  were  being taken to  implement  these\r\n\r\nplans.  Even this morning we have not been told  of\r\n\r\nthem.  We  only  have an assurance from  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister    that    that   is    his    predominant\r\n\r\npreoccupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly in paragraph 3 we are plunged from\r\n\r\nentrepot trade to capital expansion for industries,\r\n\r\nagriculture  and  fisheries, farming  land,  crops,\r\n\r\ndown to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeep-sea fishing in paragraph 9-a higgledy-piggledy\r\n\r\ncollection  from  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in paragraph 10 comes the Labour Front Party\r\n\r\ntheoretician who tried to tie them all up  together\r\n\r\nwith a bit of Labour Front Socialist erudition. Let\r\n\r\nus read it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is the objective of the Government not only\r\n\r\nto  increase the total wealth of Singapore but also\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that wealth is diffused throughout  the\r\n\r\npopulation  and  that the gap between  the  largest\r\n\r\nincomes  and  the  smallest  is  steadily  reduced.\r\n\r\nWhilst this is partly a matter of the cash earnings\r\n\r\nof  the  worker,  diffusion of wealth  also  occurs\r\n\r\nthrough improvement of the social services provided\r\n\r\nout   of   national  revenue.  In  this  connection\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy  is  one  of  improving   social\r\n\r\nservices  of  all kinds especially in those  areas,\r\n\r\nwhether  urban or rural, whose needs have not  been\r\n\r\nfully met in the past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Blabber, blabber, blabber! No facts, no figures.  A\r\n\r\nlot of pious protestations. Let us examine what the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Commerce and Industry has said.  Take\r\n\r\nhis programme for industrialisation. He covers that\r\n\r\nin  paragraphs  4  and 5. He said  something  about\r\n\r\npromoting  \"the expansion of existing industries...\r\n\r\nand  the establishment of new industries. For  this\r\n\r\npurpose    there    must   be   adequate    capital\r\n\r\ninvestment.... the  rate of capital  formation  within\r\n\r\nSingapore can be increased....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says in paragraph 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...International Bank Mission the Government is\r\n\r\npreparing  legislation  to  set  up  an  Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion   Board   to   assist   the   small-scale\r\n\r\nmanufacturer   and   is  examining   the   possible\r\n\r\nestablishment of an Industrial Research Institute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  hear  of  nothing but possible  committees  and\r\n\r\npublic  authorities which have all not  come-  into\r\n\r\nfruition.

But again, no facts, no figures, but more\r\n\r\ngood intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 we are told of\r\n\r\ntechnical schools, a part of education, I  presume,\r\n\r\nbut  somehow education is dealt with in some  other\r\n\r\nlater section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We commend the Government for making arrangements\r\n\r\nfor  marine training for the local merchant marine.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Government recognises the need for\r\n\r\ntechnical schools. It lists one Polytechnic that we\r\n\r\nhave  been talking about - that mirage which all good\r\n\r\ncolonial  administrators point to and have  pointed\r\n\r\nto, for the last five years. And before this mirage\r\n\r\nbecomes  a  reality we are being presented  with  a\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Budget to boost  it  up  by  several\r\n\r\nmillion  more  dollars.  More  of  that  from   the\r\n\r\nfinancial aspect later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever wrote paragraph 18 could not have read\r\n\r\nparagraph 62. In paragraph 18 - the explanation given\r\n\r\nwhy certain technical skills cannot be provided for\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  is that Singapore  is  too  small  a\r\n\r\nterritory. It is not economic. Singapore is  viewed\r\n\r\nalone,  separate  and distinct. Paragraph  62  envisages  all  these links with the Federation,  links\r\n\r\nstrengthened  to make both territories indivisible.\r\n\r\nWhoever  wrote paragraph 18 obviously did not  have\r\n\r\nthe Federation in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult not to be disjointed in my\r\n\r\ncriticism of this Address because the Address jumps\r\n\r\nfrom  item  to  item with no connecting  theme.  In\r\n\r\nparagraph  19  we  are suddenly plunged  into  road\r\n\r\ntransport and traffic. We are told that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"the Government is continuing to give careful study\r\n\r\nto   the   problems  of  road  communications   and\r\n\r\ntransport.  The  establishment  of  a  unified  bus\r\n\r\nsystem...\".The people of Singapore have paid  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge sum of money to bring out a transport expert.\r\n\r\nThere  has been a Transport Commission and a report\r\n\r\nhas  been  tabled which recommended a  unified  bus\r\n\r\nservice   under  a  public  authority.   But   like\r\n\r\neverything  else about this Government,  they  call\r\n\r\nfor  the  experts, they call for the  reports,  and\r\n\r\nfinally  there  is no implementation.  Now  we  are\r\n\r\ntold,  so  I  read  in  the  newspapers,  that  our\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Transport is  going\r\n\r\nto  London to see the crowded streets of London  in\r\n\r\norder  to  be  able  better  to  equip  himself  to\r\n\r\ndischarge   his   duties.  Every  Member   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Front Bench has had a free  trip.  They\r\n\r\nhave  been  either  to  the Merdeka  talks,  or  to\r\n\r\nHongkong over Christmas to inspect Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nand  teachers.  So  why not let  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Transport go to London  to  look\r\n\r\nat  the  buses in London? We only hope  that  after\r\n\r\nthis  sojourn to the land of his ancestors, or more\r\n\r\naccurately  the  land  of  the  conquerors  of  his\r\n\r\nancestors,  he will come back with a more  vigorous\r\n\r\nand  a  more  positive attitude  to  the  transport\r\n\r\nproblem. But it is unfortunate he did not take this\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  clarify  the  position   of   his\r\n\r\nGovernment with regard to road transport. It is  an\r\n\r\nopen secret that all the bus owners are saying that\r\n\r\nthis  Government has decided that public  ownership\r\n\r\nis  not possible and therefore it is going to  plan\r\n\r\nout  some scheme between the Government and private\r\n\r\nownership - perhaps the Government 55  per  cent  and\r\n\r\nprivate capital 45 per cent. There is a great  deal\r\n\r\nof talk and a lot of heart-burn amongst the Chinese\r\n\r\nbus  owners that this 45 per cent may not be  local\r\n\r\ncapital  either, because it is alleged  that  local\r\n\r\ncapital has not got sufficient managerial skill and\r\n\r\nexperience.  Here  is  a good opportunity  in  this\r\n\r\npolicy statement debate to clarify the Government's\r\n\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe   are   not   satisfied  with  this  wishy-washy\r\n\r\nequivocation - that \"the establishment of  a  unified\r\n\r\nbus  system  will play an important  part  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  publish a  White  Paper  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject shortly.\" The report of the commission  has\r\n\r\nbeen  tabled  for several months.  Let  us  have  a\r\n\r\nstand.  We  all  know that the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKapor  is very anxious about the Singapore Traction\r\n\r\nCompany, so let the S.T.C. know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious thing about the next few\r\n\r\nparagraphs - 20, 21, 22 and 23 - all from the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Communications and Works is the facile  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich everything is explained away. If a problem is\r\n\r\nintractable, then there is the comforting  thought:\r\n\r\n\"After all, it is just as bad anywhere else in  the\r\n\r\nworld.\"  For  instance, \"If traffic  congestion  is\r\n\r\nbecoming more acute,\" so it is, \"as in other cities\r\n\r\nin  the world.\" And in the best colonial traditions\r\n\r\nthey  give  a lot of comforting figures  about  how\r\n\r\n\"Singapore's Airport is flourishing\" with more  and\r\n\r\nmore  passengers. The fact that we  have  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  telephone  calls between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation, says the Ministry of Communications and\r\n\r\nWorks, illustrates \"the very close ties between the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories\". Two million trunk calls. We were\r\n\r\nnot  told what the previous figures were and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know how these two million trunk calls had been\r\n\r\nregistered.  Every telephone call to  Johore  Bahru\r\n\r\nnow  has  to go through as a trunk call.  So  these\r\n\r\ncomforting figures mean less than they appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, when we come to intractable\r\n\r\nproblems like flood control, the attitude indicated\r\n\r\nis even more engaging. Paragraph 22 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The frequent and increasing floods which have\r\n\r\ncaused  serious damage and suffering  in  the  past\r\n\r\nconstitute a major problem for which the Government\r\n\r\nnow  has the technical solution, but which can only\r\n\r\nbe dealt with as funds can be made available.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Whatever  that  can  mean. Not a  word  about  this\r\n\r\ncontroversy between the Government Engineer and the\r\n\r\nCity  Council Engineer; between the man  who  said,\r\n\r\n\"You can stick up three gates in front of the mouth\r\n\r\nof three rivers and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhold back the sea and you have all the drains empty\r\n\r\nready to take the flood waters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other engineer who said, \"If you try to\r\n\r\ndo  that,  perhaps all the three gates, or  one  of\r\n\r\nthem,  will  be swept away.\" What is the Government\r\n\r\nsaying? They say they have got a technical solution\r\n\r\nwhich,  fortunately  for  the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nengineer concerned, may never be put into operation\r\n\r\nfor  quite  a  long  time, by which  time  the  man\r\n\r\nresponsible for the scheme may have safely  retired\r\n\r\nto  some  pleasant country cottage in the south  of\r\n\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government does say that \"the anti-flood\r\n\r\nscheme  at Bedok is now almost completed\". What  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  say is that when it is completed,  there\r\n\r\nwill be no floods in Bedok! It was very wise of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Works not to commit\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether Radio Malaya, which comes\r\n\r\nin  the  next paragraph, 24, was tacked on because,\r\n\r\nalthough  part  of  the  portfolio  of  the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary, it is really communications.  Can  there\r\n\r\nbe  any  doubt at all that Radio Malaya  should  be\r\n\r\ndivorced  from the Government and run as  a  public\r\n\r\ncorporation?  Is there any real doubt  that  if  we\r\n\r\nwanted   to  introduce  television,  and   if   the\r\n\r\ncommittee  sitting on it should want  to  recommend\r\n\r\nit, it should be done by a public corporation? I am\r\n\r\nnot an uncritical admirer of the British. For their\r\n\r\nown country, they institute public corporations  to\r\n\r\nrun  their  radio, but they allow it to  become  an\r\n\r\nadjunct   of  a  government  department  in   their\r\n\r\ncolonies.  That is why we have to put up  with  the\r\n\r\ncurious  sort  of  news  presentation  from   Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya. Recently Mr Casey, the Australian External\r\n\r\nAffairs   Minister,  and  Mr  Abdul   Ghani,   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Foreign Minister, were passing  through\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I was listening to the 7 o'clock  news.\r\n\r\nRight in the middle of the news they broke the news\r\n\r\nto  interview Mr Casey. I do not know whether  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary  gave his leave  and  licence  for\r\n\r\nthis,  but  to  hear  an expatriate  break  a  news\r\n\r\nbulletin and suddenly turn round\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   say,  \"Mr  Casey,  we  in  Malaya  are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the problem of the Suez Canal  and\r\n\r\nour  future  trade and so on, via the  Suez  Canal.\r\n\r\nWhat  do you think, Mr Casey?\" And then Mr Casey,\r\n\r\nover  Radio  Malaya's News, said, \"We in  Australia\r\n\r\nshare  the  views and sentiments of the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and indeed of the whole of South-East  Asia.\r\n\r\nThe  Suez  Canal  must  be internationalised ...\".Of\r\n\r\ncourse, to be fair, Radio Malaya's news reader went\r\n\r\non  to  say  that  Mr  Abdul  Ghani,  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister of Indonesia, was also passing through and\r\n\r\nMr  Abdul Ghani said that all the Indonesians were\r\n\r\nsolidly behind the Egyptians. But this is the  kind\r\n\r\nof  monstrous  bias  which a Government  department\r\n\r\nrunning  a  radio station gives. Expatriates  under\r\n\r\nthe  charge  of an expatriate Minister,  using,  at\r\n\r\npublic  expense, this radio network to  give  radio\r\n\r\ntime  in  Malaya to the Australian External Affairs\r\n\r\nMinister.  We  raised  this  matter  of  a   public\r\n\r\ncorporation for Radio Malaya at the very opening of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly last year. After 17 months of office\r\n\r\nto be told that the Government is still thinking of\r\n\r\nit,   one   wonders  what  could  have   been   the\r\n\r\nachievement in the last 17 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote another instance on this Radio Malaya\r\n\r\nissue.  Recently four unions of the  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nwere calling a meeting to counter the moves made by\r\n\r\ncertain unions to form one union on the waterfront.\r\n\r\nBecause  these four unions happened to  be  against\r\n\r\nthis  one  union, they got radio time. It  was  all\r\n\r\nover   Radio  Malaya  on  the  21st  and  22nd   of\r\n\r\nAugust - that  these  four  unions  were  calling   a\r\n\r\nmeeting  for  the  22nd.  The  news  was  over  all\r\n\r\nnetworks  of Radio Malaya. We are trying to  run  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  State and if we expect others  to  play\r\n\r\nthe  game  with us, we have to play the  game  with\r\n\r\nthem.  If we attempt to use the whole machinery  of\r\n\r\nstate,  while we are in office, to bias things  our\r\n\r\nway,  then  we cannot complain when somebody  else,\r\n\r\nafter assuming office, does exactly the same to us.\r\n\r\nI have quoted these two instances to show the great\r\n\r\ndangers  of having this great propaganda instrument\r\n\r\nin  the  hands of a Government department  under  a\r\n\r\ncolonial official.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs 25, 26 and 27: We have S.A.T.A.,\r\n\r\nmedical   training,  nurses'  training,  specialist\r\n\r\nexaminations,  district  hospitals.  They  are  the\r\n\r\ncontributions  of the Ministry of  Health,  of  the\r\n\r\nhealthy  looking Minister for Health.  Of  all  our\r\n\r\nMinisters he is the man who carries the burdens  of\r\n\r\noffice  most lightly, probably because  he  is  the\r\n\r\nwisest   and  leaves  the  burden  mostly  to   his\r\n\r\npermanent officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little statement on clinics in\r\n\r\nparagraph  11 - it must have been from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health,  but  I do not know  why  it  came  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 11:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Extended medical facilities will be continued\r\n\r\nthrough a system of clinics throughout the Island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All we have heard so far is that one clinic will be\r\n\r\nput  up  where the Malayan Airways canteen used  to\r\n\r\nbe.  Now  they  give  us a little  bit  more  about\r\n\r\nS.A.T.A., the Colombo Plan, aid from Australia, the\r\n\r\nfight against tuberculosis, specialist training  by\r\n\r\narrangement   with   Australia,   and   the   Royal\r\n\r\nAustralian  College  of Surgeons.  Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  the  British are on their way out.  They  are\r\n\r\n8,000  miles away and they are intractably involved\r\n\r\nwith Cypriots and Egyptians and they have less  and\r\n\r\nless  to  spare  to deal with us. But  now  we  are\r\n\r\ngetting more and more linked up with Australia.  We\r\n\r\nare  getting  Australian troops to replace  British\r\n\r\ntroops.  We  are going to be trained by  Australian\r\n\r\nsurgeons instead of British surgeons. Sir,  I  have\r\n\r\ngot  nothing  against the Australians  except  that\r\n\r\nthey have not had a civilisation in Australia for a\r\n\r\nlong  time,  and  I would rather have  an  F.R.C.S.\r\n\r\n(England) than an F.R.C.S. (Australia)!  So,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  would  all  the  doctors.  And  talking   of\r\n\r\nsubversion, here is subversion: Colombo Plan aid. I\r\n\r\ngive  you a free milk shaker, then I sell you milk.\r\n\r\nThen  I send my fellows along to test you for Royal\r\n\r\nAustralian College of Surgeons memberships. Then  I\r\n\r\nhelp  you  in  the  fight against tuberculosis.  We\r\n\r\nwelcome all these things, but I think one must draw\r\n\r\nattention  to  the fact that in this  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  the Australians are gently moving  in  while\r\n\r\nthe British are gently oozing out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

So we must watch out for\r\n\r\nthis infiltration. Let us have no subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in paragraph 27 - and this wasted five minutes\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. Committee's time:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Plans are being prepared for a 200-bed Chronic\r\n\r\nhospital.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is  it  worth while building a hospital  if  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be \"chronic\"? I do not know whether  this\r\n\r\nis  a  technical  phrase. Perhaps medical  men  can\r\n\r\nenlighten us on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three paragraphs are the smallest\r\n\r\ncontribution  of all the Ministries - quite  wisely,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  less there is, the less there  is  to\r\n\r\ncriticise.  Not  one word about  this  shortage  of\r\n\r\ndoctors.  Everybody knows that Singapore  is  in  a\r\n\r\nchronic  condition of shortage of doctors; that  we\r\n\r\nare  importing  our doctors from  India  and  other\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  world. Not one word has  been  said\r\n\r\nabout how medical training facilities are going  to\r\n\r\nbe  expanded;  how  we  are going  to  improve  and\r\n\r\nincrease the training of more doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 - they are\r\n\r\nthe   contributions  of  my  friend  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Lands and Housing. Sir, I hope  I  am\r\n\r\nstill his friend, for there has been a lot of  hard\r\n\r\nwords  said about my Party in the last week by  his\r\n\r\nfriends,  but,  I  am happy to  note,  not  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself. I hope his Master Plan  will  be\r\n\r\nnot  only  technically sound, but also  wisely  and\r\n\r\njustly  implemented. As a technical job,  very  few\r\n\r\npeople will find anything to complain of because  a\r\n\r\ntremendous amount of planning has gone into it. But\r\n\r\nto  put  that  blue-print into  action,  to  uproot\r\n\r\nthousands  of  families is bound to cause  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal   of   distress  and  suffering,  unless   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  is  done  with  a  great  deal   of\r\n\r\n\"heart\".  This  is  not to  say  that  we  have  no\r\n\r\ncriticisms at all of the Master Plan. I am  not  an\r\n\r\nexpert  on town planning, but it does seem  strange\r\n\r\nwhen  the  building of a cinema was disapproved  by\r\n\r\nthe City Council, and suddenly approved because the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan had marked the site out as a cinema!  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know what this is all about. I do not  know\r\n\r\nif there is any connection between this and the two\r\n\r\nnew Members on the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are members of the Labour Front. It does  seem\r\n\r\nodd  that  the Master Plan has gone to such  minute\r\n\r\ndetail  as to mark out this little bit of  land  in\r\n\r\nKatong for a cinema.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope also that the Land Titles Ordinance and\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Acquisition and Land  Purchases  Control\r\n\r\nBills mentioned in paragraph 29 will be looked upon\r\n\r\nin  the  years to come as sound Socialist  inclined\r\n\r\nlegislation; that his Housing Authority,  which  he\r\n\r\nenvisages, in paragraph 30, will give rise to  tens\r\n\r\nof   thousands  more  of  homes  before  the   next\r\n\r\nelection,  so that they can bear witness  in  steel\r\n\r\nand  concrete  and tiles to the great  contribution\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Member  for Ulu  Bedok  towards  the\r\n\r\nhappiness and welfare of thousands of families  now\r\n\r\nliving in slums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not particularly impressed by paragraph 32. Houses for sale-this scatter-brained scheme of\r\n\r\na   million  dollars  to  finance  several  million\r\n\r\ndollars worth of business by building societies. 68\r\n\r\nhouses  put  up  for sale, probably  with  the  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  lent  by  Government to the  S.I.T.,  drew\r\n\r\n1,300  applications. Therefore it proved that  here\r\n\r\nis the way to solve the ills of Singapore by making\r\n\r\nall of them petty bourgeois, making all of them own\r\n\r\nhouses. A wonderful and admirable scheme if it were\r\n\r\npossible. But can you solve the housing shortage on\r\n\r\nthis  basis?  Are  you  not  just  aggravating  the\r\n\r\nposition by putting in a great deal of material and\r\n\r\nskill  into middle-class homes - they must be middle-class homes - before people will buy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

You pay interest to the housing  society,\r\n\r\nand the housing society pays off the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  the  Government  says, \"Take  this  same  one\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars and start another housing estate.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope my friend the Hon. the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  does   not\r\n\r\nbelieve that this is the way to a greater and  more\r\n\r\nprosperous  Malaya, it certainly is not  the  magic\r\n\r\nformula for the next election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know he has received a copy of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy statement. I refer him to pages 8 and  9  on\r\n\r\nsecurity  of tenure, compensation and resettlement,\r\n\r\nand eviction from private holdings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad to note that the Government did\r\n\r\nmention  that  the Land Clearance and  Resettlement\r\n\r\nPlan  had been accepted by the previous Government.\r\n\r\nWe hope they will implement this Plan and, further,\r\n\r\nthat  the rates and scales of compensation will  be\r\n\r\nkept  up-to-date. Everybody knows that  whenever  a\r\n\r\nsquatter is evicted, he suffers a capital loss  and\r\n\r\nloss  of  income for at least a year until he  gets\r\n\r\ngoing  in  some other locality. But  at  least  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has the intention to pay  compensation.\r\n\r\nBut  what  of evictions from private holdings?  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Lands and Housing knows that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a great deal of trouble over this. How  often\r\n\r\nhave  I  seen  him, together with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang, to discuss the problems of squatters, of\r\n\r\nNaval Base workers living on land belonging to  the\r\n\r\nBukit Sembawang Estate Ltd. of which the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar is a director? Under the present Control\r\n\r\nof  Rent Ordinance passed by the Progressive Party,\r\n\r\nany  land-owner can get a squatter  out  simply  by\r\n\r\ngiving  him  a notice to quit and then employing  a\r\n\r\nlawyer to issue a summons if he refuses to quit and\r\n\r\nto  prove  in court that the premises on  his  land\r\n\r\nconsist  of temporary dwellings like an attap-house\r\n\r\nor  a wooden and zinc house, and he is entitled  to\r\n\r\nrecover his possession. The unfortunate squatter is\r\n\r\nthen  pushed  out  with  no compensation.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  there  are two standards of treatment  for\r\n\r\nsquatters.  One,  the Government  which  recognises\r\n\r\nthat  it has certain responsibilities to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  and when it evicts squatters,  pays\r\n\r\nthem compensation. Two, the Government holding the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nring  for  a  free-for-all,  winner-take-all  fight\r\n\r\nbetween the private land-owners and the unfortunate\r\n\r\nsquatters  who live on private land.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Local  Government, Lands and  Housing  is  not\r\n\r\nunaware  of the situation. The only reason  why  we\r\n\r\nhad  not pressed it earlier was because he informed\r\n\r\nus  that he had a committee sitting to enquire into\r\n\r\nthis matter and to make such amendments to the  law\r\n\r\nas  were necessary. Seventeen months of office, and\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  had one word about  the  results  or\r\n\r\nrecommendations of this committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read a short paragraph from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy statement about which a lot has been said by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister without his  having  read  it,\r\n\r\napart from what the local Press chose to publish of\r\n\r\nit. It says here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Occupants of Crown land are now given some\r\n\r\ncompensation when they are evicted from  Government\r\n\r\nland. Similar provisions ought to be made for those\r\n\r\nwho occupy land belonging to private individuals or\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The Rent Control Ordinance  (passed  by\r\n\r\nthe Progressive Party in collaboration with British\r\n\r\nColonial  Officials)should  be  amended   to   make\r\n\r\nprovision    for   the   payment   of    reasonable\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  those occupants who  are  evicted\r\n\r\nfrom  their homes by private landlords.  Scales  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  based on principles  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nshould be worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disputes over the application of such scales of\r\n\r\ncompensation could be referred to a body similar to\r\n\r\nthe  Rent  Board  who  could determine  the  proper\r\n\r\ncompensation payable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless this is done, all that we can do for these\r\n\r\nunfortunate  people,  who  happen  to  occupy  land\r\n\r\nbelonging  to some private company like  the  Bukit\r\n\r\nSembawang  Estate,  is to apply  a  little  bit  of\r\n\r\npolitical pressure; like threatening to expose  the\r\n\r\nBukit Sembawang Estate unless some compensation  is\r\n\r\npaid.  Because we threatened to do that, some  kind\r\n\r\nof  compensation was offered. But  that  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory position and the Government should not\r\n\r\nwaste time in correcting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to paragraphs 33 to 38 of the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Address.  They  concern  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretariat:    finance,   development,    building\r\n\r\neconomy, taxation, fiscal policy. It is in the best\r\n\r\nof colonial traditions. No facts, no figures,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnothing   definite  on  which  you  can   pin   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  down.  Just  expressions  intended   to\r\n\r\ninstil confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore's financial position continues to be\r\n\r\nsound ...nothing  shall be done to shake  confidence...\r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to ensure economy  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment  spending ... large economies have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved... prudence forbids  draining  these\r\n\r\n(reserves) too low .. .Considerable taxation potential\r\n\r\nremains  to be tapped... to lay the burden  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders  of  those members of the community  best\r\n\r\nable to carry it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  how?  It  does not say. All it  says  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  fiscal  policy is  tied  up  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. So presumably we cannot put  up  income\r\n\r\ntax  until  the  Federation  Government  runs  into\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  as  it is already doing.  But  apart\r\n\r\nfrom that, nothing but a whole series of confidence\r\n\r\ninspiring notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education. I am glad to note that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  opened up its topic with the  increasing\r\n\r\npopulation of Singapore youth. Unless it does  more\r\n\r\nthan  take  note  of the increasing  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and spends a great deal of money, time in\r\n\r\norganising   the  training  of  these   youth   and\r\n\r\nproviding   career  opportunities,  the  Government\r\n\r\ncannot  expect co-operation and public spiritedness\r\n\r\nfrom  this  population. Let it never  be  forgotten\r\n\r\nthat they are born here and they have the right  to\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know about the boys' clubs and I have\r\n\r\nlistened with patience to what has been said by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon. It does seem to me  that  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  a question of catching them and  putting\r\n\r\nthem  into boys' clubs so that their excess energy,\r\n\r\nas  the Member for Serangoon puts it, will go  into\r\n\r\nuseful and peaceful activities. He thinks the  best\r\n\r\nthing that can happen to Singapore youth is to  put\r\n\r\nthem  into boys' clubs under good leaders like  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Federation of Boys'  Clubs.  Then\r\n\r\nthey  will all grow up worried about crazy  numbers\r\n\r\nof  houses,  and streets that are too  narrow,  and\r\n\r\nmarkets that have got no more access to the sea. It\r\n\r\nmay be a good thing, to keep them interested in the\r\n\r\nlittle things in life so that they forget the wider\r\n\r\nproblems of society. But that is not the purpose of\r\n\r\nyouth education. These are the people who will form\r\n\r\nthe nation of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless we give them not only education and training\r\n\r\nbut career opportunities, then we are in for a load\r\n\r\nof trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Education knows full\r\n\r\nwell that what is said in paragraphs 40, 41 and  42\r\n\r\nis  just scratching the surface. There is some talk\r\n\r\nabout  being \"ready to help the Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nauthorities  to  attain  standards  which  will  be\r\n\r\ninternationally recognised, so that  the  graduates\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to find worthwhile employment\",  but\r\n\r\nthere is not one word about the controversy sparked\r\n\r\noff  by  his saying that Nanyang University degrees\r\n\r\nmay  not  be recognised by the Government. What  is\r\n\r\nthe  position?  Is it going to be  recognised?  Are\r\n\r\nsteps being taken to see that the standard is  such\r\n\r\nthat the Government can recognise its degrees? What\r\n\r\nis  the  position of its students? They are  virile\r\n\r\nand  vigorous people. If you say to them  that  the\r\n\r\ndoor  of employment is closed to them because  they\r\n\r\ndid   not  go  into  the  Government-sponsored  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-run  University of  Malaya,  you  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect them to look upon this Government with  much\r\n\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only touch of imagination is in paragraph 42.\r\n\r\nNo  one  has  yet  raised the cry over  handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren  and the mentally deficient,  and  to  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  Government must go  the  credit  for\r\n\r\nhaving  taken  the  field first  in  looking  after\r\n\r\nmentally  deficient children.  I  have  a  sneaking\r\n\r\nsuspicion  that it may be the past  career  of  the\r\n\r\nOrganising Secretary of the Labour Front,  one  Mr\r\n\r\nde  Cruz, who  is  a  fully qualified  teacher  of\r\n\r\nmentally   deficient  children,  and  perhaps   his\r\n\r\nexperience  since then with Labour  Front  workers,\r\n\r\nthat has inspired this imaginative social work. But\r\n\r\nwe  give  them full credit for this. We  hope  that\r\n\r\nthis  school for the blind, for the deaf and  dumb,\r\n\r\nwill  perform  the very important task  of  looking\r\n\r\nafter the less fortunate in society. The only thing\r\n\r\nthat is missing is a Dr Barnado's home, and I hope\r\n\r\nin  the  next  Governor's Address that  some  other\r\n\r\nsource  of  inspiration in the  Labour  Front  will\r\n\r\nraise the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now go on to paragraph 42 to talk about minimum living standards and -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I was  commenting  on\r\n\r\nthe   fact  that  paragraphs  43  to  45  were  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of the Ministry of Labour and  Welfare\r\n\r\nbut not wishing to make my comments on this Address\r\n\r\nmore disjointed than it need be, it might be better\r\n\r\nif  we  go on to a later part of this Address where\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education states his  policy  for\r\n\r\nthe  coming year. In paragraphs 54, 55, 56 and  57,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education continues its  statement\r\n\r\non  education  policy. Mr Speaker, Sir,  there  is\r\n\r\nvery  little  in  this  enunciation  of  Government\r\n\r\npolicy  other  than the reiteration  of  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  and the fact that according to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education the White Paper differs only slightly\r\n\r\nfrom  the All-Party Report. It is necessary for  my\r\n\r\nParty  to  restate our stand. There have been  some\r\n\r\nnot  disinterested  comments in the  English  Press\r\n\r\nabout  an  alleged  change of my Party's  stand  on\r\n\r\neducation policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an absence of imagination in this part\r\n\r\nof  the  Report. We have the statement that English\r\n\r\nis  necessary  for trade demands  and  so  on,  but\r\n\r\nnowhere  does  it  reflect the changing  trends  in\r\n\r\nAsia.  Nowhere is there any acknowledgment  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that in the years to come, the Malay language\r\n\r\nwill  be the language of the country and that  this\r\n\r\nchange in trends in Malaya and in the rest of  Asia\r\n\r\nshould be reflected in the education policy. In our\r\n\r\nstatement on education and culture, we said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The education policy of the Government of\r\n\r\nSingapore does not reflect the position of Malay as\r\n\r\nthe common national language of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Party believes that not only must Malay\r\n\r\neducation  in  this  country  be  developed  beyond\r\n\r\nprimary  school level as soon as possible but  that\r\n\r\nit  should also enjoy undisputed priority over  any\r\n\r\nother language as the compulsory second language to\r\n\r\nbe  taught in all schools, be they English, Chinese\r\n\r\nor  Indian  schools. We support the  cause  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Education  Council for more Malay  secondary\r\n\r\nschools and with the Council's demand that  in  the\r\n\r\nMalay  secondary  school,  Malay  and  not  English\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  medium of  instruction  and  that\r\n\r\nEnglish   should  only  be  treated  as  a   second\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Party believes that a free and democratic\r\n\r\nMalaya  will  give full and disinterested  aid  and\r\n\r\nencouragement to the full growth and development of\r\n\r\nMalay,  Chinese, English and Indian schools  whilst\r\n\r\ndeveloping Malay as the common national language of\r\n\r\nthe various communities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know the excuses\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  advanced  by  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation that there are not enough Malay  language\r\n\r\nteachers  and  that therefore it is  impossible  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the All-Party Report on Education,  that\r\n\r\nthere should be a free choice of a second language,\r\n\r\nand  a  free  choice of a third language.  In  that\r\n\r\nparticular   All-Party  Report,   we   accommodated\r\n\r\nourselves to reach unanimity of views. We wanted to\r\n\r\ngo much further together with the representative of\r\n\r\nthe United Malay National Organisation to state  in\r\n\r\nclear  and categorical terms that Malay should  and\r\n\r\nmust be the predominant language in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use trying to escape historic trends in\r\n\r\nAsia. Nowhere in Asia was the English language more\r\n\r\ncarefully nurtured and infused into an Asian people\r\n\r\nthan  in Ceylon. Those of us who stopped in  Ceylon\r\n\r\nrecently  on  our  way to London  for  the  Merdeka\r\n\r\nConference had the opportunity of seeing a  set  of\r\n\r\ncompletely  English-speaking  and  English-educated\r\n\r\npeople  ruling the country. Yet they have found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to yield to an historic tide of  history.\r\n\r\nThere, a people completely led and administered  by\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated Singhalese and Tamils have decided\r\n\r\nby  free  franchise that English is  not  their  national language and that in another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwelve  years  they  hope to  make  Singhalese  the\r\n\r\nnational  language. This trend is  irreversible  in\r\n\r\nAsia. We the English-educated in this country are a\r\n\r\npassing  generation.  The  generation  that  is  to\r\n\r\nfollow us will be shaped by the education policy of\r\n\r\nthe   present  Government  both  here  and  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. It is for the Government  to\r\n\r\nlead  or  control these trends. It is a matter  for\r\n\r\nwhich they must answer in the next elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that we are against Government\r\n\r\ncontrols in vernacular schools in this country. Let\r\n\r\nme   read  the  Party  statement  on  education  in\r\n\r\nvernacular schools:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The P.A.P. believes that there must be only one\r\n\r\neducational  authority  in  the  country  and  that\r\n\r\nauthority is the government of that country through\r\n\r\nits popularly elected representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that steps can and should be taken now\r\n\r\ntowards integrating the Chinese, Malay, Indian  and\r\n\r\nEnglish   schools   under  a   single   educational\r\n\r\nauthority  and  within the framework  of  a  single\r\n\r\neducational    policy   orientated   towards    the\r\n\r\nachievement of a free and democratic Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the conditions attached to grants-in-aid,\r\n\r\nthe  present  laws relating to the registration  of\r\n\r\nschools  and teachers, are liable to abuse  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  either  the Registrar or  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary in the Education Ministry. They can  also\r\n\r\nmake  for  abitrary meddling and interference  with\r\n\r\nthe  formulation  of curricula  and  timetables  in\r\n\r\nvernacular schools which accept Government aid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We stated in the All-Party Report on Education that\r\n\r\nthis  suspicion was deep-rooted, that it was  there\r\n\r\nand  that  it,  was  the result  of  years  of  bad\r\n\r\nhandling by previous governments. It is useless the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education saying, \"This is all  over.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,   we  are  now  an  elected   Government\r\n\r\nresponsible to the people and you should trust us.\"\r\n\r\nWe   are  not  saying  that  there  should  be   no\r\n\r\nconditions in grants-in-aid. What we do say is that\r\n\r\nsome  of  these conditions have aroused antagonism,\r\n\r\nand  particularly  a fear that  acceptance  of  aid\r\n\r\nwould   mean   interference  with  timetables   and\r\n\r\nlanguage teaching. There is nothing in this  policy\r\n\r\nstatement which gives us an indication of  what  is\r\n\r\nto  be  in the new grant code. All we have is  this\r\n\r\npious  principle  with which no one  can  disagree:\r\n\r\nfirstly, that they must turn out children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose  loyalty  will be to this  country;  secondly\r\n\r\nthat  the grants should be wisely used and properly\r\n\r\naccounted  for.  We  have  no  quarrel  with  those\r\n\r\nprinciples.  But what are the terms and  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich the Minister for Education has worked out  to\r\n\r\nensure  that these two conditions are obeyed?  That\r\n\r\nis an entirely different matter. I hope that in the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  this debate, the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwill state his policy with regard to grants-in-aid.\r\n\r\nIt  would be optimistic in the extreme to hope that\r\n\r\nwhatever  it is, there will not be some  opposition\r\n\r\nto it, particularly in view of the statement of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education that the policy is now, full\r\n\r\naid  with conditions, or no aid at all. But  before\r\n\r\nwe criticize this policy let us know what are those\r\n\r\nconditions  which he and his Ministry have  decided\r\n\r\nto impose as conditions to grant-in-aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go back now to paragraphs 43, 44, 45 and 46 on\r\n\r\nlabour  and  social welfare. These four  paragraphs\r\n\r\nare distinguished by a lot of pious pontifications.\r\n\r\nAll these soothing words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Government intends to formulate and present to\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly schemes for ensuring that  the  first\r\n\r\nsteps  towards social security and relief  for  the\r\n\r\nhardships of the unemployed are taken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  is there any doubt at all, whatever the Report\r\n\r\nof  the Minimum Living Standards Committee may  be,\r\n\r\nthat the present rate of unemployment relief is too\r\n\r\nlow and that the Government could safely step these\r\n\r\nunemployment  assistance rates much higher  without\r\n\r\nany  danger  of being accused of being overgenerous\r\n\r\nwith public funds? On this question of unemployment\r\n\r\nitself, the policy states - I think this is where the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister found enthusiastic support\r\n\r\nfrom the leader of the Liberal-Socialist Party:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In the field of economic production the\r\n\r\nGovernment  considers  that employers  and  workers\r\n\r\nmust  recognise the need for cooperation  in  their\r\n\r\njoint    task   of   service   to   the    national\r\n\r\nprosperity....\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>An so on and so on, blah, blah, blah -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It must be realised that plans for relief of\r\n\r\nunemployment  and for creation of  new  industries\r\n\r\ncan be frustrated by  unnecessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstoppages, which reduce production or even halt  it\r\n\r\nforever, thus throwing workers into the miseries of\r\n\r\nunemployment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is fair to say that paragraph 46 does nor go as\r\n\r\nfar  as what the Liberal-Socialist Party have  been\r\n\r\nsaying  of  late; namely, that because  of  strikes\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  unemployment.

Only by freeing ourselves\r\n\r\nfrom  the  grip  of  a colonial  economy  with  its\r\n\r\ncomplete  dependence on the fluctuations  of  world\r\n\r\nmarkets, will it be possible for us to organise our\r\n\r\nlabour and resources, to increase our wealth and to\r\n\r\ntackle the problems of unemployment effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political and economic causes of\r\n\r\nunemployment, the elementary facts, that under  the\r\n\r\ncolonial system the people of this country have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol  or  direction of their economic destinies,\r\n\r\nare  deliberately overlooked by those who  seek  to\r\n\r\nhide the real causes of our economic difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we realise the problem of unemployment\r\n\r\ncannot be completely solved until we get rid of the\r\n\r\npresent  colonial economic system  which  restricts\r\n\r\nour  trade  and our industries in the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe colonial power, we believe that some action can\r\n\r\nand  should  be  taken  to lessen  the  effects  of\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, before any government can work on this\r\n\r\nproblem,  it  must  have accurate  information  and\r\n\r\nstatistics  on  the extent of unemployment  in  the\r\n\r\ncolony  and  we  therefore urge the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  a  proper  survey  of  the  extent   of\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we believe that if society is unable to\r\n\r\nprovide  employment for those willing and  able  to\r\n\r\nwork, it must give and provide them with a means to\r\n\r\nexist at a decent human level.

One forgets the wider historical aspects of\r\n\r\nthe  economy  of this country. Does  any  one  here\r\n\r\ndispute   that  we  have  been  a  base   for   raw\r\n\r\nmaterials - cheap labour, cheap raw materials,  cheap\r\n\r\nrubber, cheap tin - and that is why we have not  been\r\n\r\nindustrialised, that is why it is in the  interests\r\n\r\nof  big companies to invest in plantations and  not\r\n\r\nin factories? Every tyre, tube, or rubber sole that\r\n\r\nwe need to use, we import from Britain and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we are tied up with this capitalist\r\n\r\neconomy  and  as  long as this  capitalist  economy\r\n\r\nundergoes  periodic trade depressions, whatever  we\r\n\r\ncan  do  here  cannot buffer ourselves against  the\r\n\r\neffect  of  these  world  economic  cycles.  It  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that before the problem can be tackled  we\r\n\r\nmust  first have control of our economic destinies.\r\n\r\nWe  must  be  masters in our own  homes.  In  every\r\n\r\ncountry  in  South-East Asia that has emerged  from\r\n\r\ncolonialism - India,   Burma,  Pakistan,   Indonesia,\r\n\r\nCeylon -  the problem of rapid industrialisation  is\r\n\r\nthe  first one they have to face because they  have\r\n\r\npreviously    been    colonial   territories    for\r\n\r\ninvestments for raw materials. To equip  themselves\r\n\r\nfor  modern  economic production,  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nemployment  and  the standards of living  that  the\r\n\r\npeople desire, rapid industrialisation is the  only\r\n\r\nanswer.  We face that same problem. But  we  cannot\r\n\r\nhope to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolve  that  problem  just  by  being  polite   and\r\n\r\nfriendly  to foreign capital. Foreign capital  will\r\n\r\nnot  come to Asia because they feel that Asia  does\r\n\r\nnot   provide   the   incentives  to   capital - high\r\n\r\ndividends. There is still Africa where there  is  a\r\n\r\ncertainty  of  going on for some twenty  or  thirty\r\n\r\nyears  before the Africans in that continent  catch\r\n\r\nup  with European imperialists. In Malaya today  it\r\n\r\nis  not because we have militant trade unions  that\r\n\r\nAustralian  investors do not  want  to  build  more\r\n\r\nfactories. It is because they understand that there\r\n\r\nis  a  revolution in Asia. That implies two things.\r\n\r\nOne, they work under certain limitations as to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of profits they can rake out of the country\r\n\r\nquickly.  Two, however much they may make  for  the\r\n\r\npresent, they will soon face a time when a  country\r\n\r\nhaving  assumed control of its own economic destiny\r\n\r\nwishes  to assert itself. It has happened all  over\r\n\r\nSouthEast  Asia.  It  is happening  even  in  India\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time when we were in London, we were\r\n\r\nregaled on several occasions by British people  who\r\n\r\nhad  large  interests in this  country.  The  first\r\n\r\nthing they wanted to know about the P.A.P. was  not\r\n\r\nwhether  we  were  Communists or non-Communists  or\r\n\r\nanti-Communists: \"Tell me what are you going to  do\r\n\r\nto  our  capital, to our factories?\" So  I  blandly\r\n\r\nlooked at them, having had a magnificent repast and\r\n\r\nsaid, \"We shall do exactly what India has done.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not want to expropriate you. We do not want  to\r\n\r\nact  illegally,  or act against the  principles  of\r\n\r\ngood  conduct which all nations in this world  wish\r\n\r\nto  observe. We shall allow you to carry on so long\r\n\r\nas  it  is  in our interest.\" They said, \"Yes,  but\r\n\r\nthat is exactly the trouble you see, Lee. In India,\r\n\r\nthey are demanding more and more directorships  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  taking over our companies.\" That  is  an\r\n\r\ninevitable  process  but  it  is  a  process  which\r\n\r\nEuropean   capitalists  find   difficult   to   get\r\n\r\nreconciled to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways to carry out an\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme in Asia. One, you  work\r\n\r\nit  partly  by private enterprise with a calculated\r\n\r\nnational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy,  laying  down  terms  and  conditions  that\r\n\r\nforeign  enterprise should employ or train  locally\r\n\r\nat  least 50 per cent of their managerial staff and\r\n\r\n50  per cent of their technical staff. Ceylon tried\r\n\r\nthis policy with their European business houses. Or\r\n\r\nlike   India  where  Indian  capitalists  go   into\r\n\r\npartnership with foreign capital. That is one  way.\r\n\r\nThe  second way is where, like in North Vietnam  or\r\n\r\nChina the State takes over the whole machinery. All\r\n\r\nthis  problem of capital accumulation and where  to\r\n\r\nget money for investment is then solved because the\r\n\r\nState  assumes  all the powers  that  it  wants  to\r\n\r\ncontrol the economic life of the country. Having  a\r\n\r\ncompletely different economic system the  State  is\r\n\r\nable to industrialise rapidly. We have not come  to\r\n\r\nthat  point where we have to decide how to  do  it.\r\n\r\nWhether we follow the Indian way or the Chinese way\r\n\r\nis  not  as  yet  in dispute. Until  we  are  free,\r\n\r\nwhether we are going to have a capitalist Malaya or\r\n\r\na  socialist Malaya is a purely academic question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fallacy to suggest that because there\r\n\r\nhave  been  strikes, because unions  are  militant,\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  have this lack of industrialisation.\r\n\r\nForeign capital does not want to come in for  other\r\n\r\npolitical   reasons.  We  have  this   problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment and we have to find some solution.  We\r\n\r\ncannot find a complete solution until we are  free.\r\n\r\nBut until we are free, let us try and alleviate  it\r\n\r\nbefore it becomes too acute and produces unpleasant\r\n\r\npolitical consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

What is new? A lot  of  pious\r\n\r\nplatitudes! Here are some specific problems which I\r\n\r\nthink the Government can do something about:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"1. The revision of the Trade Disputes Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeal of the English Act on which our Trade\r\n\r\nDisputes  Ordinance is based as one  of  the  first\r\n\r\nlegislative   acts  of  the  new   British   Labour\r\n\r\nGovernment in 1945 was a victorious culmination  of\r\n\r\nnearly  two  decades of agitation by British  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement.

The Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance was left alone when the old Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance was revised and replaced last year. Under\r\n\r\nthe    present   Ordinance,   workers    who    are\r\n\r\nincapacitated  over  any  period  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nindustrial injuries do not receive their  wages  in\r\n\r\nfull   for  their  period  of  absence.  Rates   of\r\n\r\ncompensation for permanent and partial  disablement\r\n\r\narising   out  of  industrial  injuries  are   also\r\n\r\ninadequate.  The Party shall strive to  revise  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance\r\n\r\nto make it more just.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is within the province of this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"3. The Revision of the Labour Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the provisions of the Labour Ordinance\r\n\r\nparticularly those relating to payment  for  annual\r\n\r\nleave  and  overtime payments have  given  rise  to\r\n\r\ndisputes and must be clarified.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Labour will remember that when  we\r\n\r\ndecided  to  provide annual leave  for  seven  days\r\n\r\ninstead  of one week, his intention then  was  that\r\n\r\nannual  leave should be paid at the rate  of  seven\r\n\r\ntimes the daily rate. Unfortunately, many employers\r\n\r\nhave  taken \"seven days' annual leave\" to mean  one\r\n\r\nweek's  annual  leave, which means the  daily  rate\r\n\r\ntimes five and a half. He knows of one dispute with\r\n\r\na  transport  company which I had to refer  to  his\r\n\r\ndepartment.  Fortunately, this  particular  company\r\n\r\ndecided to accept the interpretation placed on this\r\n\r\nsection  by  the  Labour Ministry. There  are  many\r\n\r\nother  companies  not  quite so  helpful  in  their\r\n\r\nattitude. Rather than have this matter litigated in\r\n\r\nthe  courts one day, the section concerning  annual\r\n\r\nleave  could be clarified so that there is no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  what is intended by the Legislature is  seven\r\n\r\ntimes the daily rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the purpose of the reduction of the\r\n\r\nworking week from 48 hours to 44 hours was to  give\r\n\r\ngreater leisure to workers. It is not intended that\r\n\r\nemployers  could reduce the total weekly emoluments\r\n\r\nof  workers. Some employers however have abused the\r\n\r\nspirit of the Labour Ordinance and have reduced the\r\n\r\ntotal  weekly  emoluments of their  employees.  The\r\n\r\ntrue  purpose  and spirit of the reduction  of  the\r\n\r\nworking week must be respected by the employers. We\r\n\r\nhad  a long debate on this matter when the Bill was\r\n\r\nin  Select Committee. We decided then to leave this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the wage adjustment when the  working\r\n\r\nweek  was  reduced from 48 hours to 44 hours  to  a\r\n\r\nfree   play   between  union  and  management.   We\r\n\r\nenvisaged  then  that there would  be  difficulties\r\n\r\nwith  some employers who may want to pay, 44  times\r\n\r\nthe  hourly  rate  instead of 48 times  the  hourly\r\n\r\nrate.  We  envisaged also that there  may  be  many\r\n\r\nunions who want to get 48 times the hourly rate for\r\n\r\nworking  44  hours.  But the  Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\nadvanced this argument that certain industries  may\r\n\r\nbe  borderline, that, economically, from the  terms\r\n\r\nof   efficiency,  they  are  on  the  margin.  That\r\n\r\ntherefore  there  should  be  room  for  adjustment\r\n\r\nbetween union and employer. In the last few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths,  this has given rise to a great  number  of\r\n\r\ndisputes. This was the issue which started the Fred\r\n\r\nWaterhouse  Union dispute with the Fred  Waterhouse\r\n\r\nCompany.  One  sunny day a few  months  after  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance was put into force, the employer  reduced\r\n\r\nwages.  The reduced hourly rate times 44 plus  time\r\n\r\nand  a half for overtime to meet the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance would in fact give  the  workers  a\r\n\r\nlittle more. When the workers discovered that  this\r\n\r\nwas  not  stipulated for in the Ordinance, a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of friction arose between the employer and the\r\n\r\nunion  which led to the company sacking  the  union\r\n\r\nPresident, which led to the union going  on  strike\r\n\r\nto support their President and which finally led to\r\n\r\na  great number of hours wasted by the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour. All this needs to be reviewed. It might  be\r\n\r\nwiser  on  the part of the Government  to  have  it\r\n\r\nclearly laid down that where the hourly rate cannot\r\n\r\nbe  agreed  between management and labour,  then  a\r\n\r\nformula  must be applied. It should not  be  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  of his Government officials  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour Ministry to work out a formula to provide  a\r\n\r\nready-made  solution  where  worker  and   employer\r\n\r\ncannot  agree on the adjustment. If we do not  have\r\n\r\nthis ready-made solution ready for them in case  of\r\n\r\ndisagreement, we will have many more  strikes  over\r\n\r\nthis  issue of the reduction of the 48- to the  44-hour working week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The right of trade unions to collect political\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This right has already been accorded to workers\r\n\r\nin the Federation. The Hon. the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nwill  remember  that in the first  debate  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly - those were buoyant days - he  said  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  in  the  near future accord  this  right  to\r\n\r\nworkers  in this territory. Since then, of  course,\r\n\r\nmuch water has flowed under the bridge. More unions\r\n\r\nhave  popped  up, more members have  defeated  from\r\n\r\nsome  unions and joined other unions, and  so  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of political funds for a union  has  been\r\n\r\nconveniently  forgotten. We say that  whatever  the\r\n\r\ninclinations of unions, they should have the  right\r\n\r\nto have a political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfund  for  political action and  we  look  to  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  implement this  in  this  caretaker\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The subject of the workers in the Armed\r\n\r\nServices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an ad-hoc arrangement whereby every\r\n\r\ntime  legislation was passed which affected workers\r\n\r\ngenerally, the Armed Services were consulted.  They\r\n\r\nthen decide either to abide or not to abide by  the\r\n\r\nnew legislation. This is an unsatisfactory state of\r\n\r\naffairs  and  the position must be regularised.  We\r\n\r\ncannot have large sectors of our working population\r\n\r\noutside   the  legislative  jurisdiction   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore. This position  should  be\r\n\r\nsettled  with  the British Government  particularly\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Defence Treaty between the  Federation\r\n\r\nand  the British Government is signed. We must have\r\n\r\nthis question of our right to fix minimum standards\r\n\r\nof  employment for all our workers respected by the\r\n\r\nBritish Armed Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From labour relations, the Address with\r\n\r\nappropriateness goes on to Malayanisation. This  is\r\n\r\nthe height of understatement. Paragraph 47 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Detailed study of the report of the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission is now, far advanced  and\r\n\r\nwill  soon  be completed. The Government will  then\r\n\r\n(on  some date in the indefinite future) publish  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  for the phased replacement of expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers by Malayans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Here  was a hotly debated and controversial Report.\r\n\r\nFor  months the discussion of the Commission  raged\r\n\r\nin  the  Press.  For months we had the  expatriates\r\n\r\ncowering in the corners of their offices and  under\r\n\r\ntheir  desks, as one by one their dirty  linen  was\r\n\r\nbrought  up  for the public view. The  ex-Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister said in one of those moments when he\r\n\r\nwas  provoked,  that he had absolute confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of the Malayanisation Commission.  I\r\n\r\nhad  indicated  to him then that the  Chairman  had\r\n\r\nvery  strong views on these matters, but  he  said,\r\n\r\n\"We  have  the  most  absolute  confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nChairman.  Let  us  wait for the Report.\"  Well  we\r\n\r\nhave. We have had the Report for five months. Those\r\n\r\nof  us who went to London know the real reason  why\r\n\r\nthe  thing  was  not tabled and discussed.  It  was\r\n\r\nbecause  Members on the Government side  wanted  to\r\n\r\nuse that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas   a   lever.  In  the  middle  of  the   Merdeka\r\n\r\nconference,  the  then  Chief  Minister  said,  \"We\r\n\r\naccept  the report for the first year since we  are\r\n\r\nonly  going  to be a Government for one  year  till\r\n\r\nApril 1957, when there will be fresh elections.\" So\r\n\r\nhe  hedged  on  this question of the Malayanisation\r\n\r\nprogramme.  That  was a fairly logical  stand.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  is  all  this  blabber here  about  fair  and\r\n\r\nreasonable   compensation,   needs   for    keeping\r\n\r\nefficiency, adequate supply of qualified  Malayans?\r\n\r\nWhat we want to know right here and now is what  is\r\n\r\nthe   Government's  stand  on  the   Malayanisation\r\n\r\nReport?  Does it accept the majority recommendation\r\n\r\nor  does  it not? If it does not, why not?  Let  us\r\n\r\nhave  a  debate on it. We all know - it is  an  open\r\n\r\nsecret - that  some fantastic claims for compensation\r\n\r\nare  being  staked by expatriates as the price  for\r\n\r\nabolition. That is one of those things referred  to\r\n\r\neuphemistically in the Address as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Negotiations with the Staff Associations are in\r\n\r\nprogress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let me say on behalf of my Party, and I think other\r\n\r\npeople in this House not belonging to my Party will\r\n\r\nagree  with this, that the funds of the public  and\r\n\r\nof   the   Government  are  not  largesse   to   be\r\n\r\ndistributed to a few European officials. Before any\r\n\r\nagreement is reached with them, there should  be  a\r\n\r\nfull  and  frank debate. Let us have all the  dirty\r\n\r\nlinen washed in public, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, with even more appropriateness, after\r\n\r\ndiscussing   this   question   of   Malayanisation,\r\n\r\nparagraph  50  goes on to talk about gangsters  and\r\n\r\ngansterism. Yes, we all endorse the desire of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment    to   stamp   out   armed    thuggery,\r\n\r\nintimidation,  extortion and all unlawful  pursuits\r\n\r\norganised  by  unlawful  gangs.  But,  here  again,\r\n\r\nalthough  boys' clubs can help, one can never  hope\r\n\r\nto  tackle  this  problem unless  one  tackles  the\r\n\r\nquestion    of    education    and     employment\r\n\r\nopportunities.  As  long as  you  have  people  who\r\n\r\ncannot  get  education and who cannot  get  gainful\r\n\r\nemployment, then you have to face this  problem  of\r\n\r\nhoodlumism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From gangsters we go on to Singapore Battalion in\r\n\r\nparagraph  51.  There is an air of unreality  about\r\n\r\nthis paragraph which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As Singapore moves towards complete self-government and national status, the need to\r\n\r\nmaintain its own armed forces becomes more  urgent.\r\n\r\nRecruitment for the new Regular Battalion will open\r\n\r\nshortly  and it is hoped that all sections  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity will support the new Battalion ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If   it  had  said,  \"As  Singapore  moves  towards\r\n\r\ncomplete  self-government, the need to maintain  an\r\n\r\narmy to help the police to defend our rights . . .\"\r\n\r\nthat makes sense. We are going to have a battalion.\r\n\r\nWhom  are  we  to fight against? Who  is  going  to\r\n\r\nchallenge  us?  Do we expect to fight  the  Siamese\r\n\r\narmed forces? Or the armed forces of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my knowledge, this idea of a battalion grew up\r\n\r\nin  the  most curious fashion. We were then arguing\r\n\r\nwith  the  Secretary of State for the Colonies.  We\r\n\r\ntold  the then Chief Minister, \"Why do you want  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  you  want to give all  these  things  to\r\n\r\nBritain: `You will look after my defence; you  will\r\n\r\nlook  after my foreign affairs?' \" But he said, \"Ah,\r\n\r\nI  am  not  Oliver Twist. I will give it all  away,\r\n\r\nwhatever  I want to give away.\" Well, having  given\r\n\r\nit  all away, Mr Lennox-Boyd then turned round and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Well, you want my troops to defend you.  If\r\n\r\nyou  want my troops to defend you, then I must have\r\n\r\nthe  final  say in the Defence Council\", which  was\r\n\r\nlogically  an  impregnable  position.  Not  to   be\r\n\r\ndefeated  by  logic, the then Chief  Minister  that\r\n\r\nnight summoned the Merdeka delegation and said, \"We\r\n\r\nwill  have  a Singapore Battalion. Then we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to have British troops.\" We said to him, \"You\r\n\r\nare  not  seriously  suggesting  that  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nBattalion  will man the Naval Base,  Blakang  Mati,\r\n\r\nall  the airfields, and so on?\" He said, \"No, never\r\n\r\nmind,  we will sign a treaty with Nepal for  Gurkha\r\n\r\ntroops.  Then  we  will not need  to  have  British\r\n\r\ntroops.\"  We were all too aghast for words.  So  we\r\n\r\ntold him that it had better not be put forward as a\r\n\r\nserious  proposition. But, it was put forward.  The\r\n\r\nresult  is that now we have the Singapore Battalion\r\n\r\nin the Governor's Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want a battalion just to be a reserve for\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Police Force, then let it  be  clear\r\n\r\nthat  this  is a small battalion meant for  certain\r\n\r\nspecific\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndomestic purposes and not meant for war.

If  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have  one battalion in case  the  Police\r\n\r\nForce  finds it a bit difficult, and two riot  vans\r\n\r\nnot enough, let us put this thing into perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we should get this whole Address\r\n\r\ninto perspective. What are we talking about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Let\r\n\r\nus  get  down to realities, to the basic  political\r\n\r\nposition  in Malaya and in Singapore. I  have  said\r\n\r\nthis  before, on many an occasion, but perhaps then\r\n\r\nI  was  not believed. The battle for Malaya is  the\r\n\r\nbattle  in  the Federation. Singapore is  a  little\r\n\r\nlaboratory  where  the  British,  Nationalists  and\r\n\r\nCommunists  try  out  their  tactics  so  that   if\r\n\r\nanything  goes  wrong, there is an explosion  on  a\r\n\r\nlaboratory  scale. The fight is in the  Federation.\r\n\r\nMy  Party has been criticised this morning  by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  of  Singapore  for,  so  he  says,\r\n\r\nattacking the Federation Government. Sir, my  Party\r\n\r\ndid  not set out to do so. No one who reads,  as  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing  has read, the statement, can say  that  we\r\n\r\nhave   set  out  to  queer  the  position  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  or the  Alliance.  We  have\r\n\r\nsought to present our analysis of the position\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Malaya  and Singapore as it is today.  A  great\r\n\r\nnumber  of things have happened since the elections\r\n\r\nin  Singapore last April and in the Federation last\r\n\r\nAugust  and  it is necessary to take stock  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation. We have propounded our analysis in  very\r\n\r\ncareful  terms.  Of course, some people  have  just\r\n\r\nread Press extracts with exaggerated headlines  and\r\n\r\nhave  come  to the conclusion that the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nlashed out at the Alliance and we were told to mind\r\n\r\nour  own  business in Singapore. Sir, when Alliance\r\n\r\nMinisters come down to Singapore and lash the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, we have never had the  impudence  or\r\n\r\nimpertinence  to  tell Alliance Ministers  to  mind\r\n\r\ntheir  own  business.  This is  our  business,  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of Singapore and the Federation.  You  can\r\n\r\nin  legal  fiction divorce the two territories.  In\r\n\r\npolitical  fact you cannot cut the two  territories\r\n\r\napart.  There  will be more trouble  with  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  apart than if they were combined  into\r\n\r\none.   Politicians  often  wish  to  avoid   saying\r\n\r\nanything which is inexpedient and which will invoke\r\n\r\npopular  emotional protest. But  unless  we  resist\r\n\r\nthis  tendency, we find ourselves watered  down  to\r\n\r\nweak and feeble statements. In this analysis - and  I\r\n\r\npropose to read passages of the analysis to put the\r\n\r\npicture  into  perspective - we have stated  what  we\r\n\r\nthink  is the position today. Nobody has taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to read it and having read it, to disprove\r\n\r\nthis  thesis. We started with the present situation\r\n\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is nearly two years since our Party was\r\n\r\nformed in November 1954. We stated in our Manifesto\r\n\r\nthen  the  long-term objectives of the  Party, the\r\n\r\nfight  to end colonial domination, and the creation\r\n\r\nof  an  independent, democratic Malaya, of a united\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Singapore,  in  which  the   great\r\n\r\ndifferences  of wealth and opportunity between  our\r\n\r\npeoples  would be reduced and gradually  eliminated\r\n\r\nby constitutional means, and a happy and prosperous\r\n\r\nsociety established - [lnterruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I wish I could make this analysis more entertaining\r\n\r\nbut I regret that the situation as we see it is far\r\n\r\nfrom entertaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At that time, the political situation in Malaya\r\n\r\nwas quite simple and clear to the people of Malaya.\r\n\r\nThe British were in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblatant  and  open control of the country.  In  the\r\n\r\nFederation, they had a wholly nominated Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil with a few weak local men as \"Members\"  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government.   In   Singapore   they   had   a\r\n\r\ntransparently farcical Legislative Council of  less\r\n\r\nthan  one  half  \"elected\" Councillors.  Government\r\n\r\npolicy and its execution were all in British hands.\r\n\r\nThe   people  were  discontented.  They  could  see\r\n\r\nclearly that economic and social difficulties  were\r\n\r\ncaused  by foreign domination and exploitation.  So\r\n\r\nthe  cry  of  \"Merdeka\" rallied all,  both  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation and Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will dispute that that was, in fact, the\r\n\r\ntruth.  Then we go on to say that colonial  control\r\n\r\nis  now concealed and great umbrage has been  taken\r\n\r\nby some people to this. But nobody denies that even\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  has not as yet got  Merdeka.  They\r\n\r\nhave  a promise of it in August 1957. And we go  on\r\n\r\nto analyse the position at present:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Malayan situation confused. An independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Malaya  comprising a united  Federation\r\n\r\nand  Singapore, appears further away today than  it\r\n\r\ndid before the elections. Many things have happened\r\n\r\nsince  April  1955: labour discontent and  strikes.\r\n\r\nstudent  discontent and unrest in Chinese  schools,\r\n\r\nthe  inconclusive  Baling  talks,  the  promise  of\r\n\r\nfreedom  for  the Federation alone by August  1957,\r\n\r\nthe    failure    of   Singapore's   constitutional\r\n\r\nconference and a lack of united action by Singapore\r\n\r\npolitical Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it was the British who wanted to keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation politically separate.\r\n\r\nToday  there  are among the Alliance leaders  those\r\n\r\nwho  do  not want Singapore to join the Federation.\r\n\r\nOther   leaders  have  even  said   to   the   Reid\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Commission that they  do  not  want\r\n\r\nMerdeka unless they first get jus soli rights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  have been reading all this in the Press.  These\r\n\r\nare  statements of facts. All kinds of people  have\r\n\r\ngone  before  the Reid Commission.  The  Singhalese\r\n\r\nfrom  Malacca  said  that  they  wanted  to  remain\r\n\r\nBritish subjects and be citizens of the Federation.\r\n\r\nLeaders of Chinese guilds have gone before the Reid\r\n\r\nCommission and said, \"Unless we get jus soli, we do\r\n\r\nnot  want  Merdeka.\" Last year, there was  talk  of\r\n\r\namnesty  for  the Communists and peace  in  Malaya.\r\n\r\nNow,  there is talk of surrender of Communists  and\r\n\r\nthe  need  for expanding the Malayan army  to  take\r\n\r\nover   from   the  British  the  war  against   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  It  is no wonder that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya find the situation confusing. And so we went\r\n\r\non  to  explain  why  we say  that  the  trends  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in  the Federation are dangerous. We have  not\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  is the intention of  any  political\r\n\r\nParty or any government to cause this racial strife\r\n\r\nbut   the  policies  that  are  at  present   being\r\n\r\nimplemented give reason for the greatest  disquiet.\r\n\r\nCan  any  one deny that unrest amongst the  workers\r\n\r\nand  squatters is not being traced to its  economic\r\n\r\nand  social roots in the Federation and instead all\r\n\r\nblame for strikes and discontent is placed upon the shoulders of Communist agitators and troublemakers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Instead of solving the economic problems which\r\n\r\ncause  the  discontent,  a solution  is  sought  in\r\n\r\nmilitary  weapons, in the building  up  of  a  $500\r\n\r\nmillion  army and in intensifying the  war  against\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. It is becoming increasingly  clear\r\n\r\nthat   the  army  and  the  gendarmerie   will   be\r\n\r\npredominantly if not wholly Malay. And  that  these\r\n\r\nMalay  forces  will be used to police predominantly\r\n\r\nChinese squatters and workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of racial friction and conflict\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Malays and the Chinese  are, already\r\n\r\npresent  and  if  the  Alliance  Government  drifts\r\n\r\nfurther  along  the  road of repression  of  social\r\n\r\nunrest  by  armed forces, it will mean, in  effect,\r\n\r\nmore  Malay police, special constables and soldiers\r\n\r\nagainst Chinese squatters and workers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the first to say this, in fact,\r\n\r\nseveral  Alliance leaders have raised  the  warning\r\n\r\nagainst  racial  war  in the Federation.  We  fully\r\n\r\nadmit  that  it is their intention to prevent  any\r\n\r\nsuch  thing from happening. In a democratic  State,\r\n\r\nwe  reserve  the right to give our views  of  where\r\n\r\ntheir  policy is leading them - a policy not designed\r\n\r\nto  bring  about  this racial friction  and  racial\r\n\r\nstrife but which unless checked will tend to' bring\r\n\r\nit about. The first hallmark of a democratic State,\r\n\r\nif  we are to run a democratic State in Malaya,  is\r\n\r\ntolerance   of   criticism  from  other   political\r\n\r\nParties. If we are wrong in our thesis, let  it  be\r\n\r\ndisproved.  We took this stand and we are ready  to\r\n\r\nbe  criticised and to be proved wrong.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nhelpful  to say that we are just seeking  to  cause\r\n\r\ntrouble, that we should not interfere and that,  in\r\n\r\nfact, we are a lot of mischief makers. When we  say\r\n\r\nwhat  other people have said before and we say  it\r\n\r\nin moderate language, we have been denounced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of Singapore lies with the Federation.\r\n\r\nIt is no use trying to pretend that we could, if it\r\n\r\ncame to it, get on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout the Federation. It is no use the Federation\r\n\r\ntrying  to  pretend  that it can ignore  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore is the spark plug for all kinds of things\r\n\r\nthat  are happening in the Federation. As  long  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  is distinct and separate, the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment is faced with a situation in which, one,\r\n\r\nit  has  no  direct  control of  the  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and,  two, it has no means  to  prevent\r\n\r\nideas  from crossing over the Causeway  on  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  It  is no use telling workers  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  that they are unreasonable  and  stupid\r\n\r\nwhen,   in  fact,  they  see  that  militant  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  has brought about general wage  increases\r\n\r\nin Singapore. The only solution is to run these two\r\n\r\nterritories  as one unit so that one will  moderate\r\n\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another important issue like education I watch\r\n\r\nwith  fear the differences in emphasis in Singapore\r\n\r\nand   the  Federation:  a  Singapore  predominantly\r\n\r\nChinese  with  well organised Chinese students  and\r\n\r\ngiving  the bias on Chinese education; a Federation\r\n\r\nthat  gets  frightened that such a  policy  may  be\r\n\r\ntransported  across the Causeway and going  to  the\r\n\r\nother extreme of pressing its over-Malay emphasised\r\n\r\npolicy.  The  separation of these  two  territories\r\n\r\nwith  all the resultant biases as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nracial  composition  in the two territories  cannot\r\n\r\nbut  make  for difficulties both here  and  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Sooner or later I hope reason,  careful\r\n\r\nthinking  and  facing  of facts  will  bring  these\r\n\r\nterritories together. If it is emotion,  if  it  is\r\n\r\nappeals  to  the instinctive loyalties of  man,  to\r\n\r\nreligions  and race, then I do not see how  we  can\r\n\r\nhope  to  moderate  the  over-Chinese  emphasis  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  over-Malay  emphasis  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  The only chance of doing that  is  for\r\n\r\nboth   territories  to  face  the  facts   of   the\r\n\r\nsituation,  that they are parts of one  country  in\r\n\r\nthe  South-East Asian scene, that somehow or  other\r\n\r\nthey must find a modus vivendi to live and let live\r\n\r\nas one happy community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, we are preoccupied with the\r\n\r\nnext Merdeka talks. That is as far as we can go. We\r\n\r\nknow  that  beyond  that our  future  lies  with  a\r\n\r\nGreater  Malaya.  To think otherwise  would  be  to\r\n\r\nthink  in  terms  of  Port Swettenham  becoming  an\r\n\r\ninternational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nport,   of   Kuala  Lumpur  airport   becoming   an\r\n\r\ninternational airport and the consequent  diversion\r\n\r\nof  trade, of having all the business houses  moved\r\n\r\nup to Kuala Lumpur and of Singapore perishing as  a\r\n\r\nsecond  Malta  in  the  Far  East,  its  livelihood\r\n\r\ndependent on military bases on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately we are a long way yet from that\r\n\r\nirretrievable position. For the time being, we have\r\n\r\na certain definite task ahead and that is to reopen\r\n\r\nthe  Merdeka  talks.  I am glad  to  see  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government has the good sense to  pick  up\r\n\r\nwhere  the P.A.P. left off - complete internal  self-government. \r\n\r\nWhen we said that the last time, the ex-Chief Minister \r\n\r\nbecame very angry. I knew reporters\r\n\r\nwho were roundly rebuked for daring to suggest that\r\n\r\nit  was anything other than independence which  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to be achieved. For to suggest that we  were\r\n\r\nonly  fighting for internal self-government was  to\r\n\r\ndetract  from  the ex-Chief Minister's achievement.\r\n\r\nSir,  we tried to face the facts then as we saw  it\r\n\r\nand  tried to moderate the situation. That  was  as\r\n\r\nfar as we could go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, we are interested in seeing two\r\n\r\nsteps ahead; one, the next Merdeka conference; two,\r\n\r\nthe  step beyond that. What is there in the present\r\n\r\nsituation   that  will  make  the  next  conference\r\n\r\nsucceed  where  the last one has failed?  The  same\r\n\r\nParty  is  in power, the same Parties  are  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and the same people are waiting  to  be\r\n\r\nChief   Ministers.   The  position   is   basically\r\n\r\nunchanged - of  course, we all know that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi  (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) has since  broken\r\n\r\noff with old friends and colleagues on that side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Guess why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We all know that the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong Kapor (Mr Seah Peng Chuan) has had unhappy\r\n\r\ndifferences with Members on that side of the  House\r\n\r\nno  doubt  for good political reasons and questions\r\n\r\nof  principle,  and we all miss  the  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister about whose sojourn in Peking we are daily\r\n\r\nreminded by the Chinese Press. Apart from all that,\r\n\r\nis  there  anything different that will  make  this\r\n\r\nteam  that will go succeed where the last  one  had\r\n\r\nfailed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let us find out why the last one\r\n\r\nfailed.   Has   there  been  any  change   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational situation that is in our favour?  Are\r\n\r\nwe  going  to  go  there  and  meet  a  Lennox-Boyd\r\n\r\ndemoralised, ready to compromise, willing to yield?\r\n\r\nWhat  has happened in the international field? Lots\r\n\r\nof bombs and grenades have exploded in Cyprus since\r\n\r\nwe  left  London. Colonel Nasser has been called  a\r\n\r\ndictator and British troops are moving into  Cyprus\r\n\r\nin  great strength. Before the end of this week, we\r\n\r\nshall  know whether we are going to be in a  bigger\r\n\r\nand  more  dangerous Korea, with the Arab world  on\r\n\r\nthe  one  side,  pipelines being cut,  British  and\r\n\r\nFrench   troops  coming  in  to  make   sure   that\r\n\r\ninternational rights are respected and the Canal is\r\n\r\nkept  open.  The Secretary-General  of  the  Soviet\r\n\r\nRepublic  has already said that Russian  volunteers\r\n\r\nare  going  and that if he had a son he would  send\r\n\r\nhis son and lots of other people who have sons will\r\n\r\nsend  their  sons. Then the Far  East  will  go  by\r\n\r\ndefault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that apart, assuming that nothing blows up to\r\n\r\nsmithereens, we are going back to London. I keep on\r\n\r\nsaying \"we\", but I do not really know who \"we\" are.\r\n\r\nWhoever  goes  back  to  London  has  got  to  have\r\n\r\nsomething extra which was missing the last time  or\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  deliver the goods. They  will  either\r\n\r\nhave to compromise in which case they will be faced\r\n\r\nwith  a  great deal of trouble here, or  they  will\r\n\r\nfail.  The  last time right in the  middle  of  the\r\n\r\nconference,  the Chairman or the President  of  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist Party announced to the world that\r\n\r\nhe  was  ready to form a government if these  talks\r\n\r\nfailed.  One can imagine the effect it had  on  the\r\n\r\ndelicate constitution of our then Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British knew that we had reached all-Party\r\n\r\nagreement on certain heads. But they knew and  knew\r\n\r\npublicly  as  a  result of the  activities  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  whom  we  left behind in  Singapore - not  my\r\n\r\nfriend the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan)\r\n\r\nwho  was in London and cannot be held to blame  for\r\n\r\nit.  They said that they were ready to carry on the\r\n\r\ngovernment. The British Government knew that if the\r\n\r\ntalks  failed,  there  would be  no  constitutional\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  knew  that all that would happen would  be  a\r\n\r\nslight reshuffle in the team. Since that is  not  a\r\n\r\nsituation  that  one  should  be  unduly  concerned\r\n\r\nabout,  they  allowed a reshuffle in the  team.  We\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  present Chief  Minister  on  his\r\n\r\nskill  and  dexterity in making  the  reshuffle  as\r\n\r\ninconspicuous as possible. But if he is faced  with\r\n\r\nthe  same position again, he must face failure. The\r\n\r\nnext  time  he  must assure himself of  a  position\r\n\r\nwhere sabotage is not present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Especially from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> All political groups - when I say\r\n\r\nall political groups, I do not mean Independents or\r\n\r\nthose  who have forfeited the right of representing\r\n\r\nthe   masses.

We  know  who\r\n\r\nwill not be going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible if the Chief Minister is\r\n\r\ndetermined  to  assure himself of his  position  of\r\n\r\nstrength to organise all the anti-colonial  Parties\r\n\r\ntogether  in  one  group: one, to call  a  national\r\n\r\nconvention; two, to plan the tactics for  the  next\r\n\r\ntalks;  and  three,  this  is  the  most  important\r\n\r\none - this is the sting which will make it succeed - to\r\n\r\nplan  concerted and united all-Party constitutional\r\n\r\naction  if the next talks fail. If the British  are\r\n\r\nagain  confident in the coming talks that if  there\r\n\r\nis  a  failure, there will be another reshuffle  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  that Members will move  over  from\r\n\r\nthis  side to the other side and Members  from  the\r\n\r\nother  side  will move to this side and  some  will\r\n\r\nstay  behind, then success is uncertain. There  may\r\n\r\nbe  no progress. But if they are confronted with  a\r\n\r\nsolid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphalanx  of  anti-colonial groups who have  decided\r\n\r\nupon  what they will do at the talks, and what they\r\n\r\nwill  do  after  the talks if they fail,  then  the\r\n\r\nchances of success will be much greater. The  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister can then go back to London either alone as\r\n\r\nhe  did recently, or with others, whichever way  he\r\n\r\nwill, but in a stronger position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that this is a motion of confidence.\r\n\r\nWe  said  when the Government took office  that  we\r\n\r\nsupported the Government as a caretaker Government.\r\n\r\nWhat  the Chief Minister has said this morning  has\r\n\r\nto a certain extent made up for what was lacking in\r\n\r\nthis  Governor's  Address.  In  this  Address,  the\r\n\r\nquestion of self-government was treated as  lightly\r\n\r\nas   the  leader  of  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party\r\n\r\ntreated  it. He was interested in houses,  bee-hoon\r\n\r\nsellers, fish sellers - I am not saying that they are\r\n\r\nnot  important - I.C.I. fertilisers,  prospects  for\r\n\r\nbusiness,   youth  clubs,  youth  problems,   night\r\n\r\ncourses, and the narrow Yio Chu Kang Road which  he\r\n\r\nunfortunately has to travel up and down every  day.\r\n\r\nThe   Labour  Front  forgot  self-government  after\r\n\r\nmentioning  it in the third paragraph.  Then  comes\r\n\r\nthe Party theoretician who puts in at the end three\r\n\r\nresounding  paragraphs  which  wind  up   with   an\r\n\r\nincantation to God to ensure success.  Let  us  not\r\n\r\nleave  these things in the lap of the gods. Let  us\r\n\r\nmake  sure  as  far  as  we  can  of  positions  of\r\n\r\nstrength, positions from which we can talk, bargain\r\n\r\nand act effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the understanding that the Government calls a\r\n\r\nnational  convention to plan the  tactics  for  the\r\n\r\ntalks  and to plan united action if the talks fail,\r\n\r\nmy  Party  will  give  this Government  a  vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have been treated today to an exhibition of the\r\n\r\nmost  destructive criticism ever launched  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse. This Address of His Excellency contains what\r\n\r\nmust  be  at  least 75 per cent  of  the  aims  and\r\n\r\naspirations  of the People's Action Party.  Anybody\r\n\r\nwho  has  his country's interests at heart and  who\r\n\r\nhas  socialistic tendencies cannot but  accept  all\r\n\r\nthat is hoped for and all that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naimed  in  this  Address and  we  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsupport  all  that is contained in His Excellency's\r\n\r\nAddress.  But  our  friend the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan Yew) can see  nothing  in  it\r\n\r\nexcept  pious  words, blah, blah, blah and  ridicule\r\n\r\nfor  anybody else except his own opinions  and  his\r\n\r\nown  ideas.  The exhibition he gave me today  makes\r\n\r\nhis stand very clear. When he went through item  by\r\n\r\nitem  of the Address, he appeared to me like a bull\r\n\r\nin  a  china  shop  looking  at  every  teacup  and\r\n\r\nsmashing it if it was not red enough to his liking.\r\n\r\nThat  I  am afraid is the attitude. From his ideas,\r\n\r\nit is clear that what he wants is not evolution but\r\n\r\ndestruction   of   every  other   institution   and\r\n\r\nconstitution so that he can rebuild as an  autocrat\r\n\r\nand does what he likes with the country. Naturally,\r\n\r\nin  such  a  country, there will be no unemployment\r\n\r\nsimply because every one will have to work and if a\r\n\r\nperson  does  not  work, he is made  to  work.  The\r\n\r\npenalty,  of  course,  for not  working  is  either\r\n\r\nstarvation  or  the slave camp. Do you  think  that\r\n\r\nthere will be strikes in such a country with such a\r\n\r\nsystem? Not on your life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You have been reading too many U.S.I.S. pamphlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> The only strikes that will be\r\n\r\nallowed  will  be  fostered in the countries  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  democracy, where people are  allowed  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  allowed to bargain and allowed to riot  and\r\n\r\nthose who instigate these can sit quietly smug  and\r\n\r\nsmiling.  It  seems to me that he  has  a  peculiar\r\n\r\nmentality.  Maybe it is one of the results  of  the\r\n\r\noccupation  by  the  Japanese  when  every  act  of\r\n\r\nsomeone  else is viewed with suspicion and ulterior\r\n\r\nmotive. There seems to be a kink somewhere in  that\r\n\r\nhe  cannot  appreciate  a person's  act  without  a\r\n\r\nbitter  and  sinister motive behind it.  Even  such\r\n\r\naids  as  the  Colombo  Plan,  the  milk  machinery\r\n\r\noffered  by  the Australian Government  are  viewed\r\n\r\nwith grave suspicion and the doctors who are coming\r\n\r\nhere to teach us are not acceptable to him. He says\r\n\r\nthat  such  acts  are  an  infiltration.  Yes,   an\r\n\r\ninfiltration if you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike, an infiltration to make it more difficult for\r\n\r\nany  other  power who wants to move into  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhen we get independence. That is the view of how I\r\n\r\nlook upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow or the other, he has always chosen me to\r\n\r\nbe the butt of his sarcastic remarks. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhy his remarks are filled with such acidity. Maybe\r\n\r\nit is because the grapes are sour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on this Bukit Sembawang compensation, I do\r\n\r\nnot think he could have chosen a worse instance  to\r\n\r\nblame  private  owners  for  not  compensating  the\r\n\r\ntenants  on their land. In this particular case,  I\r\n\r\nknow that the people who were on the land were paid\r\n\r\na  better compensation than those who were on Crown\r\n\r\nland. Each of them - there were six of them who  were\r\n\r\nremoved  in  the  first phase of  building - received\r\n\r\napproximately  10,000  sq. ft. of  land  and  the\r\n\r\ncompensation was $1,500, even for the smallest hut,\r\n\r\nfor  which Government only paid a dollar  a  square\r\n\r\nfoot.  When  you talk of compensation,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nlegal compensation that the people are entitled to.\r\n\r\nIt  is  because times have changed and people  feel\r\n\r\nthat those who are in very poor circumstances ought\r\n\r\nto  be  given something to enable them to get along\r\n\r\nwhen  they have to shift from the places which they\r\n\r\nhave occupied for a long time. As a man who went on\r\n\r\nland and sat there, his right up to the present and\r\n\r\nuntil it is changed by the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nis only a month's notice but Government\r\n\r\nand  many  people have found it  right  that  he\r\n\r\nshould be given something to go on and I can assure\r\n\r\nhim  that  this  Company  has  done  all  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done, if not more.  Yes,  we  have\r\n\r\nresisted some claims because the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua) comes along and  tells\r\n\r\nthe  squatter, \"You join our Party and then we will\r\n\r\nsee  that  you get compensation according  to  your\r\n\r\nheart's  wishes. If you put your changkol into  the\r\n\r\nsoil,  that  land is yours.\" The Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  (Mr  Lim Ching Siong) goes stumping  around\r\n\r\nthe  country telling all his people, \"We will  give\r\n\r\nyou compensation. You strike and ask for more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npay.  You  will  get it and if not, there  will  be\r\n\r\ntrouble.\"  Right! The Member for Tanjong  Pagar  in\r\n\r\nthis  House says, \"You follow me and you  will  get\r\n\r\nwhat  you  want.  When I get into  the  Government,\r\n\r\neverybody  will get compensation according  to  his\r\n\r\nheart's  content - full employment.\" But he does  not\r\n\r\ntell  him, of course, that if he asks too much,  he\r\n\r\nwill find himself in a slave camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He is reading U.S.I.S.\r\n\r\npamphlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I have finished with my friend\r\n\r\nor  my enemy and I come to the more serious part of\r\n\r\ntoday's debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one have been greatly moved by our Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's speech.

We stand with the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  on  his  ideas  of  getting  self-government.  I believe he said on the  occasion  of\r\n\r\nthe opening of the Merdeka Bridge that you have  to\r\n\r\nwork  for Merdeka and you cannot rush and  ask  for\r\n\r\nself-government. lf he is going  to  work  towards\r\n\r\nMerdeka  in  the  same way the Merdeka  Bridge  was\r\n\r\nbuilt,  I  am  fully  with him.  Now  that  I  have\r\n\r\ncriticised destructive criticism, I hope  to  offer\r\n\r\nsome  constructive ones. Today is the day when  the\r\n\r\nsteward,  that is the Government in power,  renders\r\n\r\nto  its  master,  the public, his  account  of  the\r\n\r\nyear's  stewardship. His work is not judged by  the\r\n\r\nhopes  and aspirations which he thinks that he  can\r\n\r\nachieve during the next year or next few years  but\r\n\r\ncan  only be assessed by what he has done. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  the Chief Minister can claim to be proud  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachievements of the previous Government during  the\r\n\r\npast  year.  Much  of the time  was  spent  in  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  for more power and settlement of  strikes\r\n\r\ninstead  of  constructive work. There  has  been  a\r\n\r\ngeneral slowing down in the public service and this\r\n\r\nis  reflected  in the housing programme  when  just\r\n\r\nover  1,000 houses will be completed this  year  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with 3,000 last year. This  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nsevere  setback.  The excuse of  vacant  sites  not\r\n\r\nbeing available cannot account for the decrease  of\r\n\r\nover  50  per  cent as the difficulty  of  clearing\r\n\r\nsites was allowed for when the target of only 2,500\r\n\r\nunits  was  decided on. If this  can  happen  to  a\r\n\r\nprogramme planned years ahead, what will happen  to\r\n\r\nobjectives  which are still in the planning  stage?\r\n\r\nHousing is one of the items of topmost priority and\r\n\r\nwe  cannot and must not let the public down on this\r\n\r\nscore. We hope the target of 6,000 units per  annum\r\n\r\nwill be achieved in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very glad indeed that Government has a\r\n\r\nfirm  intention of establishing new industries  and\r\n\r\nfor  that  purpose  not only  will  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   be  encouraged  to  invest   in   local\r\n\r\nenterprises but foreign capital will be  attracted.\r\n\r\nHowever  it  is by deeds alone and not  words  that\r\n\r\nconfidence  in investments will be restored.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  use  closing  our eyes  to  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore was severely shaken by  the\r\n\r\nriots,  strikes  and intemperate language  used  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, even this afternoon. We shall have  to\r\n\r\nrestore  confidence  again before  we  can  attract\r\n\r\ncapital  and  this can only be done by  hard  work,\r\n\r\nsound leadership and a firm Government. During  the\r\n\r\npast few months, there have been welcome signs of a\r\n\r\nchange for the better and it is most encouraging to\r\n\r\nfind trade union leaders warning the members not to\r\n\r\nbe  misled by unscrupulous men who are prepared  to\r\n\r\ncall  workers to strike to further their  own  ends\r\n\r\nwithout  regard to the fact that the  industry  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to meet their demands  resulting  in\r\n\r\npermanent  loss of employment due to the  factories\r\n\r\nhaving  to  cease operation. Of course, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar denies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  there are such factories. There are  a  great\r\n\r\nnumber.  He  denies  them  because  his  Party   is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for their ceasing operation.  We  must\r\n\r\nrealise  that  the most serious problem  facing  us\r\n\r\ntoday  is unemployment which is steadily increasing\r\n\r\nduring  the  year. The factories  which  came  into\r\n\r\noperation this year could not absorb those who lost\r\n\r\ntheir  employment due to factories having to  close\r\n\r\ndown or curtail production. Added to this, are  the\r\n\r\n10,000  odd people each year who will leave  school\r\n\r\nto look for employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion to establish an Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion   Board   to  assist  the   small   scale\r\n\r\nmanufacturer is an excellent one but  I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat   many   small  scale  manufacturers   require\r\n\r\nimmediate  help  and  they  cannot  wait  for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Board. I have been one of  the\r\n\r\nstrongest supporters of free trade but I cannot see\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  continue to find employment  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers without some measure of protection for  our\r\n\r\nindustries against dumping of subsidised  goods  by\r\n\r\nforeign countries. A fair test as to whether  goods\r\n\r\nare  subsidised  or  not is the difference  in  the\r\n\r\nprice  obtaining in the country of origin  and  the\r\n\r\nexport  price. Every nation at some stage or  other\r\n\r\nhas  had  to protect her industries against  unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition to prevent mass unemployment and  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that we have come to that stage.  Wages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have gone up to such an extent that  many\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and shopkeepers find it impossible to\r\n\r\ncompete   against  goods  manufactured  in  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries  and they are being forced  at  first  to\r\n\r\ncurtail production and then to cease operation.  In\r\n\r\nparticular,  I refer to the bee-hoon or  vermicelli\r\n\r\nindustry.  A  year  ago, there  were  25  factories\r\n\r\nemploying  600 odd men. Today, there  are  only  20\r\n\r\nfactories employing under 400 men. This is  due  to\r\n\r\nsuch fierce competition from Thailand that over  60\r\n\r\nper cent of bee-hoon sold in Singapore is imported.\r\n\r\nAt  this  rate,  in  a  few more  months,  all  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  factories will have  to  close  down.  I\r\n\r\nrealise  the difficulties of imposing a tariff  due\r\n\r\nto  our entrepot trade but I suggest that we cannot\r\n\r\nlet  another  400  men be thrown into  the  already\r\n\r\nswollen  ranks  of our unemployed. I  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  a restriction on import so that dealers of bee-hoon  instead  of  being allowed to  import  10,000\r\n\r\npiculs,  which is the average consumption per  year\r\n\r\nincluding the exports from Singapore, be allowed to\r\n\r\nimport  5,000 piculs, that is half the amount,  and\r\n\r\nbe made to buy the other half locally. This is only\r\n\r\na suggestion which I think can save the industry. I\r\n\r\nshall welcome any other suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sad state of affairs prevails in the shoe\r\n\r\nindustry. Nearly all the shoes we see in the  shops\r\n\r\ntoday  are  imported  and our  shoemakers  are  now\r\n\r\nunemployed.  What  is the use  then  of  Government\r\n\r\npreparing  legislation  to  set  up  an  Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion Board to assist small scale manufacturers\r\n\r\nwhen  many are already facing bankruptcy?  We  must\r\n\r\ntake immediate steps to help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We notice with satisfaction Government's\r\n\r\nintention to provide more medical services,  social\r\n\r\nservices  and  amenities in  the  urban  and  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  Such  schemes will have to be paid  for  by\r\n\r\nincreased  revenue and we are told that the  burden\r\n\r\nwill fall on members of the community best able  to\r\n\r\ncarry it. No one can or will grudge the improvement\r\n\r\nof  the  standard of our workers but we  must  take\r\n\r\ncare  that  the burden of taxation will not  be  so\r\n\r\nheavy  that  it kills all incentive  to  start  new\r\n\r\nenterprises.  It is much easier to  keep  investors\r\n\r\naway  than to attract them and unless they  can  be\r\n\r\nassured  of  a reasonable return, they will  invest\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deplore the rise in the cost of administration\r\n\r\nwhich  has made it necessary for Government to  ask\r\n\r\nthis  House  to approve supplementary  votes  every\r\n\r\nquarter. If we are to spend more in social services\r\n\r\nof  which we are all agreed, we must see that every\r\n\r\ndollar we spend is spent wisely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D.

They are only detained for questioning  if\r\n\r\nthey  are suspected to be acting or to have  acted\r\n\r\nas  members  of unlawful societies, and  any  such\r\n\r\nperson with a tattoo mark which is the insignia of\r\n\r\nan unlawful society is presumed, according to law,\r\n\r\nto  be a member of that unlawful society until the\r\n\r\ncontrary  is  proved.

The name and  identity\r\n\r\ncard number of the person concerned are circulated\r\n\r\nto  all  Police Divisions and Branches to  prevent\r\n\r\nthat  person  being  again  questioned.

In addition, many known members\r\n\r\nof  secret  societies have been charged with  other\r\n\r\noffences such as armed robbery, extortion, criminal\r\n\r\nintimidation,  possession  of  dangerous   weapons,\r\n\r\nassault and rioting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these operations on serious crime\r\n\r\nand gang activity is shown by the facts that during\r\n\r\nthe  six  weeks  prior to \"Operation Dagger\"  there\r\n\r\nwere  31  cases of armed robbery and  13  cases  of\r\n\r\nsecret  society  gang  fights  and  incidents,  and\r\n\r\nduring the six weeks after \"Operation Dagger\" there\r\n\r\nwere  14  cases of armed robbery and not  a  single\r\n\r\nsecret society gang fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of \"Operation Dagger\" has been mainly\r\n\r\ndue  to  the disorganisation of the gangs, and  the\r\n\r\ndispersal  of members, many of whom have gone  into\r\n\r\nhiding,   and  the  consequent  greater   ease   in\r\n\r\nobtaining information from members of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VICE AND GAMBLING ACTIVITIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nwhether  he will give a detailed statement  on  the\r\n\r\nfindings  by  the Police of the Vice  and  Gambling\r\n\r\nactivities, and what steps have so far  been  taken\r\n\r\nto suppress these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr W.

There are 226 hotels in Singapore,\r\n\r\nexclusive of boarding houses, and up to the end  of\r\n\r\nJuly  1956  the Police, in liaison with the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department,  made 396  routine  checks  of\r\n\r\nhotels. As the result of these checks 46 cases were\r\n\r\ntaken  to Court and fines amounting to $9,790  were\r\n\r\nimposed by the Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main part of the new Hotels Ordinance was\r\n\r\nbrought  into  force on 10th August and  the  penal\r\n\r\nprovisions   will  be  brought  into   force   when\r\n\r\nsufficient time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  given  to processes of registration  and\r\n\r\nlicensing    of    hotel   and    boarding    house\r\n\r\nestablishments  and their keepers.  Enforcement  of\r\n\r\nthese  provisions should prevent hotels from  being\r\n\r\nused by known prostitutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards indecent publications and\r\n\r\nperformances,  action  is taken  whenever  suitable\r\n\r\nevidence is forthcoming against vendors of  obscene\r\n\r\nphotographs  and against editors and publishers  of\r\n\r\nmosquito newspapers publishing obscene articles. In\r\n\r\nthe first seven months of the year, 21 persons have\r\n\r\nbeen  arrested,  one  person  summoned,  and  fines\r\n\r\ntotaling $3,991 have been imposed by the Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for theatrical performances are\r\n\r\ncarefully  scrutinised and licences are refused  or\r\n\r\ncancelled   in   cases   where   performances   are\r\n\r\nconsidered improper or immoral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A campaign steadily increasing in intensity\r\n\r\nduring the first seven months of the year has  been\r\n\r\ncarried out against gambling and lotteries, and 503\r\n\r\nraids have been made resulting in 794 arrests,  and\r\n\r\nfines  amounting  to $70,632 have been  imposed  on\r\n\r\npersons  brought into Court.
