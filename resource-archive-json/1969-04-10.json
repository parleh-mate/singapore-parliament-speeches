To  be  an\r\n\r\neffective Reserve Force, during the period  of  their\r\n\r\nfull-time  service  the national servicemen  have  to\r\n\r\nreceive a high standard of training.

This\r\n\r\nmust   be  followed  by  on-the-job  experience   and\r\n\r\nadditional  training  to  advanced  levels   in   the\r\n\r\nrespective vocations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training of an officer takes up to two years\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the vocation that he is being  trained\r\n\r\nfor,  and  his previous qualifications.

He said that it requires one year to\r\n\r\ntrain  an  officer, but graduates after  passing  out\r\n\r\nmust have learnt a lot either in the field of science\r\n\r\nor  art. They are scholars. So how can they be turned\r\n\r\ninto soldiers? In my view, it is wrong. Graduates are\r\n\r\nspecialists  in  their own fields  and  I  feel  they\r\n\r\nshould contribute their specialities to the needs  of\r\n\r\nour  society  instead of wasting their  time  in  the\r\n\r\narmy. Therefore, I think six months of training  will\r\n\r\nsuffice  for them. I also feel that many people  will\r\n\r\noppose   the  continuation  of  two  years'  national\r\n\r\nservice.  Our country is not at war and there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  turn  scholars into soldiers.

The  scope\r\n\r\nof  this Act, which has effected some improvements in\r\n\r\nthe  law,  is  far-reaching, not  only  altering  the\r\n\r\nsubstantive    law   but   conferring    very    wide\r\n\r\ndiscretionary powers on the courts.

In    the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is desirable that a  careful  study\r\n\r\nof the Act and its effects as shown by the experience\r\n\r\nof  the  courts  in  England should  be  made  before\r\n\r\nsimilar legislation is introduced in Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certain of the provisions of the Civil Evidence\r\n\r\nAct,  1968, of the United Kingdom are already a  part\r\n\r\nof  our law of evidence.

Otherwise, why are there so  many\r\n\r\nrestrictive clauses? This Bill will not eradicate our\r\n\r\nback-alley abortionists who will still create all the\r\n\r\nhorrifying  complications so clearly  illustrated  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much reference has been made in this House to\r\n\r\nthe  medical  practitioners. I am not going  to  make\r\n\r\nexcuses  for  them  nor  am I going  to  explain  the\r\n\r\nreasons for any divergent views held by some of them.\r\n\r\nThe medical profession is noble enough to weather any\r\n\r\nstorm, political or otherwise. Let me, however, point\r\n\r\nout that medical practitioners are not economists and\r\n\r\nthus  do  not have the vision or perhaps the acquired\r\n\r\nability  to  visualise the socioeconomic reasons  for\r\n\r\nabortion. As citizens, a great majority of them  will\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  humanitarian reasons  for  legalised\r\n\r\nabortion. Like the rest of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens,  there  is a minority among  them  who  are\r\n\r\nbeset  by  religious scruples and this has  been  the\r\n\r\nbane  of the Minister for Health's life. Surely  this\r\n\r\nminority of medical practitioners are free to express\r\n\r\ntheir views on abortion. I respect their views and  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister for Health will do likewise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if abortion is legalised it will be the medical\r\n\r\npractitioners who will be doing the operation and not\r\n\r\nthe  politicians.  Thus,  I  feel  it  is  completely\r\n\r\njustified  for  my medical colleagues  to  air  their\r\n\r\nopinions on a step which they will be taking, a  step\r\n\r\nthat  is  so completely radical to what they  are  ac\r\n\r\ncustomed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have the feeling that no matter what we\r\n\r\nsay, this Bill will be accepted in toto by the House.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is  going  to be so, then  may  I  suggest\r\n\r\namending  the  title of this Bill to  read  \"Abortion\r\n\r\n(Restrictive) Bill\". If this is so amended, then  the\r\n\r\nBill  may be more acceptable in its title as it  will\r\n\r\nindicate  what  it is really meant to  be,  that  is,\r\n\r\nlegalised abortion will be allowed only for  medical,\r\n\r\nlegal and socio-economic reasons and not on demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, after listening to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Joo Chiat, I am glad that the Minister for Health\r\n\r\n-  if indeed the Member for Joo Chiat is correct -has\r\n\r\nhad    qualms   about   complete   and   unrestricted\r\n\r\navailability of abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take this opportunity sincerely to\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister for Health  on his able marshalling of \r\n\r\narguments in justification of this   Bill.   In  particular,  I  must  \r\n\r\nexpress   my admiration, perhaps not so sincerely, for the way  he anticipated  \r\n\r\nopposing  arguments,  especially   those\r\n\r\nbased on religious and ethical grounds. However, I do\r\n\r\nnot  agree  that he has, as he inferred, disposed  of\r\n\r\nthose arguments.

I would venture to say that the\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill,  in its present form, justifies  that\r\n\r\ncaveat which I am entering.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like first to refer to clause 5 (2) which\r\n\r\nspecifies  the  grounds  on  which  abortion  may  be\r\n\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, sub-clause (2) (a) specifies that the\r\n\r\nTermination  of  Pregnancy  Authorisation  Board  may\r\n\r\nauthorise an abortion if continuance of pregnancy  in\r\n\r\nvolves  risk  to the life of the pregnant  woman,  or\r\n\r\ninjury to the physical or mental health of the woman.\r\n\r\nDoes  it not seem, Sir, that the wording itself  here\r\n\r\nappears  to be a little risky? What sort of  odds  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of deleterious effects, physical and  mental,\r\n\r\nshould be calculated before a person can be permitted\r\n\r\nan   abortion?  My  misgivings  over  this  type   of\r\n\r\nambiguity are not lessened by the knowledge that such\r\n\r\nrisk  and  possibility of injury referred to  may  be\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  opinion, formed in good  faith,  that\r\n\r\nabortion is necessary! What is this good faith,  Sir?\r\n\r\nSurely,  the  emphasis  should  be  on  ascertainable\r\n\r\nmedical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskill,  rather  than on flimsy grounds  of  faith.  A\r\n\r\ntheological   virtue,  Sir,  to  which  perhaps   the\r\n\r\nMinister does not subscribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An abortion, even when performed by a qualified and\r\n\r\nexperienced  doctor, poses itself as a risk  to  life\r\n\r\nand a danger to health physical and mental. There has\r\n\r\nbeen,   to   my   mind,  adequate  and  authoritative\r\n\r\nassertion that this is so. This being so, is  it  not\r\n\r\nlogical  to  expect that an abortion  should  be  per\r\n\r\nmitted  only if there is grave danger to life  or  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  grave risk of injury, and of  injury  that\r\n\r\nwill  have lasting consequences to physical or mental\r\n\r\nhealth? Nowhere in sub-clause (2) (a) under clause  5\r\n\r\ndo  I  note  any qualification related to gravity  or\r\n\r\nseriousness of risks involved. I must beg  to  differ\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister's statement that \"In clause 5  (2)\r\n\r\n(a)  the  conditions under which therapeutic abortion\r\n\r\ncan  be  done  are  unambiguously  stated.\"  In  some\r\n\r\nsections of his speech introducing the Second Reading\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill, the Minister demonstrated an uncommon\r\n\r\nflair  for a vivid word-picture. Surely it would  not\r\n\r\nbe beyond his capacity to refer to the extent of risk\r\n\r\nto life, and to the extent of injury anticipated that\r\n\r\nwould warrant abortion?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be borne in mind that \"the frequency of\r\n\r\ntherapeutic  terminations of pregnancy is  decreasing\r\n\r\nrapidly with the advances of medical knowledge\".  The\r\n\r\nEncyclopa?dia  Britannica is the authority  for  this\r\n\r\nstatement,  which was made in as early  as  the  1963\r\n\r\nedition, in the section on \"Abortion\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time cardiac disease, tuberculosis, various\r\n\r\ndiseases  associated with pregnancy were all regarded\r\n\r\nby  medical  opinion as indications for  abortion.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that scientific evidence indicates that  this\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  so  today  in all respects  of  cardiac\r\n\r\ndisease,    tuberculosis,   etc.   Certainly    these\r\n\r\nconditions do require special care before  and  after\r\n\r\nthe  birth  and in some cases the social  environment\r\n\r\nmust be improved, but the conditions referred to  may\r\n\r\nnot    necessarily   and   generically   be   medical\r\n\r\nindications for abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing, Sir, if I may labour on a particular\r\n\r\naspect  of  this clause, may I ask what is  meant  by\r\n\r\n\"risk  to  the mental health of the pregnant  woman\"?\r\n\r\nIndications   of   this  sort  are   notoriously   un\r\n\r\npredictable. They are just as unpredictable  as  what\r\n\r\nwould  happen  if  a  mentally unstable  person  does\r\n\r\nprocure  an  abortion. Referring to a  conference  on\r\n\r\nabortion  held  in Washington, the United  States  of\r\n\r\nAmerica, in September 1967, under the auspices of the\r\n\r\nKennedy  Foundation and the Harvard Divinity  School,\r\n\r\none of the conferees remarked on the vagueness of the\r\n\r\npsychiatrists  present  about  the  indications  that\r\n\r\njustify  abortion  on  grounds of  damage  to  mental\r\n\r\nhealth. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am merely mentioning this\r\n\r\nreference   to  underline  my  own  view  about   the\r\n\r\nvagueness of the term \"mental health\" in the clause I\r\n\r\nam discussing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (2) (b) of clause 5 also stipulates that\r\n\r\nan  abortion  may be permitted, if it is the  opinion\r\n\r\nformed  in  good  faith that the environment  of  the\r\n\r\npregnant woman, both at the time when the child would\r\n\r\nbe  born  and  thereafter, so far as is  foreseeable,\r\n\r\njustifies  such an operation. What I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  is  what  \"so  far  as is  foreseeable\"  means.\r\n\r\nPresumably  we shall have to depend on the  foresight\r\n\r\nof  the Authorisation Board. Where social work experience  \r\n\r\nis  concerned, in the technical  sense  of  the\r\n\r\nterm,  the majority of the Board members will be  lay\r\n\r\npeople:  there  will  be one  member  (who  shall  be\r\n\r\nfemale)  who  has  had experience in  social  welfare\r\n\r\nwork, besides the Director of Social Welfare. And the\r\n\r\nopinion   of   these   members,  with   social   work\r\n\r\nexperience,  could be over-ruled in one direction  or\r\n\r\nanother  by  the  medical members of  the  Board,  if\r\n\r\nsupported  by another lay member. What I am  pointing\r\n\r\nout  is  that the weight of responsibility will  fall\r\n\r\nupon  medical people, where the grounds to  determine\r\n\r\nwhether   an  abortion  may  be  performed  will   be\r\n\r\nessentially non-medical grounds.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am already sufficiently appalled by the vagueness\r\n\r\nthat hangs about like a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwoolly   cloud   over  this  so-called  environmental\r\n\r\nclause.  But  I  must  express  my  misgivings  where\r\n\r\nenvironmental considerations may be determined  by  a\r\n\r\ncaucus of persons who are not social workers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Minister aware that when a similar so-called\r\n\r\n\"social  clause\"  was brought up before  the  British\r\n\r\nParliament, the British Medical Association  and  the\r\n\r\nRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health has on one occasion resorted  to\r\n\r\nthe views of the latter august body) had opposed this\r\n\r\nprovision on the grounds that physicians might be  un\r\n\r\nqualified  or  unwilling to  pass  judgment  on  non-medical aspects of a case?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed those who believe that initial\r\n\r\ndistress and reasons may not be sufficient to warrant\r\n\r\nan abortion, and that case work investigations should\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out  to determine the circumstances.  It\r\n\r\nshould be hoped that, when the occasion for the imple\r\n\r\nmentation of this Bill does come, great care will  be\r\n\r\ntaken   to   ascertain   the   seriousness   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  that  may  be  said  to   justify   an\r\n\r\nabortion.  I  do not see in this Bill in its  current\r\n\r\nform that there is any guarantee that a laissez-faire\r\n\r\nattitude  will  not be adopted: in fact,  that  there\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  abortion on demand that  will  be  the\r\n\r\neffect of this Bill, as it stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I pass on to sub-clause (2) (c) of clause 5?\r\n\r\nHere,   at   least,   there  is   the   qualification\r\n\r\n\"substantial\" to the word \"risk\", and \"seriously\"  to\r\n\r\nthe    word    \"handicapped\".   Would    that    such\r\n\r\nqualifications  had been entered  in  sub-clause  (2)\r\n\r\n(a) . However, if I may refer to this sub-clause (2)\r\n\r\n(c) ,  I hope that abortion recommended on genetic  or\r\n\r\neugenic  grounds will not deteriorate  into  abortion\r\n\r\npermitted  in a sort of generic manner. For  what  is\r\n\r\nmeant  by  substantial  risk of  physical  or  mental\r\n\r\nabnormalities?   Would  30   per   cent   chance   of\r\n\r\nabnormality  be adequate to warrant abortion?  Or  50\r\n\r\nper  cent? Under such circumstances, would there  not\r\n\r\nalso be the risk of a healthy foetus being destroyed?\r\n\r\nWhat is the extent of wastage that would result\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  destruction  of  foetuses  with  suspected\r\n\r\nabnormalities? I recollect having read of an estimate\r\n\r\nthat the effect of a similar provision in the English\r\n\r\nlaw  will  mean the destruction of three foetuses  by\r\n\r\nabortion  for  every deformed child that  would  have\r\n\r\nactualIy  been born. If this is so, then it would  be\r\n\r\nmore logical to wait for the foetuses to attain their\r\n\r\nfull  growth  and then commit infanticide  where  the\r\n\r\nactually deformed birth is concerned. I do not  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  what  our  society will permit.  The  point\r\n\r\nremains  that prognoses resulting in abortions  based\r\n\r\non  foetal  indications  have never  been  validated.\r\n\r\nAbortions are fatal - the evidence is destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall refrain from commenting on sub-clause (2)\r\n\r\n(d) at this stage, Sir. I would like to deal with \r\n\r\nsub-clause  (3) of clause 5. Here it is stated  that  two\r\n\r\ngeneral  practitioners (registered,  of  course)  may\r\n\r\ndecide  on  termination  of  pregnancy  without   the\r\n\r\nauthorisation of the Board. Do I take it  that  these\r\n\r\ntwo general practitioners would also be qualified  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the psychiatric condition of the  pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman  and to perform an abortion on the ground  that\r\n\r\nthis  will have less deleterious consequences on  the\r\n\r\nmental  health  of the pregnant woman  than  ultimate\r\n\r\ndelivery of the child?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in sub-clause (5) we discover that only\r\n\r\none  medical practitioner (registered - but  he  need\r\n\r\nnot possess psychiatric qualifications) is sufficient\r\n\r\nto decide, on mental health grounds, that an abortion\r\n\r\nis   immediately  necessary.  Is  this  an   adequate\r\n\r\nsafeguard? Furthermore, in clause 10, sub-clause (3) ,\r\n\r\na  general  practitioner, who may have  conscientious\r\n\r\nscruples against abortion (and whose religious convic\r\n\r\ntions the Minister says should be respected), may  be\r\n\r\nforced  into a position where he must determine  that\r\n\r\nan abortion is immediately necessary to prevent grave\r\n\r\npermanent  injury to the mental health of a  pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now may I touch on the clause related to incest and\r\n\r\nrape? May I point out that this clause was originally\r\n\r\nincluded in the English Abortion Bill,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  was removed by the sponsors themselves for legal\r\n\r\nreasons  that rape is notoriously easy to allege  and\r\n\r\ndifficult to prove. We have an apparent resort  to  a\r\n\r\nlegal  safeguard  here in our Bill. No  authorisation\r\n\r\nfor  treatment to terminate pregnancy on  grounds  of\r\n\r\nrape  or  incest will be given unless  the  Attorney-General has certified that proceedings in respect  of\r\n\r\nrape  or  incest have completed, or have  begun.  The\r\n\r\nlast three words are significant. Without final proof\r\n\r\nabortion  can  be  granted on  grounds  of  rape  and\r\n\r\nincest. I beg to seek the Minister's clarification. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that it is this sort of looseness in this piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation to reform the abortion law that leads\r\n\r\nme  to  fear exploitation of this Bill for the  avail\r\n\r\nability of abortion on demand.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to do is to distinguish the heat\r\n\r\nfrom the light in the controversy over abortion. That\r\n\r\nthere  is  justification  for  liberalising  the  law\r\n\r\nrelated to abortion in the view of those who are  not\r\n\r\naffected  by conscientious religious scruples  (which\r\n\r\nwe  must also respect) I have no doubt. All I say  is\r\n\r\nthat  we must proceed cautiously. It would have  been\r\n\r\nfar  better  if a systematic investigation  had  been\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by the Ministry of Health  to  disclose\r\n\r\nobjectively  what would be for the good  of  the  com\r\n\r\nmunity.  But  certain difficulties are  obvious,  and\r\n\r\ntime is a major consideration. Thus for the next four\r\n\r\nor  five  years  we are experimenting with  a  social\r\n\r\nsituation. And in such circumstances adequate control\r\n\r\nmust be exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health has made a most important statement on the abortion issue. But to underline the caution which I feel about the Bill, I would like to enter certain reservations about certain things that he has said. I agree with him that we want to provide a healthy social environment in which to bring up our\r\n\r\nchildren.  Certainly  our society  cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\nbreed delinquents, criminals and antisocial elements.\r\n\r\nBut I must certainly question the generalisation,  as\r\n\r\nhe states it, that such types are mainly derived\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the ranks of unwanted children, the illegitimate\r\n\r\nand  broken  homes. I am sure there  must  be  broken\r\n\r\nhomes  in which no abortion has ever taken place.  Is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister trying to say that abortion will reduce\r\n\r\ndelinquency? Can he substantiate with data  that  the\r\n\r\ncrime  rate  in  countries which permit  abortion  is\r\n\r\nnecessarily less than in those countries which do not\r\n\r\npermit  it? He has referred to the annual  figure  of\r\n\r\none  million illegal abortions in the United  States.\r\n\r\nThere  are people who dispute this figure as  grossly\r\n\r\nexaggerated.  But we will accept the authority  which\r\n\r\nhe  quoted. Does he conjecture that the crime rate in\r\n\r\nAmerica  would have shot up without these  abortions?\r\n\r\nHas  he any indication of the crime rate among  those\r\n\r\nwho   have  procured  abortions?  He  has  said  that\r\n\r\npromiscuity  and indeed I might add  other  forms  of\r\n\r\ndelinquency are matters that must depend on the moral\r\n\r\nfibre and character of the individual and the type of\r\n\r\nsociety that the individual comes from. I agree whole\r\n\r\nheartedly with him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, may I refer to this question of the life\r\n\r\nof  the  foetus?  I would normally  be  reluctant  to\r\n\r\nengage  myself in philosophical discussions  of  this\r\n\r\nsort.  But  the  Minister himself has mentioned  this\r\n\r\naspect. May I refer to the opinion of Norman St. John-Stevas,  an  English M.P, who was  prominent  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  Abortion in the English  Parliament?  St.\r\n\r\nJohn-Stevas  writes in a journal called America,  9th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1967. He says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is worth noting that the final form of the\r\n\r\n(English Abortion) Bill left abortion as a crime  but\r\n\r\nselected  certain  conditions  under  which  it   was\r\n\r\nconsidered justifiable. This form is important, since\r\n\r\nit  recognises, even in attenuated form, respect  for\r\n\r\nthe sanctity of life.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to note also that one\r\n\r\ngynacologist wrote in the Times, 5th December,  1966,\r\n\r\n\"that the embryo becomes genetically complete at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of conception though only microscopic in  size.\r\n\r\nIt  is  uncommon,\"  he continued,  \"for  a  woman  to\r\n\r\npresent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nherself for abortion before about 12 weeks, by  which\r\n\r\ntime these tiny foetuses are not amorphous masses  of\r\n\r\nprotoplasm,  but are beautifully formed, move  around\r\n\r\nfreely  in  their  sac of fluid, respond  to  noxious\r\n\r\nstimuli  and  evoke the same emotional response  from\r\n\r\ntheatre  staff, as does the delivery of  a  full-term\r\n\r\nbaby,  followed by quietness and a sense  of  tragedy\r\n\r\nbecause  a  life has been destroyed.\" This  emotional\r\n\r\nresponse was also described to me independently by  a\r\n\r\nlocal surgeon, who is not a Catholic and who supports\r\n\r\ngenerally the Government's stand on abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably this is the same sort of emotional\r\n\r\nresponse   that  one  would  get  should  one   visit\r\n\r\nWoodbridge to see for oneself the pitiful  plight  of\r\n\r\nmongols and mental defectives.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would venture to say that there is profound sorrow to be felt in both cases over the harsh objective facts of life. Our Government wishes to reflect what our people want, and to do what is good for them. My view is that our people in general want a moderate measure of abortion law reform, and\r\n\r\nnot  abortion  too  freely available.  I  think  this\r\n\r\nlatter  caution results from a belief that grave  con\r\n\r\nsideration  must  also be given to the  life  of  the\r\n\r\nunborn child.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any piece of legislation has an educational impact.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill must adequately reinforce in the minds  of\r\n\r\nour  people that human life in all circumstances must\r\n\r\nbe  treated with compassion. It is this consideration\r\n\r\nthat has led me to seek the various clarifications  I\r\n\r\nhave  sought.  I  find  it encouraging  that  in  its\r\n\r\nexercise  of the art of the possible, our Government,\r\n\r\nin  respect of this Bill, is referring it  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  and that a period of four or five  years'\r\n\r\ngrace  will  be  given to study the effects  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  inasmuch  also as this Bill  itself  has  had,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the previous Minister  for  Health,  a\r\n\r\ngestation period of two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\naccording to the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplanatory statement to this  Bill,\r\n\r\ntreatment to terminate pregnancy may be carried  out,\r\n\r\nsubject  to certain safeguards, by registered medical\r\n\r\npractitioners acting on the authority of a Board  (to\r\n\r\nbe called \"The Termination of Pregnancy Authorisation\r\n\r\nBoard\")  on medical, social, humanitarian and eugenic\r\n\r\ngrounds. However, I would like to remind the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health  of  a  recent statement  by  Dr  Hector\r\n\r\nMaclennan,   President  of  the  Royal   College   of\r\n\r\nObstetricians and Gynecologists in Britain,  made  in\r\n\r\nthe Times of 21st January, 1966:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Leaving out of account the difficulties which may\r\n\r\nbe  associated  with  the  decision  to  terminate  a\r\n\r\npregnancy  there  still remain  problems  as  to  who\r\n\r\nshould  perform  the operation, who should  give  the\r\n\r\nansthetic and where it should be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the operation is to be limited to hospital\r\n\r\npractice  by  recognised  specialists  it  should  be\r\n\r\nstated  most  emphatically that therapeutic  abortion\r\n\r\neven  in  skilled  hands is more dangerous  than  the\r\n\r\npublic   and   many  doctors  appreciate.   This   is\r\n\r\nespecially  so with a woman, pregnant for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again I would like to refer the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  to  an  article entitled Legalised  abortion:\r\n\r\nReport  by  the  Council  of  the  Royal  College  of\r\n\r\nObstetricians  and  Gynecologists  from   which   the\r\n\r\nfollowing quotation is taken.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In Scandinavia operative rates for legalised\r\n\r\nabortion  initially  varied  from  0.9  to  3.5   per\r\n\r\nthousand cases; more recent figures put the mortality\r\n\r\nrate  for Denmark at 0.7 per thousand which is  still\r\n\r\nnearly  three times as high as the present  mortality\r\n\r\nrate  (including  abortions) for England  and  Wales.\r\n\r\nMortality  rates of 0.3 to 0.6 per thousand  reported\r\n\r\nfrom  countries  in Eastern Europe are  difficult  to\r\n\r\nreconcile with experience in Northern Europe  and  in\r\n\r\nBritain.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I am quoting this is that the other\r\n\r\nday  the  Minister mentioned several cases  of  women\r\n\r\nwith  unwanted pregnancies, but he did not state over\r\n\r\na  period  of  how  many years that  the  cases  were\r\n\r\nrecorded at Kandang Kerbau Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> 1964.

Sir, I would like  to\r\n\r\nquote  Professor  T. Kobayashi, of Tokyo  University,\r\n\r\nwho in reviewing the position of Japan says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our serious concern was to overcome a population\r\n\r\nexplosion  brought  about  by  a  loss  of  land  and\r\n\r\nrepatriation   of   the  Japanese  disarmed   forces,\r\n\r\naccelerated by the usual postwar boom produced by new\r\n\r\nmarriages  and  reunited families. The situation  was\r\n\r\nworsened  by a tremendous decrease of food production\r\n\r\nand chaotic social conditions in our destroyed land.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Kobayashi said that out of 1,026 women who\r\n\r\nhad  undergone induced abortion, 68 per  cent  showed\r\n\r\nsome  kind  of  regret and fear  of  the  experience.\r\n\r\nEvidently,  it  was a desperate measure  taken  by  a\r\n\r\npeople  whose culture and temperament had bred  other\r\n\r\ndesperate  practices such as hara-kiri  and  kamikaze\r\n\r\nsuicide  techniques.  But the  population  problem  m\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  nowhere  like  the  post-war  Japanese\r\n\r\nsituation.  Our birth rate has been steadily  falling\r\n\r\nsince 1959 from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n39 to 28.6 per thousand in 1966. The rate of fall has\r\n\r\naccelerated even further since the formation  of  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning and Population Board and  the  birth\r\n\r\nrate for the first six months of 1967 shows a 13  per\r\n\r\ncent  fall over the same period in 1966. There  would\r\n\r\nappear  to be no cause for alarm and for the adoption\r\n\r\nof desperate measures such as abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in advocating abortion for socio-economic\r\n\r\nreasons,  the unborn child is regarded  as  a  social\r\n\r\ninconvenience  and economic burden.  Projecting  this\r\n\r\nreasoning a step further, legalised euthanasia or so-called \r\n\r\nmercy killing would become equally acceptable.\r\n\r\nWhy  should  society be burdened with the  aged,  the\r\n\r\nmentally  defective, the physically  handicapped  and\r\n\r\nthe  chronic  incurables? Then  how  about  legalised\r\n\r\nsuicide? An equally good case can be made out for it.\r\n\r\nThink  of the many painful and cruel methods of self-destruction, not infrequently unsuccessful. Should we\r\n\r\nnot  legalise it, have proper institutions to  ensure\r\n\r\nswift, certain and painless demise for those who feel\r\n\r\nthat  they are no longer of use to society? At least,\r\n\r\nSir,  we can obtain their consent, unlike in abortion\r\n\r\nwhere the subject has no say in this matter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the objection of a certain section of the\r\n\r\npublic  to the Bill on religious grounds, I am  aware\r\n\r\nthat  some Members of this House may take the worldly\r\n\r\nstand  that  in  the  rugged  society  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nreligious  principles  have no relevance  where  such\r\n\r\nprinciples  are incompatible with the  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  development of Singapore. To  such  persons\r\n\r\nwho  have made success their god, it is natural  that\r\n\r\nreligious  principles  may  be  dismissed  as   super\r\n\r\nstitious beliefs. All the same, it is very much to be\r\n\r\nregretted if our society is to be developed along the\r\n\r\nlines  that  the amount of respect to be accorded  to\r\n\r\nany  principles is to be determined in terms of money\r\n\r\nthat  the  principles can earn  for  us.  If  such  a\r\n\r\nsociety was already a fact in Singapore, I would have\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhesitation  in saying, \"Let us have abortion  by  all\r\n\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from my own personal observations of the\r\n\r\nmanifestations of the beginning of such a society  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, there is apparently a great need  for  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the law on abortion to minimise the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  promoting a  barnyard  standard  of\r\n\r\nmorals.  With  the number of social  escort  agencies\r\n\r\nsprouting  all over the island, it must  be  admitted\r\n\r\nthat  tourism is becoming more of a bedroom  pastime.\r\n\r\nIt,  therefore,  becomes necessary for  us  to  enact\r\n\r\nlegislation to get rid of our ill-conceived fruits of\r\n\r\npleasure-cum-industry. Facts are facts and  since  we\r\n\r\npride ourselves on our pragmatic approach to life, we\r\n\r\nmust  face  the fact that if Singapore is to  develop\r\n\r\nalong  the  lines of the shanty towns which  flourish\r\n\r\naround  foreign  military bases in Thailand  and  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  any objection to the Bill would  merely\r\n\r\nbe  of  academic  value. But my  point  i5  that  our\r\n\r\nsociety has not degenerated to such a level and  that\r\n\r\nour  laws  must  not be fashioned to  facilitate  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  our  society  on   the   basis   of\r\n\r\npromiscuity.  This  is  particularly  more  so  in  a\r\n\r\nsecular Republic in which we must be tolerant of  and\r\n\r\nmust  give consideration to religious people as  well\r\n\r\nas  those  with  religious convictions,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose  who  subscribe to the Christian religion  that\r\n\r\nthe  sanctity of life is inviolable even in the  case\r\n\r\nof  a  newly conceived foetus. Sir, here I would like\r\n\r\nto  say  that I am a free thinker. I have no reigious\r\n\r\nbias. To them the termination of the existence  of  a\r\n\r\nfoetus  is just as heinous an offence as the  killing\r\n\r\nof a human being, except when it is necessary to save\r\n\r\nthe  life  of the mother. They have every  reason  to\r\n\r\nobject in so far as the Bill appears to have,  as  an\r\n\r\nulterior objective, the control of population growth.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  conveys an impression that it is  designed\r\n\r\nfor  population control. I myself do not believe  it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is the fault of the Bill.  Even  the\r\n\r\nMinister's supporters say that this Bill is good  for\r\n\r\npopulation control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is that so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In view of such vehement and valid\r\n\r\nobjection, it seems to me that a law which embodies a\r\n\r\nradical concept repugnant to a substantial number  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  which is sponsored  as  a  measure  of\r\n\r\nexpediency is likely to bring about a train of events\r\n\r\nwhich  will secure the subsequent revocation of  such\r\n\r\nlaw. Sir, in view of the religious objections to  the\r\n\r\nBill and as Singapore is a secular state, I feel that\r\n\r\ntheir opinions should be taken into consideration. We\r\n\r\ncannot just brush them off.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may be aware that Russia after\r\n\r\nthe Communist Revolution enacted a law to provide for\r\n\r\nand  to  facilitate abortion on the  ground  that  by\r\n\r\nreleasing women from labour in bed they will be freed\r\n\r\nfor  labour  in factories. It is not surprising  that\r\n\r\nnot  long  afterwards the Russian Government reversed\r\n\r\nits  edict on the grounds that women are more  useful\r\n\r\nto  the state in the production of human beings  than\r\n\r\nin the proluction of factory goods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the same cynical spirit the Nazi\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Germany enacted stringent  legislation\r\n\r\nagainst abortion on the ground that it is the  sacred\r\n\r\nduty of a German woman to augment the Teutonic race.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that when laws relating to the\r\n\r\npreservation of human life are tampered with,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  beginning of the end of the right to exist as  a\r\n\r\nhuman being. It is with totalitarian regimes that  we\r\n\r\nassociate the control and regulation of the functions\r\n\r\nof a woman's body for the ultimate glorification of a\r\n\r\nmetaphysical entity known as the \"State\".  Admittedly\r\n\r\nthe  abortion  envisaged  by  the  Bill  is  strictly\r\n\r\nvoluntary.   But  the  process  of  transition   from\r\n\r\n\"voluntary\" to \"compulsory\" is invidious and  subtle.\r\n\r\nAnd  therein  lies  the  valid  basis  for  fear   on\r\n\r\nreligious grounds.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to quote Professor T.N.A.\r\n\r\nJeffcoate:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The destruction of the living embryo offends\r\n\r\nsomething  fundamental in human nature and  the  most\r\n\r\nscientifically detached gynaecologist cannot fail  to\r\n\r\napproach  the operation with an uneasiness which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  variously accredited to 'primordial  revulsion'\r\n\r\nand 'subtle archaic motives'.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a discussion of the risks of carrying out\r\n\r\nabortions,  reference must be made to the effects  on\r\n\r\nthe  doctor himself. Doctors feel that their  primary\r\n\r\nprofessional  role is to preserve  life  and  not  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  it. This feeling of uneasiness will  not  be\r\n\r\ndecreased by the knowledge that some abortions that a\r\n\r\ndoctor  is  made to do may not be necessary  at  all.\r\n\r\nShould  abortion laws be liberalised,  it  cannot  be\r\n\r\nassumed  that doctors will kill off as many  foetuses\r\n\r\nas  demanded with impunity. Carl Muller, Professor of\r\n\r\nObstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Berne,\r\n\r\nrecently commented:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In countries where abortion is entirely legal and a\r\n\r\ndoctor  may have to undertake an enormous  number  of\r\n\r\noperations on healthy women during a single  day,  it\r\n\r\ncan  happen that he breaks down and needs psychiatric\r\n\r\nhelp.  It  seems  that  for these  mass  abortions  a\r\n\r\nspecial  robot-like  constitution  is  needed,  which\r\n\r\nevery doctor does not possess. Some authors from  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  states  have  ascribed  the  increase   in\r\n\r\ncomplications  after abortion in part  to  'signs  of\r\n\r\nexhaustion' in the operator.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries where abortion is permitted for medical\r\n\r\nreasons  only,  the doctor has to  assess  each  case\r\n\r\ncarefully.  When the situation requires it,  he  will\r\n\r\nperform  the  abortion.  Liberalising  the   law   on\r\n\r\nabortion  can  only serve to blunt the desire  to  he\r\n\r\nconscientious  by  removing the need  to  be  so.  In\r\n\r\nserving  his  patients, a doctor's ethics  should  be\r\n\r\njudged not only by what he will do for them but  also\r\n\r\nby what he feels he cannot do.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the objection to the Bill on psychological\r\n\r\nand  moral  grounds,  I am given to  understand  that\r\n\r\ndoctors  are  called to safeguard  life  and  promote\r\n\r\nhealth, not to kill or destroy. Their code of ethics,\r\n\r\ncrystallised  in  the Hippocratic  Oath,  makes  this\r\n\r\nabundantly clear:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...I will ... abstain from whatever is deleterious and\r\n\r\nmischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to anyone\r\n\r\nif  asked, nor suggest any such counsel; furthermore,\r\n\r\nI  will  not give to a woman an instrument to produce\r\n\r\nabortion ...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is  also expected that the demand on our  medical\r\n\r\nfacilities would continue to be pressing despite  the\r\n\r\neffort of the Government to enlarge and increase such\r\n\r\nfacilities to keep pace with the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  appears  reasonable  to conclude  that  with  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the law on abortion, the demand  on\r\n\r\nour  inadequate and , overworked hospital and medical\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  staff would become more  unbearable.\r\n\r\nWithout  going  into  the pros and  cons  of  medical\r\n\r\nobjections  to  the  liberalisation  of  the  law  on\r\n\r\nabortion,  I am sure that Members in the  House  will\r\n\r\nagree  with  me  that if this Bill is intended  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans  of population control, then I think it  should\r\n\r\nbe thrown into the Singapore River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I have to stress over and over again the\r\n\r\nprecise purpose of this Bill is that if the objective\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  is  inchoate or incoherent,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nitself  cannot be otherwise. Its purpose is bound  to\r\n\r\nmanifest itself in the particular provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  in  the  way in which particular  remedies  are\r\n\r\nproposed  for the prevention of mischief  which  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  intended  to  regulate  and  which  may  be\r\n\r\nanticipated   to  arise  after  its  enactment.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  let us refer now to clause 5 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  forms  the operative provisions .  Sub-clause\r\n\r\n(2) of the proposed clause states the four grounds on\r\n\r\nwhich  the Board may authorise treatment to terminate\r\n\r\npregnancy. The grounds in paragraphs (a) , (c) and (d)\r\n\r\nare  quite acceptable in so far as the purpose of the\r\n\r\nBill is to rationalise the laws relating to abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three provisions I have just referred to are, in\r\n\r\na manner of speaking, amplified and extended versions\r\n\r\nof   the  existing  provisions  in  our  Penal   Code\r\n\r\nspecifying  the circumstances to which  abortion  may\r\n\r\nnot be considered to be a crime. But in paragraph (h)\r\n\r\nof  sub-clause (2) of clause 5 a controversial ground\r\n\r\nis  introduced. The provisions are to the effect that\r\n\r\nif  the Board is of the opinion formed in good  faith\r\n\r\nthat the environment of the pregnant wonlan justifies\r\n\r\nthe   termination  of  a  pregnancy,  the  Board  may\r\n\r\nauthorise  an abortion to be performed. My  objection\r\n\r\nis  that  in the term \"environment\", which is defined\r\n\r\nin the said paragraph to include family and financial\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of  the pregnant woman,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreference to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  danger that may result to the physical or mental\r\n\r\nhealth  of a pregnant woman if abortion is performed.\r\n\r\nIf   it  is  the  intention  of  the  Government   to\r\n\r\nliberalise  the  law  on abortion  for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nabortion, then it is irrelevant to introduce any such\r\n\r\nrestrictions as contained in sub-clause (2) .  But  if\r\n\r\nit  is the intention of the Government to rationalise\r\n\r\nthe laws relating to abortion, then it is unjustified\r\n\r\nin introducing an unduly wide ground for abortion. As\r\n\r\nI see it, any law which has the specific objective of\r\n\r\nrationalising the situation relating to  abortion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  should  spell  out  regulations  for  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  manner and mode of  performance  of\r\n\r\nabortion to safeguard the life and health of  persons\r\n\r\nwho  have  to undergo abortion. By seeking  to  place\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on the circumstances in which  abortion\r\n\r\nmay be performed, the law would be lending itself  to\r\n\r\nthe  creation of circumstances which would enable the\r\n\r\nillegal  abortionists to carry on with  their  trade,\r\n\r\nwhich is a mischief this Bill is supposed to prevent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confusion that seems to charactense the drafting\r\n\r\nof  this Bill is further shown when the provisions of\r\n\r\nsub-clause  (2)  of  clause 5 are compared  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of sub-clauses (3) and (5) thereof.  Sub-clause  (3)  is  to  the  effect  that  a  registered\r\n\r\npractitioner, after consultation with  another  in  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  hospital  or in an approved  institution,\r\n\r\nmay  perform  an abortion on the ground mentioned  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  (a) of sub-clause (2) of clause 5  without\r\n\r\nthe  prior authorisation of the Board. Sub-clause (5)\r\n\r\nis   to   the  effect  that  any  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner  may  perform an  abortion  without  the\r\n\r\nprior  authorisation of the Board if  he  is  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion formed in good faith that the abortion is  im\r\n\r\nmediately  necessary to save the life or  to  prevent\r\n\r\ngrave  permanent  injury to the  physical  or  mental\r\n\r\nhealth  of the pregnant woman. As I see it, there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  prevent  a woman who  is  determined  to\r\n\r\nterminate  her pregnancy from putting up a convincing\r\n\r\nshow  before  the registered medical practitioner  to\r\n\r\nenable him to form the opinion in good faith that  it\r\n\r\nis  immediately necessary to perform an  abortion  to\r\n\r\nprevent grave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermanent injury to the physical or mental health  of\r\n\r\nthe pregnant woman.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may recall a certain incident,\r\n\r\nwhich  was widely reported in the local press  a  few\r\n\r\nyears back, about an English woman who worked herself\r\n\r\ninto  a  hysterical  fit  in  order  to  justify  the\r\n\r\nabortion  of  her  unborn baby who  might  have  been\r\n\r\ndeformed as a result of a certain drug taken by her.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Bill does not contain any provision  to\r\n\r\nprevent  a  woman  from repeatedly  having  abortions\r\n\r\nperformed on her. I should think it is reasonable  to\r\n\r\nrequire   that,  where  the  woman  is   married   or\r\n\r\ncohabiting  with a man, she attends a course  at  the\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  clinic after she has  undergone  an\r\n\r\nabortion. In my view, sub-clause (5)\r\n\r\nof  clause  5 of this Bill is tantamount  to  making\r\n\r\nabortion   permissible  in  all  circumstances.   The\r\n\r\nprovisions  of sub-clause (5) seem to place  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of faith on the integrity of the members of  the\r\n\r\nmedical profession in Singapore. With all due respect\r\n\r\nto  them and also to Members of this House who  are\r\n\r\nmembers  of this honourable profession, my impression\r\n\r\nis  that  most  of the practitioners in  the  illegal\r\n\r\nabortion  trade at present flourishing  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  members of the medical profession. Even when  it\r\n\r\nis  a criminal offence to perform abortions except in\r\n\r\nthe very restricted circumstances permitted under  the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode,  the  consequences of a conviction for  illegal\r\n\r\nabortion are not sufficient to deter doctors as  well\r\n\r\nas quacks from performing abortions. With the present\r\n\r\nBill there is much less deterrence to such doctors to\r\n\r\nperform   abortions  which  are  not   envisaged   or\r\n\r\npermissible  under the provisions  of  this  Bill.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see any provision contained in this  Bill  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the penalties that may be suffered  by  a\r\n\r\ndoctor who performs an operation not on the basis  of\r\n\r\nan  opinion  formed in good faith to the satisfaction\r\n\r\nof the Board or in circumstances which are beyond the\r\n\r\nscope of the Bill. I wonder whether mere infringement\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions  of  this Bill  would  constitute\r\n\r\nsubstantial grounds to cause a registered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedical  practitioner  to  be  deregistered  by   his\r\n\r\nmedical association.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in paragraph (a) of sub-clause (2) of clause 8,\r\n\r\nit  is stated that only the consent in writing of the\r\n\r\napplicant  over  eighteen years of age  is  required.\r\n\r\nThat  means  a  married woman, who is  over  eighteen\r\n\r\nyears  old  and  who is not insane or  feeble-minded,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have to consult her husband regarding  the\r\n\r\nabortion of their unborn child. Where the husband has\r\n\r\nstrong  religious  objection to  abortion  and  where\r\n\r\nabortion  has been permitted under paragraph  (h)  of\r\n\r\nsub-clause  (2) of clause (8) , a domestic dispute  is\r\n\r\nbound  to arise between the husband and the  wife  in\r\n\r\nsuch circumstances. Is it the intention of the Govern\r\n\r\nment to 1e1 in such domestic dispute as a ground  for\r\n\r\ndivorce? I should think it is not only reasonable but\r\n\r\nalso  logical  to  provide for  the  consent  of  the\r\n\r\nhusband  when  abortion is to be  approved.  Even  in\r\n\r\nfamily planning, consent is required of both parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Further in sub-clause  (3)  of\r\n\r\nclause  10,  the  whole  purpose  of  providing   for\r\n\r\nconscientious  objection is  nullified  by  requiring\r\n\r\nthat  such  a person may nonetheless be compelled  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in any abortion when it is necessary  to\r\n\r\nsave  the  life or prevent grave permanent injury  to\r\n\r\nthe  physical or mental health of the pregnant woman,\r\n\r\nand  no  provision is made to determine the  criteria\r\n\r\nfor  assessing whether such an opinion  is  valid  or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last provision to which I have just referred\r\n\r\nserves to substantiate my contention that the Bill is\r\n\r\nnot designed to rationalise the laws relating to abor\r\n\r\ntion  but  rather to give effect to the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy of promoting birth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol,  if it is the intention to have  a  Bill  to\r\n\r\nliberalise  the laws relating to abortion,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  better for the Bill not to  restrict  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  on  which abortion may be performed  but  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  and  regulate the persons  by  whom  or  the\r\n\r\nmanner by which abortion is to be performed.

I am in complete agreement with Professor Tow\r\n\r\nSiang  Hwa who suggested at a forum in the University\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   recently  that  the  population   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can confidently be solved and  any  future\r\n\r\nanticipated explosion can be averted by the following\r\n\r\nsteps:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a redoubling of the present family planning\r\n\r\neffort with greater attention to personal contact and\r\n\r\nfollow-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, post partum tubal ligation after the third\r\n\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, an educational programme ainied at all\r\n\r\nlevels  of society, stressing the benefits of  family\r\n\r\nplanning and the truth about abortion.

Of course, the Minister  may\r\n\r\nsay  this is not Question Time and that I cannot ask\r\n\r\nsupplementary questions. My first question  is  this.\r\n\r\nIs  this Bill needed in Singapore? According to  both\r\n\r\nthe  present  Minister  for  Health  and  the  former\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health who spoke with such vigour,  how\r\n\r\nmany  investigations had been carried out before this\r\n\r\nBill  was  introduced? Can the Minister tell  us  how\r\n\r\nmany supporters there are in Singapore who are behind\r\n\r\nthis Bill?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Does the Abortion Bill\r\n\r\nalso  apply  to foreigners who come here?  They  will\r\n\r\nknow  about  it  and come here. The  Minister  should\r\n\r\nclarify this point.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last question is about the ceiling of the fee.\r\n\r\nWhat  is it? Is it $5? If it is $5, and there  is  no\r\n\r\nstipulation  in  the Bill to prevent foreigners  from\r\n\r\ntaking advantage of this Bill, then our medical staff\r\n\r\nare  going  to  be worked to death.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nreasonable   for   the  Minister  to   provide   some\r\n\r\nsafeguards against this in the Bill. Another question\r\n\r\nis,  how  can  the  Minister  check  against  illegal\r\n\r\nabortions,  since the Bill is drafted in such  a  way\r\n\r\nthat  abortion  is given not as of  right  or  as  of\r\n\r\ndemand?

As has also been expected, the opponents  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  have  taken up and repeated  the  familiar\r\n\r\narguments  usually  expressed  by  those  who  oppose\r\n\r\nlegalised abortion. Of course, they have put  forward\r\n\r\ntheir  arguments in a different style and form  often\r\n\r\nby  the  rearrangement of the language.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nsome  have  even attempted to conceal the  fact  that\r\n\r\ntheir arguments spring primarily from their religious\r\n\r\nand  ethical  dogmas which are based  on  one  single\r\n\r\ndebatable   hypothesis  -  that   abortion   is   the\r\n\r\ndestruction of the foetus which is human life or  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of human life and is, therefore, bad.  That\r\n\r\nis  a debatable hypothesis. Some, like the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar,  even went further and alleged  that  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  the  Abortion  Bill  we  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nlegislate to kill children. How interesting it is  to\r\n\r\nnote that one has just to stretch such an argument  a\r\n\r\nlittle,  to end up in an apparent absurdity,  as  has\r\n\r\nhappened  with the allegation of the Member for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar which I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some also attempt to put up a facade of\r\n\r\nrationality  and  of  being  scientific  by   quoting\r\n\r\nexcerpts from some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearned  medical journals in the hope  of  concealing\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  their arguments  spring  from  their\r\n\r\nfundamental religious conviction, as in the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Punggol as well as some others. By the\r\n\r\nrigmarole   of  old  familiar  arguments   that   the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  the  individual must  extend  to  the\r\n\r\nunborn  child,  that the destruction  of  the  foetus\r\n\r\naffects  the  humane feeling for life, and  that  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  the  law  on  abortion  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  has  not  reduced the  number  of  illegal\r\n\r\nabortions, the Member for Punggol seeks to  give  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  he is taking a purely  humanitarian\r\n\r\nstand and not a religious one. Unfortunately, he lets\r\n\r\nthe cat out of the bag by his statement, and I quote,\r\n\r\n\"On  what grounds does the Government seek to reverse\r\n\r\na  long-held tradition of our society about the right\r\n\r\nto  life  of  the unborn child? Is it on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat this foetus is not human, and therefore does not\r\n\r\nenjoy the right to life which is embodied in our law?\r\n\r\nIf  this  is the view of those who wish to liberalise\r\n\r\nour abortion laws, then it is up to them to prove it,\r\n\r\nfor  the  weight  of  evidence lies  heavily  against\r\n\r\nthem.\"  So  says  the Member for Punggol.  He  should\r\n\r\nknow, however, that the issue he has raised is within\r\n\r\nthe  realms  of  religious hypothesis and  dogmas  on\r\n\r\nwhich    mankind   has   disagreed   for   centuries.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately  for the people who have  raised  these\r\n\r\narguments  to  cover what, in effect,  are  arguments\r\n\r\nwhich  spring  from religious and ethical  dogmas,  I\r\n\r\nhave  already forestalled these arguments. I think  I\r\n\r\nhave  adequately disposed of them under the  category\r\n\r\nof  opposition views based on religion in my  opening\r\n\r\naddress. I remember that I ended my speech under  the\r\n\r\nhead  of religious objections by stating that  it  is\r\n\r\nfutile to allow ourselves to be involved in religious\r\n\r\narguments for or against abortion which, in any case,\r\n\r\nwill  never  result in any satisfactory  conclusions,\r\n\r\neven  if the debate goes on till the cows come  home.\r\n\r\nHowever  cleverly  these opponents build  their  case\r\n\r\naround  their religious dogmas with a view to justifying  them, often quoting from learned authorities  ad\r\n\r\nlib in order to give the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrappings  of being scientific, the significant  fact\r\n\r\nto notice is the lack of facts and figures to back up\r\n\r\nthese theoretical arguments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of my having anticipated the arguments\r\n\r\nopposing  the  Bill and classifying them  into  three\r\n\r\ndistinct  categories  - first, religious  arguments;\r\n\r\nsecond, ethical, moral and social reasons; and third,\r\n\r\nmedical  reasons - and I have systematically disposed\r\n\r\nof  them - the arguments brought up by Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  who  oppose  the Bill have unfortunately  been\r\n\r\nrepetitions of the same old familiar arguments.  What\r\n\r\nI,  therefore, propose to do now is to touch on  some\r\n\r\nof  them  and Members may like to refer to my  speech\r\n\r\nwhich  I  made  on moving the Second Reading  of  the\r\n\r\nBill, in rebuttal of the rest of their arguments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to touch upon is that\r\n\r\nmade by the opponents concerning the arguments on the\r\n\r\ndestruction  of  life. The Member  for  Punggol,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya Lebar, the Member for  Jurong,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Moulmein and, I think, the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  say that the unborn foetus is human  life  and\r\n\r\nthat abortion amounts to the killing of life. In  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  their  debate,  this  concept  has   been\r\n\r\nextended  as reflecting a lack of respect  for  human\r\n\r\nlife,  built  on  the hypothesis that  such  lack  of\r\n\r\nrespect  will  lead to social and moral decline  with\r\n\r\nconsequent  deterioration in the moral  character  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. So they say. The premises on which  such\r\n\r\narguments  have  developed are medieval  and  we  can\r\n\r\nargue  till  the cows come home without reaching  any\r\n\r\nagreement on this point. Tn law, the unborn foetus is\r\n\r\nnot  life as it is understood, for no abortionist  in\r\n\r\nany  community has been charged with murder  for  the\r\n\r\ndestruction  of  the foetus. The  extensions  of  the\r\n\r\narguments  are  extremely picturesque  and  wild.  To\r\n\r\npermit  the  destruction of  the  foetus,  they  say,\r\n\r\naffects  the  humaneness of life; it may  affect  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of society, and it may eventually lead to  the\r\n\r\nslippery path downhill. It has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextended   to   say  that  this  may  lead   to   the\r\n\r\njustification  of taking other forms of  human  life,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  sick,  the old  and  the  economically\r\n\r\nuseless.  Such an argument is not only dangerous  but\r\n\r\nalso  mischievous.  No  community  anywhere  in   the\r\n\r\npresent   world,   irrespective  of   its   political\r\n\r\ncharacter, has ever thought of permitting the killing\r\n\r\nof  human  beings, as it is generally understood,  be\r\n\r\nthey   sick,   old,  infirm,  paralysed  or   totally\r\n\r\ndecrepit.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the social reasons. Are we, as suggested by the Member for Punggol, really making a law so that members of the medical profession can take over the work done by criminals in order to do it better? Of course not. It is because our law has prevented members of the\r\n\r\nmedical  profession  from freely  doing  this,  where\r\n\r\nthere is a crying need, that criminals have been able\r\n\r\nto  take over and provide a much needed service. They\r\n\r\ndo  it  in  a  haphazard, dangerous and irresponsible\r\n\r\nmanner  and  yet,  as the Member  for  Alexandra  has\r\n\r\nstated,  they earn the gratitude of women  who  carry\r\n\r\ntheir  confidence and gratitude even  to  the  grave.\r\n\r\nShould we not give our medical profession the freedom\r\n\r\nthey  should have had many years ago? A Bill of  this\r\n\r\nnature,   complex  in  character  with   considerable\r\n\r\nsafeguards  for the women, the medical  practitioners\r\n\r\nand  the  community, offers the sanction  of  society\r\n\r\nunder specific conditions. It is not a licence for  a\r\n\r\npermissive  society.  I have  already  stated  in  my\r\n\r\nopening speech that if the object is merely to remove\r\n\r\nthe present restraints on abortion in the Penal Code,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill in its present form will not be necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the opponents have not taken note of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the Member for Punggol has claimed,\r\n\r\nand I believe that the Member for Bras Basah has also\r\n\r\nclaimed  that  Singapore, with  the  passing  of  the\r\n\r\nAbortion Bill, would become an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabortion centre, perhaps they have not read the  Bill\r\n\r\ncarefully and I ask them to read it again;  in  fact,\r\n\r\nwe have gone so far as to write complex provisions to\r\n\r\nprevent this. For example, it is provided in clause 5\r\n\r\n(8)  of  the Bill that no woman can have an  abortion\r\n\r\nunless  she has been a resident in Singapore  for  at\r\n\r\nleast  four months. Any visitor who has to reside  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for four months will find it too  late  to\r\n\r\nhave an abortion. Perhaps the Member for Punggol does\r\n\r\nnot  understand this. This is the sort  of  provision\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  put into the Bill,  because  we  have\r\n\r\nlearnt  from the experience of Japan and  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if you look up the immigration regulations,\r\n\r\nyou will see that no foreigner is allowed to stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for more than two weeks. If the Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol  likes,  he  can,  in  a  question, ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Defence\r\n\r\nto clarify that. He will give him the same answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the arguments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput  forward by the Member for Moulmein. He got a bit\r\n\r\nawry  when  he  referred to legalising the  right  to\r\n\r\nsuicide and! to provide facilities to see blue films,\r\n\r\netc., as something equal to the passing of this Bill.\r\n\r\nThis  is,  quite clearly, a facetious approach  to  a\r\n\r\nserious  problem.  His argument got  rather  confused\r\n\r\nwhen  he  referred to the success of  the  Government\r\n\r\nfamily  planning programme, the result  of  which  he\r\n\r\nsaid   was  encouraging.  And  then,  curiously,   he\r\n\r\nproceeded  to  say  next  that  under-population  can\r\n\r\nhamper  economic growth and development.  Presumably,\r\n\r\nhe was not referring to Singapore when he said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Point of\r\n\r\nclarification,  Sir,I  was not  talking  of  under-population in Singapore. I was only making a  general\r\n\r\nstatement   about  economic  development.  Population\r\n\r\ncontrol is very essential. Under-population can be  a\r\n\r\nproblem.  Over-population can be  a  problem.  I  was\r\n\r\nmaking a general statement which can be applicable in\r\n\r\nall situations. I went on to explain that Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  never  face  that  problem.  So  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister has got me wrong there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in that case the Member's\r\n\r\ngeneral  statement is neither here nor there.  May  I\r\n\r\nproceed  by  saying that it is also because  abortion\r\n\r\nhas  a  special  place  in  community  concepts  that\r\n\r\nspecial provisions have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger to unmarried girls and widows has been\r\n\r\nreferred to by the Member for Geylang Serai  who  has\r\n\r\nstated  that  the  Abortion Bill  will  aggravate  an\r\n\r\nunhealthy  situation which has been  created  by  the\r\n\r\nextensive  family planning programme now  under  way.\r\n\r\nThis is a debatable point because family planning  is\r\n\r\nmade  available to married women and, if I may repeat\r\n\r\nagain,  I  have  dealt with the point about  abortion\r\n\r\nleading  to  promiscuity  rather  adequately  in   my\r\n\r\nopening speech. Perhaps the Member for Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nmight like to refer to my speech again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again turning to the Member for Moulmein, he also\r\n\r\naccused  me of losing the thread of my argument  when\r\n\r\nin  arguing  that  since  the  laws  on  abortion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are outdated and irrational, he asked why I\r\n\r\nwas  sponsoring a Bill which seeks to perpetuate  the\r\n\r\nconcept that \"abortion is intrinsically wrong\".  That\r\n\r\nabortion  has  been \"made the subject  of  a  special\r\n\r\npiece of legislation with innumerable safeguards,  is\r\n\r\na  strong indication that the proponents of the  Bill\r\n\r\nare  not  clear in their conscience\" about  abortion.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what  the Member for Moulmein has  alleged.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that\r\n\r\nthe Bill does not seek to perpetuate the concept that\r\n\r\nabortion  is intrinsically wrong. Surely the  concept\r\n\r\nthat  abortion is intrinsically wrong or right  is  a\r\n\r\npronouncement of an ethical and religious nature, and\r\n\r\nI  have  time  and again said that to be involved  in\r\n\r\nethical  and  religious arguments for or against  the\r\n\r\nBill  is  entirely futile. Further, it is astonishing\r\n\r\nfor  the  Member  for  Moulmein to  allege  that  the\r\n\r\nconscience of the proponents of the Bill is not clear\r\n\r\nor is dubious. Apart from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  it is a non sequitur  and  therefore\r\n\r\nillogical, on the contrary, I am sure that unlike the\r\n\r\nopponents  of  the  Bill who are torn  between  their\r\n\r\ndogmas  and  the  humanitarian  appeal  to  alleviate\r\n\r\nsuffering, the proponents have a clear conscience.  I\r\n\r\nfor  one have no doubts about it. However, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Moulmein's aforesaid trend of argument, which was\r\n\r\nclearly involved and apparently confused, does  serve\r\n\r\nto  illustrate the typical way in which the opponents\r\n\r\ngo about attacking the Bill by basing their arguments\r\n\r\non   false  presumptions.  Another  good  example  of\r\n\r\npresuming falsely is that, time and again, they  have\r\n\r\ninsisted even in the face of facts that the Bill will\r\n\r\nallow abortions on demand. However, let me state once\r\n\r\nagain  that an elaborate Bill such as the one  before\r\n\r\nus  has been made to contain all the safeguards which\r\n\r\nare necessary in order to ensure the following:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) That abortions are to be made available under\r\n\r\ncertain  specified conditions as have  been  provided\r\n\r\nand  drafted with care in the Bill and that abortions\r\n\r\nare  not  allowed on demand. We are not in favour  of\r\n\r\nabortions on demand because, as I have stated  in  my\r\n\r\nopening  speech,  this may lead to recurrent  demands\r\n\r\nfor  abortion  and we know, as a medical  fact,  that\r\n\r\nrepeated  abortions  result  in  a  higher  rate   of\r\n\r\nmortality and morbidity. In fact, I have revealed  in\r\n\r\nmy  opening  speech the decision of Government  which\r\n\r\nwas  taken  even  before the Bill  was  presented  to\r\n\r\nParliament,   that  in  order  to  prevent   repeated\r\n\r\nabortions, where a woman who presents herself for  an\r\n\r\nabortion  has  three children or more,  the  abortion\r\n\r\nwill  be  permitted on condition that she  agrees  to\r\n\r\nsterilization subsequently. Where is the abortion on\r\n\r\ndemand? It is a fantasy that was flourished again and\r\n\r\nagain by the opponents of this Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) From the medical point of view, we have to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the most aseptic conditions under  which\r\n\r\nabortions can be done so that the risk is absolutely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminimal.  There must, therefore, be adequate  control\r\n\r\nof    operations.    Otherwise,    the    back-street\r\n\r\nabortionists  will  certainly not  only  continue  in\r\n\r\nbusiness but will be having a booming one.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) We must provide safeguards for doctors who\r\n\r\nhave conscientious objections, and make it an offence\r\n\r\nfor anyone to compel others to have an abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these conditions are to safeguard the\r\n\r\ninterest o1 persons who are in the minority like  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Moulmein  whose  ethical  and  religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs make them oppose abortions. I do not think it\r\n\r\nis necessary for me to go on to elaborate further why\r\n\r\nsuch a Bill ir necessary. The conditions to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe interests of such persons are so apparent, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  already  stated them in detail  in  my  opening\r\n\r\nspeech,  that only an ostrich will not  be  aware  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Member for Moulmein in his speech has\r\n\r\ncomplained  that I have not spared the House  of  the\r\n\r\nsordid details of the traumatic experiences of  women\r\n\r\nundergoing  abortion at the hands of the  back-street\r\n\r\nand illegal abortionists or by do-it-yourself methods\r\n\r\nin  the case studies which I recounted in this  House\r\n\r\nto  illustrate  the desperation of our  women  caught\r\n\r\nwith  an unwanted pregnancy and the terrible cost  in\r\n\r\npain,  suffering and health. I am sorry, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  they did make some Members uneasy or  cause\r\n\r\nthem  to  wince a little in their seats, particularly\r\n\r\nthose who are torn between their religious dogmas  on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand  and,  on the other,  the  irrefutable\r\n\r\nevidence of human agony and suffering facing them.  I\r\n\r\nam afraid I had to do so. However, being realistic, I\r\n\r\nalso  know that it would not be possible to  dislodge\r\n\r\nthe hard-held opposing views of some Members based on\r\n\r\nethical  and  religious dogmas with which  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen inculcated for years. To have attempted to do so\r\n\r\nwould have been just as difficult as it is to make  a\r\n\r\nduck's back wet. But it would have served its purpose\r\n\r\nif  they  had stirred the conscience of the opponents\r\n\r\nto the Bill who have come out with a strong belief in\r\n\r\ntheir righteousness, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nface up to the realities of human agony and pain  and\r\n\r\nmake  them ponder over it even if it does not end  up\r\n\r\nin correcting their dogmatism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein also picked out one of the\r\n\r\nexamples  I  quoted of a 33-year old  Roman  Catholic\r\n\r\nChinese housewife. He very strongly remarked that  if\r\n\r\nonly  she  had  obeyed her religious  teachings,  she\r\n\r\nwould  have  been spared the agony.  This  is  indeed\r\n\r\ninteresting  and proves the point that I have  stated\r\n\r\nin my opening speech, that it is all very easy to put\r\n\r\non  a straight collar and start moralising on someone\r\n\r\nelse's anguish and predicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Katong. He has been\r\n\r\nquite  assiduous  in his study of the  Bill  and  has\r\n\r\ntalked  quite  a  lot  about legal  expressions  like\r\n\r\n\"mental health\", \"foreseeable\" and so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> The expression \"mental health\" is\r\n\r\nnot legal terminology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It has a legal interpretation\r\n\r\nand this is the point I want to make. These are terms\r\n\r\nused by our legal draftsmen who drafted this Bill and\r\n\r\nwhen they use these terms they have decided cases  to\r\n\r\nguide them. I do not think hon. Members will allow me\r\n\r\nto  go  on  to  quote legal precedents  in  order  to\r\n\r\nexplain what these terms mean, but if the Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong  puts up sonic questions on these legal terms,\r\n\r\nperhaps I may be able to satisfy him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the Member for Joo Chiat? He\r\n\r\nexpressed  some  disappointment  that  we  have   not\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  Bill  whereby abortion  will  be  made\r\n\r\navailable on demand. But as a surgeon he will realise\r\n\r\nthe point which I have made just now, and also in  my\r\n\r\nopening address, that to allow repeated abortion  is,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  medical point of view, not  a  good  thing\r\n\r\nbecause  it  does increase the rate of mortality  and\r\n\r\nmorbidity.  This is one of the reasons  why  we  have\r\n\r\ndecided not to make abortions available on demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah made a long speech and\r\n\r\nconcluded  by  saying that since we are  liberalising\r\n\r\nthe  law  on  abortion, why do we not  also  legalise\r\n\r\nsuicide, after mentioning hara-kiri and kamikaze? May\r\n\r\nI  tell the Member that suicide, in fact, is no legal\r\n\r\noffence because of the simple reason that no one  can\r\n\r\nbe prosecuted for suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b>\r\n\r\nSuccessful suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Under the law, attempted suicide\r\n\r\nis  an  offence hut suicide is not. So  if  a  person\r\n\r\ncommits  hara-kiri  successfully,  he  will  not   be\r\n\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the point about family planning\r\n\r\nin  conjunction  with the Abortion  Bill.  All  those\r\n\r\nMembers who support the Bill and those who oppose  it\r\n\r\nhave  congratulated the Government on its success  in\r\n\r\nfamily  planning, and this is accepted. However,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir, the possible effects of this Bill  are\r\n\r\ninterpreted differently by those who support the Bill\r\n\r\nand  those who oppose it. Those who oppose it express\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  for  the  Government's  family   planning\r\n\r\nprogramme and welcome its extension. I would like  to\r\n\r\nstate  that the effects of the Abortion Bill  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's family planning programme have been very\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered by my Ministry and  the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning and Population Board, it is because of  this\r\n\r\nthat   one  of  the  fundamental  features   in   the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Abortion Bill will be its close\r\n\r\ntie-up  with the national family planning  programme.\r\n\r\nWe already have an excellent post-partum programme in\r\n\r\nour maternity and gynaecological wards at the Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital and Thomson Road General Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family planning staff from the Board interview\r\n\r\nevery  woman  who has delivered a child and  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  admitted  for  an  abortion.  These  women  are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to take up family planning. In  fact,  in\r\n\r\n1968, 50 per cent of such women actually did so.  The\r\n\r\nfamily planning staff will, when this Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  implemented, interview every woman who  has  been\r\n\r\ngranted an abortion in the hospital, as they do  now,\r\n\r\nand encourage her to take up family planning. That is\r\n\r\nwhy   the  amendment  to  the  Family  Planning   and\r\n\r\nPopulation  Board Act becomes necessary. If  a  woman\r\n\r\nhas  not  subsequently adopted family  planning,  the\r\n\r\nTermination  of  Pregnancy Authorisation  Board  is\r\n\r\nlikely   to  take  an  extremely  dim  view  of   any\r\n\r\nsubsequent application by the woman for an  abortion.\r\n\r\nThe  recommendation  for  abortion  from  the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  and Population Board, supported by evidence\r\n\r\nof  the practice of family planning in their records,\r\n\r\nwill  make it very easy for women to get an  abortion\r\n\r\nin  the case of contraceptive failure. This would  be\r\n\r\nmade  quite clear when a woman comes in for her first\r\n\r\ntermination of pregnancy. In addition, a  woman  with\r\n\r\nthree  or more live children who is then to be  given\r\n\r\nan   abortion  will  he  asked  to  accept  voluntary\r\n\r\nsterilization as a condition of the authorisation  of\r\n\r\nabortion.  These two complementary steps will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  family planning programme will not  suffer\r\n\r\nand that women will not come repeatedly for abortion.\r\n\r\nIt  will,  in fact, stimulate the practice of  family\r\n\r\nplanning,  contrary  to what  the  prophets  of  doom\r\n\r\namongst  the opposition to the Bill say.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthis  close  and intimate tie-up, the situation  that\r\n\r\noccurred  in Japan, where the Eugenic Protection  Law\r\n\r\nwas  implemented independently of the family planning\r\n\r\nprogramme  with  consequent  detrimental  effects  on\r\n\r\nfamily planning\r\n\r\npractice, is not expected to occur in Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the rate of population growth in\r\n\r\nSingapore is falling. This has also been repeated  by\r\n\r\nmany  speakers both for and against the Bill. I would\r\n\r\nIike  to  remind  Members again that  even  with  our\r\n\r\npresent  rate of population growth of 1.8  per  cent,\r\n\r\nour  population  will double in  39  years.  Our  aim\r\n\r\neventually, and as soon as it is practicable,  is  to\r\n\r\nreach the one per cent rate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  growth. By 1970, at the end of the present  five-year family planning programme, we will reach 1.5 per\r\n\r\ncent, It is going to be much harder to reach one  per\r\n\r\ncent  growth rate because the rate of fall from three\r\n\r\nper  cent  to  two per cent is always  much  quicker,\r\n\r\nwhereas the rate of fail from two per cent to one per\r\n\r\ncent  requires  a  tremendous  effort.  So  far,   no\r\n\r\ndeveloping  country has achieved this  and  we  shall\r\n\r\nonly  achieve it with a broad measure of support  for\r\n\r\nall  measures  of population control and  our  family\r\n\r\nplanning programme needs all the support it  can  get\r\n\r\nto achieve its goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent social measures have been introduced and\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Employment Act, much to the unhappiness\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Bras Basah, maternity leave  after\r\n\r\nthe  third pregnancy is denied. This measure and  the\r\n\r\nraising   of   hospitalisation  charges   for   later\r\n\r\npregnancies are part of the broad Government  support\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Voluntary Sterilization  Bill,  of\r\n\r\nfamily  planning in Singapore. This Bill is a further\r\n\r\nmeasure in our effort to control the growth of population  and this work is by no means done yet, although\r\n\r\nwe  have  achieved considerable success to date.  Far\r\n\r\nfrom  tarnishing the good name of the  Republic,  the\r\n\r\npassage  of  the Abortion Bill, which is a  piece  of\r\n\r\nmodern  social legislation conceived for the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  women  and  their families as  well  as  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of Singapore, will redound to the credit  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, whatever some hon. Members may  like\r\n\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications has pointed out how much this Bill means as a further and final step in the emancipation of women in Singapore - women who are already enjoying equaL rights, equal pay and a host of privileges provided for in the Women's Charter. The emancipation of women is the logical consequence\r\n\r\nof  our efforts tobuild a just and equal society with\r\n\r\nequal  and adequate opportunities for the living  and\r\n\r\nthose who are to he born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just summarise the\r\n\r\ncentral  purpose  of the Bill' it is  to  reform  and\r\n\r\nliberalise the law of abortion in Singapore which  is\r\n\r\nal   present   not  only  uncertain  and   completely\r\n\r\nunenlightened  and restrictive, but also  ineffective\r\n\r\nin  that  the  majority of our women, faced  with  an\r\n\r\nunwanted pregnancy, resort to be relieved by going to\r\n\r\nthe back-street or illegal abortionists, usually with\r\n\r\ntragic results. It offers an alternative to our women\r\n\r\nwho  qualify under the specific conditions as set out\r\n\r\nin   the   Bill   to  have  an  abortion   which   is\r\n\r\ncomparatively  safe and under aseptic conditions,  it\r\n\r\nthereby liberates our women from the fear of unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancies, it also benefits the family by ensuring,\r\n\r\nas  far  as possible, that every person born in  that\r\n\r\nfamily  is a wanted child and also avoids the tragedy\r\n\r\nof  having  children  born with  physical  or  mental\r\n\r\nabnormalities.  It therefore serves  to  protect  the\r\n\r\nhealth  and  welfare of the mother  as  well  as  her\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Bill will also enhance the welfare of\r\n\r\nour  community by ensuring that every child  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  wanted child. It also  ensures  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  our  children  and  that  they  will  be\r\n\r\nproperly   cared  for  and  have  opportunities   for\r\n\r\neducation and the full development of their faculties\r\n\r\nso that they can grow up and lead meaningful lives in\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress again, Mr Speaker. Sir, that this\r\n\r\nBill  does respect the religious and ethical  beliefs\r\n\r\nof  our people. No one is forced to have an abortion.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  to  those  whose  ethical  and  religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs have made them oppose abortion, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask them again this question: Is it right in  our\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  and  multi-religious  society  for  any\r\n\r\nperson  or  group of persons, on grounds of religious\r\n\r\ndogmas,  to deny others, whose religious and  ethical\r\n\r\nbeliefs  do not forbid them to have an abortion, the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to take advantage of the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis  proposed  law? If their ethical  and  religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs  forbid them to support abortion,  the  least\r\n\r\nthey  can do, in the name of humanity, is to  abstain\r\n\r\nfrom voting against the Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The  three\r\n\r\nlaws  are  a charter to liberate women from  unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancies  and are as far-reaching in their  social\r\n\r\nimport  as  the Employment Act, the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  (Amendment)  Act  and the industrial  Relations\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Act are to the working community.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Voluntary Sterilization Bill provides for a\r\n\r\nmeans of preventing the unwanted or harmful pregnancy\r\n\r\nby  the  sterilization of either the female  or  male\r\n\r\npartner  of  a  union.  Female  sterilization  is  at\r\n\r\npresent  practised quite frequently, in this country,\r\n\r\nthe need for it, and possibly for male sterilization,\r\n\r\nis  likely to increase progressively. There  are  far\r\n\r\nfewer  ethical  objections to these  operations  than\r\n\r\nthose to the termination of pregnancies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our present law in regard to sterilization is\r\n\r\nobscure  and  much  open to criticism.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nspecific reference in the Penal Code to sterilization\r\n\r\nexcept reference to emasculation, which is an offence\r\n\r\ndefined as a grevious hurt.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, sterilization is probably not unlawful\r\n\r\nprovided  there  is full and valid  consent  for  the\r\n\r\noperation  and  that it was done for the  benefit  or\r\n\r\nwell-being  of the person. But this is  by  no  means\r\n\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless sterilization is performed for the purpose of\r\n\r\ntreatment, it might however be considered an  assault\r\n\r\non  the  person  if performed for any other  reasons,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  for family limitation, social and  economic\r\n\r\npressures, high parity and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neugenic  considerations. In such circunistances,  the\r\n\r\noperation is not made lawful even if consent is given\r\n\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposition, however, has no direct judicial\r\n\r\nauthority  to support it, because it has  never  been\r\n\r\ntested in a court of law, Therefore, the state of the\r\n\r\nlaw  on the subject is such that no one can say  with\r\n\r\ncertainty what the law is. Meanwhile, doctors have to\r\n\r\ntake  responsibility for the sterilization operations\r\n\r\nwhich  they have to perform to protect the health  of\r\n\r\nwomen  and  to protect mothers from giving  birth  to\r\n\r\npotentially abnormal babies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill, therefore, is to correct the\r\n\r\nambiguity  in  the  laws regarding sterilization.  It\r\n\r\nwill  make it lawful for sterilization operations  to\r\n\r\nhe  performed for purely medical conditions as a form\r\n\r\nof   treatment  if  the  registered  practitioner  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with another practitioner agrees that it\r\n\r\nis necessary.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any other case, the operation can be performed on\r\n\r\nany  person  so long as the person is  (a)  above  21\r\n\r\nyears  of age; (b) has the valid consent not only  of\r\n\r\nhimself  but of his wife, if he is married;  and  (c)\r\n\r\nhas  three or more living children. If the person  is\r\n\r\nunder age, the operation can be performed only if the\r\n\r\nparents  or  guardians of the person signify  consent\r\n\r\nfor  such  treatment; or if the person  is  afflicted\r\n\r\nwith   any  hereditary  form  of  illness   that   is\r\n\r\nrecurrent, mental deficiency or epilepsy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilization has such a vital part to play in the\r\n\r\nprevention of pregnancy from the stand-point  of  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of  the  individual or the happiness  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily and for population control, that the need  for\r\n\r\nnew  legislation  to  cover  its  performance  is  as\r\n\r\nurgently required as that for the Abortion Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that the Abortion Bill should be\r\n\r\ncomplemented with the simultaneous passage of  a  law\r\n\r\non sterilization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made in describing the Abortion Bill\r\n\r\nthat  it  was the experience in some countries  which\r\n\r\nhad  liberalized  their  laws  on  abortions  that  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  number  of women  were  having  repeated\r\n\r\nabortions. For such women, it would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npreferable  to undergo sterilization than be  allowed\r\n\r\nto go through repeated ordeals of abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be infinitely simpler if niarried couples\r\n\r\nsubmit to sterilization after they have the number of\r\n\r\nchildren  they  have planned for.  For  a  relatively\r\n\r\nsimple operation they are rid once and for all of the\r\n\r\nworry  of  a possible unplanned pregnancy. For  them,\r\n\r\nthey are once and for all rid of the inconvenience of\r\n\r\npractising contraception. They will also he free from\r\n\r\nany further expenditure for birth-control measures.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the woman burdened with the care of too many\r\n\r\nchildren,  where  her health is  sapped  by  repeated\r\n\r\npregnancies,  it  is a relief to  be  free  from  the\r\n\r\ntyranny of fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent report of a series of 186 sterilised women\r\n\r\nfrom  the Medical Research Council, Medical Sociology\r\n\r\nResearch Unit, in the University of Aberdeen,  showed\r\n\r\nthat  most of the women were satisfied with and  were\r\n\r\nenthusiastic advocates of sterilization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilization will also be permitted for eugenic\r\n\r\nreasons.  For  example, it would be  permitted  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  a likelihood of transmission of hereditary\r\n\r\ndiseases  or where one of the partners is insane,  or\r\n\r\nmanic-depressive, or schizophrenic, or feeble-minded.\r\n\r\nIn  words  that  have become memorable,  Mr  Justice\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes, a great jurist, delivered  the\r\n\r\nfollowing opinion:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is better for all the world, if instead of\r\n\r\nwaiting to execute a degenerate offspring for  crime,\r\n\r\nor  to  let them starve for their imbecility, society\r\n\r\ncan  prevent  those  who  are manifestly  unfit  from\r\n\r\ncontinuing their kind.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation in the male is a simple one. It is\r\n\r\ndone  under local anaesthetic and can be done in  any\r\n\r\nout-patient surgery. Perhaps the Member for Joo Chiat\r\n\r\nwill know this better. In the operation, each of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  small tubes, known as the vas deferens,  leading\r\n\r\nfrom  the  testes are cut. In this way, sterility  is\r\n\r\nachieved  without  affecting  the  man's  libido   or\r\n\r\nvirility  and there is a good chance that  the  tubes\r\n\r\nmay  be  re-joined, if required, successfully  at  a\r\n\r\nlater date. This operation is medically known as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvasectomy.  It  is important to point out  here  that\r\n\r\nthis is entirely different from castration, which  is\r\n\r\na form of emasculation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In women, the operation is less simple as the tubes\r\n\r\nleading  from  the  woman's  ovaries,  known  as  the\r\n\r\nFallopian tubes, are within the abdominal cavity. The\r\n\r\noperation requires a small incision into the abdomen,\r\n\r\nbut  the  other part of the operation  is  nearly  as\r\n\r\nsimple  as for a male. Here again, I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor Joo Chiat will know this better. The operation is\r\n\r\nrequired to be done under general anaesthesia and the\r\n\r\npatient  has  to  be  warded. Needless  to  say,  the\r\n\r\noperation  carries slightly more risk  compared  with\r\n\r\nthe  negligible risks of the operation on  the  male.\r\n\r\nThe operation on the female is called a ligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Abortion Bill, there are certain safeguards\r\n\r\nwritten  into the Voluntary Sterilization Bill  which\r\n\r\nwill  effectively prevent abuse. One of the important\r\n\r\nsafeguards  is  never  to  permit  sterilization   of\r\n\r\npersons against the person's will. We must never  get\r\n\r\ninto  the  position where the Bill,  introduced  with\r\n\r\nsuch high ideals and good intentions, is exploited by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  and cruel persons as had-  happened  in\r\n\r\nthe  mad days of Nazi Germany during the Second World\r\n\r\nWar   where   several  thousands  of   persons   were\r\n\r\nsterilized without their consent. We must  never  get\r\n\r\ninto  the position where this law can be used against\r\n\r\nparticular persons or against a community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is to allow for sterilization of persons to\r\n\r\nbe  done  entirely voluntarily and  at  the  person's\r\n\r\nrequest. Coercion will be an offence. Since there are\r\n\r\nboth serious social and medical implications for  the\r\n\r\noperations of sterilization which have essentially  a\r\n\r\npermanent result and cannot be so easily undone, very\r\n\r\ncareful  safeguards  have been introduced  and  these\r\n\r\nare:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The authority of a Eugenics Board will be\r\n\r\nrequired  to authorise the sterilization of  persons.\r\n\r\nThe  Board will consist of five members who  will  include a Judge, two registered medical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractitioners  and  two  others  appointed   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister,  one  of whom must have had  experience  in\r\n\r\nsocial welfare work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Consent of the person, parent or guardian in\r\n\r\ncase  the applicant is below 21 years of age, and  of\r\n\r\nthe  spouse  should the person be  married,  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired.  The  reason for requiring consent  of  the\r\n\r\nmarital  partner  is that the operation  without  the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the spouse can be considered  a  marital\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Sterilization will be carried out only in\r\n\r\nGovernment hospitals or an approved institution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The operation will be carried out only after a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  30 days has elapsed from the day  of  the\r\n\r\napplication  in  order  to  give  time   should   the\r\n\r\napplicant change his mind.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) For the medical practitioner and other medical\r\n\r\nstaff, a conscience clause is included in the Bill so\r\n\r\nthat no person will be obliged to participate in such\r\n\r\nan operation if it is against his conscience.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) The Bill will continue to be in force for a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  four years, which may be extended  for  a\r\n\r\nfurther  period  of one year, which in  effect  means\r\n\r\nthat  a  critical assessment can be made  as  to  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the legislation and Parliament  will\r\n\r\nhave the opportunity for debate on it again if it  is\r\n\r\nto be re-enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill makes provisions making it\r\n\r\nlegal to carry out the operations of sterilization on\r\n\r\na  male  or  female  person  on  application  and  by\r\n\r\napproval of a Eugenics Board. Sterilization does  not\r\n\r\ncarry  the  same emotional and ethical considerations\r\n\r\nas  those raised by legalised abortion. Sterilization\r\n\r\nis   a  form  of  contraception  which  is  virtually\r\n\r\nsterilization for life. As such, it has the advantage\r\n\r\nover  the  other  forms  of contraceptive  techniques\r\n\r\nwhich   are   less  convenient,  and  not  completely\r\n\r\neffective.  But  being irreversible, serious  thought\r\n\r\nmust be given by the applicant and great care must be\r\n\r\ntaken by the Board in approving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe application before the operation is undertaken so\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  never regretted.

This method is  generally\r\n\r\nasked  for  by  women who already have more  children\r\n\r\nthan  they  can adequately care for, and  the  simple\r\n\r\noperation   is   normally  done   immediately   after\r\n\r\nchildbirth. I have witnessed such an operation. It is\r\n\r\nthe  most convenient contraceptive method for  women,\r\n\r\nespecially:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) those in the low income group who need a\r\n\r\nreliable  family  planning  method  which   is\r\n\r\npermanent  and without incurring any recurrent\r\n\r\ncost;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) those whose education is low and therefore\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty understanding the anatomy  of\r\n\r\nthe body and the whys and wherefores of conception; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) those whose husbands, unfortunately, are most\r\n\r\nuncooperative  and  show little  understanding\r\n\r\nand  feeling,  by refusing to countenance  any\r\n\r\nvisible form of contraception being practised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical sterilization, fortunately, is not a\r\n\r\ncontroversial issue as mentioned by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health, as in the case of legalisation\r\n\r\nof  abortion and is generally being accepted  as  the\r\n\r\nmost  reliable  method for family planning  purposes.\r\n\r\nThis is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnothing new therefore and is, in fact, offered as the\r\n\r\nnumber  three order of priority to women in Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  family  planning method under the Government's\r\n\r\nFive-Year Mass Family Planning programme.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to quote the following relevant\r\n\r\nparagraph  of  the  White Paper  on  Family  Planning\r\n\r\n(Command  Paper  No.  22  of  1965)  tabled  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament on 27th September, 1965:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Choice of Family Planning Methods</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'5.2 It is the aim of this Plan therefore to be both\r\n\r\nbold  and imaginative by offering all who want Family\r\n\r\nPlanning a \"menu card\" as it were, of choices in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing order of preference:\r\n\r\n<pre>         \r\n\r\n           (a) Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD).\r\n\r\n           (b) Contraceptive Pill (CP).\r\n\r\n           (c) Surgical  sterilisation through ligation, \r\n\r\n                   etc.(for those with 6 or more children).\r\n\r\n           (d) Diaphragm with Paste.\r\n\r\n           (e) Vaginal tablet types.\r\n\r\n           (f) Condoms.\r\n\r\n           (g) Rhythm method.\r\n\r\n</pre>  \r\n\r\n<br>but the whole emphasis of the Plan is to offer IUCD.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now, our Kandang Kerbau Maternity\r\n\r\nHospital  has been performing a few hundred  of  such\r\n\r\ncases  each  year,  at  the request  of  the  mothers\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of surgical sterilization for males,\r\n\r\nwhich  in  medical  jargon is called  vasectomy,  the\r\n\r\nmethod  seems  to be popular in some  countries  like\r\n\r\nIndia,  where it has recently been reported  that  as\r\n\r\nmany as 5,7 million have been sterilized, of whom  80\r\n\r\nper  cent are males, in Singapore, however, vasectomy\r\n\r\nhas  not quite caught on. I think this House will  be\r\n\r\ninterested in a true case history which occurred when\r\n\r\nI was in the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th December, 1967, I received a letter in\r\n\r\nChinese from a Naval Base worker and the free English\r\n\r\ntranslation goes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dear Minister Yong,\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be pleased if you could let me know whether\r\n\r\nour  Government  Hospitals provide services  for  the\r\n\r\nsterilization of men\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- i.e. vasectomy.  I  intend   to   undergo   this\r\n\r\nsterilization as a means of family planning. I  am  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Citizen  and  I  now  have  six   children\r\n\r\nalready, their ages ranging from 15 years, 14  years,\r\n\r\n13 years, 11 years, 7 years and l\u00bd years. I am now 41\r\n\r\nyears  of  age and my wife is 34 years old. According\r\n\r\nto information given to me she is in the most fertile\r\n\r\nage group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I had my fourth child, I had starteti to\r\n\r\npractise  birth control. Despite this I had two  more\r\n\r\nchildren. This is most distressing. I have tried  all\r\n\r\nthe  methods of birth control, and the latest  method\r\n\r\nused  was  the  oral pills, which my  wife  had  been\r\n\r\ntaking for the past few years. But unfortunately  she\r\n\r\ndid not agree with the pills and developed rashes all\r\n\r\nover  her  body. She had consulted a doctor who  gave\r\n\r\nher  injections and medicines to take  by  mouth  but\r\n\r\nthese were of no avail. This is most distressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Family Planning Board held its exhibition\r\n\r\nat  the Victoria Memorial Hall this year, I specially\r\n\r\nwent  there  to learn more about family planning.  At\r\n\r\nthat exhibition I bought a book on \"The hows and whys\r\n\r\nof  modern family planning\". After carefully studying\r\n\r\nthis  book I am convinced that vasectomy as described\r\n\r\nin  that book is the best method of birth control for\r\n\r\nme.  So  I went to the Family Planning Clinic at  the\r\n\r\nKandang Kerbau Hospital for advice and service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by a nurse in the clinic that at the\r\n\r\nmoment  the Government does not provide this  service\r\n\r\nand  that if I wanted this service I should write  to\r\n\r\nyou  and  perhaps  you may be able to  give  me  some\r\n\r\nguidance.   Finally  she  also  recommended   me   to\r\n\r\nYoungberg  Memorial Hospital where  this  service  is\r\n\r\nbeing provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Minister, when I went to the Youngberg Hospital to enquire about this service, I was surprised to hear from a member of the staff there that the operation fee alone was $108.00, and inclusive of medicines and injections the total charges would come to about $130.00. My monthly salary is only $252.00\r\n\r\nwith  which  I  have  to  feed  a  family  of  eight.\r\n\r\nMoreover, three of my children are in middle schools\r\n\r\nand two in primary schools. To meet daily expenses is\r\n\r\nalready  a difficult task, and to spend half  of  one\r\n\r\nmonth's salary on this operation would be impossible.\r\n\r\nBecause I am in dire need of this operation and  have\r\n\r\ntherefore  taken the liberty to write to you,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope that you will he able to recommend me to one  of\r\n\r\nthe Government Hospitals to have this safe and simple\r\n\r\noperation done.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was indeed touched by the highly responsible\r\n\r\noutlook  of this man, over his deep concern over  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  his  wife and family. I  therefore  gave\r\n\r\ninstructions that this man's wishes for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvasectomy be met at the earliest possible date.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to state that the simple and successful\r\n\r\noperation  was  performed  by  none  other  than  the\r\n\r\nProfessor  of  Surgery, Mr Chan Kong  Thoe,  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, and I was privileged  to  be\r\n\r\npresent  at  the operation which took  place  in  the\r\n\r\nOutram Road General Hospital on 26th January, 1968.
