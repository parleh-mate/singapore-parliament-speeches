M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, the matter has been considered\r\n\r\nbut  it  has  been  decided  that  it  would  not  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  to change the rate of interest  paid  by\r\n\r\nthe Post Office Savings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.O. Savings Bank does not compete with\r\n\r\ncommercial banks or borrowers appealing to  investors\r\n\r\nin  the stock market. It does not raise or lower  its\r\n\r\nrate   of  interest  on  deposits  in  sympathy  with\r\n\r\nmovements  in the stock exchange. It aims  at  giving\r\n\r\npeople in the lower income group easy facilities  for\r\n\r\nsaving  small  amounts in circumstances  of  absolute\r\n\r\nsecurity,  and  guarantees a rate of  interest  which\r\n\r\nremains  steady and certain over the years and  which\r\n\r\nis  reasonable having regard to the security and  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  afforded by the Bank. In this  connection\r\n\r\nit  is perhaps interesting to note that despite booms\r\n\r\nand depressions, disasters and victories, the rate of\r\n\r\ninterest paid by the P.O. Savings Bank in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom has remained at 2 per cent since 1864;  while\r\n\r\nthe rate of interest paid by the P.O. Savings Bank in\r\n\r\nthe  United States of America has remained at  2  per\r\n\r\ncent since 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is open to doubt whether the P.O. Savings Bank\r\n\r\ncould  in  fact  raise the rate of  interest  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time even if it were regarded as politic  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  As  the hon., Member is no doubt aware;  the\r\n\r\nP.O. Savings Bank is intended to be a self-supporting\r\n\r\ninstitution. Its deposits are required by law  to  be\r\n\r\ninvested   in   trustee   stocks,   which   yield   a\r\n\r\ncomparatively low rate of interest. Its income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis   derived   solely   from  interest   from   these\r\n\r\ninvestments.  From  this income,  it  must  meet  its\r\n\r\noperating  costs  and  pay the rate  of  interest  on\r\n\r\ndeposits, which is prescribed by law. It should also,\r\n\r\nif  circumstances permit, build up a reserve  against\r\n\r\ndepreciation  of  investments.  If  its   income   is\r\n\r\ninsufficient  to meet running expenses and  statutory\r\n\r\ninterest charges, the deficit must, by law,  be  made\r\n\r\ngood  by  Government. The financial position  of  the\r\n\r\nBank   at   the  present  time  has  been   examined.\r\n\r\nIndications clearly are that if the rate of  interest\r\n\r\nwere to be now raised to 3 per cent - which would still\r\n\r\nbe  low compared with the yields obtainable elsewhere\r\n\r\nunder  stable  and secure investment - the  Bank  would\r\n\r\nfind  difficulty in meeting its running expenses  and\r\n\r\ninterest  charges, and the deficit would have  to  be\r\n\r\nmet  from the general revenue by Government.  Such  a\r\n\r\nsituation would not, I am sure, be in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe wishes of the hon.

These matters will, of course, Sir,  be\r\n\r\ndealt  with in greater detail in connection with  the\r\n\r\nBudget on 20th November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir, which I would like to\r\n\r\nmention before I close, and that is that I propose to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  item  218  on page 9 of the  message.  That\r\n\r\ndeals  with  the item \"Subhead 14, item (2) -  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Maternity Hospital\" under Head D49 Medical and\r\n\r\nHealth.

As\r\n\r\nwill  be  seen, Sir, from Schedule A of the Sessional\r\n\r\npaper,  the task of revision and rationalisation  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  monumental  one and it  says  much  for  the\r\n\r\nability and good sense of all concerned that  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen completed so successfully. Some idea of what the\r\n\r\ntask  has involved and of the success which has  come\r\n\r\nof  it  will be gained from the fact that 55 existing\r\n\r\nsalary  scales  have been reduced to  12  key  salary\r\n\r\nscales plus five variations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the command paper and the schedules\r\n\r\ngive  a  clear  picture of what  has  been  done.  In\r\n\r\nSchedule A the 17 new scales are shown in the  right-hand column by means of the Roman numeral IV plus one\r\n\r\nor  more  letters  of  the alphabet.  Comparisons  of\r\n\r\ncolumns one and two will give a clear picture of  how\r\n\r\nexisting posts and grades have been absorbed into new\r\n\r\nmain classifications. Pensionable posts are shown  in\r\n\r\ncapital  letters, non-pensionable posts are shown  in\r\n\r\nitalics. Schedule B gives a list of posts which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  upgraded.  Schedule C is  the  usual  financial\r\n\r\nsummary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one point which I should mention\r\n\r\nand  which  has inadvertently been omitted  from  the\r\n\r\ncommand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaper.

These officers  will\r\n\r\nbe  paid  salaries as follows: if they are  below  16\r\n\r\nyears  of age, they will be paid 70 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nminimum  basic salary of the grade to which they  are\r\n\r\nappointed, rounded off to the nearest dollar; if they\r\n\r\nare  over 16 but under 17 years of age, they will  be\r\n\r\npaid 80 per cent of that salary; and if they are over\r\n\r\n17  but  below 18 years of age, they will be paid  90\r\n\r\nper  cent of that salary.

The rate of interest approved was 5 per\r\n\r\ncent  and the stock was subject to redemption at  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of the City Council at any  time  between\r\n\r\n1966  and  1976 on due notice being given. The  issue\r\n\r\nwas  intended to be a conversion issue in so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  City Council had decided to redeem the Singapore\r\n\r\nMunicipal  5 per cent Debenture Stock 1926 and  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  a  substantial number of the  holders  of  that\r\n\r\nstock would convert into the new stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new issue was favourably received by the\r\n\r\ninvesting   public.   The  Central   Provident   Fund\r\n\r\nsupported it generously and by April of this year the\r\n\r\nfull  amount of the issue had been taken up. The City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  however, was still in urgent need of  funds\r\n\r\nfor its public utility undertakings, and, rather than\r\n\r\nfloat  a  new loan, it was decided to seek permission\r\n\r\nto   raise  the  ceiling  of  the  existing  loan  to\r\n\r\n$50,000,000. This was the subject of a motion to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  in April of this year when it was  resolved\r\n\r\nthat the authorised amount of the 1956 loan would  be\r\n\r\nincreased to $50,000,000. Subscriptions continued  to\r\n\r\nbe  made  to  the  loan  for  some  time  after  this\r\n\r\nresolution, was passed. By the middle of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe year, however, the downward movement in the value\r\n\r\nof  gilt-edged  securities had become marked,  yields\r\n\r\nhad  increased, and a 5 per cent loan at par  had  no\r\n\r\nlonger  many attractions for investors. The  position\r\n\r\nat  the beginning of September was that subscriptions\r\n\r\nhad  ceased  to  come in and a total  of  $13,000,000\r\n\r\nremained unsubscribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need of the City Council for funds to meet\r\n\r\nimpending bills, however, remained urgent. The matter\r\n\r\nwas  discussed with the City Council authorities  and\r\n\r\nit was decided that in all the circumstances existing\r\n\r\nat  the present time, it would be wiser to issue  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  the  existing loan at a discount  rather\r\n\r\nthan float a new loan at a higher rate of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter has also been discussed with the\r\n\r\nauthorities of the Central Provident Fund, which,  as\r\n\r\nyou  know,  is the main source of investment  capital\r\n\r\navailable to Government and the City Council  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time.  The Board has agreed to  support  the\r\n\r\nissue of the balance of the existing 5 per cent  loan\r\n\r\nif  the issue price is reduced to allow a discount of\r\n\r\n10  per  cent. This discount gives a yield of 5?  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  redemption and is in line with the  present\r\n\r\nyield on similarly dated stock in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Sir, I second the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.41 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, in this Assembly on 29th July, in the debate  in\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  the Local Government  Bill,  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin  moved  an  amendment  which   I\r\n\r\nopposed, and which amendment was to the, effect  that\r\n\r\nloans  raised  by the City Council should  be  funded\r\n\r\nover  the  life of the physical assets to which  they\r\n\r\nrelated  and not the period from issue to redemption.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, the House had been in committee on the Bill\r\n\r\nfor  several  days  and, I suspect,  the  Press  were\r\n\r\ngetting  rather bored with the debate. Certainly  the\r\n\r\nPress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGallery  was pretty empty and the Public Gallery  was\r\n\r\nquite empty, and I am sure that the star reporters of\r\n\r\nthe  various newspapers were absent at that time. But\r\n\r\nbe  that  as it may, I was reported at that  time  as\r\n\r\nsaying  that  there was a feeling  that  the  Malayan\r\n\r\ndollar  was slipping. Now, in point of fact,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmade   no   reference  whatsoever  to   depreciation,\r\n\r\nsupposed  or  otherwise, of the  Malayan  dollar;  at\r\n\r\nleast  not specifically. I am, Sir, a member  of  the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Board  and  I  know something  about  these\r\n\r\nthings.  But  in  any case as a  banker  I  am  fully\r\n\r\nconversant  with the Currency Ordinance  and  I  know\r\n\r\nthat the Malayan dollar, the Straits dollar, is fully\r\n\r\nbacked  by  sterling  and is at least  as  strong  as\r\n\r\nsterling. Besides, I repeatedly told this House on  a\r\n\r\nprevious occasion that the only currencies to survive\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese holocaust were the Straits  dollar  and\r\n\r\nthe  Hongkong dollar, because they had 100  per  cent\r\n\r\nbacking.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what I was drawing attention to was at\r\n\r\nthat  time  the universal depreciation of Currencies,\r\n\r\nto  creeping inflation with its inevitable commitment\r\n\r\nof  world-wide  reluctance to  invest  in  gilt-edged\r\n\r\nsecurities,  that is government and municipal  bonds,\r\n\r\nor  indeed  in  any  other  type  of  fixed  interest\r\n\r\nsecurities.  The position of course is exactly  as  I\r\n\r\nstated  it  was and there has been no change  in  the\r\n\r\ninterim.  On the contrary, there has been  a  further\r\n\r\nslump  in  gilt-edged markets in  the  sterling  area\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  counter-inflationary measure  by  the\r\n\r\nBank  of England in raising the Bank Rate by two  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  seven per cent per annum. Now, Sir, whether\r\n\r\nor  no  such  action is an effective  weapon  in  the\r\n\r\nbattle against inflation is a matter of opinion.  The\r\n\r\nrelevance  of  all this, Sir, is this:  that  however\r\n\r\nunpalatable it may be to local investors who may have\r\n\r\npurchased  this stock fairly recently  and  now  find\r\n\r\nthat it is offered at a greater discount, the fact is\r\n\r\nthat  the  present  decision is  both  necessary  and\r\n\r\ninevitable. These are facts which intelligent  people\r\n\r\nmust fully realise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be those who feel that we should ignore\r\n\r\neconomic changes in other parts of the sterling area,\r\n\r\nbut as long\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the  existing fiscal and economic links  continue\r\n\r\nwith  the  United  Kingdom,  we  cannot  successfully\r\n\r\nmaintain  any attitude of economic isolation.  It  is\r\n\r\ndoubtful  if  we  could. Even  if  this  island  were\r\n\r\ncompletely  and utterly independent, we should  still\r\n\r\nbe  faced  with  the same position, as its  existence\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the  free and unrestricted  movement  of\r\n\r\nmoney  and that presupposes an approximate parity  of\r\n\r\ninterest and discount rates with those in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council wants this money.

My  motion  now\r\n\r\nseeks to extend the continuance of the Ordinance  for\r\n\r\na  further  period of one year as from 8th  December,\r\n\r\n1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance gives the Minister powers to make\r\n\r\norders  prohibiting the import and export  of  goods.\r\n\r\nHowever, in keeping with our tree trade policy, these\r\n\r\npowers  are used very sparingly as hon. Members  know\r\n\r\nvery  well,  and  except for a  comparatively  narrow\r\n\r\nfield,  most  imports are placed on the open  general\r\n\r\nlicence  and exports are freely licensed. The  powers\r\n\r\nof  control,  however,  can be useful  in  regulating\r\n\r\nimports  for balance of payments reasons,  especially\r\n\r\nfrom  the  hard  currency areas, but here  again  all\r\n\r\nessential,   and  many  semi-essential,   goods   are\r\n\r\nlicensed  freely. These powers also provide a  useful\r\n\r\ncheck   for   the  purpose  of  disease  control   in\r\n\r\nconnection with imports of plants, animals and  meat.\r\n\r\nIn  the export field, the powers under this Ordinance\r\n\r\nare  used  to  keep a check on exports  of  strategic\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  essential items in  short  supply  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At present controls on exports  are  very\r\n\r\nfew  in  number.  It is, however, necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister to have such powers of control and the Trade\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council has been consulted  and  it  agrees\r\n\r\nwith this view.

It   is   still  subject   to   drafting\r\n\r\namendments.   I  would  have  wished  to   give   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to the House for a longer period to study\r\n\r\nbefore  this  debate,  but  last  Saturday  was   the\r\n\r\nearliest possible date for tabling and today  is  the\r\n\r\nlatest  practicable day for taking the debate  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to  complete all the necessary matters connected\r\n\r\nwith  the  agreement  before  the  end  of  the  last\r\n\r\nextension  of  the agreement. And  I  must  ask  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to note that we cannot accept any amendments\r\n\r\nto  the terms of the agreement. The Government has  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional  responsibility  for  negotiating  and\r\n\r\nsigning agreements of this sort.

The  agreement is a sound one. It  reconciles\r\n\r\nthe  divergent  interests of  all  concerned  and  it\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  serves all concerned  in  the  best  way\r\n\r\npossible in the practical circumstances.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also ask Members of the House, Sir, to note\r\n\r\nthat  this agreement covers only a part of the future\r\n\r\noperations  of Malayan Airways. There is  with  us  a\r\n\r\ncomplementary agreement which will be signed  between\r\n\r\nthe  three  Borneo territories of the  one  part  and\r\n\r\nMalayan   Airways  of  the  other  part.  These   two\r\n\r\nagreements  are  fully  interlocking,  complementary,\r\n\r\ninterdependent,  and they will together  provide  the\r\n\r\nfirm  basis on which Malayan Airways will be able  to\r\n\r\noperate aviation services throughout the whole Malaya-Borneo area.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement is particularly satisfactory, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, because it is an example of international co-operation on the best social principles. We have  all\r\n\r\nbeen saddened no doubt in recent years by the unhappy\r\n\r\nspectacle  of nations selfishly and greedily  seeking\r\n\r\nwhat they consider to be their national interests  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of other nations. That selfish and greedy\r\n\r\nconduct of nations has in the past plunged the  world\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  tragic futility of war and may do so again  with\r\n\r\nhorrible  results for us all. Here we have a reversal\r\n\r\nof  that  unhappy situation. We have five territories\r\n\r\ncoming  together and making an agreement which  fully\r\n\r\nembodies the principle that the good of each is  best\r\n\r\nserved to the mutual good of all. It is a most  happy\r\n\r\naugury  that the Government of the Federation should,\r\n\r\nat the outset of its period of independence, have so\r\n\r\nfully  accepted  and carried out this principle;  and\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore, with self-government in hand, should\r\n\r\nhave  gone  along  as well. It is a model  which  the\r\n\r\ngreater Powers of the world might very well follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our Singapore point of view, this agreement\r\n\r\nmatches  our historic function and duty  of  being  a\r\n\r\ncentre  of communications and services for this  part\r\n\r\nof  the  world, and indeed for the whole  world.  The\r\n\r\nfive  territories  concerned will  all  benefit  from\r\n\r\nhaving  a strong, economically sound airline  linking\r\n\r\nthem   efficiently.  They  will  derive  far  greater\r\n\r\nbenefits from that than they could have derived  from\r\n\r\nany policy of isolationism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal briefly with the economic aspects of\r\n\r\nthe  agreement when I come to the end of  my  motion,\r\n\r\nSir.  But  I  would  point out here  that  for  sound\r\n\r\ninvestment the scale of operations of an airline must\r\n\r\nmatch  the  capital invested. If you  have  airplanes\r\n\r\nidle  on  the  ground when they could  be  fruitfully\r\n\r\ncarrying passengers and freight in the air,  you  are\r\n\r\nsuffering  a dead loss; and there is every hope  that\r\n\r\nunder  this  agreement  the scale  of  operations  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways will be such as to match  the  fixed\r\n\r\ncapital   employed,  because  we  have   these   five\r\n\r\nterritories working in real partnership together with\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways as their common servants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should like to pay a high tribute to the Hon.\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Yoke  Lin,  who at the time  of  the  major\r\n\r\nnegotiations  of this agreement was the Minister  for\r\n\r\nTransport  in the Federation. His negotiating  skill,\r\n\r\nhis  grasp of principle, his statesmanlike leadership\r\n\r\nplayed a vital part in securing the general adherence\r\n\r\nof  all  concerned to this agreement. We  owe  him  a\r\n\r\ngreat debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Mr Speaker, I need go through this\r\n\r\nagreement clause by clause.

Number 8 bears the  appearance\r\n\r\nof  a  subsidy  clause but, as far  as  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it is an appearance rather than a reality.\r\n\r\nBy  international custom, international  flights  get\r\n\r\ntheir  aviation spirit free of tax and, consequently,\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways  will, under  this  clause,  receive\r\n\r\nnothing   more  than  all  other  operators   through\r\n\r\nSingapore  also  receive. Similarly, as  regards  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  from duties on spare parts and  engines  and\r\n\r\nthat  kind  of thing, Singapore is of course  a  free\r\n\r\nport  so  that, as far as Singapore goes, this  is  a\r\n\r\ndead-letter clause.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next clause - of very great importance - is clause\r\n\r\nnumber  15. It deserves the closest attention of  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  In  clause  15  (1) we provide  that  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  shall have exclusive rights on the  services\r\n\r\nin the First Schedule and on additions thereto during\r\n\r\nseven years, that is the first seven years of the 10-year franchise. And in 15 (2) we provide that Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways shall, for the remainder of the term  of  the\r\n\r\nagreement,  a  further three years,  be  entitled  to\r\n\r\noperate  all  the services which it was operating  at\r\n\r\nthe end of the first seven years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, the Federation and Borneo safeguard\r\n\r\ntheir  special interests by making provision for  the\r\n\r\npossible  sharing  of  additional  services   between\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways and Borneo Airways for  Borneo,  and\r\n\r\nbetween  Malayan  Airways and an airline  for  Malaya\r\n\r\nduring the last three years of the agreement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause, in short, provides transitional\r\n\r\npossibilities if some transition is necessary  during\r\n\r\nthe  latter years of the franchise. It is a difficult\r\n\r\nclause to summarise and indeed a difficult clause  to\r\n\r\nunderstand.   It   involves   both   the    technical\r\n\r\ncomplexities   of   the   law   and   the   technical\r\n\r\ncomplexities  of  civil aviation  practice,  and  the\r\n\r\ncombination of all these complexities produces a sort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  verbal algebra which personally takes me a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of time to make sense of. If hon. Members  want\r\n\r\nme  to make it clear no doubt they will say so and  I\r\n\r\nwill  try to clear up their minds in my reply to  the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause does illustrate the difficulty of\r\n\r\nputting  into  readily  comprehensible  and  not  too\r\n\r\nunwieldy   language  an  agreement   which   concerns\r\n\r\ndifferent  territories with to some extent  different\r\n\r\nspecial  needs. We had envisaged the  writing  of  an\r\n\r\nagreement  which  would have  covered  all  the  five\r\n\r\nterritories of Malaya and Borneo on the one part  and\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Airways on the other part, but  when  we\r\n\r\ncame to writing it down it became completely unwieldy\r\n\r\nand  it  was decided that there should be a  separate\r\n\r\nBorneo agreement which would be complementary,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave already stated.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for clause 15. Clause 16 is just worth a\r\n\r\nmention, Mr Speaker. It links up with clause  5  and\r\n\r\nit  provides  the basis for a potential expansion  of\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways on to new overseas routes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we can pass to clause 18, I think, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nand  this  is  one to which the House will  assuredly\r\n\r\ngive  very close attention. We are all agreed,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  on  the essential need that our local citizens\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  both to qualify themselves  and  to\r\n\r\nexercise   their  qualifications  in   positions   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility and authority and leadership; in short\r\n\r\nthat  Malayan Airways should be truly Malayan as well\r\n\r\nas  fully  efficient;  and this clause  provides  the\r\n\r\nmeans  to attain that objective. Careful thought  and\r\n\r\nplanning  will be necessary in this connection  since\r\n\r\nat   present  the  local  staff,  excluding  the  air\r\n\r\nhostesses, form a little under 25 per cent of the air\r\n\r\ncrews and a little under 50 per cent of the qualified\r\n\r\nengineers. There will inevitably be a period of years\r\n\r\nduring  which  expatriate staff must be  retained  in\r\n\r\nemployment. I do not propose to prejudice the work of\r\n\r\nthe  new Malayan Airways Board, nor of our Government\r\n\r\ndirectors on the Board, by a discussion of details or\r\n\r\nby  acrimonious  references to past history.  I  have\r\n\r\nfull confidence that the new Malayan Airways will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwise  and  just  and practical in dealing  with  both\r\n\r\nlocal  and expatriate staff. If at present any member\r\n\r\nof Malayan Airways' staff has feelings of doubt as to\r\n\r\nhis  future, I am sure that those doubts will  vanish\r\n\r\nas   the  new  Malayan  Airways  Board  develops  its\r\n\r\npolicies.  In this connection the close  links  which\r\n\r\nwill  henceforth  exist between our airline  and  two\r\n\r\ngreat  international airlines offer marked advantages\r\n\r\nin staffing matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 will also no doubt receive the close\r\n\r\nattention  of  hon. Members. Nothing  is  of  greater\r\n\r\nimportance to Singapore than that the development  of\r\n\r\nour   economy  should  not  be  obstructed  by  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes.  This clause provides for conciliation  and\r\n\r\ndiscussion  by  which, properly used, trade  disputes\r\n\r\ncan be avoided, and I have full confidence again that\r\n\r\nin  this  matter  the Board will act  with  practical\r\n\r\nwisdom for the good of all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will no doubt particularly welcome  19\r\n\r\n(c) which envisages that the staff organisations will\r\n\r\nnot  concern  themselves solely with their  terms  of\r\n\r\nemployment  and  conditions of employment,  but  will\r\n\r\nalso play their part in matters of the efficiency  of\r\n\r\nthe  services  which  they help to  provide  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral good of the five territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to both these clauses, hon. Members will,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure,  bear  in mind that there  will  be  two\r\n\r\nGovernment directors on the Board and that they  will\r\n\r\nbe  well  able  to  represent the best  interests  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  of  the  Federation,  and  of   their\r\n\r\ncitizens, in all matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 remains for a brief mention, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nIt   is  important  because  it  enshrines  the  very\r\n\r\nvaluable principle of continuing co-operation between\r\n\r\nthe  two  Malayan  Governments.  Co-operation  is   a\r\n\r\npractical matter of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need deal further now with the\r\n\r\nagreement but it does remain for me to deal with  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the Government's purchase of part of  the\r\n\r\nshare capital of Malayan Airways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I\r\n\r\nmust  now deal with the last part of my motion  which\r\n\r\nconcerns the investment of $500,000 from the  surplus\r\n\r\nfunds   of  Singapore  in  the  reconstructed  public\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I had better start by giving a simple\r\n\r\naccount of what is actually going to happen over  the\r\n\r\ncapital of Malayan Airways. The existing issued share\r\n\r\ncapital  amounts to $2\ufffd million made up  of  250,000\r\n\r\nshares  of  $10 each. 550,000 new shares  are  to  be\r\n\r\nissued,  thus making a total capital of  $8  million:\r\n\r\nthat  is, 800,000 shares of $10 each. This new  share\r\n\r\nissue   will  be  distributed  amongst  the  existing\r\n\r\nshareholders in appropriate proportions according  to\r\n\r\ntheir   holdings.  Thereafter,  the   Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will buy 50,000 shares. The Government  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya will do the  same  and  so\r\n\r\nacting  jointly  will  the three Borneo  Governments.\r\n\r\nThere  will  thus be a total holding of  $l\ufffd  million\r\n\r\nheld  by the three Governments. Just over $4\ufffd million\r\n\r\nworth  of  shares  will be bought by QANTAS/BOAC  and\r\n\r\njust  under $2\ufffd million will be offered to the public\r\n\r\nof Malaya and Borneo. Simultaneously, Malayan Airways\r\n\r\nwill  be  transformed into a public limited liability\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these transactions deserves the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the House. It is best  illustrated  by\r\n\r\nconsidering the profits reaped by a single $10 share.\r\n\r\nThese will amount altogether to $22 made up of $11.40\r\n\r\nfrom past profits, formerly allocated to Reserve, and\r\n\r\n$10.60 from appreciation of fixed assets. In short, a\r\n\r\n$10  share-based on an accountant's valuation - now has\r\n\r\na market value of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$32. From the point of view of the shareholders, that\r\n\r\nis  no doubt a very happy situation but I think I had\r\n\r\nbetter  make  a  few comments on  it  in  order  that\r\n\r\nMembers of the House may see the situation in a  more\r\n\r\nprecise perspective. I should not like Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  form  the impression that  by  putting  in\r\n\r\n$500,000 into the new Malayan Airways, we can  expect\r\n\r\nto reap profits on that scale and to take them out of\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways  and  use  them  in  some   way   to\r\n\r\nsupplement the general revenue of the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first examine the $11.40 which comes from\r\n\r\nprofits formerly allocated to Reserve. The management\r\n\r\nof Malayan Airways has consistently followed the very\r\n\r\nwise  and very desirable policy of ploughing  back  a\r\n\r\nlarge  proportion of profits into the  industry.  The\r\n\r\nresult  has  been  a relatively low  rate  of  annual\r\n\r\ndividend.  On capital actually invested, as  distinct\r\n\r\nfrom  the  original capital, dividends have  averaged\r\n\r\nonly  5 per cent before tax. Shareholders who have  forgone  larger dividends in the past are now drawing\r\n\r\nin  a lump sum what they have forgone in the past and\r\n\r\nif we add together the dividends actually distributed\r\n\r\nplus the lump sum which is now being drawn in respect\r\n\r\nof dividends forgone in the past, we find that we get\r\n\r\nan  average annual return on the capital invested  of\r\n\r\nabout,  I  think, 14.2 per cent. If hon. Members  are\r\n\r\ntempted  to deduce from this that we ought to  invest\r\n\r\nall  our money in this sort of enterprise because  we\r\n\r\nare getting a very high rate of profit, they ought to\r\n\r\nthink  again. This rate of profit of 14 per  cent  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  very  high rate for a risk-bearing enterprise\r\n\r\nand   an   airline  is  emphatically  a  risk-bearing\r\n\r\nenterprise. One single crashed aeroplane can wipe out\r\n\r\nits  profits.  There  is no salvage  from  a  crashed\r\n\r\naeroplane; there is a dead loss of capital. Moreover,\r\n\r\nif you have an accident or accidents, you also suffer\r\n\r\na  loss  of public confidence and a loss of  goodwill\r\n\r\namongst  the  travelling  public  and  that  will  be\r\n\r\nreflected  in a lasting loss of revenue. Now,  thanks\r\n\r\nto  the  skill and reliability of its staff,  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways has a high - I can say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  extraordinarily high-record for  safety  and  for\r\n\r\npunctuality. I do not think that any other airline in\r\n\r\nthe world has a better record. Malayan Airways has  a\r\n\r\n100  per  cent safety record and about 98 to  99  per\r\n\r\ncent  record  for  regularity of services.  Over  ten\r\n\r\nyears of operation, during which it has carried  some\r\n\r\n1,040,000 passengers and it has operated some 159,000\r\n\r\nrevenue  hours,  Malayan Airways has never  killed  a\r\n\r\npassenger  or  lost  an  aeroplane.  That  remarkable\r\n\r\nrecord  of safe flying is reflected in the fact  that\r\n\r\nreserves  have been built up and that they  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen wiped out through disastrous accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to provide for future re-equipment, it will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be necessary for Malayan Airways  to  put\r\n\r\naside large sums to Reserve. Consequently, it will be\r\n\r\nnecessary   for  them  to  seek  to  operate   at   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  rate of profit. Every  effort  must  be\r\n\r\nmade  to ensure that the future operations of Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways are as satisfactory in regard to punctuality,\r\n\r\nsafety, efficiency and financial return as their past\r\n\r\noperations have been. So much for the reserve  aspect\r\n\r\nof the gain on the shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is the appreciation of fixed\r\n\r\nassets, and, of course, I need hardly point out  that\r\n\r\nall  fixed assets inevitably increase in their  money\r\n\r\nvalue  on the grounds of what the hon. Mr Sutherland\r\n\r\nwas  saying  just now : -that there is  a  world-wide\r\n\r\ncreeping inflation: as the money gets smaller, so the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  any  assets in terms of the smaller  money\r\n\r\ngets  bigger.  But  the Malayan dollar  has  probably\r\n\r\nsuffered  less  inflation than many other  currencies\r\n\r\nand  I  would not like to guess what the  element  of\r\n\r\ninflation is in this appreciation of fixed assets;  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think we need attach too much importance  to\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A much more significant factor is the eleven\r\n\r\nDakotas which belong to Malayan Airways. Although the\r\n\r\nDakota  is old and in a sense obsolescent, it has  up\r\n\r\ntill  now  had a high market value. The Dakota  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  suitable  aeroplane for the sort of  operations\r\n\r\nthat  Malayan  Airways  has conducted  and  as  those\r\n\r\noperations  are fairly widespread, naturally  it  has\r\n\r\nfairly  high value in the world market. But  we  must\r\n\r\nremember this, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninsofar as appreciation of fixed assets accounts  for\r\n\r\nprofits  in  this case, those profits are a  windfall\r\n\r\nwhich cannot be expected to recur. It is possible, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  that  they  may  recur;  there  may   be   a\r\n\r\nfavourable world market at some future date  for  the\r\n\r\naircraft  which may be owned by Malayan Airways,  but\r\n\r\nit  is  not  a thing on which anybody can  count,  or\r\n\r\nwhich  you  can take into your expectations  or  your\r\n\r\nplanning. It is purely in the nature of a windfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the past profitability of Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways. We cannot in this matter attempt to  predict\r\n\r\nthe future profitability on the basis of the past.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  going  to attempt to guess what  the  future\r\n\r\nprofitability may be. There are a great many  factors\r\n\r\nwhich,   in  some  cases,  are  necessarily   unknown\r\n\r\nfactors,  in  the  sense that we  cannot  predict  or\r\n\r\ncontrol  them.  They operate by causes lying  outside\r\n\r\nour own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct profitability is not, however, the criterion\r\n\r\nby  which we should judge our proposed investment  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  Airways.  We are concerned  not  with  making\r\n\r\nprofits but with providing services. Our aim  is  set\r\n\r\nout in the second \"Whereas\" in the Agreement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... it is the desire of the Governments to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to provide for safe, economic and efficient\r\n\r\nair transport services;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Such services are of the greatest importance not only\r\n\r\nfor Singapore but also for the Federation and for the\r\n\r\nthree   Borneo  territories - in  fact,  for  all   the\r\n\r\nGovernment partners who are now undertaking this  new\r\n\r\naviation  development.  Now,  if  we  are  going   to\r\n\r\nmaintain  those efficient air services which  are  so\r\n\r\nimportant, there will necessarily have to be a  large\r\n\r\ncapital investment because the aviation world  is  an\r\n\r\nintensely  competitive one. We must  have  aeroplanes\r\n\r\nthat  fully match the needs and expectations  of  the\r\n\r\ntravelling  public  and  aeroplanes  of   that   sort\r\n\r\nnecessarily cost money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is very proper that we should aim and the\r\n\r\nnew  Malayan Airways should aim to provide all or  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  possible  of the capital  required  out  of\r\n\r\nprofits.  That can only happen if the rate of  profit\r\n\r\nis  reasonably  high and if there is thoroughly  safe\r\n\r\nflying  to  make sure that there are no \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccidents  to wipe  out  profits  which have been  accumulated.  If\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways or any other airline cannot find  its\r\n\r\ncapital   from   its  own  profits,  then   it   will\r\n\r\nnecessarily have to find the capital elsewhere:  that\r\n\r\nis to say, either in the private market, the ordinary\r\n\r\nmoney  market or from Government support of one  kind\r\n\r\nor  another. Now, the chances of getting large  scale\r\n\r\ncapital  investment in an airline  are  not,  on  the\r\n\r\nworld  picture, very good. I have got here some world\r\n\r\nfigures  of  airline profit or loss  expressed  as  a\r\n\r\npercentage of turnover. In 1951, over the whole world\r\n\r\npicture, the loss was 1.9 per cent; in 1952,  it  was\r\n\r\n3.6  per cent; in 1953, it was 1.3 per cent; in 1954,\r\n\r\nit  was .4 per cent. Over all those four years, there\r\n\r\nwas  a  loss - in  some cases, a substantial  loss.  In\r\n\r\n1955,  the tide turned and there was a profit of  2.4\r\n\r\nper cent gross on turnover. 2.4 per cent, I can point\r\n\r\nout,  is  hardly a commercial rate of  profit.  These\r\n\r\nfigures are before payment of fixed interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\nAm  I  right  in  assuming that these  figures  being\r\n\r\nprovided  to us are figures of international airlines\r\n\r\nand not of internal monopoly airlines?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> They were given to me as world figures\r\n\r\ntaking in all types of airlines together.

The United States of America  is\r\n\r\nan extremely rich and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwealthy   country  with  a  very  high  standard   of\r\n\r\nefficiency   and  low  operational  cost - particularly\r\n\r\nstaff  cost - and there in that great and free economy,\r\n\r\nthe  Congress has found it necessary to pass  a  Bill\r\n\r\n(it  went  to  the President last August) authorising\r\n\r\nGovernment  guarantees up to 90  per  cent  on  loans\r\n\r\nrequired  by  local U.S. operators. If Singapore  had\r\n\r\nhad  to find from public funds - from the surplus funds\r\n\r\nof  the Government - the capital now needed for Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways, the burden would have been very considerable\r\n\r\nindeed.  It  could  only be met by sacrificing  other\r\n\r\ndevelopment - schools, hospitals, a unified  transport\r\n\r\nsystem   or  flood  control  or  some  other  equally\r\n\r\nimportant work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment in Malayan Airways is partly an act\r\n\r\nof  partnership. It is an act of partnership  between\r\n\r\nthe  five Governments concerned and it is also an act\r\n\r\nof  partnership between the commercial operators  and\r\n\r\nthe Government cooperating. It is also a guarantee of\r\n\r\nour  firm  purpose to do all in our power to maintain\r\n\r\nour  aviation services at the very high  level  which\r\n\r\nour status as a world communications centre requires.\r\n\r\nWe  must  therefore note with satisfaction  that  the\r\n\r\nvery  efficient past management of the operations  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways has made it possible to provide  for\r\n\r\nthe  continued operation of this airline with  strong\r\n\r\nnew  backing,  with  every  reasonable  prospect   of\r\n\r\neconomic soundness and of operational efficiency, and\r\n\r\nwithout  a  heavy  requirement  for  investment  from\r\n\r\npublic  funds. There has been no loss of capital  for\r\n\r\nSingapore in this matter. All the capital accumulated\r\n\r\nfrom  the  past will continue to be employed  and  to\r\n\r\ngive  employment.

The way he presented his  argument\r\n\r\nthis  morning  indicated that it was a  case  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not having sufficient funds to acquire  51\r\n\r\nper  cent of the shares. Therefore it decided to give\r\n\r\nBOAC/QANTAS 51 per cent, sell by public auction  or\r\n\r\neven  by  public subscriptions $24, million worth  of\r\n\r\nshares and the three Governments together raise  $14\r\n\r\nmillion worth of shares. Now I would like to ask  him\r\n\r\nand  have a categorical answer, yes or no: was it  or\r\n\r\nwas  it  not  a demand of QANTAS and BOAC or  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  that they should have a controlling interest\r\n\r\nin  the company? That is the first point. If they did\r\n\r\nnot  want  the  controlling interest, why  were  they\r\n\r\ngiven  a controlling interest and if they wanted  the\r\n\r\ncontrolling interest, what was the reason for it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now presented with a fait\r\n\r\naccompli.  Last year when we raised this question  of\r\n\r\nthe  renewal  of the franchise we were informed  that\r\n\r\nthere  would be a full opportunity for debate of  all\r\n\r\nthe  terms and conditions. Now we are told, \"Here  is\r\n\r\nthe  agreement. We are not obliged to tell it to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  but  we  are  doing  it  as  a  matter   of\r\n\r\ncourtesy.\" We are first of all informed that all this\r\n\r\nis  the good work of the Minister of Transport of the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  a large bouquet was handed  to  him.\r\n\r\nWell,  Sir,  the bouquet may well have been  deserved\r\n\r\nbut  I  have a feeling that this is another  instance\r\n\r\nwhere  the Singapore Government has decided  to  hide\r\n\r\nbehind the Federation sarong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister took us through\r\n\r\nseveral  clauses  in  the proposed  agreement  rather\r\n\r\nrapidly this morning. The first question I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  him  is:  why is there no provision  in  the\r\n\r\nproposed  agreement as to what is to  happen  if  the\r\n\r\nagreement is not renewed at the end of the franchise?\r\n\r\nClause 21 reads:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) Not later than the 30th day of October, 1964,\r\n\r\nthe  parties shall consult together to consider  what\r\n\r\nfurther arrangements, if any, should be made  at  the\r\n\r\nend of the period of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Each party shall, as soon as possible after such\r\n\r\nconsultation  and, in any case, not  later  than  the\r\n\r\n30th  day  of  October, 1966, inform the other  party\r\n\r\nwhether or not it desires-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to continue this Agreement for a further\r\n\r\nterm; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to negotiate a fresh agreement to take effect\r\n\r\non the termination of this Agreement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is the typical case of an agreement to agree and\r\n\r\nis  no agreement whatsoever. What happens if there is\r\n\r\nno  agreement? Does the company just wind up and sell\r\n\r\nits  assets?  Or  we  going to be confronted  with  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where  if  we  want  to  nationalise   the\r\n\r\nairline,  we shall have to pay a terrific  price  for\r\n\r\nit,   just   as  Malayan  Airways  by  very   skilful\r\n\r\naccounting had been able to increase its share  value\r\n\r\nfrom a nominal $10 to $32? Now, from the $10 which we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  pay  for a share in  1957,  how  many\r\n\r\ndollars is it going to be if we want to buy over this\r\n\r\ncompany  and run it as a national airline in 1964  or\r\n\r\n1966?  That,  I should imagine, is one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant factors. The Government, for better or  for\r\n\r\nworse,  have decided not to have a controlling  voice\r\n\r\nin  this airline. The Government have left the matter\r\n\r\nin  abeyance as to what is to happen at  the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  period.  Surely, it must have a policy  and  it\r\n\r\nshould tell us what that policy is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, why were only BOAC and QANTAS brought\r\n\r\ninto   it?  If  it  is  a  question  of  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nairlines,   why   was  not  Air  India   invited   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the development of our  internal  air\r\n\r\nservices?  Why  two  \"white\"  Governments  in   close\r\n\r\ncollaboration over the Far Eastern routes? I  have  a\r\n\r\nparticular antipathy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntowards  monopolies in which foreign or  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nGovernments  will  be  able  indirectly  to  run  our\r\n\r\nessential services. It may well be that airlines  are\r\n\r\ndifficult  things to run. They are  risky;  they  may\r\n\r\nincur  terrific losses. We have been regaled  with  a\r\n\r\nwhole  series  of  figures as  to  how  international\r\n\r\nairlines  have  been losing money. But  this  is  one\r\n\r\nairline  that has been making money and  it  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  likely that it will continue to make money  for\r\n\r\nno  other reason than that there is no other internal\r\n\r\nair   service   to  be  allowed  in  Singapore, the\r\n\r\nFederation   and   the  Borneo  territories.   Unless\r\n\r\nsomething  unexpected happens to  the  air-travelling\r\n\r\nhabits of the people of this area, it is likely  that\r\n\r\nthe air traffic is going to increase and profits also\r\n\r\nwill increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we were told that clause 18 is a\r\n\r\nprogressive clause. It sets the duty of this  company\r\n\r\nto Malayanise, train local personnel as air crews and\r\n\r\nground maintenance staff. I would like to read a  few\r\n\r\nof the operative words in clause\r\n\r\n18. It says here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Company undertakes that provision shall be made\r\n\r\nfor  training  and promotion schemes  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nfullest  practicable employment  and  advancement  of\r\n\r\nlocally domiciled staff . . . \".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  does  \"locally domiciled staff\" mean?  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  all  kinds of people come here, live  here  two\r\n\r\nyears  and evince an intention to reside here  longer\r\n\r\nthan  they  expected  when they  first  arrived  here\r\n\r\nbecause   they   found  conditions  for   them   very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  Are  they locally domiciled  staff?  I\r\n\r\nalways  believed that Malayanisation is a process  by\r\n\r\nwhich we displace expatriates with local citizens and\r\n\r\nsubjects,  not just locally domiciled  staff.  I  may\r\n\r\ncome from Timbuctu and after two years, I say, \"Well,\r\n\r\nI like Singapore and I like to be domiciled here.\" So\r\n\r\nI would come within this phrase of \"locally domiciled\r\n\r\nstaff\".  I  am  quite  sure  that  that  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Minister for Transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 goes on to say in the next sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\". . . recruiting, training and promotion air crews\r\n\r\nand certificated ground maintenance staff . . .\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  about  the  administration and  the  managerial\r\n\r\nside?  We  know that it is always more difficult  to\r\n\r\nMalayanise  the  technical side because  it  takes  a\r\n\r\nlonger time training technicians and technocrats than\r\n\r\nto  train  administrators. We know  also  that  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  expatriates have  arrived  to  head  the\r\n\r\nvarious  departments in the new Malayan  Airways.  It\r\n\r\nmay  well  be  that,  at  the beginning,  experienced\r\n\r\nadministrative  personnel are necessary  to  get  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  going  but why is there in  clause  18  no\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the training and the eventual  taking\r\n\r\nover of these jobs by local men?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is an agreement which is full of\r\n\r\nloopholes. It says in clause 4 \"fares and rates\"  and\r\n\r\nvariations  thereof. This is a key clause because  if\r\n\r\nthe  service is to run efficiently, it does not  only\r\n\r\nmean  that  there should be no crashes of planes  and\r\n\r\nthat  planes  should arrive on schedule but  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be run cheaply and it is acknowledged amongst\r\n\r\nall  air operators that Malayan Airways have some  of\r\n\r\nthe highest fares in South East Asia. It says here:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Company shall charge for the carriage of\r\n\r\npassengers and cargo such fares and rates as may from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  be  approved by  the  Ministers.  The\r\n\r\nCompany may submit to the Ministers proposals to vary\r\n\r\nfares  and  rates, together with such information  in\r\n\r\nsupport  thereof as may be required by the  Ministers\r\n\r\nand  the Ministers' approval of such proposals  shall\r\n\r\nnot be withheld without good cause being shown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  who is to decide whether it is \"good cause\"  or\r\n\r\nnot? Clause 3 says that if there is any disagreement,\r\n\r\nit  goes to arbitration. Clause 22 says that if there\r\n\r\nis arbitration, the two Governments shall appoint one\r\n\r\narbitrator  and the Company shall appoint  the  other\r\n\r\narbitrator, and it says that if there is no agreement\r\n\r\nbetween the arbitrators, there shall be an umpire:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... in case of disagreement between the\r\n\r\narbitrators  so  appointed and so far  only  as  they\r\n\r\ndisagree, to their umpire to be appointed by them  in\r\n\r\nwriting  before  they enter on the  business  of  the\r\n\r\nreference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Government  Ministers  disagree  with  the   company;\r\n\r\nMinisters   appoint  one  arbitrator,   the   company\r\n\r\nappoints one arbitrator. Two arbitrators disagree and\r\n\r\nit  goes to one umpire. What if they cannot agree  on\r\n\r\nan umpire? Then what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappens?  But surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, this business\r\n\r\nof fares is a matter which cannot be left just to the\r\n\r\ncompany and if it is not agreed to, to an umpire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has rightly said that they are\r\n\r\ninterested in this as a public service and not  as  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  concern. Now, Sir, I am quite  sure  that\r\n\r\nQANTAS/BOAC are interested in this as a profit-making\r\n\r\nconcern and not as a public service. We do not expect\r\n\r\nthe  Australian Government or the British  Government\r\n\r\nto  do a public service for us. What I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow is this: if they consider it sufficiently profit\r\n\r\nmaking,  why  is the Government only taking  a  token\r\n\r\nshare  of $500,000? Is it suggested that if the three\r\n\r\nGovernments  between them or the two  Governments - the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  and Singapore - were  to  raise\r\n\r\nslightly  more  than $4 million, the two  Governments\r\n\r\nwill  go  bankrupt? That is the explanation which  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  before we give our approval or before  we\r\n\r\neven take note of this agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I do not appreciate the argument that\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are not interested in running  it  as  a\r\n\r\nprofit-making concern we should therefore  leave  the\r\n\r\nprofit  making to two public corporations  which  are\r\n\r\nprofit-making  concerns. I seriously suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Works that it must be\r\n\r\nwritten into this agreement that the right to appoint\r\n\r\ndirectors should not vest in proportion to the number\r\n\r\nof  shares held. It was indicated to us this morning,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  does  not  say  so  anywhere   in   the\r\n\r\nagreement, that the Singapore Government will appoint\r\n\r\none  director  and  the  Federation  Government  will\r\n\r\nappoint the other director. We have not been told how\r\n\r\nmany directors there will be on this company and  how\r\n\r\nthey will be appointed. By the ordinary operation  of\r\n\r\nmost  of  the rules and memoranda of companies,  they\r\n\r\nare  appointed on the basis of the number  of  shares\r\n\r\nheld  in  a particular company. I do not see how  two\r\n\r\nGovernments   can  give  a  monopoly  to   a   public\r\n\r\ncorporation not knowing how many directors there  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be and what voice they are going to have  in\r\n\r\nthat directorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only provision that is laid down for directors is\r\n\r\nin clause 12 which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... all the Directors of the Company including\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  shall  be  British  subjects,  British\r\n\r\nprotected  persons or citizens of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>How  many  there are going to be and what weight  the\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation directors are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave  on  this  board of directors is another  matter\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works why it is he who  has  moved\r\n\r\nthis  motion  when,  in fact, he will  not  sign  the\r\n\r\nagreement  at  all.

It is a\r\n\r\nmatter of principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think I can safely deal with\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Borneo  Governments  are  doing  in  their\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  airline which is again an airline  linked\r\n\r\nwith  the BOAC and which they regard as a very  vital\r\n\r\nairline for their own internal purposes. I could find\r\n\r\nout  from the Borneo Governments whether they  object\r\n\r\nto  the  hon. Member having the information he  asked\r\n\r\nfor  but I do not think that I should try to give him\r\n\r\nthe   precise   nature  of  the  rather   complicated\r\n\r\nproceedings  between the Borneo Governments  and  the\r\n\r\nother interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked, \"Why a monopoly?\" Air services must be a\r\n\r\nmonopoly if they are going to pay. It is possible  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the   number  of  taxis  on   the   street\r\n\r\nindefinitely, but an aeroplane must fly at  a  proper\r\n\r\nloading.  If the load is insufficient, then it  flies\r\n\r\nat a loss. You cannot expect to have capital invested\r\n\r\nin airlines unless you give the investors at least  a\r\n\r\nreasonable chance of recovering their costs.  I  have\r\n\r\nindicated  that  although  the  profits  of   Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways have been satisfactory in the past, there  is\r\n\r\nno certainty of their continuing at that level in the\r\n\r\nfuture.   On  the  world  picture,  they  have   done\r\n\r\nextremely well but you cannot gamble on the fortunate\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a point about not enough public funds.\r\n\r\nWell,  the simple fact is there: We are just hard  up\r\n\r\nfor  money.  We  could invest our  money  in  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  if we wanted to, but of course if  Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  wished  to  have  a controlling  interest,  then\r\n\r\nobviously  the  other  countries  would  have   said,\r\n\r\n\"Well,, we are not going to have our airlines at  the\r\n\r\nmercy  of the Singapore Government. It has  to  be  a\r\n\r\npartnership.\" It would have been necessary  to  carry\r\n\r\nout   a   joint   purchase,   presumably   in   equal\r\n\r\nproportions, by all the Governments holding an equal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproportion  of  the capital. It is a  most  difficult\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre and would certainly be doomed to failure if\r\n\r\nit were to be tried at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted a categorical answer to the question why\r\n\r\nBOAC/QANTAS wanted a controlling interest. Well,  the\r\n\r\nobvious  answer  is that they wanted to  control  the\r\n\r\nthing.  The  obvious danger to all people  likely  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  this  country  is  that  ill-judged   and\r\n\r\ninexperienced people may get into power and that they\r\n\r\nmay  then  carry  out  ill-judged  and  inexperienced\r\n\r\npolicies. I do not think you will get anybody to  put\r\n\r\ncapital  into  Singapore  in  partnership  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  unless  they have a reasonable  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat their voice will be heard and that they will not\r\n\r\nbe  pushed around in an ill-judged way as a result of\r\n\r\npolitical pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget if I have dealt fully with the question of\r\n\r\nnot  enough time. I think I was interrupted  at  that\r\n\r\nstage. The simple fact is, of course, that we had  to\r\n\r\nspend  a  good deal of time in getting this agreement\r\n\r\nup to tabling stage. There had to be a completion; we\r\n\r\nhad  to  wait for the Borneo Governments to  complete\r\n\r\ntheir   parallel  complementary  agreement  and   the\r\n\r\nconsequence  has been that we are rather  pushed  for\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a rather curious question, of what happens at\r\n\r\nthe end of the franchise? The hon. Member read clause\r\n\r\n21  and I do not think I need read it again. It  says\r\n\r\nperfectly plainly \"what further arrangements, if any,\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  at the end of the  period  of  this\r\n\r\nagreement.\"  The  only thing that  emerged  from  his\r\n\r\nquestion was an apparent assumption on his part  that\r\n\r\nthis  Government would still be in power in 1967.  At\r\n\r\nleast  he asks what our policy would be and  what  we\r\n\r\nintended  to do in 1967. The fact of the  matter,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  that  we have provided a  very  adequate\r\n\r\nagreement  with,  as  I pointed out  in  my  original\r\n\r\nremarks,  a  transitional clause for  a  transitional\r\n\r\nperiod  of three years - the last three out of the  ten\r\n\r\nyears  of  the  franchise - and there is  no  point  in\r\n\r\ntrying to go further and to presume that we are going\r\n\r\nto do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis or that at the end of ten years. We have not got\r\n\r\nthat  amount of foresight to see the future; nor  has\r\n\r\nanybody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why was not Air India invited to participate?\" The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  objected to what he called \"whites\",  I\r\n\r\nthink.  I  can  only say that we do  not-at  least  I\r\n\r\ncertainly  do not - when conducting negotiations,  work\r\n\r\nfrom  any racialist or racist approach. Air India  is\r\n\r\nan   efficiently   run   and  a  highly   competitive\r\n\r\ninternational airline and if they had approached  us,\r\n\r\nwe  would have considered it. In fact, they did  not,\r\n\r\nand  we are perfectly satisfied with QANTAS/BOAC  as\r\n\r\nan effective partnership on a larger scale, with more\r\n\r\nadvantages  to  offer  to  us.  There  is  no  reason\r\n\r\nwhatever  to suppose that Air India would  have  been\r\n\r\nable to give us any better or more helpful terms than\r\n\r\nwhat we have got from QANTAS/BOAC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> All your Ministers prefer to\r\n\r\ntravel by Air India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> As to that, I cannot say. There are\r\n\r\nsabotage problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked, \"What is locally domiciled staff?\" I am\r\n\r\nafraid  that is a very thin one again in  respect  of\r\n\r\nclause  18. Obviously, a person locally domiciled  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not locally domiciled in Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nnor  is  he  locally domiciled in Kuching, Brunei  or\r\n\r\nJesselton and you have got to find some phrase  which\r\n\r\nadequately  represents the fact that we  are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith five different territories, and not with one. We\r\n\r\nhave   provided  in  clause  12  what  is  much  more\r\n\r\nsignificant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The restriction in favour of British subjects . . .\r\n\r\nshall be extended to include Singapore citizens  when\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizenship  has  been   established   by\r\n\r\nlegislation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the company is bound to employ them.

Now, here are  the\r\n\r\naverage fares in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayan  cents  per passenger mile for  some  of  the\r\n\r\nairlines operating in this part of the world:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam         39.5 cents per passenger mile.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Indonesia                          39.6 cents per passenger mile.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  Malayan Airways                    28.1 cents per passenger mile \r\n\r\n                                        for what they call their standard\r\n\r\n                                        service, I think and\r\n\r\n                                     \r\n\r\n                                     21.1 cents per passenger mile\r\n\r\n                                        for their tourist services.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   tourist   services  are  the  more   accurately\r\n\r\ncomparable  with the standard of service provided  in\r\n\r\nthe other airlines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  Thailand                          20.9 cents per passenger mile.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Burma                             20.6 cents per passenger mile.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  India                             15.4 cents per passenger mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  on  that table, there are two airlines  with  a\r\n\r\nvery  much  higher  rate indeed,  not  very  far  off\r\n\r\ndouble,  that  is, Indonesia and Laos,  Cambodia  and\r\n\r\nVietnam:  then there are more which are substantially\r\n\r\nthe  same - Thailand and Burma running just level  with\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways; then there is India down below  five\r\n\r\nor  six  cents cheaper per passenger mile. Of course,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a difference in the standard of living  in\r\n\r\nthese  territories and in the standard of wage rates.\r\n\r\nI   think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  probably  the\r\n\r\npassengers  in  Malayan Airways can (a)  well  afford\r\n\r\nthese  fares and (b) get a better standard of service\r\n\r\nor  a  very  good standard of service; and  that  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  keeping the  prices  down  does,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  depend on the wage rates prevailing in  that\r\n\r\nparticular territory. But anyhow there is  no  ground\r\n\r\nat all for saying that Malayan Airways' fares are the\r\n\r\nhighest in South-East Asia. That sort of remark should\r\n\r\nbe  withdrawn when it is made. These wild allegations\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  made against what is  in  fact  very\r\n\r\nlargely a Malayan-operated concern.

Sessional Paper No. L.A.  18\r\n\r\nof  1957 shows that the Committee held five meetings.\r\n\r\nThe  minutes  of  these  meetings  can  be  found  in\r\n\r\nAppendix III and Appendix IV contains the minutes  of\r\n\r\nthe  meetings  at  which  the  Committee  heard  oral\r\n\r\nevidence   from   various   individuals   and    from\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   of   certain  organisations.   Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will note that careful consideration has been\r\n\r\ngiven to the representations made both orally and  in\r\n\r\nwriting  and  as a result certain changes  have  been\r\n\r\nmade to the Bill. Certain of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendments are technical ones designed to improve the\r\n\r\ndrafting of the Bill and I do not propose to go  into\r\n\r\nthese  in detail as they are fully explained  in  the\r\n\r\nofficial  report  on the proceedings  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. Possibly, the most notable change has been\r\n\r\nthe  reduction of the residential qualification  from\r\n\r\nten  years  to  eight years. As a result  of  further\r\n\r\nconsideration and discussion, it has been agreed that\r\n\r\nit  would  be easier from an administrative point  of\r\n\r\nview to reduce the qualification to eight years. This\r\n\r\nwill  greatly simplify registration as identity cards\r\n\r\nwere issued late in 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment, Sir, is the proviso\r\n\r\nadded  to  clause 12 of the Bill which provides  that\r\n\r\nbefore the Minister refuses an application, he  shall\r\n\r\nrefer the case to an Advisory Committee consisting of\r\n\r\nthree  persons appointed by the Governor in  Council.\r\n\r\nIn  making  his  decision, the  Minister  shall  have\r\n\r\nregard  to  any  report made to him by this  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will also notice that a new Part VI has\r\n\r\nbeen  added  to the Bill. Sir, as is well known,  the\r\n\r\nmain purpose of the Bill is to enable persons who are\r\n\r\nqualified to become citizens under this law  to  take\r\n\r\npart  in  the general elections next year and  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary for the initial registration  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  take place as quickly  as  possible  in\r\n\r\norder that the electoral rolls can be prepared. It is\r\n\r\nan  All-Party decision that a three-month period  for\r\n\r\ninitial registration is sufficient for people to have\r\n\r\ntheir  names put on the electoral rolls and  so  take\r\n\r\npart in the forthcoming elections. At it is now going\r\n\r\nto be made so easy for people to be registered, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the Minister to have powers to  cancel\r\n\r\nthat  registration. Following such cancellation,  the\r\n\r\nperson concerned can reapply for registration in  the\r\n\r\nnormal way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the most important amendments and, as I\r\n\r\nsaid  before, the others are designed to improve  the\r\n\r\ndrafting of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Sir, I second the motion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Please\r\n\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, this Assembly is going to enact a\r\n\r\nlaw  by  which  it  proposes to give,  under  certain\r\n\r\nconditions,  citizenship status  to  the  people  who\r\n\r\nreside or are domiciled in Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I went through the Select Committee\r\n\r\nReport, I found that a certain section of people made\r\n\r\ncertain  representations. They claim that  those  who\r\n\r\nare  already  registered as Citizens  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom    and   Colonies   should   be    recognised\r\n\r\nautomatically.  Sir,  I think that  that  is  a  very\r\n\r\nreasonable  suggestion which, I beg  to  submit,  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  completely ignored.  These  people\r\n\r\nhave unmistakably shown their loyalty to Singapore by\r\n\r\nswearing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen  and  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is  not right to insist,  every  time\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  change of government, that  citizenship\r\n\r\nregistration  should be renewed.  According  to  this\r\n\r\nBill, I think about 60,000 people who are Citizens of\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom and Colonies will  be  asked  to\r\n\r\nregister again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not asking anything new by this\r\n\r\nregistration. The same forms are to be filled  in  by\r\n\r\nthe  same  section of people, swearing allegiance  to\r\n\r\nthe  same person, that is, Her Majesty the Queen, and\r\n\r\nto  the same country, that is Singapore. I think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment finds pleasure in making more people  come\r\n\r\nforward  and  register  but  the  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nencouraging  people  to  come  forward  and  register\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is now creating a feeling amongst  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  expected  themselves  to  be  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that  they are completely ignored  because\r\n\r\nthey are asked to register again. The Government is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally  discouraging people from  coming  forward  to\r\n\r\nregister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore was directly under the colonial rule\r\n\r\na  new  method  of  registration of  citizenship  was\r\n\r\nimposed  on  the people. I think, Sir, in  1946,  the\r\n\r\npeople were asked to register. Many people did go  to\r\n\r\nregister  and there was an election. The  result  was\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  C.  C.  Tan became the head  of  the  then\r\n\r\nGovernment.   When  he  became  the   head   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   he   discovered   a   new   method   of\r\n\r\nregistration of citizenship. By this new  method,  he\r\n\r\ndeprived those people who elected him of their voting\r\n\r\nrights.  After  Mr  C.  C.  Tan,  our  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister Mr David Marshall proposed a new method  of\r\n\r\nregistration of citizenship. Now the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  Dr Lim Yew Hock has invented a new  method\r\n\r\nof  registration of citizenship. As there is going to\r\n\r\nbe  an  election in 1958, there will be another Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.  Surely there will again be another  method\r\n\r\nof  citizenship registration. Sir, by these  tactics,\r\n\r\nthis  Government  must realise that the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are losing faith in it. Whenever there is a\r\n\r\nchange  of  government, a new method  of  citizenship\r\n\r\nregistration will be devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another irony is this. This Assembly is not a\r\n\r\nconstituent Assembly. This is a legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\nWe  were elected under the Rendel Constitution and we\r\n\r\nrepresent the interests of a certain section  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. Not only are you not doing that, but you  are\r\n\r\ndepriving those people who elected you of their right\r\n\r\nto  vote.  The people who are Citizens of the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  and Colonies whom you are asking to register\r\n\r\nare the very people who elected you to this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
