Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Chief Justice's decision in PP v Teoh Ai Nee and Ngoh Chin Heng was first reported in the press, a committee was formed to study its implications and to review the law and policy on parallel imports of copyright products. The committee will complete its review and make its recommendations soon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Chief Justice highlighted some unintended effects of the law. When Parliament enacted the Copyright Bill in 1987, the House was told that the legislative intent was not to prohibit parallel imports, only counterfeit products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision turned on the technical interpretation of a particular section of the Copyright Act, which was open to alternative interpretations. At the same time, however, the Chief Justice made it clear that formulating Singapore's policy on parallel imports should be the task of the legislature and not that of the judiciary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's policy on parallel imports has not changed. We must strike a balance between, on the one hand, ensuring cheaper prices for consumers and, on the other, providing sufficient protection to the copyright industries, to enable them to reap the benefits of their efforts and so have the incentive to develop the business. Once we receive the committee's report, we will propose amendments to the law to clarify this. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, due to the uncertainty, when will this committee complete its report? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc.

This is because Government rates will remain unchanged on 1st April 1994, notwithstanding that Government fees and charges will attract GST where similar supplies are or might be made by the private sector. Government's purpose in doing this is to facilitate the implementation of GST. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government fees and charges are adjusted periodically to account for increase in costs.

We systematically review and amend safety regulations, so that workers can work in a safer environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, from time to time, lapses in compliance and human errors have resulted in accidents, sometimes with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> fatal consequences. In 1992, there were two major shipyard accidents involving the loss of 14 lives and 75 workers suffering injuries. The Government convened two Committees of Inquiry to look into the causes and circumstances of the accidents. The Committees conducted thorough investigations and hearings. They recommended enhanced safety measures for hot works, chemical usage and audit of safety management system. In May 1993, my Ministry ordered Sembawang Shipyard, where both accidents took place, to comply with all the recommendations. The shipyard had done so, including conducting an external safety audit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry organised a study mission to Japan to study safety management in Japanese shipyards. Senior management of major shipyards and representatives of the Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI) joined the mission to study first-hand the Japanese safety management system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry organised a Workshop on Accident Prevention in Shipyards in October 1993 to discuss and disseminate the recommendations of the Committees, and the findings of the study mission. Senior managers of shipyards and union representatives took part and agreed to implement these recommendations in their own shipyards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, the Department of Industrial Safety (DIS) monitored monthly progress in implementing the safety recommendations. The regular monitoring and enforcement visits showed that the major shipyards have implemented practically all the recommendations of the Committees of Inquiry. Shipyards are also in the process of implementing the recommendations of the study mission to Japan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only major recommendation of the Committees of Inquiry which is still not fully implemented is the conduct of safety audits by external auditors with specific experience in auditing safety systems of shipyards. So far, only Sembawang Shipyard had conducted such audit. ASMI is actively sourcing for consultants to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> draw up standard auditing procedures, which the other shipyards could use for their external safety audits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also conducted a comprehensive review of existing safety provisions for shipyards. The recommendations of the two Committees of Inquiry on measures to prevent fire and explosion have been incorporated in a new set of safety regulations. In addition, the review also covers other hazards, such as those arising from the use of scaffolding, lifting equipment and electrical installations. These regulations will be gazetted shortly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these steps to tighten regulation of safety management, the Department of Industrial Safety conducts regular inspections of shipyards to ensure that they comply with accepted safety practices and procedures. In 1993, the Department of Industrial Safety conducted 1,223 inspections of shipyards. Shipyards which had violated safety regulations were issued with notices of non-compliance or composition fines. For more serious violations, shipyards were prosecuted in court. In instances where the workplace was grossly unsafe, stop work orders were issued to force the shipyard to improve safety measures before work resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore deeply saddened by the report of the tragic accident in Jurong Shipyard in the morning of 8th February this year. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to the family of the nine workers who died in the accident and the two injured workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have appointed a Committee of Inquiry to determine the causes and circumstances leading to the accident and to recommend appropriate preventive measures. Shipyard managements must rigorously implement safety measures and stringently enforce compliance by their workers and employees of their sub-contractors. Workers must also understand that when they are working in hazardous conditions, disregarding safety precautions can be disastrous both to themselves and to fellow workers nearby. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the three accidents which occurred so close together will remain a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> painful and vivid reminder for a long, long time to all shipyard managements and their workers to work safely. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB INTERIM AND MAJOR UPGRADING PROGRAMMES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Integration)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development if he will explain how the Housing and Development Board integrates both the interim and major upgrading programmes for flats; and whether a flat, which has undergone interim upgrading, will be entitled to major upgrading later on. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Acting Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Interim Upgrading Programme complements the Main Upgrading Programme. The Main Upgrading Programme is intended for flats older than 17 years. The Interim Upgrading Programme allows HDB residents of precincts in the 10 to 17 years age band to enjoy some benefits of the Main Upgrading Programme earlier. Otherwise, they would have to wait for more than eight years before they are eligible for the Main Upgrading Programme. Works under the Interim Upgrading Programme are confined to the precinct and block level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Interim Upgrading Programme is merely an advancement of some of the improvements under the Main Upgrading Programme, precincts that are upgraded under the Interim Upgrading Programme are still eligible for the Main Upgrading Programme later on. However, as far as possible, the improvements provided under the Interim Upgrading Programme for a particular precinct will not be duplicated in the main upgrading package for that precinct. The full interim upgrading cost expended by Government on the precinct will also be deducted from the precinct's main upgrading budget. For example, the total direct upgrading cost for a 3-room flat under the Basic Package of the Main Upgrading Programme is about $22,500. If the flat has enjoyed $6,000 worth of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> interim upgrading works, it is only eligible for $16,500 worth of improvement works under the Main Upgrading Programme later on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the total upgrading budget for a precinct is fixed.

The Member has chosen to single out one particular aspect. But the Public Transport Council has to consider all aspects, from the taxi users' point of view and from the taxi companies' point of view. These factors include the cost of owning and operating taxis, the earnings and patronage of taxis and the profitability of taxi companies. Apart from these factors, the PTC also considers the overall principle on which taxi fares are based, that there must be a parity of statutory cost between taxis and cars so that our available road space is used more efficiently. So this is the totality of factors which the Public Transport Council has to consider and not just the particular factor which the Member has raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If we take the question of totality of taxis as against private motor cars, when the maximum number of taxis is reached, the Ministry could easily curtail them.

My question is: at the moment, if at any \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> time the taxis reach the maximum number, the Government could easily freeze the number of taxis.

But that certainly is not an issue at the moment, is it not? Because the supply of taxis has not reached such a stage where you could curb taxis.

However, the Department of Statistics carries out a monthly survey of business activities in Singapore including that of the retail sector. About half of the January returns have been received so far. The data shows that retailers within the CBD had about the same growth in sales in January as those outside the CBD. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government implemented the whole-day Area Licensing Scheme in order to ease the worsening traffic condition in the CBD during business \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> hours. This will ensure that our limited road space in the CBD will be optimally used for the benefit of our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial surveys by the PWD have shown that the number of cars going into the CBD has dropped by about 10% with the implementation of the whole-day ALS resulting in a smoother traffic flow. This will benefit retailers as an increasingly congested CBD will only deter shoppers who wish to drive into the CBD to shop. Shoppers can also use the extensive public transport system serving the CBD. Furthermore, those who are deterred by the ALS from entering into the CBD during the day can also do their shopping during the evenings and weekends. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more shopping complexes are developed outside the CBD, retailers within the CBD will need to adapt and respond to the new competition.

These and other factors probably have far greater significance than the $2 ALS fee that is being charged.

Since then, SBC has increased its programme output by 25% for television and 3% for radio. Improvements to programming have helped to draw larger audiences. SBC's daily TV viewership went up by 27% to more than two million and daily radio listenership by 49% to 1.5 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its continuing improvement to programmes, SBC is stepping up its output of public service broadcasts (PSBs). PSBs are programmes which contribute towards national and social \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> objectives. They include education and information programmes, cultural, sports and children's programmes, Malay and Tamil broadcasts as well as locally produced Mandarin and English dramas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, SBC will be offering more locally-produced entertainment programmes in English and Chinese on Channels 5 and 8. There will also be more day time television fare, including breakfast television. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of providing more and better programmes has been growing steadily. The upgraded SBC programmes will cost $250 million in financial year 1993, compared to $200 million in financial year 1990, an increase of 25%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant amount of the expenditure is for the provision of PSBs. Whilst PSBs account for 71% of SBC's production budget, they do not attract sufficient advertising revenue to pay their costs. It is therefore necessary to raise licence fees to help underwrite them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBC does not use the surpluses it has built up to fund these programmes, as this would affect its future effectiveness. These surpluses are not large compared to its investment needs. SBC will spend them on upgrading and expansion. It needs more studios and production facilities. SBC must also prepare for digital audio broadcasts, and later on, high definition television. SBC's long term challenge is to upgrade its channels to enable them to compete and retain viewers when new channels proliferate as a result of satellite and cable television. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister to confirm whether it is true that 100% of the fees collected by the Ministry goes to SBC? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> All licence fees go to SBC. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> In that case, may I ask whether NTUC Radio Heart is also required to provide a certain amount of public service broadcast?

They are much less than those observed by SBC television and radio stations. When SBC is corporatised, a separate regulatory board called Singapore Broadcasting Authority will be set up. All licence fees and all additional Government grants will then go to this statutory board. It will then be for this statutory board to decide how to allocate the fund it has for public broadcasting purposes and they can be allocated to SBC channels, the successor channels, they can be allocated to Radio Heart, or whatever other television channels we may then have. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> In view of the Minister's answer, it therefore shows that the concept of paying a certain amount of funds for public service broadcasts is not wrong. Since already NTUC Radio Heart, I believe, is already providing some PSBs, I see no reason why they should not be provided with a certain amount of funds right now. I am not asking for a 50:50 basis, Sir. But would the Minister consider providing at least an amount in proportion to their public service broadcasts as compared to SBC's? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> If NTUC Radio Heart were to put up a case as to how it can improve its public broadcasts if it receives grants, then I think this proposal can be put to the broadcasting authority when it is formed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Why not now, Sir? Why wait until it is formed? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Because, today, SBC is the regulatory authority. It regulates itself. In a sense, it is an invidious position given the fact that we do have other channels operating now and this is why there is a need to clean up and separate the regulatory authority from the broadcasting stations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Sir, I am asking this question in my capacity as a member of the Central Committee of CASE. As we have received complaints from members of the public on our hotline, is it necessary for SBC to increase the licensing fees when there is an accumulated surplus of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more than $400 million, as given in the Annual Report, and for last year's operating income it was more than $270 million. Also, a lot of the programmes in this expansion activity of SBC is due to re-runs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> In the accounting of SBC operations, we separate the budget for public service programmes from its commercial operations. The surpluses are accumulated in the commercial operations. They receive part of the licence fees and a certain amount of additional Government grants. I think it is important to have the accounts separate because otherwise this removes the incentive from SBC to operate efficiently. The question arises as to whether we should use the surpluses from the commercial side to subvent or to subsidise the operations on the PSB side. Here, I do not think it is wise because we are looking ahead to a television environment that will become very competitive. SBC has massive investment needs in the future to keep up with the competition and the technology. So I do not think it is wise now to tax SBC commercial operations in order to subsidise the public service broadcasts. In addition to licence fees, the public service broadcasting side of SBC also receives Government grants. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Batok):</b> Would the Minister state whether the SBC licence fees would attract GST? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> No, it will not. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the public service broadcasts carry commercial advertisements? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Yes, it does. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> If it does, then why can you not use whatever is collected commercially to subsidise? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> It is not enough. Whatever is collected commercially is ploughed back. In other words, if we have a purely commercial basis --- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon.

In fact, recently MITA has worked out an arrangement with the Finance Ministry for an additional grant to SBC based upon 15% of licence fees collected. In other words, whatever we collect from licence fees, the Finance Ministry will throw in an additional 15% for the public service broadcasting side of SBC.

The article asked whether The Necessary Stage had similar political motives. The Necessary Stage subsequently clarified that it had no such motive whether in the past or for the future. Prof. Tommy Koh, Chairman of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> National Arts Council (NAC), wrote to the Straits Times on 7th February 1994, stating that the NAC was satisfied that The Necessary Stage had not politicised its past performances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Straits Times' article was somewhat sensational, it did focus public attention on a potential problem which we should be mindful of. It is not good for the arts in Singapore to become politicised. While art, especially theatre, cannot avoid commenting on social and political conditions of society, in Singapore art should not be used to promote particular political causes, and certainly not in a covert way. Otherwise, the Government will be forced to treat and regulate such performances as a form of political activity. This will be quite different from the NAC's present approach towards the arts, and will surely retard the development of the arts in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forum theatre makes the audience a part of the performance. It can create a very intense experience for the audience, who become participants. The technique is not new. It is a variation of the group experience used by psychologists for group therapy, and by political and religious groups to secure the commitment of members to their causes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such techniques can be exploitative. Schools and members of the public should be aware of their possible dangers. The NAC rightly takes a very cautious approach towards them, and has stated that it will not fund forum theatre projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>3-ROOM HDB RENTAL FLATS AT BLOCKS 35 AND 38, TELOK BLANGAH RISE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Sale to sitting tenants)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

This package included the extension of service 16 to the Airport, and the addition of buses to service 24 so that MRT commuters will have a better link to the Airport. Although service 149 was withdrawn, Scheme B buses were retained on the route to cater to peak demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all other network changes under the MRT-bus integration exercise, the operators made these changes to the airport services to make more productive use of buses and drivers, and to reduce duplication of services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council approved the package of changes to the airport services after satisfying itself that alternative services are available to affected commuters. For example, for those taking service 149, the alternatives are service 31 between Toa Payoh and Marine Parade, and service 16 between Marine Parade and Changi Airport. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the practice that, whenever changes to bus routes are implemented, the PTC and bus operators monitor feedback closely to see if further fine-tuning is necessary. After evaluating feedback from the airport workers directly as well as through Mr Teo, the Council decided that SBS should supplement Service 16 with a parallel peak-hour express service 16E.

It is part of the overall effort to improve their status, image, professionalism and career development and also to attract better qualified, better educated personnel into the SAF. This amendment is necessary to define the rank of Warrant Officer, spell out the procedures for the appointment of Warrant Officers by the Armed Forces Council and make provisions for their higher responsibilities and additional duties. Warrant Officers may be appointed to hold junior officer appointments in the SAF. They will have enhanced disciplinary responsibilities including the powers of investigating officers in cases where the offender is below the rank of Warrant Officer. Clause 5 of the Bill provides for a Warrant Officer holding the appointment of a Company Commander or its equivalent to be vested with the powers to deal with junior military offenders summarily. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for a summary trial system for senior military officers in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and above. At present, senior military officers of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and above can only be tried summarily by the Armed Forces Council (AFC) which also serves as the Reviewing Authority for all disciplinary cases. The Bill seeks to resolve the apparent conflict between the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> judicial and reviewing responsibility of the Armed Forces Council. Although it is possible to refer every disciplinary case involving senior military officers to a subordinate military court, this might seem to be denying them an expeditious hearing that is currently available to other servicemen. Clauses 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Bill provide that the Chief of Defence Force (CDF) will have jurisdiction to deal with Lieutenant Colonels summarily while Colonels and above will be dealt with by a Senior Disciplinary Committee (SDC) which will be a special committee of the Armed Forces Council. The SDC will have at least three members appointed by the Chairman of the AFC. The Senior Disciplinary Committee will basically have similar powers to those currently exercised by the Armed Forces Council in summary trials of senior officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides a time bar provision for the trial of any offence under the Armed Forces Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, no disciplinary action can be taken against servicemen three years after the date of the offence itself or after the three years time bar. In some cases, particularly those arising from an audit, the offence itself is not discovered until after three years and the offender is not arrested until after this time. To enable disciplinary action to be taken in such cases, clause 20 of the Bill provides for the period of three years to run either from the date of the offence itself; or from the time the offence is reported to a disciplinary officer or a military policeman, whichever is later. A serviceman who claims trial in a subordinate military court will have his case adjourned to another date for hearing. And to remove any doubt as to when the three-year limitation ends, the Bill provides the limitation period to stop running once the servicemen is produced before a court martial. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Bill provides for a new bail system for military offenders, rectify anomalies in the Armed Forces' Council power and other nomenclature changes. The SAF Act provides for the bail provisions of the Singapore Criminal Procedure Code to apply to military offenders. At \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> present, bail may be offered when a person subject to military law is arrested or detained or is brought before a military court, except for offences which are punishable with death or life imprisonment. These Criminal Procedure Code provisions are unsuitable in that they are designed to apply to proceedings in a civil and not military court. Clause 28 of this Bill provides for specially tailored provisions of bail to be offered to military offenders when they are arrested pending investigations or are brought before the subordinate military court. The provisions are modelled on the bail provisions existing in the Criminal Procedure Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Armed Forces Council can quash the decision of a disciplinary officer at a summary trial. It may order that a case be retried by the same or another disciplinary officer but it has no power to order a court martial. To remove this inconsistency, clause 15 of the Bill provides the Armed Forces Council with the power to refer the case to the Chief Military Posecutor if it considers that the case should be tried by a subordinate military court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the restructuring of the NCO Corps, the definition of servicemen will be expanded to include new terms such as enlisted personnel, ratings and airmen. The obsolete rank of \"Corporal First Class\" will be deleted. These changes are provided for by consequential amendments in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill provides considerable powers to the CDF and also to the Senior Disciplinary Committee to summarily try and punish relatively senior officers. When senior officers are tried by their peers, there could be opportunities for victimisation, especially when it relates to very senior officers. I wonder whether the Minister can enlighten the House as to whether there are any safeguards against such victimisation. For example, whether the offender has other recourses if he refuses to be tried by the CDF or, in the case of the Senior Disciplinary Committee, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whether outside members, apart from military personnel, can be included in the Committee. I am not saying that this is happening but there may be cases where some people may be tempted to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that this amendment does not confer additional powers beyond what is already allowed in the SAF Act to conduct summary trial of senior SAF officers. All it does is that it enables the AFC to now delegate the power to summarily try Lieutenant Colonel to the Chief of Defence Force and for an officer of the rank of Colonel and above to be summarily tried by a Senior Discplinary Committee. Powers are already existing in the Act for these officers to be tried by summary proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether there is safeguard against victimisation, let me assure the Chairman of the GPC for Defence and Foreign Affairs that all summary trials in the SAF are conducted fairly and equitably and that the serviceman who is being tried will be treated fairly and there are adequate safeguards to prevent victimisation. I also want to point out that only scheduled offences as listed in the Schedule to the SAF Act can be tried summarily. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also in existence another safeguard that during a summary trial, if the serviceman feels that he is not being treated fairly and that, in fact, the penalties that are going to be handed down by the officer sitting in summary judgment of him will be more than just a reprimand, the serviceman in every case can always opt to have his case referred to a full court martial, so that he will not be subject to victimsation by just one senior officer sitting in summary judgment against him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point as to whether we could include an outside person in the Senior Disciplinary Committee that is appointed by the AFC to conduct summary proceedings against Colonels and above, I would like to point out that the SAF is a profession. Military discipline has to be administered by members of the military, by members of the profession. This is consistent with many other professions, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for instance, accountants, lawyers, doctors, when it comes to professional misconduct, a peer group sits in judgment of the offender. Likewise with military officers, if they are going to be tried summarily, I think it should be done so by their fellow officers who are senior to them. To be able to conduct a summary trial against a military offender, the person conducting the trial should have some knowledge and background of military discipline and military code of conduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an instance. There are many military offences which concern breach of professional standards such as offences like \"conduct to the prejudice of good order or discipline\" which must be taken in the military context. Or \"behaviour in a manner unbecoming of a member of the Singapore Armed Forces\", which again has to be taken in the context of the SAF. Therefore, only officers of the SAF who are more senior to the offender will have a proper background and knowledge of the context under which the offence took place and would be able to conduct a summary trial of the offender. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the SDC, the SDC in fact can include a non-SAF officer because the Armed Forces Council includes the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence. So when the Chairman appoints a Senior Disciplinary Committee to conduct a summary trial for a Colonel or a more senior officer, he could always include one of the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence to be a member of the SDC. The Permanent Secretary (Defence), while he is an outsider as far as SAF is concerned, is also somebody who is very familiar with military conduct and military discipline, by nature of his work as a Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence. So he will give valuable input as a non-serving member of the SAF and yet, at the same time, preserve the element of knowledge and experience in matters of military discipline. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that clarifies the concerns about victimisation expressed by the Chairman of the GPC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>JUDICIAL COMMITTEE (REPEAL) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to abolish all appeals to the Privy Council. With such abolition, Singapore will become like other Commonwealth countries in this region (except for Brunei) which have abolished all such appeals. At the opening of the new legal year this January, the Chief Justice stated that with the establishment of the single permanent Court of Appeal in Singapore, the time had come to review the remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council. The Government has agreed with him. So does the Law Society of Singapore which has written to say that they support the proposal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year when I took through this House the legislation to establish our new dedicated Court of Appeal, I was asked when we would remove all appeals to the Privy Council. I then replied that the Government would review the limited rights of appeal to the Privy Council with a view to its eventual removal after giving the new Court of Appeal time to establish itself. Now that the Council of Judges have unanimously recommended further appeals to the Privy Council be done away with, the time has come for us to cut the last strands of this legal umbilical cord once and for all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain briefly why the Government agrees with the Judiciary's recommendation. Since 1989, the rights of appeal have been restricted to criminal cases attracting the death penalty where the decision of the Court of Appeal was not unanimous. For civil cases, appeals to the Privy Council lay only where parties had a prior agreement to do so. In the last four years, there has been no criminal \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> appeal to the Privy Council. In civil cases, there have been only two civil appeals, both cases being related cases which were heard together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, I spelt out at some length in this House the reasons which compelled us to seriously question the desirability of maintaining this legal anachronism which has been a feature of our judicial system for the last 30 years since our independence in 1965. The most important reason is that our local legal, economic, social and political developments have placed Singapore on a path that in many ways is different from that being followed by the United Kingdom. This has become especially pronounced with the United Kingdom's entry into the European Community. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is that continued reliance on the Privy Council would stultify local development of the law which is already over-dependent on case authority from the United Kingdom. The abolition of appeals to the Privy Council would give our local jurisprudence an opportunity to develop along indigenous lines and in a direction more attuned to local and regional realities. In this regard, Members will recall that last year we enacted the Application of English Law Act which abolished Section 5 of the Civil Law Act rendering it unnecessary for our Courts to apply the law as administered in England in the determination of a mercantile issue. With this new law, our courts will now apply only prescribed English statutes as part of Singapore law. Our local legal jurisprudence will henceforth develop on a separate and independent course with English decisions serving only as persuasive authorities for the guidance of our judges. They will not be binding precedents. Abolition of appeals to the Privy Council is a logical and necessary step consequent to the enactment of the Application of English Law Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the provisions of the Bill, clause 2 repeals the Judicial Committee Act, thus abolishing appeals to the Privy Council. This, however, is subject to a saving provision in clause 4 which provides for the continued application of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> any appeal, application for leave or special leave to appeal made under the Judicial Committee Act before the commencement of the Bill and they will continue to apply. Clause 3 provides for consequential amendments to other Acts set out in the Schedule, and I may add that we will also have to repeal Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore which is an enabling provision allowing appeals to the Privy Council. That, however, will be provided for in a separate Bill which has been introduced by the Finance Minister to amend the Constitution, and it also contains certain other amendments to the Constitution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Sir, I declare my interest as a lawyer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill and I wish to raise two points on which I seek the Minister's clarification. Sir, the position today is that civil appeals to the Privy Council are permissible only if the parties to the proceedings consent to be bound by the appeal to the Privy Council provided that that consent is given before the commencement of the appeal before the Court of Appeal in Singapore. This arose out of an amendment in April 1989. At that time, in moving the amendment, the Hon. Minister said that one of the options the Government had considered was a total abolition of appeals in civil cases to the Privy Council. But having regard to various views and suggestions expressed in the House as well as outside, the Government decided that we should not completely cut off appeals to the Privy Council in commercial matters for various reasons. One is because of the expertise of the Privy Council and the other is the legal store of knowledge that the Privy Council has. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it was decided that this option be made available to commercial houses, in particular, banks, finance houses, etc, that they be entitled to put into agreements that they enter into, a clause to the effect that they would agree to be bound by appeals to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what we did in 1989 was to afford this avenue to parties which wished to retain the option of going to the Privy Council. Some parties obviously acted on the faith of that avenue that was afforded and entered into agreements with clauses to the effect that they agree to be bound by appeals to the Privy Council. I consider it slightly odd, to say the least, that the Government, having afforded that avenue, as it were, and the parties having adopted the option that has been given, having walked down that avenue, are now being told that that avenue is closed. Because what this Bill proposes to do is actually to abolish appeals altogether. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had, some five years ago, given parties that option. People have actually used it. Certainly commercial houses in some cases have, and now we are taking it away from them, summarily, if you like. Instances like these are not covered in the transitional provision. I wonder whether the Minister would consider including these instances in the transitional provision. Let those agreements be worked out, or at least run their course, before this Bill takes effect in so far as these agreements are concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and this is related to the first point I have made, the transitional provision in clause 4 provides that the repeal shall not affect any appeals before the commencement or before the effect of the repeal. We are in a very odd situation because it means that parties who have pending appeals, and who might not yet have agreed to go to the Privy Council, are still given time to make that agreement to escape the provisions of this Bill. Because they are entitled to agree before the commencement of the appeal. In other words, before they stand up in the Court of Appeal, they are entitled at any time before then to agree to go to the Privy Council. This transitional provision appears to allow them more time to take a decision whether or not to agree. Whereas the transitional provision takes away from parties who have already agreed to go to the Privy Council on the faith, as I said, of the amendment that this House passed in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 1989. It seems somewhat odd to me and I wonder whether the Minister would explain the policy rationale for that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if I could just ask the Minister a clarification under clause 4. When it is said that this Act shall not apply to any appeal, does that mean an appeal already commenced, or does that mean proceedings in which notices of appeal have been filed? Because there is a time lag between the filing of a notice of appeal and the actual hearing of the appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill. Sir, I shall be brief. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, four years ago when the GPC for Law and Home Affairs brought up the question of a single permanent Court of Appeal in this House, the Minister patiently explained that while he supported the concept, the constraining factor was that of manpower. Since then, more Judicial Commissioners have been recruited and today we know that another two new Judges have been appointed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the single permanent Court of Appeal was set up. There has been one year of experience and the experience has been good. Sir, it is now close to three decades since our independence. The Government and Judiciary have patiently, carefully and meticulously worked towards this day when we are ready to assume our own judicial responsibilities as an independent nation. Today, the umbilical cord to the Privy Council will be finally severed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like Mr Davinder Singh, I would like to ask the Minister to clarify on an area of concern that has been expressed by some members of the shipping and financial community and other MNCs. In the previous Judicial Committee Act, parties could agree to have their cases heard by the Privy Council prior to a hearing by the Court of Appeal in Singapore. Will today's repeal of this clause adversely affect our position as an international financial, shipping and training centre? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my belief that the passing of this Bill will have far-reaching implications for the legal profession. This Bill, together \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with the laws adopted earlier to restrict the use of Queen's Counsels to only very complicated cases, will be an added impetus to further encourage more lawyers to specialise. This will provide a pool of well-trained specialists to serve the international city that Singapore must be for the next century. I am sure that the legal profession will rise to the occasion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both speakers who have spoken. Both Dr Arthur Beng and Mr Davinder Singh have raised a point about the feature which was introduced five years ago about allowing parties for civil cases to agree beforehand that they could have their appeals to the Privy Council. Does this legislation bring about a loss of confidence on the part of investors or the shipping community? I do not think so. First, as you will have noticed from my speech, in the past five years there have been only two appeals to the Privy Council. I have not had any representations put to me or to anybody else that there is alarm or concern among the shipping or commercial community. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me also say that obviously the feature which was introduced five years ago could not have been intended to last forever, but at some stage we would have had to do away with appeals to the Privy Council. For those in the shipping or banking community for whom it is important that the resolution of a dispute that they have under the contract be located outside Singapore, or the final decision maker on the dispute should be in England - it is always open to them still to agree and provide in the contract or other document that they can have recourse to arbitration in England. They can have a prior agreement that their dispute shall be settled by arbitration by one or more of the leading Queen's Counsels or other outstanding lawyers in England or other parts of the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh has asked me on the interpretation on clause 4. I should like to point out to him that the saving provision \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is almost identically worded as the saving provision in the Bill enacted in 1989. In fact, the wordings are almost exactly the same. The intention is that it should cover any appeal which has actually been made, not just an appeal which has been heard or part heard. Does the saving provision also cover pending agreements even before the appeal is made?

This is consistent with international practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Historical background</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the exemption of the requirement for Import and Export Permits for trade with Peninsular Malaysia dates back to the period before 1957, when Singapore was part of the British Straits Settlement. At that time, imports and exports moved freely between Singapore and the various States of Malaya without the need for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Permits. When Singapore became independent in 1965, we continued the practice of not requiring Permits for trade with Peninsular Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, Singapore legislated the current Registration of Imports and Exports Rules. This requires traders importing from or exporting to West Malaysia by road and rail to deliver a Declaration to the Customs at the Woodlands Customs checkpoint or at the Railway Goods Shed checkpoint. Transport agents for imports from and exports to West Malaysia by sea and air, deliver the Declaration to the Imports and Exports Office. The Declarations do not require any endorsement by Government departments, and are used primarily for the compilation of trade statistics. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Rationale for the Amendment</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing procedure for documenting trade with West Malaysia will no longer be adequate when GST is implemented. With effect from 1st April 1994, imports into Singapore from all sources will be subject to GST collection. Exports from Singapore, including re-exports, to all destinations will be eligible for refund of GST. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it necessary for all import declarations to be endorsed and scrutinised to ensure that the reporting is accurate for the purpose of GST declaration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment will remove the exemption for Import and Export Permits for trade with West Malaysia to enable the Trade Development Board to scrutinise, if necessary, the declarations of imports from and exports to West Malaysia, and endorse them before they can be accepted at all Customs checkpoint for the clearance of goods. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Implementation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the amendment, the Permit Requirement for trade with Peninsular \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Malaysia will harmonise Singapore's trade documentation system for all our trading partners, and facilitate the implementation of GST. We plan to implement the new Rules on 1st April 1994, to coincide with the implementation of the GST. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 4(2) of the Registration of Imports and Exports Act (Chapter 270), resolves that the Registration of Imports and Exports (Amendment) Rules 1994, published as Notification No. S 14 in the Government Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 1 of 7th January 1994, as contained in Paper S.L. 4 of 1994, be approved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CIVIL LIST</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name under item No. 5 in the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> *That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule to that Act be varied by deleting the figures \"$868,800\", \"$53,000\", \"$2,249,900\", \"$411,300\", and \"$146,600\" in the second column and substituting the figures \"$1,190,400\", \"$55,000\", \"$2,175,700\", \"$561,600\" and \"$51,500\", respectively. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provisions for privy purse and entertainment allowance to $1,190,400 and $55,000 respectively.

Growth was broad-based, with all major sectors doing well though overall growth was also boosted by the strong performance of the financial and business services sector, in particular the stock market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to achieve good growth despite sluggish growth in most of the developed countries because the Singapore economy benefited from strong regional growth and good prospects in certain product niches like electronics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector expanded by 9.8% on the back of strong demand for electronic products like disk drives, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and printed circuit boards from the USA, Europe and the booming Asia-Pacific region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial and business services sector saw its growth rate more than double from the 5.3% in 1992 to 13% in 1993. The faster growth was due to buoyant activity in the stock market and foreign exchange trading, faster growth in domestic lending and a modest recovery in the Asian Dollar Market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boosted by buoyant entrepot and transhipment trade, the commerce sector and the transport &amp; communications sector also did well. The commerce sector grew by 8.5% and transport &amp; communications grew by 9.6%. Construction activity remained buoyant with growth of 8.0% due to the strong pipeline of contracts awarded in 1992 and 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in three years, productivity growth exceeded real wage growth. The strong productivity growth of 6.4% reflected both a cyclical recovery from the weak productivity growth in 1991 and 1992, and the upgrading of our manufacturing activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the Unit Labour Cost Index fell and contributed to the continued decline in the Unit Business Cost Index. Against the other Newly Industrialising Economies, Singapore's competitive position also held steady. One sign of our continued attractiveness to investors is the record $3.9 billion worth of investment commitments in the manufacturing sector which we received, in a year when investor countries cut back on outward investment or diverted investments to China and Vietnam. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1994</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The external environment has improved. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks has given a clear signal that most trading nations are committed to the continued liberalisation of world trade. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the developed economies, the USA, which is Singapore's largest export market, is expected to continue on a path of sustained recovery. Germany and Japan are now in recession but are expected to recover gradually during 1994. This should have a positive impact on the rest of continental Europe and Asia. In Asia, growth is expected to continue at a brisk pace as domestic consumption and investment boost demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will benefit from the improved economic prospects in the world because we are competitive, and continued investments in infrastructural development, education and skills upgrading will help us to maintain our competitive edge. Our local entrepreneurs have continued to seek out opportunities in the region. The Government has also put in place major programmes like the regionalisation drive, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the health care cost containment measures, and improvements to our education system to build the foundation of our future well being and success. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry has forecast 1994 growth to be in the range of 6-8%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the continued good growth of the economy, the Government will proceed as announced in the last Budget to make the final 1.5 percentage point adjustments to CPF contribution rates. From 1 July 1994, the employers' CPF contribution rate will be increased from 18.5% to 20% while the employees' rate will be reduced from 21.5% to 20%. Employers and employees should take this adjustment into account in their wage negotiations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to longer-term issues in economic management. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Preparing for the future</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has sustained rapid economic growth over the last 20 years. Singaporeans today enjoy high incomes, a good standard of living and an excellent health care system. Good education and our system of meritocracy allow \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singaporeans to start from the same starting line and succeed on the basis of ability and hard work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We achieved rapid economic development not solely through good luck. Otherwise many more countries would similarly have succeeded. It was the result of the deliberate efforts of the Government, strongly supported by Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was able to garner the support of the people to pursue tough policies that helped economic development. And Singaporeans had the tenacity to try out unconventional solutions to daunting problems. We succeeded against the odds. But it was also fortuitous that a generally benign world economic environment, with strong US leadership and a liberalising trade regime, gave developing countries like Singapore a chance to grow out of poverty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are at a turning point. We have become a Newly Industrialised Economy (NIE), and are on the threshold of the First League of nations. Our per capita GDP has overtaken some OECD countries. But Singaporeans must not be lulled into thinking that we have arrived, and start relaxing and taking progress and prosperity for granted. We have some way to go before entering into the First League of nations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower is Singapore's only resource. Our educational profile has improved greatly, but it is still far below that of the developed countries and even the NIEs. Among the NIEs, we have the lowest educated workforce. Only about 54% of our labour force have attained at least a secondary school education, compared to over 70% in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only about 25% of our labour force have at least a post-secondary education, compared to about 50% in Taiwan and South Korea. In the developed countries, about 75% of the workforce in Japan and Switzerland have at least a post-secondary education, and 87% in the USA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic structure is also very much that of a developing country. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> depend heavily on foreign technology. Our R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of GDP is about 60% of Taiwan's and South Korea's, and only 40% of the developed countries. Very few of our companies rank as world-class corporations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great challenge facing Singapore is how do we collectively manage the leap into the ranks of the First League. The path will be uphill, as we face tougher competition for investments and in the market place from other developing countries and NIEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next phase, the role of Government will be no less important than that during our take-off stage. I shall now review the role of Government in economic management in Singapore, and examine its relevance in our current stage of development. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Role of Government in economic management</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That governments have a role to play in the economic affairs of a nation is not disputed. Even Adam Smith, the advocate of the \"invisible hand\", envisaged a minimum level of state provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic history in the last 80-90 years has defined two models for economies - central planning and the free market system. The former has proved to be a dismal failure. However, the question of the proper role of government is not settled as even in so-called market economies, the role of government varies considerably. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A market economy encourages competition and the efficient use of available resources. But, carried to the extreme, market solutions are harsh on the less able who become the poor and low income earners. On the other hand, heavy government intervention and subsidies entail high taxes, which discourage hard work and enterprise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of sluggish growth and high unemployment, many Western countries have been critically re-assessing the role of government, especially in the provision of welfare benefits. Everywhere in the OECD, governments are trying to reduce \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> welfare benefits to improve the incentive for work, reconfigure the education system towards skills relevant to the economy, and reduce the tax burden on the productive sectors. This re-assessment is now more urgent as these mature economies face strong competition from younger economies in East Asia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Asian countries have been the subject of a serious two-year study by the World Bank, in an attempt to discover lessons that can be applied to other countries. The results are summarised in a report entitled \"The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy\". The emphasis on public policy is noteworthy. It suggests a positive role for government, if it can be applied in those areas that support private initiative. For example, while heavy investments in basic education up to secondary level are highly productive, generous welfare provisions are not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the World Bank has identified two elements in the role of government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is in \"getting the fundamentals right\". This means high levels of domestic savings, broadly based human capital, good macro-economic management, and limited price distortions. Rapid productivity growth was helped by liberal policy on the acquisition of technology either through openness to direct foreign investment or licensing. Public investment complemented private investment while education policies stressed universal primary schooling and improvements in quality at primary and secondary levels. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element is in careful policy interventions that had strict limits on their cost and caused minimal distortions to the economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developed countries have come to a similar conclusion. The OECD undertook a study into the problem of high unemployment in 1992. It concluded that high unemployment results from a combination of weak macro-economic \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> policy, weak human resource development policies, rigid labour markets and technological change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its advice is for governments to focus on three areas: providing a stable macro-economic environment; ensuring flexibility in the labour market through education, training, re-training, enterprise promotion and flexible wage-setting process; and a better-designed system to maintain a degree of social solidarity in the face of high unemployment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After painful experiments in central planning and painstaking studies, the role of government in economic management is now more clearly understood. The government's role is to provide a conducive environment for private initiative while intervening directly only in areas where there is market failure. These are precisely the areas where the Singapore Government has focused its energies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Singapore Government's role</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's philosophy of economic management is that the Government's role is not to supplant the private sector but to help its development, so as to provide Singaporeans with a good life. With this guiding principle in mind, Government's intervention has been, and will continue to be, in four main areas. These are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) providing a conducive environment for economic growth and social stability; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) maximising the employment potential of Singaporeans through a practical and rigorous education system; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) upgrading economic structure through selective direct investments in strategic projects; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) ensuring Singaporeans have relevant skills by providing up-to-date training and skills upgrading programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Economic growth and social stability</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a natural area for Government involvement, because there are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> substantial factors, both internal and external, that individuals and the private sector cannot on their own control or take into account of. Examples include maintaining a stable macro-economic environment with a strong currency, low inflation and high savings; the planning and development of infrastructure; the provision of education and training facilities, public housing and public health care. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While governments do not create wealth, they can create the conducive environment necessary for economic growth. The Government cannot adopt a totally laissez-faire approach, and blindly hope that market forces will make everything work out in the end. For example, we embarked on the design and building of the MRT system long before traffic congestion in the city became serious. Similarly, the Government built Changi Airport, and subsequently Changi Terminal Two in anticipation of significantly increased air passenger traffic. These were high risk decisions that commercial banks would have balked at financing. Had the Government not taken the lead, the private sector would never have built an MRT or a Changi Airport, and Singapore would have been worse off. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to plan well into the future to keep our infrastructural development ahead of demand. At the same time we must further streamline administrative procedures and reduce the Government involvement in areas where it is no longer necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also responsible for ensuring social stability, especially given our potentially volatile multi-racial and multi-religious mix. For example, left to natural forces, people will find it more comfortable to gravitate towards the like-minded. But the cumulative result of many such individual choices will be racial and religious enclaves, a sure formula for social strife as we have seen in other parts of the world. We must continue to ensure that our housing estates are racially and socially well integrated, and strengthen social tolerance and harmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to uphold our system of meritocracy. It has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enabled Singaporeans to enjoy high social mobility. Those who are capable and prepared to work hard can move ahead regardless of their social background. This reduces social tensions and benefits everyone, able and less able alike. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must also intervene to provide the necessary social infrastructure. Left to market forces alone, most Singaporeans will not have decent housing and many will not have adequate access to medical services. The Government will therefore continue to provide the necessary social infrastructure for lower income earners, and adequate subsidies for essential health, education, and housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Education</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must maximise the potential of every Singaporean. The Government has an indispensable role in keeping the education system, and the knowledge and skills that it imparts to students, relevant to the needs of the economy. Those entering the workforce must possess the knowledge and skills to make them employable, and give them and their employers a competitive edge over their foreign competitors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our limited manpower resources, it is vital that we minimise wastage of precious human talent. We must continually find ways to improve our education system, and reduce drop-out rates. The Government will continue to plan and anticipate demand for the different types of post-secondary school manpower required to support our economy, so that universities, polytechnics and the ITEs can provide the relevant types of courses and intake capacity. We will publicise the demand and career prospects for the various professions, and encourage school leavers to apply for the available courses. While the choice of courses ultimately depends on individual applicants, we cannot passively accept these individual choices as the final word, and admit everyone into the course of their choice, regardless of employment prospects. We must guide and channel students towards more promising areas and disciplines. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Where the supply of students exceeds the number of places we need, we have to ration these places, according to merit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. Manufacturing is a cornerstone of our economy. Our education system must produce sufficient numbers of computer scientists, engineers, technicians and skilled workers to support the manufacturing sector and to attract high technology companies to locate in Singapore. Many Singaporeans may find it interesting and rewarding to pursue a career in Medicine or Law. But, if too many of our best and brightest gravitate towards these disciplines, not enough will become engineers and computer scientists. The viability of our economy will therefore be at risk. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Upgrading the economy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid economic development and growth of the regional economies will mean more competition for Singapore. They will be able to produce at a lower cost some of the products currently produced here. Our companies will need to continue upgrading into higher value added activities in order to remain competitive. But, because we are already at a higher base with higher cost levels, we need to be even more imaginative in finding competitive niches. Changes in technology and markets necessitate our taking a total approach to strengthening our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must find niches for ourselves, either as a critical node in the global network or as the host of a key industry cluster. This involves building up mutually reinforcing sets of core capabilities that will help to reduce the cost of the finished product. The Government will play an active role in identifying, building up and selectively investing in such industry clusters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Government has set up the $1 billion Cluster Development Fund. The Fund will make strategic investments, together with private sector partners, to bring to Singapore projects which develop core capabilities within our industry clusters. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to the catalytic role played by the Government in the earlier days of our economic development. In the 1960s, we needed to build a new economy that could absorb the large number of people entering the labour force. The Government started various new enterprises like Sembawang, Jurong and Keppel shipyards, DBS Bank, NATSTEEL, Neptune Orient Lines and Singapore Airlines. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When necessary, the Government even took significant equity shares in private sector projects which involved higher risks than usual, but which were strategically vital because they brought in new jobs, new technology and access to markets. One good example is the petrochemical complex. Our initial equity investment of $520 million in 1977 paved the way for major investments by prominent international companies in this key sector. Total petrochemical investments amounted to $2.7 billion by the end of 1993, and 1993 output totalled $1.7 billion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not go into these activities to \"crowd out\" the private sector. It did so only when the private sector did not have the necessary expertise or capital, or when entrepreneurs found the risks of the ventures too high. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to invest directly in strategic projects to promote the development of key sectors of industry, especially in manufacturing. The Cluster Development Fund will enable us to invest in selective strategic projects in the coming years. This will help to spark off other complementary projects, and promote medium and long-term growth in the industry groups involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local enterprises already play an important role as supporting industries to MNCs. The Cluster Development Fund will also be used to help the more promising ones develop their operations to keep pace with their customers, and to become MNCs in their own right. Furthermore, the Fund will be used to invest in the region, together with local and multi-national companies, to bring about spin-offs for our domestic industry clusters. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Skills training and upgrading</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we progress up the technological ladder, capital investment per worker will increase. We must therefore ensure that our workers possess the relevant technical and operational skills to work optimally and productively. Only then can employers compete effectively in the international market place, obtain a reasonable return on their investments, grow and create more employment opportunities for Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy will continue to restructure as competitors develop and become more competitive. Companies will need to continually upgrade their technology and product lines. Some may have to relocate to neighbouring countries because they are no longer viable here, and be replaced by new companies. In this whole process, workers will need to continually acquire new skills. Others will be displaced and need re-training to take up new jobs. The Government will work with the trade unions and employers to upgrade the skills of older workers, and re-train those who are displaced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund (SDF) will continue to play a key role in the skills training and upgrading of our workers. In FY92, the SDF disbursed more than $50 million in support of training programmes to upgrade workers' skills. This is much more than the $15 million collected through the Skills Development Levy that year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Levy is based on an employer contribution rate of 1% of the pay of each employee whose monthly salary is $750 or below. Over the years, collections through the Skills Development Levy have been falling. This is because fewer people earn monthly salaries of less than $750 with each passing year. At the present SDF disbursement level, the Fund will eventually be depleted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we step up the training, upgrading and re-training of the workforce in the coming years, SDF disbursements will also increase. The Government has therefore decided to revise the salary ceiling for Skills Development Levy \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> collection from $750 to $1,000, with the levy rate remaining at 1%. This revision will take effect from FY95. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to further revise this salary ceiling over time to match the annual Skills Development Levy collection with actual disbursements. SDF can then have adequate funding to help our workforce into the 21st century. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Evolution in the role of the Government</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while Government needs to remain engaged in economic management, there are limits to its direct involvement. Greater Government role must translate into higher Government expenditure, and eventually, into higher taxes. This will reduce our ability to compete in world markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the developed countries, government expenditures vary from about 30% of GDP as in the case of the United States to over 60% of GDP in Sweden. As a result, these countries have had to impose high personal and corporate taxes. They have in the process eroded their national competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government has prudently kept Government expenditure low. Government expenditure in FY93 was below 17% of GDP. The Government has always budgeted for and achieved a modest surplus each year, in order to accumulate sufficient reserves to tide us over bad years, as well as prepare for the rapid ageing of the population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low Government expenditure and the surplus have enabled the Government to reduce tax rates over the past years. Singaporeans today pay one of the lowest tax rates in the world. Total Government operating revenue in 1993, which includes income taxes, motor vehicle taxes and customs and excise duties, amounted to only 22% of GDP. This compares with 31% to 58% in the developed countries, and 25% in South Korea and Taiwan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, married Singaporeans earning below $25,000 per year in fact pay no income taxes, while those earning $50,000 per year pay only 4% of their earnings in income tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Contrary to popular perceptions, the vast majority of Singaporeans certainly do not pay high taxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual areas in which the Government acts also cannot remain static. These must change with new circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to change the way some public services are managed, giving them greater operational autonomy, to make them more efficient and responsive to the needs of the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example in health care, the Government has restructured hospitals, allowing them greater autonomy in day-to-day operations while retaining Government oversight of the health care system. This has kept the hospitals efficient, kept costs low and ensured that basic health care costs remain affordable for all Singaporeans. Singaporeans now enjoy good service in restructured hospitals while those who cannot afford to pay the full cost of treatment can still enjoy varying amounts of subsidies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in tax administration, conventionally seen as a core area of Government responsibility, the Government has converted the Inland Revenue Department into a statutory board - the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. The improvement in the level of service and the attention paid to customer service are clear to the taxpayers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, Singapore is not alone. Several countries, for example, the UK and New Zealand, are also converting previously government functions into executive agencies with well-defined goals and service targets. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONCLUSION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have achieved much in the last 20 years, due to the combination of sound economic management by the Government and hard work of the people. We can all be proud that each of us has contributed towards the effort of economic growth and nation-building, whether as part of the public sector, as a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> risk-taking entrepreneur, or as a salaried employee. This teamwork must continue as we strive to gain promotion into the First League. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PART II</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to the Budget for the next financial year. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government expenditure will continue to focus on areas that support and promote economic growth for Singapore. We must avoid the pitfalls of welfarism which, as the experience of socialist and western democratic governments have shown, sooner or later leads to dependency and destruction of the work ethic. We prefer to spend in ways which build national resilience and promote enterprise, hard work and prudence. Government's role is to put in place the necessary infrastructure, provide a clean and safe environment, and train our people to the best of their potential. The FY94 Budget reflects these long term priorities: an emphasis on education, sound economic infrastructure, affordable health care, good public housing and national security. At the same time, we will increase funding for the arts, sports and recreational activities to satisfy the broadening aspirations of Singaporeans, to advance social cohesion and to improve the quality of life of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong and dynamic private sector must remain the engine of growth in Singapore. The size of the public sector will therefore be controlled so as to release more manpower to the private sector. At the same time, the public sector will continue to make improvements in the management of its financial and human resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since recovery from the recession in 1987, revenue growth and careful control over expenditures have allowed us to generate budget surpluses every year. This has been achieved without dampening economic growth or holding \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> back any productive investments. As a result we have been able to set aside substantial sums each year to reserves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point it is worth repeating that in the special circumstances of Singapore, it is essential that in good years we accumulate surpluses to reserves of Government. Singapore has little land and no natural resources to fall back on. Our financial reserves are therefore of crucial importance, not only to see us through times of crisis but also for securing investor confidence in our future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our budgetary surpluses also allow us to build up the assets of Singaporeans through grants to buy quality assets, like Telecom shares. It also enables us to embark on programmes like Edusave and Medifund. Government has in the last two years channelled a large part of our budget surpluses into Edusave and Medifund. I announced in the last Budget Speech that Government would inject $500 million into Edusave in FY93. In view of Singapore's strong economic performance and healthy budget balance, I have decided that Government's contribution to the Edusave fund for FY93 should be increased to $1 billion. Supplementary Estimates to effect this will be tabled in Parliament next week. For FY94, another $500 million will be channelled to Edusave and $100 million to the Medifund from the projected surplus. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>Pension Fund</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our favourable fiscal position will also enable us to set up a Pension Fund for public officers. Currently, pensions for them are paid out of Government's annual operating expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pension payments to retired public officers are protected under the Constitution. Pensions constitute a charge on the Consolidated Fund, which means that pension obligations must be honoured regardless of the Government's budgetary position or the state of the economy. This is rightly so. Civil servants and military officers who have served the nation faithfully should not spend their retirement in fear that the Government may not have the money to pay for their pensions when times are bad. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total annual pensions expenditure currently amounts to some $390 million. As a percentage of GDP, it is expected to remain steady over the medium term at approximately 0.4%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the annual payment is not large, the current funding arrangement is unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Constitutional protection afforded to pensioners under this arrangement is good only so long as there are funds available in the general purpose Consolidated Fund to pay the pensions. The present arrangement does not recognise pensions as a sizeable future liability, and hence there are no dedicated funds set aside for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present arrangement also understates the manpower cost of the civil service. It requires future taxpayers to pay for the services rendered by the present generation of civil servants and military personnel. This is fine so long as the economy continues to do well and future taxpayers do not mind additional taxes. Should there be a downturn, they will find it a painful burden to bear. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is prudent therefore for Government to recognise pensions as a future liability and to make provision for it explicitly. This is simply good housekeeping practice. We do so for other explicit liabilities. For example, every year a substantial amount is provided in the Estimates for Sinking Fund contributions. For FY94, the amount is $2.6 billion. These Sinking Fund contributions have to be made by law for the redemption of maturing loan stocks issued to CPF Board by Government. We should similarly start making provision for future pension liabilities. We should do so now when revenues are strong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will therefore introduce legislation later this year to set up a Pension Fund. Part of Government's reserves will be transferred to the Pension Fund to provide for the past service pension liabilities of pensioners and serving officers. On-going service pension liabilities will be funded by an annual budgetary contribution, estimated at approximately 17% of pensionable emoluments. A Pension Fund with dedicated \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> assets to back pension liabilities will be a solid assurance to pensionable public officers that their pensions will continue to be paid. At the same time, future taxpayers will be relieved of the burden of paying for services rendered by current and past public officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to the FY94 Expenditure Estimates. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>THE FY94 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total operating and development expenditure in FY94 is expected to amount to $16.7 billion, which is 18.6% of GDP, up from 17.0% in FY93. The substantial increase is primarily due to increased development expenditure, from 5.5% of GDP in FY93 to 6.9% in FY94. Operating expenditure, on the other hand, will show a more modest increase, from 11.5% to 11.7% of GDP in FY94. These expenditure levels are within Government's medium term policy target of keeping total expenditure to 20% of GDP, with no more than 12% for operating expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $16.7 billion budgeted for total Government expenditure in FY94 is 19% more than in FY93. As in previous years, Social and Community Services will take up the largest share at nearly 40%. More than half of this will be for education. The rest will go into healthcare services, subsidies on public housing, environmental protection, community development and support of the arts. The second largest share, at 32% of total expenditure, will be taken up by National Security, including Defence and Home Affairs. Economic and infrastructural development, including transportation, R&amp;D and other civil engineering projects, will take up another 18%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now elaborate on the FY94 expenditure proposals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Operating Expenditure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure comprises Expenditure on Manpower, Other Operating Expenditure, Grants-in-Aid and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Pensions. In FY94, operating expenditure is projected at $10.6 billion, up 11.1% over the revised FY93 expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on Manpower will go up by $294 million to $2.5 billion. This is 2.8% of GDP, compared to 2.7% in FY93. The increase is to cater for the salary revision effective 1st January 1994, normal salary increments, and for filling essential vacancies. Under the Government's Zero-Growth in Manpower policy, Ministries will continue to meet new demands through productivity improvements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Operating Expenditure or OOE is projected at $5.5 billion or 6.1% of GDP. This is $413 million or 8.2% more than FY93. Apart from inflation and higher workload, the increase also caters for additional expenditure by the Ministries and departments on input GST. Other increases include higher provision for training bursaries for nurses, teaching bursaries, scholarships, and for maintenance of buildings and roads. The implementation of the Small Families Improvement Scheme to help low income families meet housing and educational expenses also accounts for part of the increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants-in-Aid to various Government funded statutory boards and restructured hospitals are expected to come to $2.2 billion, or 2.5% of GDP. This represents an increase of $316 million over FY93. Larger grants are required to meet the higher operating costs of aided schools, polytechnics and universities. Additional grants and subsidies totalling some $30 million will also be given for education, healthcare and public housing to offset the impact of the GST. A grant will also be given to the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board to compensate the loss of revenue to STPB when the cess rate is reduced from 4% to 1% with the introduction of GST. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, Pensions Expenditure is expected to remain at 0.4% of GDP, increasing by $30 million over the FY93 allocation to $388 million. This is because of a larger number of pensioners and the rising cost of medical subsidies for pensioners. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Development Expenditure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development Expenditure is expected to reach $6.2 billion in FY94 or 6.9% of GDP. This is almost 37% of total expenditure, as against 32% in FY93. Government's intention is to allocate an increasing share of the budget for development expenditure, to reach 40% over the medium term. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main part of the development budget will go towards the provision of social and economic infrastructure. Major healthcare-related projects include the development of Eastern General Hospital, the new Kandang Kerbau and Tan Tock Seng Hospitals, and the combined Institute of Health and National Dental Centre. Infrastructural projects include land reclamation works at Changi East, Tuas, and Buran Darat, the Schools Building Programme, the Roads Building Programme and the Sewerage and Drainage Programmes. To improve public transportation, Government has set aside funds for the development of bus interchanges and the Electronic Road Pricing System. The public can also look forward to better service with the construction of the new Immigration Building and the second phase of the redevelopment of Woodlands Checkpoint. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A capital subsidy of $601 million for public housing has been provided, an increase of 7.5% over FY93. A substantial part of this will be for the Upgrading Programme, including Interim Upgrading to improve the quality of existing HDB estates. Provision is also made for other infrastructure work in HDB new towns and for specific works in existing estates. Funds are also needed to pay for the discount on the sale of tenanted HDB shophouses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) is crucial to Singapore's efforts to leverage science and technology for industrial competitiveness and to locate higher value added activities in Singapore. The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), established 3 years ago, will continue to spearhead this effort. A total of $400 million or 0.4% of GDP will be provided for Government-funded R&amp;D in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> FY94. This represents an increase of $187 million over FY93. The emphasis will continue to be on industry-related R&amp;D, with $350 million allocated to the R&amp;D Fund to be administered by NSTB. Another $50 million will be allocated for research projects of an academic nature to be undertaken by various institutions under the Ministry of Education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital grants totalling $2.2 billion will be given to other statutory boards. This is an increase of $916 million over FY93. The projects include a new campus for Temasek Polytechnic, upgrading of the National University of Singapore, and development of aided and independent schools, junior colleges and vocational institutes. Other projects include the Woodlands extension of the MRT system, the development of water works, recreational facilities and attractions on Sentosa, extension and improvement of community centres, and the redevelopment of Outward Bound Singapore. Grants will be extended to provide recreational and welfare facilities for the elderly and to upgrade Singapore Sports Council facilities. Funds are also allocated for strategic investments and other economic development schemes under the Economic Development Board, including the recently announced Cluster Development Fund. Another major project will be the development of Jurong Island, amalgamating the cluster of petrochemical islands. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give the House a brief update of measures taken by Government to manage and control expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Singapore Government Management Accounting System</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computerised management accounting systems, acronymed SIGMA, have been successfully introduced in all ministries. SIGMA equips the Government with accurate cost information to help ensure that operations are cost-effective. It also assists managers in evaluating competing options, such as whether certain activities should be performed in-house or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> contracted out to the private sector. SIGMA will continue to be enhanced and extended to all departments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Budgeting for Results</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGMA provides a basis for rational decision making by managers. In addition, it is an important step forward in our on-going efforts to link budgets to performance and outputs. We call this Budgeting For Results. Under this arrangement, the budget provided to a department is directly linked to the quantity and quality of goods and services to be provided by that department. For example, the budgets of several educational institutions are already based on a pre-determined sum per student-year. We hope to extend the system gradually to other departments where feasible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linking the budget of a department to the results expected will make the accountability of the public sector manager clearer. It should also help encourage greater initiative, entrepreneurial thinking and financial discipline within the civil service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Zero-base Reviews</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the Auditor-General has been conducting zero-base reviews of individual Ministries. These are to ensure that Ministries' major policies and practices remain relevant and effective, and that overall, their resources are efficiently utilized. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year, reviews of the Ministries of Law, Labour, Environment, Finance (Public Service Division) and the Public Service Commission were completed. Over the next one and a half years, the Auditor-General's Office will review the Ministries of Finance (Budget and Revenue Divisions), Information and the Arts, National Development, Health and Communications. The Auditor-General has agreed to make known his findings and recommendations to Parliament through the Public Accounts Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PART III OF FY94 BUDGET STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me turn next to the fiscal position and the proposed tax changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better than expected growth in 1993 yielded a healthy budget surplus. While next year's economic performance is not expected to be as strong, the projected growth of 6-8% will nonetheless exceed our medium term target range of 4-6%. Revenue collection in FY94 is estimated at $18.9 billion. With operating and development expenditures budgeted at $16.7 billion, a surplus of $2.2 billion is anticipated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy matures, we will be looking towards a consolidation of the fiscal measures we have introduced over the years to promote growth. There will be more adjustment to and extension of existing schemes. Last year, I introduced a package of tax incentives to promote our external economy. These should be given time to work through. I also announced a 3 percentage point reduction of corporate tax rate. As the economy is expected to grow at a rate well above the target range of 4-6%, there is no need to adjust our tax rate this year to further stimulate the economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our major tax reform, GST will be introduced. Corporate and personal income tax rates have been cut. A package of tax and non-tax rebates has been given to offset GST. Total GST to be collected in FY94 is estimated at $960 million. The tax cuts and rebates introduced will reduce Government revenue by $1.2 billion. The net effect is expected to be revenue-negative. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating framework for GST is now in place. From 1st April 1994 we will be operating one of the simplest and most flexible GST systems in the world. With GST in place, we will have a more balanced tax structure, better suited to support the next phase of our economic development. Our medium term goal is to bring our corporate tax rate down to 25% to maintain our competitiveness in an increasingly competitive world market. Personal tax rates will also be kept low to reward effort and enterprise. Provided we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> exert careful control over operating expenditures and sustain good economic growth, we should have adequate revenues even though the GST rate will remain at 3% for at least 5 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1993 was a very successful year. A strong fiscal position gives the Government scope to pass part of its surplus back to the economy and to enhance the assets of its citizens. I will elaborate on the details later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the tax changes for companies. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Incentives To Promote Securities Lending and Borrowing</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the growth of international derivatives trading and arbitrage activities and the trading of regional securities in Singapore, I have decided to extend the Asian Currency Unit (ACU) and Approved Securities Companies (ASC) schemes to include foreign securities lending and borrowing activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this extension, an ACU and an ASC will enjoy a concessionary tax rate of 10% on income derived from lending and borrowing foreign securities with another ACU, ASC or non-resident person. The fee income derived by approved fund managers from arranging securities lending and borrowing transactions on behalf of foreign investors will also qualify for this concessionary tax rate. We will also exempt from tax the securities lending fee, manufactured dividend and interest paid by the ACU or ASC to a non-resident person. Unless it is a bank or a branch of a bank, the non-resident person must not have any permanent establishment in Singapore. These changes will take effect from Year of Assessment 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With immediate effect, we will also not levy stamp duty on documents executed under seal and agreements in respect of such securities lending and borrowing transactions. I am confident that these incentives, together with an efficient and stable financial system, will help to attract \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more international financial institutions to use Singapore as a securities lending and borrowing centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Incentives to Promote Silver and Platinum Trading</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, ACUs enjoy a concessionary tax rate of 10% on incomes derived from trading in gold, but not other precious metals. There is a growing market interest in the trading of silver and platinum besides gold. In view of this, I have decided to include spot and physical trading in silver and platinum with approved parties as qualifying activities under the ACU incentive scheme. This will encourage financial institutions to conduct such activities in Singapore. The incentive will take effect from Year of Assessment 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extension of Incentives for Transactions in Non-Singapore Dollar Securities</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, ACUs and ASCs enjoy the following incentives when they transact in non-Singapore dollar securities on their own account or on behalf of non-residents with other ACUs, ASCs and non-residents: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 10% concessionary rate of tax on income derived; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) exemption of contract note stamp duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further promote Singapore as a regional securities trading centre as well as a fund management centre, I have decided to extend the 10% tax concession to transactions of ACUs and ASCs with approved fund managers with effect from Year of Assessment 1995. Only transactions in respect of funds managed for foreign investors by such fund managers will qualify for the tax incentives. The exemption of stamp duty will also be extended to such transactions with immediate effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Further Incentive for Approved Securities Companies (ASCs)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the tax exemption scheme for syndicated offshore credit and underwriting facilities is only open to ACUs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-bank financial institutions, such as securities companies, are fast becoming important players in arranging and participating in syndicated facilities. To encourage securities companies to expand their operations and conduct syndication business in Singapore, I have decided to extend the scheme to ASCs with effect from 1st March 1994. This will help to further enhance Singapore's position as a leading syndication centre in Asia. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extension of Relief Periods for Tax Incentives</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1960s, we have introduced a number of tax incentives under the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) or EEI Act to promote the development of our manufacturing and services sectors. Among these were incentives for: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Expansion of Established Enterprises; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Expansion of Service Companies; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Export of Services; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Warehousing and Servicing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 4 incentives provide for an initial tax relief period of 5 years or shorter. They may not be sufficiently attractive for projects with large initial investments. In addition, the Expansion of Established Enterprises Incentive and the Expanding Service Companies Incentive cannot at present be extended beyond the initial 5-year period. Companies are therefore not encouraged to expand after the initial incentive period. To enhance these 4 incentives, I have decided to extend the initial incentive period to not more than 10 years, with effect from Year of Assessment 1995. Thereafter, companies can apply for an extension of the tax relief period. The period for each extension will not be more than 5 years, subject to a maximum relief period of 20 years for each incentive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Reduction of Time Limit to Issue Assessments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Comptroller of Income Tax can make assessment or additional \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> assessment on taxpayers within 12 years after the year of assessment concerned. The law also requires companies and other persons carrying on a business to keep and retain in safe custody sufficient records to enable their incomes and allowable deductions to be readily ascertained by the Comptroller. Therefore although the period is not spelt out in the law, such taxpayers are effectively required to retain their records for 13 years since the Comptroller has 12 years to make assessments and tax is assessed on a preceding year basis. It is costly and onerous for such taxpayers to comply with these statutory requirements on record keeping. Under the Companies Act, companies are required to retain their accounting and other records for 7 years. I have therefore decided to reduce the current 12-year statute of limitation to issue assessments for non-fraud cases to 6 years for Year of Assessment 1995 and subsequent years, and to provide for accounting and other records relating to such assessments to be kept for 7 years. In the case where fraud or wilful default has been committed, assessment can still be made at any time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the tax changes for individuals. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAX CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Income Tax Rebate</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the buoyant performance of the economy last year, I have decided to give an across-the-board one-off rebate of 5% on individual income tax for Year of Assessment 1994. The estimated revenue loss to Government is $76 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy and Rental Charges</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, because of the good economic growth last year, the Government has decided to grant rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy (S&amp;C) charges and rentals. These rebates will be additional to the GST offset rebates which take effect from 1st April this year. The rebates will vary with flat type and are as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 1-Room Flats \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment on their behalf by Government of two months' net rent and three months' net S&amp;C charges, after deduction of the GST offset rebates. The rental payments will be made on 1st April and 1st December and the S&amp;C payments on 1st April, 1st August and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) 2-Room Flats \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment on their behalf by Government of one month's net rent and three months' net S&amp;C charges, after deduction of the GST offset rebates. The rental payment will be made on 1st April and the S&amp;C payments on 1st April, 1st August and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) 3-Room Flats \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment on their behalf by Government of two months'net S&amp;C charges after deduction of the GST offset rebate. The payments will take effect on 1st April and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) 4-Room Flats \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment on their behalf by Government of one month's gross S&amp;C charges, to be made on 1st April this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) 5-Room Flats \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment on their behalf by Government of one month's gross S&amp;C charges, to be made on 1st April this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional costs to Government for these rental and S&amp;C rebates are estimated at $28 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Higher Interest Rate for the CPF Retirement and Special Accounts</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has recently announced the intention to raise the CPF Minimum Sum from $34,600 to $80,000. The increase will be done gradually over 10 years. Half of the CPF Minimum Sum is to be kept in the form of cash. As savings in these accounts are held for the long term, Government will pay a higher interest rate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for the CPF Retirement and Special Accounts. With effect from 1st July 1995, cash savings in the CPF Retirement and Special Accounts will attract a rate which is 1.25 percentage points above the normal CPF interest rate. Details of the scheme will be announced by the Minister for Labour later. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme (SOTUS)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, to help middle and working-class Singaporeans own shares in Singapore Telecom, we implemented a CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme. Government contributed $200 into the CPF account of every citizen who had at least $500 credited into his account during the qualifying period. 1.26 million citizens received $242 million in matching contribution from the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government expects to privatise other major Government owned companies and statutory boards from time to time. The next major exercise will be about two years from now. In order to help Singaporeans build up enough CPF savings to buy shares in this company, this year the Government will implement a second SOTUS scheme to top-up CPF accounts of citizens aged 21 and above. The Government will pay $300 into the account of a CPF member, provided he or his employer contributes at least $750 during an 18-month period from 1st March 1994 to 31st August 1995. We have extended the qualifying period from 6 to 18 months, to make it easier for Singaporeans to meet their co-payment requirement. Members who pay in less than $750 will receive a pro-rated contribution from the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extension of Claim Period for Procreation Incentives</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the period within which the special and further tax rebates can be absorbed is seven years. When GST is implemented on 1st April 1994, personal income tax rates will be cut and a tax rebate of $700 given. With these, some taxpayers who are currently enjoying the special and further tax rebates will not be able to consume the rebates to the same \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> extent within the seven-year claim period. To assist taxpayers to better enjoy the procreation incentives, I have decided to extend the claim period for the special and further tax rebates from seven to nine years. This change will take effect from Year of Assessment 1994 for new claims as well as existing claims where the seven-year period has not expired. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes to Encourage Singaporeans to Venture Overseas</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with Government's call to Singaporeans to venture abroad, I announced last year that Singaporeans can choose to be non-residents for tax purposes if they have worked overseas for at least 6 months in any calendar year. As non-residents, they will not be taxed on their foreign income remitted to Singapore. In addition, these non-resident Singaporeans can claim special non-resident reliefs on their Singapore sourced income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the substantial reduction in the non-resident tax rate since 1986, many Singaporeans working overseas who declare non-resident status for tax purposes are unable to enjoy the non-resident reliefs. To encourage Singaporeans to venture overseas, I have decided to reduce the tax rates used to compute non-resident reliefs with effect from Year of Assessment 1995. The revised tax rates for each tax bracket is in Appendix 1 (Cols. 441 - 442). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620441.htm\">Appendix 1 - REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX RATES USED TO COMPUTE NON-RESIDENT RELIEFS UNDER SECTION 40 (Cols. 441 - 442)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback indicates that employees are often reluctant to accept overseas postings as they are unable to enjoy tax deduction for voluntary CPF contributions. I would like to clarify that the law already allows tax deduction for contributions by such employees to the CPF which are obligatory by contract of employment, provided that they are residents for tax purposes. The tax deductibility for these contributions, as well as contributions to other approved pension and provident funds, will be capped at the compulsory CPF limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, employers will also be allowed a tax deduction for CPF contributions made in respect of staff posted overseas which are obligatory by contract of employment. This is provided that the staff posted overseas are engaged in activities related to the production of gains or profits which the employers receive in Singapore and are liable to tax thereon. However, at present, such contributions by the employers are taxable income to the staff posted overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage regionalisation efforts, I am pleased to announce that such contributions in respect of ordinary wages will be exempt from tax, up to the statutory limit for compulsory CPF contributions by employers. The tax change will take effect from Year of Assessment 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Earned Income Relief for Taxable Retirement Benefits</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, to rationalise the tax treatment of retirement benefits, I announced that all retirement benefits, other than compulsory CPF, received from private employers will be taxable. These taxable retirement benefits can be paid out in several ways: as a lump sum, an annuity over five years or a life pension. This has given rise to uncertainty as to whether earned income relief can be claimed for all taxable retirement benefits. As retirement benefits are earned income, I am pleased to announce that earned income relief will be allowed in respect of all taxable retirement benefits received by employees from their employers. This change will take effect from Year of Assessment 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Payment of Life and Personal Accident Policy Proceeds Without Probate or Letter of Administration</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death benefits from a life insurance or a personal accident insurance policy are subject to estate duty. To provide immediate financial relief to the family of the deceased, the Insurance Act (Chapter 142) currently allows up to $50,000 of death claims to be paid by insurance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> companies without having to wait for clearance from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Over time, the adequacy of this $50,000 has been eroded. To restore the adequacy of the financial relief, the present $50,000 limit will be increased to $150,000 from 1st April 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Deduction for CPF Contributions by Self-Employed</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-employed persons who contribute to the CPF are allowed to deduct their contributions, inclusive of compulsory Medisave contributions, from their assessable income. The present limit for such deductions is 18% of the assessable income from self-employment, subject to a maximum of $12,960. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st July 1993, the employer's CPF contribution rate was increased to 18.5%. In line with this, the limit for the tax deduction will be raised to 18.5% of the assessable income from self-employment, subject to a maximum of $13,320. This will take effect from the Year of Assessment 1995. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>OTHER TAX CHANGES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Reduction in Property Tax Rate</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rate for industrial, commercial and let out residential properties was reduced from 23 to 16% in 1990. Nonetheless, our property tax rate is still higher than those in some of our neighbouring countries, such as Thailand and Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help reduce business costs and enhance Singapore's competitiveness in attracting foreign investments, the property tax rate will be lowered in stages to 12% over the next 4 to 5 years. As a first step, I have decided to reduce the property tax rate of 16% by 1% to 15% of annual value across-the-board. The reduction will take effect from 1st July 1994. The revenue loss involved for Government is estimated at $84 million. The concessionary tax rate for owner-occupied residential property will remain at 4%. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Cigarettes and Tobacco</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As duties on cigarettes and tobacco were last increased in 1993, there will be no increase this year. However, to meet GATT requirements, imported cigarettes will be subject to both import and excise duties with effect from 1st July 1994. To maintain the existing tax incidence, import duty on cigarettes will be reduced to $55 per kilogram. Excise duty on cigarettes will remain at $60 per kilogram. Existing import duty on tobacco of $60 per kilogram will be removed and replaced by excise duty of the same value. Details of the duty changes for the various types of cigarettes and tobacco are in Appendix 2 (Cols. 443 - 445). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620443.htm\">Appendix 2 (Cols. 443 - 445)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on liquor</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As duties on liquor were last revised in 1992, I do not propose to raise them again this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to meet GATT requirements, import duties on hard liquor, sake, wine, vermouth, cider, perry, arrack and pineapple spirit will be removed and replaced by excise duties. Imported beer, stout and samsoo will be subject to two duties: import duties and excise duties. The existing excise duties on beer, stout and samsoo are $2.80 per litre, $3.10 per litre and $11.00 per proof litre respectively. To maintain the same tax incidence as before, the import duties on beer, stout and samsoo will be reduced to $0.80 per litre, $1.70 per litre and $4.50 per proof litre respectively. These duty changes will take effect from 1st July 1994. Details are set forth in Appendix 3 (Cols. 447 - 451). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620447.htm\">Appendix 3 (Cols. 447 - 451)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Motor Vehicles</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced in my 1993 Budget Statement, import duties on motor vehicles will be reduced to nullify the effects of GST. Hence with effect from 1st April 1994, import duties on cars, taxis and motor cycles will be 41%, 17% and 12% respectively. To meet GATT requirements, import duties on motor vehicles will be revised and replaced by excise duties with effect from 1st July 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Petrol</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excise duties on petrol will also be reduced to nullify the effects of GST. Duties on leaded premium, intermediate and regular grades petrol will be reduced to the higher of 46% of pump price plus 7.8 cents or 71 cents, 68 cents, and 63 cents per litre respectively. Duties on unleaded premium, intermediate and regular grades petrol will be reduced to the higher of 46% of pump price or 57 cents, 54 cents and 49 cents per litre respectively. Duties on kerosene, lubricating oil, liquified petroleum gas and aviation spirit will be suspended. The revised duty rates for petrol will come into effect on 1st April 1994. Details of the duty changes are in Appendix 4 (Cols. 453 - 456). With these changes, the total tax collected per litre of petrol, inclusive of GST will remain unchanged from 1st April 1994. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620453.htm\">Appendix 4 (Cols. 453 - 456)</a>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONCLUSION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Sir, after three years of slow growth, the world economy is expected to perform better in 1994.

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Small Claims Tribunals were set up to provide a speedy and inexpensive machinery to handle small claims of $2000 or less. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, a total of 24,310 claims were filed in the tribunals. The figures for 1991 and 1992 were 25,465 claims and 28,517 claims respectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All claims filed in 1993 have been disposed of expeditiously. Time taken was: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n      Consumer claims      -  7 days.\r\n\r\n      Non-consumer claims  -  14 days.\r\n\r\n      Tourist claims       -  Within the same day.\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the substantial number of claims, the tribunals have been able to maintain a waiting time of not more than 1 week for consumer claims and 2 weeks for non-consumer claims, resulting in cutting down waiting time by more than half. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the Chief Justice in his Keynote Address at the Subordinate Courts Third Workplan Seminar said that since these tribunals are a quick and inexpensive forum for the resolution of disputes, we should broaden their scope so that more people can make use of this alternative to the civil courts. For this reason, he has directed a working party of judicial officers to review the Small Claims Tribunals Act and, in particular, to consider extending the jurisdiction of the tribunals both in terms of the value as well as the nature of claims. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will await the recommendations of the working party before deciding whether to revise the jurisdiction of the tribunals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LOOPHOLE IN INCOME TAX STRUCTURE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether the disparity between the maximum personal income tax and corporate tax rates will create a loophole for individuals in the highest income bracket to set up a company to take advantage of the lower corporate tax rates; and if he will remedy it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognised that the three percentage point difference between the prospective top marginal rate of personal income tax of 30% and the company tax rate of 27% could provide an incentive for high income persons to incorporate. But in practice, only very few high income individuals could benefit from incorporation. Under our personal tax regime, the effective tax rate will only rise to 27% for individuals at a chargeable income of $823,333, after taking into account the $700 GST rebate. Furthermore, the costs of incorporation have to be considered, together with the need to meet regulatory requirements under the Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore keeps all tax planning devices under constant review and will take steps to close the loophole should it prove necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCREASE IN FUNDS FOR MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Health whether there has been an increase in funds to his Ministry resulting from its taking over from the Ministry of Community Development the responsibility for nursing homes, day care centres for the elderly sick, care for the terminally ill, etc. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the budget of the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been increased following its taking over of responsibility for nursing homes and day care centres for the elderly sick from the Ministry of Community Development (MCD).

Another sum of $18.4 million was provided for the development of new homes and day care centres, including a centre for the care of terminally ill patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FAMILY PLANNING</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will explain the decreased attendance at family planning clinics of new and existing acceptors of family planning; and whether he will give an economic profile of the acceptors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendances at Government family planning clinics have dropped because with rising incomes, more women are obtaining their contraceptive supplies from the private sector. Secondly, over the years the condom has become the most popular method of contraception. As it is easily available in many retail outlets, couples do not need to obtain their supplies from family planning clinics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although attendances at Government family planning clinics have dropped, the contraceptive practice rate in Singapore has remained more or less constant at 65% in 1992 as compared to 67% in 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the economic profile of acceptors at government family planning clinics, 11% have a combined family income of under $800, 43% between $800 and $1,500 and 46% above $1,500. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CERTIFICATES OF ENTITLEMENT FROM THE OPEN CATEGORY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether the open catgory of Certificates of Entitlement will set the trend towards bigger cars which cause more pollution, and if he will scrap this category. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Certificate of Entitlement (COE) from the Open Category can be used to register any type of vehicle. This is to allow the market some flexibility in determining the vehicle mix according to changes in demand. The domination of the Open Category by buyers of bigger cars is a reflection of the current strong demand for bigger cars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not follow that bigger cars cause more pollution. All vehicles, big or small, have to comply with the same strict emission standards before they can be registered for use here. At present, the Registry of Vehicles adopts internationally accepted emission standards for petrol-powered vehicles. These standards in fact impose lower and hence more stringent emission limits for bigger cars than smaller cars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry sees no reason for scrapping the Open Category. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MATERNITY BILL OF FEMALE CIVIL SERVANTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Health whether the maternity bill of female civil servants who join the Service in 1994 will be paid by the Government and, if not, whether Medishield Plus will cover maternity costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants recruited from 1st January 1994 are placed under a new medical benefits package called Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme. Under the scheme, they will receive an additional 1% Medisave contribution based on their monthly gross salary in lieu of hospitalisation benefits. However, they will be eligible for subsidised outpatient medical treatment subject to an annual limit of $350. Female civil servants who join the service in 1994 will therefore have to pay the hospital maternity bill themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of MediShield Plus is to protect the insured from the high cost of treating prolonged and catastrophic or major illnesses. It does not cover delivery expenses and there are no plans to change the present scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620439.htm\">Annex - FEE INCREASES BETWEEN FEBRUARY 1993 AND JANUARY 1994 (Cols. 439 - 440)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620441.htm\">Appendix 1 - REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX RATES USED TO COMPUTE NON-RESIDENT RELIEFS UNDER SECTION 40 (Cols. 441 - 442)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620443.htm\">Appendix 2 (Cols. 443 - 445)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620447.htm\">Appendix 3 (Cols. 447 - 451)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940223/19940223-HA-0620453.htm\">Appendix 4 (Cols. 453 - 456)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
