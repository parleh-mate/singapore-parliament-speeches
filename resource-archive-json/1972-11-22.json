This  meant   that   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a  skilled  industrial  workforce\r\n\r\nwould  assume  growing importance, as  Singapore's\r\n\r\nnational  income became increasingly dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe   output   and   productivity   of   industry.\r\n\r\nIndustrial  training has therefore been recognised\r\n\r\nas a major instrument of economic policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as a matter of national urgency, the\r\n\r\nNational    Industrial   Training   Council    was\r\n\r\nestablished  in  April  1968  to  deal  with   the\r\n\r\nimmediate  problem of developing and co-ordinating\r\n\r\ntechnical  education  and industrial  training  to\r\n\r\nmeet  this  need. Two months later  the  Technical\r\n\r\nEducation  Department was specially formed  within\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education to execute the  targets\r\n\r\nestablished by the Council. In the short space  of\r\n\r\nfour years, the Technical Education Department has\r\n\r\nsubstantially achieved the initial targets set out\r\n\r\nand laid a firm foundation for the development  of\r\n\r\na skilled industrial workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like, at this juncture, to correct\r\n\r\ncertain   mis-impressions  about  our   vocational\r\n\r\ninstitute graduates and the value of the  training\r\n\r\nthey   have   received,  which   would   otherwise\r\n\r\nundermine what has so far been accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the new vocational institutes were\r\n\r\nestablished, the main supply of workers  with  any\r\n\r\nvocational   training  at  all   came   from   the\r\n\r\nvocational  schools. Because of the similar  name,\r\n\r\nvocational  institutes have  often  been  confused\r\n\r\nwith  vocational  schools,  which  now  no  longer\r\n\r\nexist.   This   confusion  is  most   unfortunate.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, many former vocational school students\r\n\r\nwere   drop-outs  from  the  school  system.   The\r\n\r\nvocational  institutes, on the other  hand,  cater\r\n\r\nfor   those  with  a  reasonably  high  level   of\r\n\r\neducation  who  wish to learn a  practical  skill.\r\n\r\nIndustries  show a distinct preference  for  these\r\n\r\ngraduates. The value of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining  has also been recognised by  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vocational institute graduates have been\r\n\r\ntrained  at  heavy  public  subsidy  specially  to\r\n\r\nundertake   industrial  employment   and   I   am,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  naturally perturbed lest doubts  about\r\n\r\ntheir  value should take hold. No effort has  been\r\n\r\nspared to explain to the public, through the  mass\r\n\r\nmedia and other means, the many developments which\r\n\r\nhave  taken  place  in industrial  training  since\r\n\r\n1968.  Any  misconceptions  and  prejudices  which\r\n\r\nstill  persist, even among a small sector  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation, could be very damaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to stamp out these unfavourable\r\n\r\nattitudes  and to ensure that training  programmes\r\n\r\nreceive the fullest acceptance and recognition  is\r\n\r\nto   develop   close  co-operation   between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  industry and labour.  The  growth  of\r\n\r\nsuch   co-operation   will   become   increasingly\r\n\r\nnecessary   in   the  next  stage  of   industrial\r\n\r\ntraining,  as  it  is envisaged that  the  further\r\n\r\nskill-development of the basic-trained worker  can\r\n\r\nmost  effectively  be  undertaken  by  and  within\r\n\r\nindustry.  It  is  for  these  reasons   that   an\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training Board is  being  proposed  to\r\n\r\ncentralise,  co-ordinate and intensify  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining.  A statutory board will enable  industry\r\n\r\nand  labour  to  participate  more  fully  towards\r\n\r\ncommon goals. It will have more flexibility in  an\r\n\r\narea   where  slowness  to  respond  to   changing\r\n\r\nconditions can result in high training wastage  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand and critical skill shortages on  the\r\n\r\nother.  A board will also be better able  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the problems of disseminating the right kind\r\n\r\nof conceptions about industrial training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the responsibility for industrial training\r\n\r\nbecomes  vested in the Board, technical  education\r\n\r\nin  schools will remain the responsibility of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry. The Technical Education Department, with\r\n\r\nall  its  functions  taken  over,  will  then   be\r\n\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is essentially a\r\n\r\nstraightforward Bill. Its main purpose has already\r\n\r\nbeen outlined in the Explanatory \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement, and I do not wish to go  into\r\n\r\nthe details again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While industrial training is primarily the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of industry, it is  imperative  to\r\n\r\nensure that national interests are served. A major\r\n\r\nfunction   of  the  Board  will  be  to  encourage\r\n\r\nindustry  to play its proper role in the  national\r\n\r\nindustrial training effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that the future pattern of\r\n\r\nindustrial   training  to  be  promoted   by   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Training Board will be as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The training of operatives and artisans will\r\n\r\ngradually be transferred back to industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On the other hand, the further development of\r\n\r\nthe  necessary training capacity for the  required\r\n\r\noutput  of  skilled manpower, both institutionally\r\n\r\nand within industry, will be a major preoccupation\r\n\r\nof the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Board will increase the supply of persons\r\n\r\ninstitutionally  trained up to  Trade  Certificate\r\n\r\nand Industrial Technician Certificate levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The further skill-development of the basic-trained worker will be accomplished by the\r\n\r\nemployer with the help of the Board through on-the-job  training and, wherever possible,  within  the\r\n\r\nframework of an apprenticeship training scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The emphasis in industrial training will be\r\n\r\nplaced  on the attainment of recognised standards.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  envisages  that  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining  Board will develop a national system  of\r\n\r\ntrade  testing.  This will not  only  improve  the\r\n\r\nquality  of training but also establish uniformity\r\n\r\nof standards within the work-force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The upgrading of adult skilled workers will\r\n\r\nbe  progressively achieved through  programmes  of\r\n\r\noff-the-job Industrial Training (OJIT),  based  on\r\n\r\nthe module system already introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) To cater for the smaller industries, group\r\n\r\ntraining schemes, encompassing both apprenticeship\r\n\r\ntraining  and  OJIT,  will be  developed  for  the\r\n\r\nupgrading of key personnel, and finally,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The promotion of apprenticeship training\r\n\r\nitself will be a primary concern of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be apparent, from what I have just\r\n\r\noutlined, that apprenticeship schemes will feature\r\n\r\nincreasingly    in   industrial   training.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is giving consideration to introducing\r\n\r\nlegislation to promote and regulate apprenticeship\r\n\r\ntraining at some future date. The Government  will\r\n\r\nlook  forward to the views and recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Training Board, when formed, on the\r\n\r\ndetailed provisions that will be necessary. It  is\r\n\r\nanticipated  that the legislation will  cover  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of apprenticeable trades, the forms and\r\n\r\nconduct of the training to be undertaken, and  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of both employer and  apprentice,\r\n\r\nincluding  the period of indenture. The Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining  Board will then become the chief  agency\r\n\r\nfor the implementation of apprenticeship training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish to inquire from the Minister for Education as\r\n\r\nto  when  will  the Industrial Training  Board  be\r\n\r\nactually set up, now that the Bill is being read a\r\n\r\nSecond  and  Third  time.  What  are  the  present\r\n\r\neducational institutions that will be  taken  over\r\n\r\nby  the  Industrial Training Board? Will  they  be\r\n\r\nonly  the vocational institutes? Will they include\r\n\r\nthe  technical schools, the centralised workshops,\r\n\r\nand  so  on? What categories of teachers  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven the opportunity to exercise their option  to\r\n\r\nhe  employed by the Industrial Training Board, and\r\n\r\nwhether  the terms and conditions of service  will\r\n\r\nbe  as  favourable, if not, more  favourable  than\r\n\r\nwhat they are at present?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of clause 19 (h) of the Bill which\r\n\r\nstates  that  the  Industrial Training  Board  can\r\n\r\ncarry  on any trade or business, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nrequest the Minister for Education to elaborate on\r\n\r\nwhat  trade  or  business that  he  envisages  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Training Board will carry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout.  Will  this affect the training programme  of\r\n\r\nthe  educational  institutions? There  is  also  a\r\n\r\nprovision  in clause 39 which makes it  compulsory\r\n\r\nfor   apprentices  who  undergo  training  to   be\r\n\r\ninsured.   I   would   like   to   know    whether\r\n\r\nconsideration  is  also given to  teachers  to  be\r\n\r\ninsured also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision for teachers to exercise the\r\n\r\noption as to whether or not they want to remain in\r\n\r\nthe  Government service or to be opted in  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Training Board. In this respect can the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education ensure that a  reasonable\r\n\r\nperiod  will be given to the teachers to  exercise\r\n\r\nthe  option,  so  that they  can  have  a  clearer\r\n\r\npicture  of  what their future will be  when  they\r\n\r\nopt?  As  at  present, they are still vague  about\r\n\r\ntheir working conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  heartily  commend the  Government  on  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill. I have no  doubts  that\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of  the establishment of  a  properly\r\n\r\nadministered Industrial Training Board will  be  a\r\n\r\nvastly  improved co-ordination of  all  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining  which  at  present  seems  to  be  in  a\r\n\r\nrelatively  fragmented  state.  It  can  also   be\r\n\r\nexpected that industrial training facilities  will\r\n\r\nbe  improved and extended. It is significant  that\r\n\r\nresearch  and assistance in research will  feature\r\n\r\nas  a  function of the Industrial Training  Board.\r\n\r\nThus,  Sir,  we  can expect a more systematic  and\r\n\r\nrational  relationship between  training  and  the\r\n\r\nindustrial training needs that can result  from  a\r\n\r\nbetter understanding of training problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that there will be a\r\n\r\ndetermination of common standards to  be  attained\r\n\r\nin different industrial skills and a common method\r\n\r\nof   ascertaining  whether  these  standards  have\r\n\r\nindeed  been attained. The problem that arises  is\r\n\r\nhow  to encourage industries, especially the small\r\n\r\nones  to  which  the  Minister  has  already  made\r\n\r\nreference,  to  organise training  for  their  own\r\n\r\napprentices  up  to  the  standard  set   by   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining Board, or to see to the building  of  the\r\n\r\nskills   of   employees   in   small   industries.\r\n\r\nObviously, incentives will have to be provided. It\r\n\r\nis   only   realistic   to  conclude   that   many\r\n\r\nenterprises  will  have  to  be  induced  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage    of   the   apprenticeship    training\r\n\r\nprovisions, although the better the skills of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  the better the chances of an  enterprise\r\n\r\nsucceeding. Of course, the beneficiary will be the\r\n\r\nindustry itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of the problem that we are having\r\n\r\nover  quality  control. It is no use pointing  out\r\n\r\nthat  quality  control  makes  for  profitability.\r\n\r\nThere has to be a demonstration effect. Incentives\r\n\r\nhave  to be offered. In the case of the Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board, in as much as there has been  talk\r\n\r\nof    payroll   tax   being   used   to    support\r\n\r\napprenticeship  and industrial training,  I  would\r\n\r\nsupport   such  a  measure.  Indeed,  perhaps   an\r\n\r\nadditional  eventual  measure  will  have  to   be\r\n\r\nprovided,   as  what  the  Minister  has   already\r\n\r\nreferred   to,   namely,   the   passage   of   an\r\n\r\napprenticeship  training act which  will  make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for  industries  to  provide  training\r\n\r\naccording  to  schedules, schemes  and  conditions\r\n\r\nlaid down by the Industrial Training Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, the Industrial Training Board will\r\n\r\nhave  to  work  out  the  manner  in  which  those\r\n\r\nindustries which already have general training may\r\n\r\nbe  able  to contribute to industrial training.  A\r\n\r\ncareful  judicious blend of a joint effort between\r\n\r\nthe  Government and industry will result  both  in\r\n\r\nthe  industries themselves benefiting, as well  as\r\n\r\nour  industrial growth receiving the good  effects\r\n\r\nof such co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two other matters in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  I would like to refer to, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nOne  of them is the composition of the members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board. I wonder what sort of people  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed  to the Board. I would like to recommend\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be one adult educator  on  the\r\n\r\nBoard.   The   Ministry  of  Education   is   well\r\n\r\nacquainted with the people within its own ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I am rather curious about\r\n\r\nis the hint in clause 5, which says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be paid to the Chairman, Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman and other members of the Board out of the\r\n\r\nfunds  of  the  Board  such  salaries,  fees   and\r\n\r\nallowances as the Minister may, from time to time,\r\n\r\ndetermine.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There seems to be a precedent  already\r\n\r\nwhere  this is concerned where a member of a Board\r\n\r\nis  given a full salary. I would imagine that  one\r\n\r\nhas  to  determine that the job he  does  will  be\r\n\r\ncommensurate   with  the  full  salary   that   he\r\n\r\nreceives.  After all, there is already a  Director\r\n\r\non  this  Board, and it is stated that he  is  the\r\n\r\nChief  Executive  Officer, so  we  would  like  to\r\n\r\nensure  that there is no duplication of  authority\r\n\r\nand, of course, of salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to refer to\r\n\r\nrelates to clause 19 which, I think the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  has  already referred to,  concerns  the\r\n\r\ncarrying on of trade or business by the Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining  Board. Presumably it is  something  like\r\n\r\nwhat  is  being  done in the Catering  School,  in\r\n\r\nwhich case there is, at the same time, business as\r\n\r\nwell  as  training. I find it difficult to imagine\r\n\r\nthat  this  can be applied in any other  instance.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  like  some clarification  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 34 (1), Sir, it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister shall nominate in each year the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General or a company auditorto  audit  the\r\n\r\naccounts of the Board.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  would strongly urge that if the Auditor-General\r\n\r\nis  not  nominated,  a company auditor  should  be\r\n\r\nnominated  on  the  advice of the Auditor-General,\r\n\r\nwho  should also give the terms and conditions  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of which the audit should  be  carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask a question in\r\n\r\nrelation to a point which has already been brought\r\n\r\nup,  which is that the Board will require  persons\r\n\r\nwho  attend courses to be insured against personal\r\n\r\ninjury  and loss of life. Who is going to pay  for\r\n\r\nthis insurance, Mr Speaker, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the\r\n\r\nfirst  question raised by the Member for Moulmein,\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like  to establish the Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nBoard  as soon as possible after the Bill  becomes\r\n\r\nan  Act. Much depends on the various processes  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  go through. The Member also asked  which\r\n\r\ninstitutions  will come under the jurisdiction  of\r\n\r\nthe   Board.  The  institutions  which   will   be\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Board will include mainly those\r\n\r\nwhich are involved with industrial training. These\r\n\r\nare  all  the vocational institutes, the Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnical   Institute,  the  Hotel  and   Catering\r\n\r\nTraining School. The Centralised Workshop and  the\r\n\r\ntechnical schools, as I said earlier, will  remain\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the staff of the institutions,\r\n\r\nthey will be given the option whether to remain in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service or to join the  Board,  and  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  period will be given to them  to  make\r\n\r\ntheir options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rather interesting query about carrying on\r\n\r\nof  trade  or  business, I think  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong  has already answered the question  partly.\r\n\r\nIn   carrying  out  training,  there  are  certain\r\n\r\nproducts which are marketable and certain services\r\n\r\nwhich   are   also  marketable.  It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the Board to engage  in  trade  or\r\n\r\nbusiness  so  as  to dispose of  these  marketable\r\n\r\nproducts and services to bring in revenue. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time it serves as a sales promotion  of  the\r\n\r\nskills of our graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not the practice of a statutory board\r\n\r\nto  have their staff insured. I guess the best way\r\n\r\nis  for  the  staff  - I believe  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  will  expect this from me  -to  take  up\r\n\r\nINCOME policies themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong touched on the question of\r\n\r\nencouraging  small  industries to  participate  in\r\n\r\ngroup  training schemes. We have some  measure  of\r\n\r\nsuccess  with the SASAR group, i.e, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Shipbuilders and  Repairers.  For\r\n\r\nthese industries, we provide further education. We\r\n\r\norganise the courses to provide a uniform training\r\n\r\nsyllabus and curriculum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers. We provide the  facilities  and\r\n\r\nteaching staff for the further education component\r\n\r\nand the industries provide on-the-job training. We\r\n\r\nalso provide expert advice on what training should\r\n\r\nbe  done in their industries. We also give certain\r\n\r\nincentives   to  encourage  people  to   take   on\r\n\r\napprenticeship   training.   There   are   certain\r\n\r\nfinancial  allowances to be given to any  industry\r\n\r\nwhich  takes  on demobbed national servicemen  for\r\n\r\ntraining  in  certain critical trades,  especially\r\n\r\nthe precision trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong also raised a very\r\n\r\ninteresting  point  about  appointing   an   adult\r\n\r\neducator on the Board. Let me assure him that only\r\n\r\nthe  best people who can make a contribution  will\r\n\r\nbe appointed to the Board. It is with this purpose\r\n\r\nin  mind that we have made a provision in the Bill\r\n\r\nto  pay an allowance to the Chairman and the other\r\n\r\nmembers of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him entirely that if the Auditor-General is not nominated to audit the accounts of\r\n\r\nthe  Board,  then we will take the advice  of  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General on who should be the best to carry\r\n\r\nout that function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Dr Lee Chiaw Meng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL CADET CORPS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Cadet Corps movement in Singapore was\r\n\r\nfounded  in  1902 when the first Army Cadet  Corps\r\n\r\nunits were formed in Raffles Institution. It was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  after the Second World War that the movement\r\n\r\ngained  momentum. In 1947, Army Cadet Corps  units\r\n\r\nwere resuscitated; in 1948 the Sea Cadet Corps was\r\n\r\nformed, followed in 1949 by the formation  of  the\r\n\r\nAir  Training  Corps. Each of these  organisations\r\n\r\nfunctioned   independently  of  the  other.   With\r\n\r\nindependence  in 1965, the need to  inculcate  the\r\n\r\nyouth  of  the Republic with a sense of patriotism\r\n\r\nand to develop in them ruggedness of mind and body\r\n\r\nand leadership qualities became imperative. It was\r\n\r\nconsidered that an effective way of bringing  this\r\n\r\nabout   lay  in  the  training  provided  by   the\r\n\r\nuniformed  movement in the schools.  An  expansion\r\n\r\nprogramme   of   the  Cadet  Corps  movement   was\r\n\r\ntherefore  embarked  upon in  1965.  The  combined\r\n\r\nmembership of the three Cadet Corps then stood  at\r\n\r\njust  over  1,500  with 24 schools  participating.\r\n\r\nToday,  the strength of the Cadet Corps has  risen\r\n\r\nto  over  14,000  members (9,000  boys  and  5,000\r\n\r\ngirls)  with  102  out  of 113  secondary  schools\r\n\r\nparticipating.   Next  year,   the   Cadet   Corps\r\n\r\nmembership is expected to reach 18,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership in the Cadet Corps extends from\r\n\r\nSecondary I to Pre-University I students. It is no\r\n\r\nexaggeration to say that many of our top Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed Forces personnel once served as cadets  when\r\n\r\nthey were in school. I am informed that cadets, on\r\n\r\nbecoming   national  servicemen,  have   acquitted\r\n\r\nthemselves   well,  setting  high   standards   in\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  bearing,  turnout  and  performances.\r\n\r\nThat  the  Cadet Corps provides sound pre-national\r\n\r\nservice training is no modest claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing numbers of students wishing to\r\n\r\njoin the Cadet Corps, at one time the movement was\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the difficulty of training sufficient\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  officers to meet new demands  and  to\r\n\r\nreplace  those  leaving the  Corps  on  promotion,\r\n\r\ntransfers,    secondment,    study    leave    and\r\n\r\nresignations.  However, the problem  is  gradually\r\n\r\nbeing  overcome  with  the introduction  of  cadet\r\n\r\ntraining  at  the Teachers Training College.  Last\r\n\r\nJune,  36  TTC  trainees  graduated  as  qualified\r\n\r\nteachers as well as trained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncadet officers. Currently, there are 99 final year\r\n\r\nTTC  students undergoing cadet training. Steps are\r\n\r\nbeing taken to relieve the shortage of officers in\r\n\r\nthe  Cadet Corps through the appointments  of  SAF\r\n\r\nreservists who are teachers. Attention is paid  to\r\n\r\nPre-U  I  students who are given advanced training\r\n\r\nfor appointment as Cadet Lieutenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the Cadet Corps movement\r\n\r\nnecessitated a complete review of the Cadet  Corps\r\n\r\norganisation  as  a whole. Hence on  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1969,  the National Cadet Corps was formed by  the\r\n\r\nintegration  of the Army, Sea and Air Cadet  Corps\r\n\r\nto  strengthen  the administration  of  the  Cadet\r\n\r\nCorps  movement and to raise the level of training\r\n\r\nof  all cadets in schools. This move ensures  that\r\n\r\nthe  best  use  is  made  of manpower,  buildings,\r\n\r\ntraining   areas  and  facilities  and  of   other\r\n\r\nlogistical  requirements,  resulting  in   maximum\r\n\r\nutilisation  of  available  resources.  With  this\r\n\r\nintegration, new legislation has to be promulgated\r\n\r\nto replace the existing Acts and Regulations which\r\n\r\ngovern   the   Army,  Sea  and  Air  Cadet   Corps\r\n\r\nseparately. Hence the introduction of the National\r\n\r\nCadet  Corps  Bill. In passing, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nmention that the Police Cadet Corps does not  form\r\n\r\npart of the National Cadet Corps. It remains under\r\n\r\nthe  control  of  the Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.\r\n\r\nHowever,  steps  are  being taken  to  update  the\r\n\r\nPolice Cadet Corps Act and the Police Cadet  Corps\r\n\r\nRegulations  to bring them in line with  the  main\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the National Cadet Corps  Act  and\r\n\r\nRegulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the National Cadet Corps\r\n\r\nBill,  the Cadet Corps will be accorded the status\r\n\r\nbefitting  the role it is playing in training  our\r\n\r\nyouth to become loyal and responsible citizens  as\r\n\r\npart  of  our  effort to build  an  organised  and\r\n\r\ndisciplined society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Lee Chiaw Meng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\t\tORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Exemption of Notice)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FIRE AT ROBINSON DEPARTMENTAL STORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon.

In view of the magnitude  of  the\r\n\r\nfire  and  the number of lives it has  claimed,  I\r\n\r\nregard  this as a matter of public importance  and\r\n\r\nsufficiently  urgent  to merit  a  voice  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, for which I am grateful to you, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is simply to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs if he would inform this  House  of\r\n\r\n(i) the tragic outcome of the fire which broke out\r\n\r\nyesterday in the Robinson departmental store,  and\r\n\r\n(ii)  any other details which he may now  have  in\r\n\r\nhis possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at 1006 hours yesterday,\r\n\r\nthe Fire Brigade Control Room received a telephone\r\n\r\ncall that an electrical short circuit had occurred\r\n\r\nin  the  Robinson  departmental store  at  Raffles\r\n\r\nPlace. This was followed by a series of calls from\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the   public.  The   Fire   Brigade\r\n\r\nimmediately  responded  to  the  fire  call.   The\r\n\r\nofficer,  on  arrival at 1013  hours,  immediately\r\n\r\nradioed the Fire Control Room that Robinson's  was\r\n\r\nsmoke-lodged and requested for an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadditional  pump.  The fire, fanned  by  a  steady\r\n\r\nbreeze,   rapidly  worsened  due  to  the   highly\r\n\r\ncombustible stocks and structures of the building.\r\n\r\nReinforcements of men and fire engines  were  sent\r\n\r\nto  the scene immediately. The fire at this  stage\r\n\r\nhad already obtained a very strong hold and spread\r\n\r\nrapidly  throughout the entire  building.  At  the\r\n\r\nheight  of the fire, 14 fire engines and  some  90\r\n\r\nofficers  and men were engaged in fire operations.\r\n\r\nA total of nine hand-controlled branches and three\r\n\r\ntwin  branches were brought to bear on  the  fire.\r\n\r\nThe  Brigade  is  still  engaged  in  damping-down\r\n\r\noperations at this very moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the fire the building and contents\r\n\r\nof  Robinson's were completely destroyed, and  the\r\n\r\nupper floor of adjoining and adjacent premises was\r\n\r\naffected  by  the heat and flames.  The  Assistant\r\n\r\nDirector, Building Control Division, was contacted\r\n\r\nand was requested to inspect the beams and columns\r\n\r\nand  to  advise  the Brigade of  their  stability.\r\n\r\nFollowing a preliminary inspection and assessment,\r\n\r\nthe  Brigade was advised that the structures  were\r\n\r\nnot  stable,  and it was therefore inadvisable  to\r\n\r\nbegin digging operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lift-car nearest Messrs Bengold was forced\r\n\r\nopen last night, but no one was found inside.  The\r\n\r\npassenger  lift-cars located at the  rear  of  the\r\n\r\npremises  had collapsed during the fire.  However,\r\n\r\nSir,  I have just been informed that at 2.00  p.m.\r\n\r\nthis  afternoon four skeletons were found  at  the\r\n\r\nfire  site.
