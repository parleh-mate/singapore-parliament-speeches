It has been  a  long\r\n\r\nroad.  Our discussions on 1st and 2nd July were part of a\r\n\r\nprocess  that  has been on-going at various levels  since\r\n\r\n1998.   There have also been several exchanges of letters\r\n\r\nsetting out different proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not recap every last twist-and-turn of this\r\n\r\nprocess.   There is still some way to go before we  reach\r\n\r\nagreement.  So neither is it appropriate for me to reveal\r\n\r\nevery last detail of what is still being negotiated.  But\r\n\r\nthere   have  been  many  media  statements   about   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  which  may  have resulted  in  some  public\r\n\r\nconfusion.   I  will  therefore try to  be  as  clear  as\r\n\r\npossible where we are at this point of time.  I will also\r\n\r\nset  out  clearly Singapore's consistent approach towards\r\n\r\nthe negotiations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our negotiations in Putrajaya in July were preceded\r\n\r\nby  an exchange of letters at the highest level.  On  4th\r\n\r\nMarch  2002, Prime Minister Mahathir wrote to us  setting\r\n\r\nout  certain proposals.  These proposals were  completely\r\n\r\nnew and different from what had been discussed during the\r\n\r\nmeetings  between Senior Minister Lee  Kuan  Yew  and  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir  in  September 2001.  On 11th April 2002,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh Chok Tong replied, setting out our  various\r\n\r\ncounter-proposals.  This exchange of letters  established\r\n\r\nthe basic framework for our discussions recently in July.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussions are on a package of issues. Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Mahathir's letter of 4th March dealt with water,\r\n\r\nrailway, a proposed bridge to replace the Causeway,  CIQ,\r\n\r\nCPF and airspace; Prime Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGoh's reply of 11th April dealt with the same issues.  By\r\n\r\nestablishing  the  basic framework for our  negotiations,\r\n\r\nthis exchange of letters also defined the package.  By  a\r\n\r\npackage,   we   mean  that  nothing  is  resolved   until\r\n\r\neverything  is resolved and that there can be  trade-offs\r\n\r\nbetween  the  issues  to satisfy the  interests  of  both\r\n\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on the specific issues which were\r\n\r\ndiscussed during our meetings on 1st and 2nd July.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Water</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three aspects to the water issue:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the observance of the existing Water\r\n\r\nAgreements of 1961 and 1962.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the price of water supplied under possible\r\n\r\nnew  agreements  after the expiry of the  1961  and  1962\r\n\r\nAgreements in 2011 and 2061 respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Malaysia's proposal to invoke the price\r\n\r\nreview clauses of the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with each of these aspects in turn.\r\n\r\nExisting Agreements\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's consistent and firm position is, and\r\n\r\nremains,  that  the  1961 and 1962 Water  Agreements  are\r\n\r\nvalid and legally binding agreements, enshrined under the\r\n\r\n<br><br>1965&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separation  Agreement, and must be  honoured.   The\r\n\r\nterms  of  the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements  cannot  be\r\n\r\nunilaterally  changed.  This is a  fundamental  and  non-negotiable point.  Whether or not we agree on the  supply\r\n\r\nof  water after the expiry of these two agreements  is  a\r\n\r\ncompletely separate matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a formal statement on 1st July, the Malaysian\r\n\r\nside assured us that Malaysia would \"honour the 1961  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Agreements until their expiry in 2011 and 2061\r\n\r\nrespectively\".  Malaysia was also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclear that it does not propose to amend the terms of  the\r\n\r\n1961 and 1962 Agreements.  We welcome these assurances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Agreements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th April 2002, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong\r\n\r\nexplained to this House why Singapore wants to reduce our\r\n\r\ndependence  on Malaysian water. Prime Minister  Goh  said\r\n\r\nthat  it  was not healthy for our countries to be  always\r\n\r\nlocked in disputes over water and to allow this one issue\r\n\r\nto   sour   bilateral  relations  and  prevent  us   from\r\n\r\ncooperating in strategic areas of mutual benefit. By next\r\n\r\nyear,  our  Bedok and Kranji NEWater plants  will  be  in\r\n\r\noperation.   By 2011, two more NEWater plants in  Seletar\r\n\r\nand Ulu Pandan will be ready.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can allow the 1961 Agreement to lapse in 2011. It\r\n\r\nis  within  our  means  to produce  sufficient  water  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the water from the 1961 Agreement.  However,  we\r\n\r\nare  still prepared to buy some water from Malaysia after\r\n\r\nthe expiry of the 1961 Agreement.  But the price must  be\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 2061, when the 1962 Agreement expires, it only\r\n\r\nmakes economic sense for us to continue to buy additional\r\n\r\nwater  from Malaysia, if the cost of that water  is  less\r\n\r\nthan  the water we can produce ourselves.  The price must\r\n\r\nbe competitive in relation to the cost of our alternative\r\n\r\nsources of water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent talks, we have briefed the Malaysians\r\n\r\nabout  our plans to develop alternative sources of  water\r\n\r\nby increasing our catchment areas and through NEWater and\r\n\r\ndesalination.   The  Malaysians now have  understood  our\r\n\r\nposition.  They  agree that the price of  water  must  be\r\n\r\nmarket-competitive.   But we have  yet  to  agree  on  an\r\n\r\nacceptable basis for a competitive price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st July, the Malaysians proposed a price\r\n\r\nformula.   On  2nd  July,  they told  us  they  are  also\r\n\r\nconsidering  benchmarking the price, among other  things,\r\n\r\nagainst  the China-Hong Kong model and other models.   We\r\n\r\nhave explained to the Malaysians why the China-Hong Kong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmodel is not relevant. But we will study their proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's proposal is that the price of any\r\n\r\ntreated  water  that we may buy from Malaysia  after  the\r\n\r\nexpiry of the current Agreements should be pegged  to  an\r\n\r\nagreed  percentage  of Singapore's  cost  of  alternative\r\n\r\nsources  of  water which is NEWater.  Such a formula  can\r\n\r\nwithstand  the  test of time.  Singapore  is  willing  to\r\n\r\ndisclose  independently audited accounts of our  cost  of\r\n\r\nNEWater to work out the price mechanism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Price Review</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent negotiations, Malaysia informed us\r\n\r\nthat it wanted to invoke the price review clauses of  the\r\n\r\n1961  and 1962 Water Agreements.  The 1961 and 1962 Water\r\n\r\nAgreements do provide for a review after 25 years.  Under\r\n\r\nthe terms of these Agreements, if Malaysia wanted a price\r\n\r\nreview,  this  should have been undertaken  in  1986  and\r\n\r\n1987.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is 15 to 16 years late, we have informed\r\n\r\nthe Malaysians that in the interest of making progress in\r\n\r\nour  talks,  Singapore is prepared to consider Malaysia's\r\n\r\nrequest  to invoke the price review clauses of  the  1961\r\n\r\nand 1962 Agreements as part of the package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also stressed that any such review must be in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the express provisions  of  the  clauses\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  1961 and 1962 Water  Agreements.   In\r\n\r\nparticular:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the price review must be only on the basis of\r\n\r\nfactors explicitly mentioned in the clauses contained  in\r\n\r\nthe  1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.  In other words,  it\r\n\r\nmust  not be a re-negotiation of the existing agreements.\r\n\r\nThe  Malaysian side has agreed that any price review must\r\n\r\nbe   \"consistent   with  the  provisions   of   the   two\r\n\r\nAgreements.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as specified in the 1961 and 1962 Water\r\n\r\nAgreements, the review must cover both the price  of  the\r\n\r\nraw water supplied by Malaysia to Singapore and the price\r\n\r\nof the treated water supplied by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  Malaysia.   The Malaysian  side  has  also\r\n\r\nagreed to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the price review cannot be retroactive. If\r\n\r\nwe  agree  to it, it will take effect only from the  time\r\n\r\nthat  the revision is agreed upon.  This is in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the provisions of the price review clauses  in  the\r\n\r\n1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make a final point on the price of water to\r\n\r\nclear  up  any  possible confusion.  In  September  2001,\r\n\r\nthere  was an in-principle agreement on the price  of  60\r\n\r\nsen  per  thousand gallons for future raw  water,  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed  every five years for inflation, for  100  years\r\n\r\nafter the expiry of the 1962 Agreement in 2061.  Although\r\n\r\nwe  were not legally obliged to do so, we also offered to\r\n\r\npay  45  sen per thousand gallons for raw water currently\r\n\r\npurchased  under the 1961/1962 Agreements as part  of  an\r\n\r\noverall package deal that took into account our interests\r\n\r\non  other  issues in the package and the  concessions  we\r\n\r\nwere  making.  However, the Malaysians have now  advanced\r\n\r\ncompletely  new  and  different proposals,  taking  their\r\n\r\nearlier offer off the table.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>POA, KTM Station/Lands in Singapore and CIQ</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia informed us that it has decided to relocate\r\n\r\nits rail CIQ from Tanjong Pagar back to Johor.  There was\r\n\r\nno   substantial  discussion  on  this   or   the   joint\r\n\r\ndevelopment of KTM lands in accordance with the  POA.   I\r\n\r\nexpect this to be taken up at the next meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consistent position is that the POA is a legally\r\n\r\nbinding  agreement and its provisions must  be  observed.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  POA, the KTM station is to move from  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  to  Bukit Timah.  However, as part of the package,\r\n\r\nas I have told the House before, Singapore is prepared to\r\n\r\nvary the POA to allow the KTM station to shift to Kranji,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Malaysians  had  requested,  and  to  include\r\n\r\nadditional  railway  lands for 60-40% joint  development.\r\n\r\nThese  are concessions which Singapore will make only  as\r\n\r\npart of the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our negotiations in July, the Malaysian side\r\n\r\nassured  us  that  Malaysia is not  disputing  the  legal\r\n\r\nvalidity  of the POA.  Singapore welcomes this assurance.\r\n\r\nBut  as  part of the package discussions, Malaysia wanted\r\n\r\nSingapore to agree to include more KTM lands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bridge</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also discussed Malaysia's proposal to replace the\r\n\r\nCauseway with a road bridge.  Malaysia briefed us on  its\r\n\r\nproposal.   The Malaysians told us that their  preference\r\n\r\nwas  for  a  full bridge, but if there was no  agreement,\r\n\r\nthey will proceed with a half bridge on their side of the\r\n\r\nCauseway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We informed the Malaysians that Singapore sees no\r\n\r\ncompelling  need  to  replace the  Causeway.   But  since\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  eager to replace the Causeway  with  a  new\r\n\r\nbridge,  we  are prepared to consider jointly building  a\r\n\r\nnew  bridge  as  part  of  the package.   Many  important\r\n\r\ndetails  have  yet  to  be worked  out,  among  them  the\r\n\r\nlocation of the waterway and the clearance height for the\r\n\r\npassage  of  vessels  and so on.  We  will  continue  our\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on the bridge at the next meeting.   We  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  also go along with Malaysia's proposal  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a railway swing bridge but on this too, there  are\r\n\r\ndetails to be sorted out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many media reports that Malaysia\r\n\r\ndoes  not  consider  its proposal for  a  new  bridge  to\r\n\r\nreplace the Causeway as part of the package and wants  it\r\n\r\ndiscussed separately.  Let me say that Singapore has made\r\n\r\nit  clear that the bridge will be considered only as part\r\n\r\nof the package because:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Dr Mahathir's letter of 4th March 2002\r\n\r\nclearly set out the proposal for a bridge as one  of  the\r\n\r\nissues in the package; so did Prime Minister Goh's  reply\r\n\r\nof 11th April 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we see no compelling reason to replace the\r\n\r\nCauseway with a new bridge.  Building our side of  a  new\r\n\r\nbridge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  cost  a lot of money. It makes no sense for  us  to\r\n\r\nincur  this significant expenditure if the bridge is  not\r\n\r\npart   of  the  package.   Singapore  can  justify   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure  only  if  there is agreement  on  the  other\r\n\r\nissues in the package.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Airspace and CPF</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues were not discussed in detail at the\r\n\r\nlast  round. We will continue our discussions on airspace\r\n\r\nand CPF at the next meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may conclude by alluding to what Dr Ong Chit\r\n\r\nChung also asked about various press comments.  After the\r\n\r\n1st  to  2nd July negotiations, there has indeed  been  a\r\n\r\nflurry  of comments based on often inaccurate reports  in\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  media.  Some have said  the  ball  is  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's   court  and  accused   us   of   being   the\r\n\r\nunreasonable  party.  This is part of a familiar  pattern\r\n\r\nto make us appear in the wrong with their people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not be confused by such reports. As I\r\n\r\nsaid in this House before on 16th May 2002, such comments\r\n\r\nconstitute  a  form of psy-war to weaken our  morale  and\r\n\r\nsoften  our  position on matters under  negotiation.   We\r\n\r\nwill  calmly and politely state the facts and  have  them\r\n\r\nstand  the test of time, when truth will out.  We  should\r\n\r\nonly   pay   serious  attention  to  what  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\ngovernment  had  said during the actual negotiations  and\r\n\r\nthe proposals they had presented on the record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to approach the talks\r\n\r\nconstructively so that both countries can reach a win-win\r\n\r\nsolution  on  the  package of issues.   There  is  really\r\n\r\nnothing to be gained by negotiating through the media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told my colleague, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid,\r\n\r\nand his delegation, Singapore is making concessions which\r\n\r\nwe  are  not legally obliged to do.  We are not  obliged,\r\n\r\nfor  example, to agree to their bridge proposal;  we  are\r\n\r\nnot obliged to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagree  to  any variation to the POA; and we are also  not\r\n\r\nobliged  to allow premature withdrawals of CPF monies  by\r\n\r\nWest  Malaysian  workers.  Likewise,  we  recognise  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia is not legally obliged to supply water after the\r\n\r\n1961 and 1962 Agreements expire.  Nor is Malaysia legally\r\n\r\nobliged to restore the use of airspace for the RSAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for a deal to be reached, clearly, there\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  give and take.  This is why I emphasised  to\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister Syed Hamid that all the issues have  to\r\n\r\nbe  considered  as a package.  One cannot  look  at  each\r\n\r\nissue  in isolation and see if one side got more or less.\r\n\r\nIf  each side were only to focus on the concessions it is\r\n\r\nmaking on one particular item without taking into account\r\n\r\nthe  concessions  it  receives on other  aspects  of  the\r\n\r\npackage,  then I think it will be impossible to reach  an\r\n\r\nagreement.    Both  sides  must  be  prepared   to   make\r\n\r\nconcessions.  Both sides must look at the balance of  the\r\n\r\ntotal package, and I think this is the only way forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues are complex. I do not think it will\r\n\r\nbe  easy  to  reach an agreement just after  one  or  two\r\n\r\nmeetings.  But with political will and a spirit  of  give\r\n\r\nand take on both sides, I think it is possible for us  to\r\n\r\nconclude  a  package.  I have informed  Foreign  Minister\r\n\r\nSyed Hamid that Singapore would be happy to host the next\r\n\r\nmeeting  here.  We are now in the process of working  out\r\n\r\nthe  dates  for  the Second Ministerial  meeting  on  the\r\n\r\npackage of issues to be held in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, I want to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he would care to comment on the reported\r\n\r\nMalaysian  proposal  to  raise  the  price  of  water  to\r\n\r\nMalaysian 60 sen per thousand gallons, and then to RM3.00\r\n\r\nafter  2007,  and  whether  the Minister  considers  such\r\n\r\nproposals outrageous and arbitrary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I do not think I need to use\r\n\r\nany  adjectives to describe the proposals,  but,  indeed,\r\n\r\nthese  figures  were in Dr Mahathir's  letter  to  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister on 4th March.  And they were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso in the first proposal by the Malaysian delegation on\r\n\r\n1st July.  In other words, Malaysian 60 sen from 2002  to\r\n\r\n2006, backdated to 1986 and 1987, and RM3.00 from 2007 to\r\n\r\n2011.   And  they  wanted  a supplementary  agreement  to\r\n\r\nreflect this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could not accept this proposal as, in effect, it\r\n\r\nwould  have  meant  renegotiation and  amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  two  Water Agreements.  We stated our  position\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  not  acceptable.   Later,  the  Malaysians\r\n\r\ninformed   us  that  they  were  no  longer   seeking   a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  agreement for that  purpose,  and  instead\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  recourse to the price  review  clauses\r\n\r\nunder the 1961 and 1962 Agreements, and they would do  so\r\n\r\nconsistent with the provisions of the two Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether in points of international law, do the Malaysians\r\n\r\nhave  any right to backdate any revisions after  so  many\r\n\r\nyears when they did not do so earlier.  And, whether they\r\n\r\nhave the right to act on it or backdate any revision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I think the lawyers will have a\r\n\r\nvery  interesting time debating this.  I think this is  a\r\n\r\nhighly  arguable point.  But the position we  have  taken\r\n\r\nis,  regardless  of the legal ability,  as  part  of  the\r\n\r\npackage,  in  order to advance and make progress  in  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  we are prepared to look at  their  request.\r\n\r\nBut it must be part of the package.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the Malaysians have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  talked  about the Hong Kong  model  of  water\r\n\r\nagreement.  I wonder whether the Minister would  care  to\r\n\r\ncomment on the difference between the Hong Kong model and\r\n\r\nour existing Water Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I have said in my main answer\r\n\r\nthat  we informed the Malaysians that the Hong Kong model\r\n\r\nis  not relevant.  And prior to this, we have made public\r\n\r\nstatements,  through  the Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,\r\n\r\nsetting out the position.  It is not relevant because, in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  Hong  Kong  and  China,  China  bears  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructural and operational costs of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupplying  raw  water to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong  does  not\r\n\r\nbear   any   of   these  costs.   So,  the   analogy   is\r\n\r\ninapplicable.   In  our  case,  over  the  years,  it  is\r\n\r\nSingapore    which   has   borne   the   infrastructural,\r\n\r\noperational  and  maintenance costs, such  as  pipelines,\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  dams, and so on.  This comes up  to  be  an\r\n\r\nastronomical  figure.   So, it is  really  not  comparing\r\n\r\napples with apples.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  Singapore  has proposed any formula  for  future\r\n\r\nwater negotiations and,  likewise, whether the Malaysians\r\n\r\nmade any such proposals on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Can I clarify? Is Dr Ong referring\r\n\r\nto the price of water for the future, after the expiry of\r\n\r\nthe two Agreements?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Yes. As I have said, both sides\r\n\r\nhave discussed various proposals.  I think both sides now\r\n\r\nagree  that  the  price  for future  water  under  a  new\r\n\r\nagreement  to  replace the existing two Agreements,  upon\r\n\r\nexpiry,  must  be competitive.  But what  is  the  agreed\r\n\r\ncompetitive price has yet to be worked out.   As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now,  we have put forward  a  proposal.   Our\r\n\r\nproposal  is  that  it must be pegged  to  the  price  of\r\n\r\nalternative sources, which is NEWater.  The thrust of our\r\n\r\nproposal is that we should avoid situations where we have\r\n\r\nconstant  disputes  over the price of water.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe proposal that we have tabled would stand the test  of\r\n\r\ntime.   We  will  give  them all the  figures  about  how\r\n\r\nNEWater pricing is worked out - the cost and so on.   And\r\n\r\nit  makes economic sense for us to agree to a price  that\r\n\r\nmust  be  less than what it costs us to produce  NEWater.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it does not make any economic sense.   So,  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  be an agreed percentage of the cost of producing\r\n\r\nNEWater.   The  details will have to be worked  out.   We\r\n\r\nhave  already  given them a briefing.   So  that  is  the\r\n\r\nessence, a formula that can stand the test of time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  would not perennially lead to disputes, and it must\r\n\r\nbe competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysians have also presented a formula on the\r\n\r\nfirst  day,  which involves factors such as the  existing\r\n\r\nwater tariffs, inflation, consumer price index and so on.\r\n\r\nBut  Members would have read their public statements that\r\n\r\nthey  have  said  that they would have  to  rework  their\r\n\r\nfigures.  On 2nd July, they had revised a proposal  where\r\n\r\nthey  have said that the price will have to be determined\r\n\r\nlater by agreement.  It has to be competitive.  But  they\r\n\r\nhave  said  that they want to consider benchmarking  with\r\n\r\nthe Hong Kong model or other models.  So, we will have to\r\n\r\nawait for their final proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, as the Minister is aware\r\n\r\nthat over a period of time, Singapore as well as Malaysia\r\n\r\nagreed  to  negotiate  on  a  package  of  issues.   But,\r\n\r\nrecently, Malaysia changed its tack and said it wanted to\r\n\r\ntake the water agreement negotiation outside this package\r\n\r\nof issues.

In fact, if we can  go\r\n\r\nback to the origins of this, it was to be considered as a\r\n\r\npackage  because both leaders recognised that these  were\r\n\r\noutstanding issues, and it is best to clear the decks for\r\n\r\nfuture  relations  by  resolving  these  issues  as   one\r\n\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PEOPLE'S ASSOCIATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the People's Association Act (Chapter 227\r\n\r\nof the 2000 Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresented by the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr  Wong  Kan\r\n\r\nSeng);  read the First time; to be read a Second time  on\r\n\r\nthe  next  available  sitting of Parliament,  and  to  be\r\n\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BOARD</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the National Science and Technology Board\r\n\r\nAct (Chapter 201A of the 1991 Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresented  by  the  Minister for Trade and  Industry  (BG\r\n\r\nGeorge Yong-Boon Yeo); read the First time; to be read  a\r\n\r\nSecond  time on the next available sitting of Parliament,\r\n\r\nand to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND AND RELATED CHANGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand Minister for Finance's Statement [22nd July 2002].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n<br>12.59 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the present debate on the proposed changes\r\n\r\nto  the Central Provident Fund.  Sir, this is a difficult\r\n\r\ntime  for  Singaporeans.  It is  not  easy  to  strike  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between taking care of the welfare and emotional\r\n\r\nwell  being  of Singaporeans, and dealing with  the  hard\r\n\r\nfacts of the economic realities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note the comprehensiveness of the\r\n\r\nmeasures  proposed and announced by DPM Lee yesterday  at\r\n\r\nensuring  that  our economy remains competitive  and  our\r\n\r\nworkers  remain  employable in a  highly  gloablised  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been talked about the group of older\r\n\r\nworkers  whose  employers'  CPF  contribution  has   been\r\n\r\nproposed  to  remain at 16% when the full restoration  of\r\n\r\nCPF  rates  takes  place.

The classification is often  times\r\n\r\nbased  on  their  level of economic and social  activity.\r\n\r\nThe proposal involving the 50-55 age group seems to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuggest  a  need to classify another group of  \"elderly\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps we need to call them the \"younger old\", or  maybe\r\n\r\n\"the  not so young\", or maybe \"the not so old\".  Whatever\r\n\r\nwe call them, they seem to be a new group of workers that\r\n\r\nwe  are  concerned about since their age is a determinant\r\n\r\nin the present debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the unemployment figures, especially those\r\n\r\ninvolving this group of workers, are a cause for concern.\r\n\r\nThe  profile  of  unemployed persons  as  at  June  2001,\r\n\r\ndocumented  in  a  Report on Labour Force  2001  by  MOM,\r\n\r\nshowed  that although workers aged 50 and above  make  up\r\n\r\nonly  14%  of  the unemployed, which is proportionate  to\r\n\r\ntheir proportion in the population, they take the longest\r\n\r\ntime  to  regain  employment.   The  median  duration  of\r\n\r\nunemployment for this group of workers is 14 weeks.  They\r\n\r\nwere   also  found  to  be  more  vulnerable  to   under-employment.   It was also reported that job seekers  with\r\n\r\nprimary  education  and below took the  longest  time  to\r\n\r\nregain employment.  Thus, it can be extrapolated that the\r\n\r\nolder  workers with lower educational qualifications  are\r\n\r\nthe most vulnerable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is thus understandable to see the measure as\r\n\r\na  way  of  reducing the cost of employing older workers.\r\n\r\nIt  is  based on the assumption that wages of the workers\r\n\r\nare  a  key inhibitor for them to regain employment.   We\r\n\r\nfirst  need to understand how the cost of employing these\r\n\r\nworkers  has  risen.  Many speakers  in  the  House  have\r\n\r\nspoken  of  the  seniority  wage  system,  ie,  with  the\r\n\r\nseniority  comes  the  practice  wisdom  that  they  have\r\n\r\nacquired  all  these years.  This practice  wisdom  would\r\n\r\nthen  be  the  value-add that they bring along  to  their\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one would hope that the wages of the workers\r\n\r\nare  pegged to their performance or productivity,  taking\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the practice wisdom and the value-add\r\n\r\nthat  they bring along.  However, we have heard arguments\r\n\r\nfrom  the  employers that they can find  younger  workers\r\n\r\ndoing  similar  jobs  done by older workers  at  a  lower\r\n\r\nprice.  Is this really so?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIf  this  is  so, the issue is thus to look at  the  wage\r\n\r\nsystem,  ie,  ensuring  that  the  wages  are  based   on\r\n\r\nperformance and not age.  Yes, perhaps we have  inherited\r\n\r\na  wage  system that has structurally created a stumbling\r\n\r\nblock  to  our economic system.  We need to replace  this\r\n\r\nstumbling  block  to something that is small,  agile  and\r\n\r\nflexible,  to  ensure  that  age  is  not  a  factor   in\r\n\r\ndetermining wages, but rather performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the proposed changes in the employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution of workers aged 50-55 suggest that  the\r\n\r\nwages   of  this  group  of  workers  are  a  significant\r\n\r\ninhibitor  to gaining employment, I wonder  if  it  is  a\r\n\r\nvalid assumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report on Wages in Singapore 2001, published by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Manpower, showed that the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween age and wages is mediated by the skills level  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  It noted, and I quote: \"The pace  of  wage\r\n\r\nincrease  with  age is more pronounced with  the  highest\r\n\r\nskilled  workers  as  their work is  generally  knowledge\r\n\r\nintensive.\"   For  example,  the  median  gross  wage  of\r\n\r\nmanagers  aged  30-35 was $3,930 compared to  $5,005  for\r\n\r\nmanagers  aged 50-55, a 40% difference in favour  of  the\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report, however, continued, and I quote: \"The\r\n\r\nimpact  of  age  on  wages is less  among  lower  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.  Here, wages generally peaked earlier.\"  In June\r\n\r\n2001,  the median wage of cleaners, labourers and related\r\n\r\nworkers  aged 30-35, for example, was $1,582 compared  to\r\n\r\n$1,298 for workers aged 50-54 years old, a difference  of\r\n\r\n18%  in favour of the younger workers.  Another group  of\r\n\r\nlowly skilled workers are the plant and machine operators\r\n\r\nand assemblers.  There is little difference in the median\r\n\r\nage  of  the  young and older workers in this group  with\r\n\r\nthose  aged 30-35 earning a median income of $1,878,  and\r\n\r\nthose in the 50-54 age group earning $1,810, a very, very\r\n\r\nsmall difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we evaluate these statistics and the earlier\r\n\r\nfigures on the profile of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunemployed, with specific reference to the workers in the\r\n\r\n50-54 age group, we can infer that perhaps wages are  not\r\n\r\na  significant  factor  in  their  ability  to  seek  re-employment.   The wages of the older workers  with  lower\r\n\r\nskills and education are already lower than the wages  of\r\n\r\ntheir younger counterparts.  Lowering the employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  may not be the solution  to  ensuring\r\n\r\ntheir employability.  Indeed, it is their skills set  and\r\n\r\nits  relevance  to the available jobs that are  critical.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, a 4% reduction in salary may mean a lot  to\r\n\r\nthis  group  of workers.  I would like to thus  echo  the\r\n\r\ncall made by Mr Ravindran yesterday for this reduction to\r\n\r\nbe  a  temporary measure, and for it to be restored  when\r\n\r\nthe economic situation improves for this group of workers\r\n\r\nwith their improved skills set.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Government will\r\n\r\nextend  the People-for-Job Traineeship Programme and  the\r\n\r\nSRP  as  these  programmes will serve the needs  of  this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  workers.   The challenge is  to  entice  these\r\n\r\nworkers to take advantage of these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think much has been asked of the workers - from wage restraint to wage cuts to now, cuts in CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  -  all in the name of staying  competitive\r\n\r\nand  keeping costs low.  However, what are we asking  the\r\n\r\nemployers  to do?  What have we done to educate employers\r\n\r\nto  play  their  part in ensuring the  employment  market\r\n\r\nremains buoyant?  Employers have been given much handouts\r\n\r\nin the recent Budget, especially with regard to tax cuts,\r\n\r\netc.   However,  it is rather surprising  to  note  their\r\n\r\nattitude towards issues related to the employment market.\r\n\r\nYesterday,  Mdm Halimah shared with the House  that  only\r\n\r\n4.8%  of  companies have implemented the monthly variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  in the wage system.  It was rather  surprising\r\n\r\nto  me  to  find out, Sir, from the Report  on  Wages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore 2001 survey that 64% of firms studied indicated\r\n\r\nthat  they had no wish to introduce the MVC in their wage\r\n\r\nsystem.   This is despite efforts by the labour  movement\r\n\r\nin  encouraging  them to do so.  I  wonder  what  is  the\r\n\r\nproportion of these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfirms  which currently use a performance-based  appraisal\r\n\r\nsystem in deciding remuneration for their employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such blatant attitudes of the employers will\r\n\r\ncontinue to plague the already harsh employment landscape\r\n\r\nfor our workers.  We will continuously have to return  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers to make the adjustments and, of course,  the\r\n\r\nCPF  will  end  up  being the easiest  target.   I  would\r\n\r\nencourage   the  Government  to  introduce  measures   to\r\n\r\nencourage  employers  to  move  into  the  flexible  wage\r\n\r\nsystem,  perhaps starting with some incentives,  if  not,\r\n\r\nsome  legislative measures may be necessary.  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  as  an employer, the Government has set an  example\r\n\r\nfor  the  private sector to follow.  But I would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat the Government also study why such examples are hard\r\n\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one can say that this is a chicken-and-egg\r\n\r\nissue.   But the proposed cut in the CPF rates for  older\r\n\r\nworkers has got a deeper implication.  We need to look at\r\n\r\nthe  issue  beyond  the economic consideration.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  economic productivity of these  workers  is\r\n\r\nalso dependent on their emotional and psychological well-being.   The current economic gloom will certainly affect\r\n\r\nthe  psychological  and  emotional  well-being  of  these\r\n\r\nworkers.   If  we  keep  asking the workers  to  continue\r\n\r\nsacrificing  their  salary, it will  continue  to  dampen\r\n\r\ntheir spirit.  At the same time, while I acknowledge that\r\n\r\nour  society  is aging, we need not hasten  the  pace  by\r\n\r\nconfirming that the 50-54 age group is indeed a new group\r\n\r\nof  elderly people.  I think they have much to offer  and\r\n\r\nreducing  the  CPF  rate  may perhaps  send  a  different\r\n\r\nmessage to them.  We should try to remain as youthful  as\r\n\r\nwe  can  for a longer period of time, perhaps  we  should\r\n\r\nclassify  them  as  the  \"older young\",  instead  of  the\r\n\r\n\"younger old\", still up and about, and certainly able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we recognise that changing the CPF rate is\r\n\r\nnot  the only solution to the problem.  Indeed, there are\r\n\r\nlarger  issues,  eg,  ensuring that the  wages  of  these\r\n\r\nworkers are commensurate to their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproductivity, regardless of their age or gender, going by\r\n\r\nyesterday's session on Questions for Oral Answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, one perception that exists,\r\n\r\nfollowing the recommendations put forth by the  ERC  sub-committee that the employers' CPF contribution for  these\r\n\r\nworkers  be  reduced, is the underlying value that  older\r\n\r\nworkers have lower economic value as they grow older.   I\r\n\r\nthink  no  matter what we say, we cannot deny  that  such\r\n\r\nactions  can  lead to such perceptions.  Age  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen  equated to wisdom and productivity with the  caveat\r\n\r\nof  the presence of the relevant skills set.  We need  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we are not accused of ageism.  I  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  the  argument can be raised that  we  have  already\r\n\r\nlowered  the  CPF rates for workers aged  55  and  above.\r\n\r\nThis  was  more palatable as it was pegged  to  the  then\r\n\r\nretirement age of 55.  But palatable or not, the  current\r\n\r\nmeasure, I think, is just as equally, if not more, bitter\r\n\r\nin  taste.  Perhaps it is not the right medicine for  the\r\n\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to evaluate the value behind our\r\n\r\ntreatment of age and economic value and viability.  These\r\n\r\ntwo should not be equated - ideal as it may be - just  as\r\n\r\nother  demographic  factors like  gender,  ethnic  group,\r\n\r\nshould  not be linked to economic productivity  and  thus\r\n\r\nwages.  Sir, it is a frightening thought to be told on my\r\n\r\n50th   birthday that I am too expensive and  my  economic\r\n\r\nvalue  has  dropped by 4%.  I would ask if my performance\r\n\r\nhad  not  deteriorated, why should my salary be  reduced.\r\n\r\nThe  statistics I quoted earlier have shown that in  some\r\n\r\nsectors,  older workers are already earning lower  wages,\r\n\r\nand I believe it is not due to their age but rather their\r\n\r\nskills set and productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any reduction in CPF contribution from\r\n\r\nemployers  is  a  reduction in the total  income  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual worker.  To the lower skilled worker, it would\r\n\r\nbe  significant.   This is even more critical  if  he  is\r\n\r\ntaking  a loan with a bank to mortgage his HDB flat.   He\r\n\r\nmay  be  one  who falls into the category of  HDB  market\r\n\r\ninterest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrate  loan.   I  would  like  to  address  some  of   the\r\n\r\nimplications of the new initiative announced by  DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nyesterday on the intended target group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the new policy applies to the new\r\n\r\nloans  or refinanced loans, we should study the potential\r\n\r\neffect using the experiences of the current group of home\r\n\r\nowners who would fall into the target group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask DPM Lee or HDB what is the\r\n\r\nproportion of the current group of home owners who  would\r\n\r\nhave  been affected by the new policy.  From the  records\r\n\r\nof  HDB,  what  is the proportion of this group  of  home\r\n\r\nowners who have a history of defaulting payment on  their\r\n\r\nmortgages?   What is the profile of this  group  of  home\r\n\r\nowners?   Were  they also defaulters of  other  payments,\r\n\r\nlike utilities and other bills?  How many of them are  on\r\n\r\nthe verge of being declared bankrupt following failure to\r\n\r\nmeet  their  financial commitments  to  other  creditors?\r\n\r\nThese  latter  creditors are likely to be the  commercial\r\n\r\nbanks   who   we  intend  to  send  them  to   with   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the new policy.  These  are  the  cases\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  seen  in  our individual  constituencies.\r\n\r\nToday,  they  come  to us for assistance  in  negotiating\r\n\r\ninstalment  plans, tomorrow they will come to us  looking\r\n\r\nfor  a  roof  over their heads for themselves  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I see the need to make Singaporeans more\r\n\r\nresponsible for themselves and for the Government to  let\r\n\r\ngo  some of the hand-holding, there is a need to do  this\r\n\r\nincrementally.    Sir,  behavioural  changes   are   best\r\n\r\nachieved incrementally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that if we can study the trends of\r\n\r\nwhat  happened to this group in this economic crisis,  it\r\n\r\nwill  help  us  prepare for eventualities  when  the  new\r\n\r\npolicy sets in.  We have to accept that there will be  no\r\n\r\nmore  safety nets for this group of people.  Should  they\r\n\r\ndefault,  and by our previous experience, many will,  and\r\n\r\nshould the flats be repossessed, we will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  a problem in our hands.  Sir, I do acknowledge that\r\n\r\nwe cannot save everyone nor should we protect them.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  responsible for their own actions.   But  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic crisis tells us that there is  a  group\r\n\r\nthat ends up in a difficult situation due to no fault  of\r\n\r\ntheirs  - they are structurally unemployed and need  time\r\n\r\nto  upgrade themselves to regain employment.  The HDB has\r\n\r\nused    its   own   discretion   and   exercised    moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in extending different  schemes  to  this\r\n\r\ngroup  to help them tide over difficult times.   But  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks will not care.  They will look  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom-line.  Also, what will happen to those who already\r\n\r\nhave  problems  with their creditworthiness?   What  will\r\n\r\nhappen  to  them  if the banks refuse to grant  them  the\r\n\r\nloan?    Sir,  we  need  to  study  this  further  before\r\n\r\nimplementing it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the recommendations put forth by\r\n\r\nthe ERC sub-committee and endorsed by the Government have\r\n\r\nthe interest of the people at heart.  We are indeed going\r\n\r\nthrough   rough   times  and  major  shifts   have   been\r\n\r\nrecommended.  For Singaporeans to be convinced that these\r\n\r\nmeasures  are for their good, we need to give  them  hope\r\n\r\nand  direction.   I seek the Government's  indulgence  in\r\n\r\nlooking  at some of the issues that the other Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  House and myself have raised as we work together  to\r\n\r\ngive  Singaporeans  this ray of  hope  that  things  will\r\n\r\nindeed get better for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join in the debate.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to join my parliamentary colleagues in speaking  up\r\n\r\nfor the workers in the 50-55 age group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has accepted the ERC's proposal to\r\n\r\nlower the CPF rate for workers in the 50-55 age group  to\r\n\r\n16%.   This  is  the  current  rate  for  the  employers'\r\n\r\ncontribution for all employees, lowered from 20%  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  current  economic  condition.   Although  there   is\r\n\r\npresently no difference between the CPF contributions for\r\n\r\nworkers in this age group and those below 50, there  will\r\n\r\nbe  a 4% difference in the CPF rate once the full 20%  is\r\n\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis has been causing unhappiness and concern among those\r\n\r\naffected.   These workers fear that housing payments  may\r\n\r\nbe  affected  as  well  as their retirement  funds  being\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to balance the harsh economic\r\n\r\nsolutions to help our companies survive with the  welfare\r\n\r\nof our workers.  It must balance companies' cost of doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  with  the retirement needs of our  older,  less\r\n\r\nwell-off employees.  In my view, the Government  can  and\r\n\r\nmust  chip  in  and help bridge the gap between  the  two\r\n\r\ncompeting needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Government helped the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup  through  the  various rebates - asset  enhancement\r\n\r\nschemes,  New Singapore Shares and generous  one-off  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   This helps narrow the disparity  between\r\n\r\nour high income earners and the less fortunate.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  need to adopt a more targeted approach towards  those\r\n\r\naffected  by the Government's own measures.  We  do  this\r\n\r\nfor  the GST increase and we should also do this for  the\r\n\r\nCPF  reduction.  This is not only fair but will also show\r\n\r\nthat  we  still  care for our workers from  the  previous\r\n\r\ngeneration who have contributed to Singapore's success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I agree that lowering the\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF  contribution  for  older  workers  would\r\n\r\nenhance  their employment opportunities, I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat we should lower the total monthly CPF savings of the\r\n\r\nlower  paid workers.  Therefore, my proposal is  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to subsidise or pay for part of the  CPF  for\r\n\r\nolder  workers below certain income levels to  help  them\r\n\r\nremain employed.  This measure can be put in place for  a\r\n\r\nlimited period of, say, five years.  This should be  long\r\n\r\nenough   for  other  younger  workers  to  adjust   their\r\n\r\nfinancial and retirement plans.  As an example,  affected\r\n\r\nworkers  earning up to $1,200 per month can have  the  4%\r\n\r\ncut  in  the employers' CPF contribution be made good  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Those earning more will enjoy the  same\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  those earning $1,200.  In my  calculations,\r\n\r\nthis will work out to approximately $60 million\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nper  year  when  the CPF rates are fully  restored.   The\r\n\r\naffected workers will then have up to $2,880 restored  to\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  balances when they reach 55 years old.   This\r\n\r\nsum may be small to those who are well off, but will mean\r\n\r\na  great  deal  to  those  in the lower  income  bracket,\r\n\r\nstruggling to make ends meet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has decided to compensate the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  in  the  50-55  age  group  through  the\r\n\r\ntransitional CPF top-up.  My question is:  why  not  also\r\n\r\nextend this to other Singaporeans?  Sir, I hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will consider the merits of my proposal  when\r\n\r\nimplementing the measures proposed by the ERC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon\r\n\r\nHeng):   Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me bring us back  to\r\n\r\nfundamentals.  What does the CPF mean to each person?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Government Ministers have\r\n\r\nconsistently  stated  that the basic  objectives  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund (CPF) are savings for retirement,\r\n\r\nmedical treatment and housing.  But what is at the top of\r\n\r\neach  person's  mind?  Last week, NTUC conducted  several\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with  union leaders.   After  attending  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  one of my colleagues, in her early  30s,  a\r\n\r\ngraduate,  married  with  two  children,  sent  me   this\r\n\r\nobservation, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At different stages of our life, we have different\r\n\r\nexpectations of CPF.  For me - and my cohort - CPF is for\r\n\r\nhousing.   Which is why most of us do not  really  bother\r\n\r\nabout the Minimum Sum or Medisave retention sum, but more\r\n\r\nconcerned  on  how much is left from my Ordinary  Account\r\n\r\n(OA) for housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those in the late 40s, they could have grown-up\r\n\r\nkids.  The working group may have slightly better savings\r\n\r\nand  income, and therefore may aspire to upgrade.  So CPF\r\n\r\nfor housing again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why in the dialogue sessions over the last\r\n\r\nfew  days, we do not hear people complaining that the  4%\r\n\r\nfreeze  will affect their retirement income, but that  it\r\n\r\nwill  affect their mortgage loans.  Which shows most  are\r\n\r\ncommitting almost the maximum of their OA into housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgency to save for healthcare needs will come at a\r\n\r\nlater  stage.   Children will want to use their  Medisave\r\n\r\nfor their parents, so that their parents can draw out the\r\n\r\nexcess from their CPF when they retire.  I do that for my\r\n\r\nparents, and I understand most of my friends do that too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those not married, they should have more savings\r\n\r\nrelatively - as they have less to spend on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, though not many have achieved the Medisave\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum,  with  MediShield,  it  may  not  be   that\r\n\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think insurance would serve as a good source of\r\n\r\nincome  for  many retirees in future, to  complement  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings.   The  reach may not be that  extensive  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  but  personally I think it is  a  good  scheme  of\r\n\r\nforced savings with protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, retirement income should be financed with\r\n\r\nindividual   savings,  insurance,  and   subsidies   from\r\n\r\nchildren, if any.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my colleague knows a single mother who\r\n\r\nworked  hard to raise eight children, but they  seem  too\r\n\r\ncaught  up with their own families now, giving her little\r\n\r\nsupport,  if any.  I told my colleague that I  have  seen\r\n\r\ntears  well  up  in  the  eyes of 70-year  old  residents\r\n\r\nseeking help at meet-the-people sessions when I ask  them\r\n\r\nhow many children they have.  They know the next question\r\n\r\nI  would be asking is: How much support do they give  you\r\n\r\neach  month?   Voice breaking, the answer would  be  \"Not\r\n\r\nmuch.\"   And yet they would defend their children  saying\r\n\r\nthat life is hard for them too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is a disconnect between Government and\r\n\r\npeople, it is because people look at the immediate  while\r\n\r\nthe  Government  takes a holistic view.  Any  unhappiness\r\n\r\nthat  people  express is understandable  because  changes\r\n\r\naffected  their immediate needs.  The CPF  is  for  their\r\n\r\nneeds over a lifetime, especially their retirement needs.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  should  take  care  to  do  is  make  sure  the\r\n\r\nadjustments  we  make  do not cause  undue  hardship.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve the ERC's recommendations that the Government has\r\n\r\naccepted,  have done that.  It will squeeze some  people,\r\n\r\nbut not unduly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC has restated the principle of the CPF.\r\n\r\nThat  is important.  We did not have such a clear set  of\r\n\r\nprinciples before, so the CPF had become different things\r\n\r\nto  different  people,  and I have illustrated  from  the\r\n\r\ncomments  of my colleague, for many people,  CPF  is  for\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the ERC has clearly stated that the CPF is for\r\n\r\nthe  broad  majority of Singaporeans -  those  above  the\r\n\r\nlowest  10% and below the top 20% by income.  The  lowest\r\n\r\n10%  will  need help through other means.   The  top  20%\r\n\r\nshould be able to plan for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the broad middle 70%, what does the CPF provide?\r\n\r\nRetirement  expenditure, healthcare and home ownership  - at  the  basic level.  At the basic level, I think  is  a\r\n\r\npoint  that  should be highlighted, so that we  will  not\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  have misconceptions of what  the  CPF  will\r\n\r\nprovide for us.  Perhaps, it would be better if we define\r\n\r\neven  more clearly what we mean by basics.  Because basic\r\n\r\nhousing  differs  from  one  person  to  another.   Basic\r\n\r\nmedical  care also differs from one person to the  other.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  we  can define what is basic, then we will  know\r\n\r\nthat   beyond   the   basics,  it   is   our   individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to plan and save for what  we  desire  to\r\n\r\nhave.  Then perhaps like what my colleague does, take  up\r\n\r\ninsurance-linked investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not everybody is like my colleague. I regard\r\n\r\nher  as belonging to the top 20%.  For the broad majority\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans,  their CPF savings provide  them  their\r\n\r\nbasic  needs  in retirement.  For more than  the  basics,\r\n\r\nthey should save what they can, and their children should\r\n\r\nsupport them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should all remind ourselves that pensions\r\n\r\nhave a history of about 150 years.  Our CPF has a history\r\n\r\nof  barely  50  years.  Before pensions and CPF,  parents\r\n\r\nraise  their children, and children support their parents\r\n\r\nwhen they grow old.  This cycle has not changed.  For the\r\n\r\nbroad majority of people, CPF supplements the traditional\r\n\r\ncompact  between  parents  and  children.   Without   it,\r\n\r\ndemographic  changes  will put  the  traditional  compact\r\n\r\nunder severe strain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a long time now, the CPF, working with the\r\n\r\nHDB,   has  been  more  of  a  housing  society  to  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   than   a   fund  for   retirement.    With\r\n\r\nSingapore's   rapid   growth,   it   has   allowed   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to upgrade their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, more than 90% own their homes. The quality\r\n\r\nof  our  housing is already high by world standards.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  expect  the  same  fast  pace  of  upgrading   to\r\n\r\ncontinue.  What happens to the Swiss standard of  living?\r\n\r\nThe  Swiss are blessed with more land, and great  natural\r\n\r\nbeauty.   Many Swiss live on landed property.  For  those\r\n\r\nwho  live  in  Swiss cities, surely we  do  not  see  the\r\n\r\nmajority  living in fenced-in condominiums complete  with\r\n\r\nswimming  pools!  That is why I said, by world standards,\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  accommodation that Singaporeans  have  now\r\n\r\nachieved equals the best around the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total CPF contribution rate will be 40% up\r\n\r\nto  the  age of 50 years.  It means the CPF will continue\r\n\r\nto  help each one buy his first property.  Those who wish\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  will have to plan and save separately.   The\r\n\r\nOrdinary Account will be less, most likely not enough for\r\n\r\nupgrading  without other savings.  Beyond the age  of  50\r\n\r\nyears, the CPF will concentrate on helping the individual\r\n\r\nsave for retirement spending and healthcare.  The prudent\r\n\r\nvaluation limit on use of CPF funds for mortgage payments\r\n\r\nwill  prevent  the erosion of hard earned savings.   This\r\n\r\nwill contribute to a more stable property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will not prevent bubble-like price rises in\r\n\r\nthe future.  However, the swings may not be as wide as in\r\n\r\nthe  past.   And future leaders will do well to  remember\r\n\r\nthat  in  dealing with such situations, they  should  not\r\n\r\ncause demand to rise further as that would merely pump up\r\n\r\nprices.   The property price index chart, on  page  4  of\r\n\r\nBusiness  Times  today,  is instructive.   The  chart  is\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the one that Members can find  in  the  Cost\r\n\r\nReview  Committee Report of 1996.  Any measure  that  has\r\n\r\nincreased demand has merely pushed up prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the feedback I get from my colleagues in\r\n\r\nthe   NTUC   and   my   grassroots,   after   yesterday's\r\n\r\nannouncement, is why are we allowing 10% cash payment and\r\n\r\n10%  from the CPF for private housing, because that would\r\n\r\ncreate  demand.  And they asked me why is it that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  other complementary measures to prevent  the  over-consumption  of  housing.  For  example,  should  we  not\r\n\r\ninstitute  a rule on how much of the monthly wage  should\r\n\r\ngo  towards mortgage payment?  People would then be  able\r\n\r\nto  cope  with  the payment over the life  of  the  loan,\r\n\r\nknowing the changes that may happen in the economy  which\r\n\r\nmay  even cause some of them to be out of work from  time\r\n\r\nto time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that they told me was that we should\r\n\r\nnot  allow  the so-called ballooning schemes that  became\r\n\r\npopular in the early 1990s.  These are schemes where  one\r\n\r\ndoes  not  pay  the principal sum; one only services  the\r\n\r\ninterest  payments.  They feel that this is a trap  which\r\n\r\nwe  should  not allow our people to get into.  These  are\r\n\r\nprudent  suggestions which the banks and other  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, when they issue housing loans, should  bear\r\n\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I hope it is now a bit clearer\r\n\r\nwhat  the  CPF will do for people at different stages  of\r\n\r\nlife.   In the early years, it would be to help  them  to\r\n\r\nbuy  their  first property, as well as save up  some  for\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement  and medical needs, the  principal  one\r\n\r\nbeing for housing.  But, in the later years, it would  be\r\n\r\nto  save up for retirement spending and healthcare.  Seen\r\n\r\nin  this  light, the change in the long-term contribution\r\n\r\nrate for those in the 50-55 age group cannot be described\r\n\r\nas  discrimination against them.  And we should never use\r\n\r\nthe term \"ageism\" lightly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Addressing the seniority-based wage system</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our wage system is seniority-based. As my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Matthias Yao, said yesterday, our  system  is\r\n\r\nuncommon.   I studied wage systems in different countries\r\n\r\nin  the 1980s.  So I know our seniority-based wage system\r\n\r\nis  inherently flawed.  I knew then that it was uncommon,\r\n\r\nbecause  other countries used a different principle.   My\r\n\r\nyounger colleagues in the unions did not take my word for\r\n\r\nit.  They checked for themselves, as Mr Matthias Yao said\r\n\r\nyesterday, and confirmed what I found out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalmost  20 years ago - that the prevalent system  applied\r\n\r\nelsewhere was one based on job rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Japanese have a seniority-based system\r\n\r\nsimilar to ours.  From the late 1980s, Japanese companies\r\n\r\nhave  had to change it.  The Japanese MNCs knew  after  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of time that the average wage costs go  up  under\r\n\r\nthat system and they become uncompetitive.  They tried to\r\n\r\nchange, progress was slow.  But they have persisted.  Let\r\n\r\nme   quote  from  the  article  \"The  Death  of  Lifetime\r\n\r\nEmployment\" in the publication Look Japan, August 2002:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The second mainstay of the customary employment\r\n\r\nsystem  in Japan, seniority-based pay, has also  changed.\r\n\r\nAn  aging  society  with fewer children  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nunderlying  factors.  A salary curve that  rises  sharply\r\n\r\nalong  with  employees' age was acceptable in times  when\r\n\r\nthere  were a greater number of young people.  The  total\r\n\r\npersonnel  costs  could be suppressed during  times  like\r\n\r\nthat,  because a greater number of people are paid  lower\r\n\r\nwages.   But in an aging society, it has become necessary\r\n\r\nto  revise the seniority-based salary, to keep down total\r\n\r\npersonnel costs.  An increasing number of enterprises are\r\n\r\nraising the proportion of performance-based wages  as  an\r\n\r\nincentive for higher performance.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Japanese realised that and they have been\r\n\r\nmaking changes.  And, as Mr Matthias Yao said, the  right\r\n\r\nway is the job rate.  We have pushed that since 1986.  At\r\n\r\nleast,  I have pushed for it since 1986.  Although  years\r\n\r\nof  modification has narrowed the gap between  commencing\r\n\r\nand  maximum salaries, on average, an office clerk in the\r\n\r\nage  group of 50-55 is now paid 60% more than one in  the\r\n\r\nearly  20s doing the same work; an electrician, 40% more;\r\n\r\nand  managers,  200%  more.   These  are  from  the  same\r\n\r\nstatistics that Dr Maliki mentioned earlier.  With  these\r\n\r\ngaps,   the   4-percentage  points  less  in   employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution  means they will still  be  paid  more  than\r\n\r\nthose  with shorter service.  So I do not think this  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  described  as discriminating  against  the\r\n\r\nyoung-old or the not-so-young, as Dr Maliki has described\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki was right in pointing out that in some\r\n\r\nother classifications, eg, cleaners, the increase in wage\r\n\r\nlevels across the age profile is very minor.  In fact, we\r\n\r\ncan find\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomewhere the wage level actually drops.  But we have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  this  is the case.   In  many  cases  of\r\n\r\nproduction, the length of work of the employees is short.\r\n\r\nAnd there are not so many in the older age group.  In the\r\n\r\ncase of cleaners, there are not so many in the young  age\r\n\r\ngroup.  Most of them are in the older age group.  So,  we\r\n\r\nhave to understand why that is the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But working with the unions, we know what is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in  collective agreements and,  typically,\r\n\r\nthere  is a salary scale, with a commencing salary and  a\r\n\r\nmaximum point.  We know the people are paid according  to\r\n\r\nlength of service, still very much so.  Not as much as it\r\n\r\nused  to  be, but still there is a very significant  gap.\r\n\r\nIf  I  were  operating a hospital and  all  my  employees\r\n\r\nbelong  to the mature group or have been working  a  long\r\n\r\ntime,  then I know that if a new hospital were to set  up\r\n\r\nand  employ  young  people  under  our  system,  the  new\r\n\r\nhospital  is  going to be more competitive than  the  old\r\n\r\nhospital.   That  is why we have got to  restructure  our\r\n\r\nwage  system  to  that  based on  the  job  rate  and  on\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Helping older employees avoid structural unemployment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been another good reason for the reduction\r\n\r\nin  employer's contribution to CPF, ie, to help employees\r\n\r\nin  this  age group.  They may not see it as  such.   But\r\n\r\nretrenchment  figures  show that a higher  proportion  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  laid  off  when  companies  restructure.    Mr\r\n\r\nMatthias  Yao  gave  some figures yesterday.   We  expect\r\n\r\nrestructuring to continue.  So, why should we place  them\r\n\r\nat higher risk, especially when they also find it hardest\r\n\r\nto  find re-employment?  Ministry of Manpower data  shows\r\n\r\nthat  workers  above  40 years take longer  to  find  re-employment.   Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon  informed   Members\r\n\r\nyesterday of the experience of South West CDC, where  the\r\n\r\nworkers  looking for jobs, and having a  hard  time,  are\r\n\r\nthose aged 40 and above.  Members can get a good idea  of\r\n\r\nthe problem, if they spend time in their CDCs helping\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  looking for jobs.  Age, not educational level,  is\r\n\r\nthe  key  factor,  as  what the  Ministry  of  Manpower's\r\n\r\ninformation tells us.  So, is it age discrimination?   Or\r\n\r\nis it the seniority-based wage system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate 4-year Department of Statistics (DOS)\r\n\r\nstudy  of 14,000 workers retrenched from October 1997  to\r\n\r\nSeptember 1998, during the Asian financial crisis,  shows\r\n\r\nthat  a  significant number are now not working -  almost\r\n\r\n30%.   It is a sign that we have structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nAnd, unfortunately, we must expect more to come.  The DOS\r\n\r\nfindings for those who found re-employment were sobering.\r\n\r\nMore  than  half  had wage cuts; one in seven  had  their\r\n\r\nearnings  halved;  another  one  in  five  suffered  cuts\r\n\r\nbetween  25% and 50%.  Those who suffered wage cuts  were\r\n\r\nthe  older  ones,  aged 40 and above.   Again,  age,  not\r\n\r\neducation, was the key factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to help them avoid the trap of structural\r\n\r\nunemployment, we have to do several things.  Bring  their\r\n\r\nwage levels closer to their productivity, so they stay in\r\n\r\ntheir jobs.  Altering our seniority-based wage system  to\r\n\r\npay  by  performance is the way forward, but it  takes  a\r\n\r\nlong time.  Not restoring the employer's contribution  to\r\n\r\nCPF  will  help, at least right now.   Mr  Gan  Kim  Yong\r\n\r\ndisagreed  yesterday, saying that cutting CPF  for  older\r\n\r\nemployees  will  only  entrench the seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.  But employer's contribution to CPF is also  part\r\n\r\nof  total wages.  Lowering it will narrow the gap between\r\n\r\ntop-end wages and commencing salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, adjusting wage costs is not enough. I\r\n\r\nfully  agree.   In addition, we should retrain  them  and\r\n\r\nredesign  jobs  to raise productivity.  The  unions  have\r\n\r\npushed  for  it.   They say employers are not  retraining\r\n\r\nenough.   I  hope  that  Members who  are  in  management\r\n\r\npositions   in  their  respective  companies  will   give\r\n\r\nretraining  of their employees a greater push,  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  ones  who can make the difference  in  the\r\n\r\nredesign  of  jobs so that their employees  can  be  more\r\n\r\nproductive  and paid more.  So, I am saying that  Members\r\n\r\ncan make a difference.  Do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nleave it to the unions and union leaders to push.  If the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament do their part in their respective\r\n\r\ncompanies, I think we can make more progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC's recommendations, therefore, address\r\n\r\nseveral  long-term  issues, and they  help  workers  over\r\n\r\ntheir  lifetime.  Certainly, to some workers,  the  small\r\n\r\nchanges  may  hurt.   The effects can be  mitigated,  and\r\n\r\nemployers would do well to make transitional payments  to\r\n\r\nthose immediately affected when CPF is restored for those\r\n\r\nbelow   50   years.   For  those  working  in   unionised\r\n\r\ncompanies,  I  am  sure they will get their  transitional\r\n\r\npayments.   Others have said it is unfair to  some  older\r\n\r\nworkers  who are value for money and, therefore,  unfair,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  CPF will not be restored.   Here,  I  fully\r\n\r\nagree  with my colleagues from the unions that  employers\r\n\r\nare free to pay them in cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me just make a note that the report in\r\n\r\ntoday's Straits Times about the TCTC may give people  the\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding that it will be a top-up into  the  CPF.\r\n\r\nI  do not think it is intended to be a top-up to the CPF,\r\n\r\nbut  rather  a top-up where the employees, in this  case,\r\n\r\nthe civil servants, will get it in cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me highlight another recommendation\r\n\r\nthat  has not attracted much debate, that the CPF  should\r\n\r\nbe used as a counter-cyclical tool only as a last resort.\r\n\r\nTwice  the CPF has been used to help us out of recession.\r\n\r\nEach  time,  we have devised new, flexible elements  into\r\n\r\nour  wage  system,  learning from the experience  of  the\r\n\r\nrecessions.   This statement in the ERC's recommendations\r\n\r\nmeans  that  in future recessions, employers  should  not\r\n\r\nexpect  the employers' contribution to CPF to be cut,  at\r\n\r\nleast  not so readily as in the last two times. And  they\r\n\r\nwould  have to work out the wage structure for their  own\r\n\r\ncompanies to cope with the cycles of business.   The  CPF\r\n\r\nwill  now  focus  on  providing  the  broad  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with their basic needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite what the Minister has said, I would\r\n\r\nlike to speak on the issue of the non-restoration of  CPF\r\n\r\nfor  the  older  workers.   I  also,  like  many  of   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues here, feel for the older workers.   They  have\r\n\r\ngiven  their best years to build Singapore to what it  is\r\n\r\ntoday.   I think it is very unfair of the Government  not\r\n\r\nto give them their due in respect of their CPF.  I do not\r\n\r\nthink  the 4-percentage point savings on the part of  the\r\n\r\nemployers will be an incentive to the employers  to  want\r\n\r\nto  employ older workers if they do not need them in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place.  Employers employ  any  worker  if  he  can\r\n\r\ncontribute   to  the  bottom  line  of  their  companies,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  his age.  More importantly,  I  think  to\r\n\r\ndeliberately  cut  older workers' CPF,  which  is  really\r\n\r\ntheir  salary,  is  a  wrong  move.   By  doing  so,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is sending the wrong signal to  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity. The Government is really telling the employers\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  all  right  to discriminate  against  older\r\n\r\nworkers regardless of whether they can do the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think that, from the legal point of view,\r\n\r\nthis cut in salary is quite unconstitutional.  Article 12\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution  says that all  persons  are  equal\r\n\r\nbefore  the  law.  By cutting the CPF, the Government  is\r\n\r\nmaking  the  law discriminate against older  workers.   I\r\n\r\nthink the unions should look into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older workers do realise that in these difficult\r\n\r\ntimes,  when they get retrenched, and if they are offered\r\n\r\nan alternative job, they will most probably be offered  a\r\n\r\nlower  pay.   Most  of these older workers  accept  that.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the cut in CPF, as pointed out yesterday, I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  by Mr Sin Boon Ann, they shall suffer a  double\r\n\r\npenalty.  They will get a lower pay as well as their  CPF\r\n\r\nwill be taken away from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> have made many credible suggestions and\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think it is wise of me to repeat  them.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  and unions should explore them.  Whatever  it\r\n\r\nis, I think it is wrong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot to restore the CPF of the workers between the age  of\r\n\r\n50-55.   I hope that the ERC shall rethink this issue  in\r\n\r\nthe  meantime  before the restoration of CPF  comes  into\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange that I should be speaking, as an\r\n\r\nOpposition, for the restoration or non-cutting of the CPF\r\n\r\nbecause,  as far as I can remember, it was the Opposition\r\n\r\nin the early days, when the CPF was as high as 50% of the\r\n\r\nworkers' salary, that we, at that time, were asking for a\r\n\r\ncut of the CPF.  Times have now changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe changes to the CPF rules announced yesterday signal a\r\n\r\nfundamental  change  in the social  compact  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people in some important aspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time now, the Government has been\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  an over-protective nanny.  The  Government\r\n\r\nlooks  after  the  people in almost all aspects  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  trust  the  Government  to  look  out  for  their\r\n\r\ninterests, almost unquestioningly.  This is especially so\r\n\r\nwhen   it  comes  to  planning  for  their  housing   and\r\n\r\nretirement needs.   Now it seems that the Government  has\r\n\r\ntaken out the scissors to cut some apron strings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the principle of encouraging greater\r\n\r\npersonal responsibility which is behind some of the  CPF-related  changes  announced yesterday.  The  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  people are ready for it  and  whether  they\r\n\r\nunderstand why this is necessary at this particular time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been so many major changes announced in\r\n\r\nquick succession, a whole slew of them, and this has left\r\n\r\nmany  workers, especially the less-skilled and the  older\r\n\r\nworkers, reeling with confusion and anxiety. They do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  to make of the changes, or how to  adjust  to\r\n\r\nthem.   They  certainly do not understand the term  \"bank\r\n\r\norigination\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to simplify its explanations\r\n\r\nand pitch it at the average\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporean.   It needs to assure the public  that  these\r\n\r\nchanges   are  necessary  at  this  time  and  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will help them through this transition period,\r\n\r\nholding  their  hands  merely for  a  while  more  before\r\n\r\nleaving  them on the other side of the busy  street.  And\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  would  put  in  place  pedestrian\r\n\r\ncrossings and covered linkways so that they can go  about\r\n\r\ntheir own way, come rain or shine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the changes to the use of the CPF for\r\n\r\nproperty purchases and the divestment of HDB market  rate\r\n\r\nloans  to  banks.  This will take effect on  1st  January\r\n\r\n2003 at the same time as the GST increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially concerned about the impact on HDB\r\n\r\nflat  owners  who  had over-invested in their  properties\r\n\r\nduring  the  boom  years.  Often, I  meet  residents  who\r\n\r\ncontinue to live in five-room or executive HDB flats when\r\n\r\nthey  cannot afford to do so, and often because they have\r\n\r\nbeen hit by the economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many residents have come to see me to write to the\r\n\r\nHDB  to  defer  payment  of  their  mortgage  loans.   An\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  has sought help  to  downgrade  to  a\r\n\r\nsmaller  flat  or a rental flat. Some are  divorcees  who\r\n\r\nhave  just sold their matrimonial flat or widows  who  no\r\n\r\nlonger need a big flat.  They want to live more prudently\r\n\r\nin  a  smaller flat.  Some just want to cut their  losses\r\n\r\nearlier after realising that the burden is too heavy  for\r\n\r\nthem and they want to sell their flat before the required\r\n\r\nfive-year period for minimum occupation is due.  But  HDB\r\n\r\nhas strict laws on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked them why they sought to buy such big\r\n\r\nflats in the first place, they often replied that it  was\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Government had encouraged them to  upgrade,\r\n\r\nand  also  because they thought they could rely on  their\r\n\r\nCPF  for  most of the payment. They took the Government's\r\n\r\nword on this with simple faith.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with the new changes, HDB flat owners who want\r\n\r\nto downgrade, can no longer go to the HDB for market rate\r\n\r\nloans and they can no longer enjoy the flexibility of the\r\n\r\nHDB  in deferring payments.  They now have to go to banks\r\n\r\nfor loans and need to pay 10% of their 20% downpayment in\r\n\r\ncash  before they can buy a flat, when before they  could\r\n\r\npay  the  20% downpayment entirely from their CPF.   This\r\n\r\nmay  well  be the knock-out blow to Singaporeans  hit  by\r\n\r\nhard times and who are forced to downgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their options for rental housing are presently\r\n\r\nlimited.   To qualify for HDB rental flats, the applicant\r\n\r\nmust  have a combined income of less than $800  a  month.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the applicant must not have sold an HDB flat\r\n\r\nwithin 30 months at the point of rental application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to review the HDB rental\r\n\r\npolicies  and  to  also  look at how  the  non-subsidised\r\n\r\nrental  housing market in Singapore can be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nprovide rental housing for a wide range of income groups,\r\n\r\nespecially the lower income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I am aware that we also have to examine\r\n\r\nthe  larger  implications of this.  In Singapore,  it  is\r\n\r\nalmost a sacred tenet that each Singaporean should own  a\r\n\r\nhome  to  give him a stake in the country.  But  in  many\r\n\r\nother  developed  countries,  such  as  America  however,\r\n\r\nrenting is a lifestyle decision for many Americans who do\r\n\r\nnot want to be burdened with mortgage payments.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem  would  rather save the money for investing  in  new\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and to give them greater mobility  to  travel\r\n\r\nabroad to work in different cities and countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the changes announced which\r\n\r\nworries  me is whether our banks are up to the  challenge\r\n\r\nof  providing  loans to the lower middle-income  and  the\r\n\r\nlower-income  groups. The buzzwords for banks  today  are\r\n\r\nprofitability  and efficiency.  I am not sure  how  ready\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  to cater to the lower-income  individuals\r\n\r\naffected by the changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the change to allow banks to have their\r\n\r\nfirst-charge  on mortgage loans, I am not  confident  how\r\n\r\nreadily  they can listen to the lower-income's pleas  for\r\n\r\ncompassion.   Perhaps,  it is time  for  us  to  look  at\r\n\r\nencouraging  the  establishment  of  non-profit   housing\r\n\r\ncooperatives.   These  cooperatives  would  be  able   to\r\n\r\nnegotiate a better deal with the banks on behalf of their\r\n\r\ntenants and to also safeguard their interest as a group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in Canada, non-profit housing\r\n\r\ncooperatives  receive money from the Government  to  help\r\n\r\nthe  cooperatives subsidise a certain number  of  housing\r\n\r\nunits or apartments. The housing charged for this unit is\r\n\r\nadjusted  to the income of the household.  If a household\r\n\r\nqualifies for a subsidy, their rent is usually set at 30%\r\n\r\nof  the household income plus charges for utilities.   It\r\n\r\nis a model worth looking at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change which troubles me is the CPF cut for\r\n\r\nworkers  above  50.  I understand the  rationale  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and   support  its  aim  to   increase   the\r\n\r\nemployability of the older workers.  I also  applaud  the\r\n\r\nmove of the civil service to take the lead in giving back\r\n\r\ncash  to its older workers, part of what they would  have\r\n\r\nto forgo because of the CPF changes.  However, I question\r\n\r\nif  this  is the best way to go about it.  I have  argued\r\n\r\nagainst  cutting the CPF of older workers in  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate at length, so I will not repeat my points.  But  I\r\n\r\njust  want  to add one more point.  So far, the proposals\r\n\r\nintroduced to help older workers stay employed are  often\r\n\r\npiecemeal  and ad-hoc, introduced separately,  one  at  a\r\n\r\ntime, without an overarching framework.  Seen separately,\r\n\r\nit can send a wrong message to the public.  For instance,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF freeze for workers above 50 can be read by  many\r\n\r\nas a move to make life harder for the older workers.  And\r\n\r\nit  is  no  surprise that people look at  the  policy  in\r\n\r\nisolation  and question if it is effective in encouraging\r\n\r\nemployers to hire older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it is introduced together with other measures\r\n\r\ndirected at employers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  change  their mindset towards the older  workers  and\r\n\r\nwith  legislation to protect older workers, it would give\r\n\r\na  more accurate signal of the Government's intent, which\r\n\r\nis to help them stay employed and that the Government has\r\n\r\ntheir interests at heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower Ministry, on its part, has put in extra\r\n\r\neffort to help older workers but I must say that this  is\r\n\r\noften lost on the public.  It has put in place very  good\r\n\r\nprogrammes  like  providing higher level funding  support\r\n\r\nfor  the  training of older workers.  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to pull together all these schemes and to  set\r\n\r\nup  a  comprehensive national programme for older workers\r\n\r\nto address the problem of unemployed older workers and to\r\n\r\nsend the signal that they are valued as assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Finland has done with some success.\r\n\r\nFinland  is  one of the rare countries to  have  taken  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive grip on age policy.  It launched a national\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  older  workers  in  1997  and   this   is\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  cooperation with various Ministries  and\r\n\r\nits  social  partners.  It serves as a  good  example  of\r\n\r\nFinnish tripartite cooperation.  The partners have  tried\r\n\r\nto  improve  the  position  of  older  workers  at  their\r\n\r\nworkplace and there has been extensive commitment to this\r\n\r\ngoal  on  the  employers as well as the employees'  side.\r\n\r\nThe  goal  of the programme was to improve the employment\r\n\r\nrate among older workers as well as to influence people's\r\n\r\nattitude towards aging and older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures of this national programme are focused\r\n\r\non  helping to solve the problems of unemployment through\r\n\r\ntraining, information and legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, we are going through a period of\r\n\r\nrapid  change.    And there is a danger that  our  social\r\n\r\ncompact  that has been built between the people  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment through the many decades may be fraying.  Even\r\n\r\nas  it  is  being restructured, I urge the Government  to\r\n\r\ntake  steps to strengthen this social compact, and  build\r\n\r\non the trust that the people have on the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a union leader for the past 26 years.\r\n\r\nAll these years, my top-most priority is job preservation\r\n\r\nand  creation.   Hence, it pains me when  I  see  workers\r\n\r\nretrenched.  The pain gets worse when retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nare  unable to find new jobs.  Older workers are  hardest\r\n\r\nhit.   In my own union experience, especially in the past\r\n\r\nfew  years, I have noticed that older retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nhave  greater difficulties in finding new  jobs.   In  my\r\n\r\nexperience,  the challenges we face now on  the  economic\r\n\r\nfront  and  job market are the most severe.  As  a  union\r\n\r\nleader,  I am equally concerned of the other basic  needs\r\n\r\nof workers, ie, adequate housing, healthcare and a decent\r\n\r\nliving standard in retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing these concerns, I welcome the Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Committee's recommendations on  changes  to\r\n\r\nthe  CPF system.  Its objective of refocusing the CPF  is\r\n\r\ntimely  and  necessary.  I welcome the  intent  that  the\r\n\r\nchanges to the CPF will be gradual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to express these views on the proposed\r\n\r\nCPF  changes.   First, the raising of the employees'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  wage band to $500-$750.   This  means  that\r\n\r\nworkers  earning  within this wage band and  below  would\r\n\r\nhave  a higher take-home pay from now on.  It is also  an\r\n\r\nincentive   to   encourage  those  who  are  economically\r\n\r\ninactive  to enter the job market.  Relatively,  it  will\r\n\r\nhelp the lower income households more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But raising the CPF band alone will not solve the\r\n\r\nproblem.   We should find ways to redesign jobs that  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  done  by  foreign workers to  make  them  more\r\n\r\nattractive to our local workers.  There is also an urgent\r\n\r\nneed to educate our local workers not to shun these jobs,\r\n\r\nthrough  the  media  or grassroots organisations.   Other\r\n\r\nthan  the CPF changes, the Government should implement  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  set  of  packages  to  reconcile  the  housing,\r\n\r\nmedical and retirement needs of the lower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome  workers  and their families.  This  would  ensure\r\n\r\nthat they are not worse off in the longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now, I would like to touch on the\r\n\r\nrecommendation to freeze the employer's CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nat  16%  for those in the 50-55 age group.  In the debate\r\n\r\nyesterday,  25 MPs spoke.  In today's debate, Dr  Maliki,\r\n\r\nMs  Irene Ng and Mr Chiam See Tong also spoke on it.   It\r\n\r\nmay  seem to the outside observer that the NTUC  MPs  are\r\n\r\nfor  the freeze, and everyone else is against it.  I  too\r\n\r\nsupport  the  freeze.  Why do we support it?   The  other\r\n\r\nsolutions proposed by the MPs are all very good solutions\r\n\r\n-   retraining,  upgrading of skills, more   productivity\r\n\r\nand  value added merit-based wages.  These are all  sound\r\n\r\nsolutions  and  proposals.  They  have  been  around  for\r\n\r\nyears.  They are not new proposals.  But let me ask  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers:  how  many  employers  send  their  workers  for\r\n\r\nretraining,  not  just  for their  present  jobs  but  to\r\n\r\nprepare  them  for  long-term  employability?   How  many\r\n\r\nemployers have implemented base-up wage system, which was\r\n\r\nproposed by the labour movement in 1986?  The reason  why\r\n\r\nwe  need to introduce a freeze now is not because  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  the  solution.  It is that  those  who  should\r\n\r\nimplement the solution are slow and reluctant to  do  so.\r\n\r\nThis   freeze  should  achieve  the  desired  effect   of\r\n\r\nretaining   older  workers,  improving  their  employment\r\n\r\nprospects,  and  I agree that these measures  to  achieve\r\n\r\ngreater wage flexibility would help preserve jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can choose to do nothing about it and let\r\n\r\nevents  unfold.  Mr Chiam has mentioned that a couple  of\r\n\r\nyears ago, the Opposition had called for a cut in CPF.  I\r\n\r\nwas  one  of  them who objected to the proposal.   He  is\r\n\r\nright  -  time has changed.  Of course, time has  changed\r\n\r\nright  now.  And we are calling for this freeze  because,\r\n\r\nas  trade unionists, day to day, we have to help  workers\r\n\r\nwho are unable to find jobs, and for those who are out of\r\n\r\nthe  job  market, to bring them back into the  workforce.\r\n\r\nThese are the difficulties we face today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As responsible trade unionists, we have to do\r\n\r\nsomething.   Of course, any freeze will hurt,  but  there\r\n\r\nare  other measures to help them, which I will touch upon\r\n\r\nlater.   But  doing nothing will actually put  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers  into a greater pain and, without jobs,  actually\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  CPF at all.  They and their  families  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  go through a great extent of suffering.   Each\r\n\r\nday, when retrenched workers approach us, especially  the\r\n\r\nolder  ones, we have great difficulty to find them  jobs.\r\n\r\nOf   course,  I  do  agree  that  employers  should   not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against older workers.  But we  just  cannot\r\n\r\nlive with statements without doing anything.  So, we need\r\n\r\nto  do  something concrete, and we hope these steps  will\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has changed. Time has changed. With\r\n\r\nglobalisation and competition from the region  and  other\r\n\r\nnewer economies emerging, there are greater difficulties,\r\n\r\nespecially older workers face more difficulties.  So,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  with this freeze, and with other  measures\r\n\r\nwhich are in place, it would definitely help them to  get\r\n\r\nback  their jobs.  But if that is not sufficient, then  I\r\n\r\nthink the Government should monitor the situation and, as\r\n\r\nMembers  have suggested, if necessary, we can incentivise\r\n\r\ngood  employers  and disincentivise bad  employers.   If,\r\n\r\neventually,  legislation is needed, then we  can  explore\r\n\r\nit.  But right now, we need to immediately introduce some\r\n\r\nmeasures, and this measure of freezing the CPF for  those\r\n\r\naged 50-55, we believe, will help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly urge employers not to treat these\r\n\r\nmeasures as a cost-cutting exercise.  They must take  the\r\n\r\nERC  recommendation seriously and pass back part  of  the\r\n\r\nsavings  to  deserving employees, either in the  form  of\r\n\r\nbonus  or monthly variable payments.  I am glad that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as an employer will be setting an example.  I\r\n\r\nurge  private sector employers to do the same.  Forms  of\r\n\r\npayment  can  be flexible depending on the  company.   As\r\n\r\nthis is a recommendation, there may be employers who  are\r\n\r\ndoing  well  and yet keep all the savings to  themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this happens, it will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunfair to this age group of workers.  Hence, I call  upon\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  set  up a  tripartite  committee  to\r\n\r\nmonitor   the  situation  and,  if  necessary,  introduce\r\n\r\nappropriate measures against such bad employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to freeze employer's CPF contribution\r\n\r\nat  16%  for  those aged 50-55 years old will cause  some\r\n\r\nhardship.   These older workers have made sacrifices  and\r\n\r\ncontributed significantly to our nation's early years  of\r\n\r\neconomic  development and nation building.  Many  workers\r\n\r\nin  this  age  group  have skills and  experience.   They\r\n\r\nshould  not be made to feel useless.  Their concerns  are\r\n\r\nreal and they rightfully deserve more help.  Will they be\r\n\r\nable  to  service their mortgage loans?  Will  they  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  funds  for  their  retirement?    These   are\r\n\r\nfundamental questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our nation has built up considerable strengths,\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and resources in the past  30  years.   The\r\n\r\nolder workers have contributed to these achievements  and\r\n\r\nresources.   I  urge  the Government to  provide  special\r\n\r\nassistance  to  them.   Earlier  on,  Dr  John  Chen  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that the Government could top up  the  CPF  of\r\n\r\nsuch  older  workers,  and  I  support  his  call.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment should explore topping up, if not in full,  at\r\n\r\nleast in part, to help such workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a specific request for DPM to consider.\r\n\r\nYes,  reducing the employee's CPF contribution for  those\r\n\r\naged  50-55  years old by 4% will enhance their  spending\r\n\r\npower,  but it will also erode their CPF savings  in  the\r\n\r\nlong  term.  They may have to pay higher taxes  and  lose\r\n\r\nout in the CPF interest of their savings.  Sir, I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government consider giving an  option  to  the\r\n\r\nemployee either to take the cash or let it remain in  his\r\n\r\nCPF account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to stress an\r\n\r\nimportant  point  which  Mr Lim  Boon  Heng  had  earlier\r\n\r\ntouched on.  CPF cuts have been used in the past to  pull\r\n\r\nus  out  of recession.  Every cut is painful for workers.\r\n\r\nEmployers should not expect\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanother  CPF cut if a recession occurs.  It is time  that\r\n\r\nemployers  built  up  the flexible  component  of  wages,\r\n\r\nespecially MVC without any further delay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has accepted the CPF\r\n\r\nrecommendations  and it has announced  some  measures  to\r\n\r\nhelp  workers,  especially  the  older  ones.   This   is\r\n\r\nencouraging.    As  the  CPF  recommendations   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented gradually, I urge the Government  to  monitor\r\n\r\nthe  situation closely, as it has many implications,  and\r\n\r\ndo more, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the changes to the CPF system\r\n\r\nannounced by the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt that the CPF system has\r\n\r\nserved us well over the years.  It has become an icon  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, the world has changed.  It is now  a\r\n\r\nglobalised   economy   with  intense   competition   from\r\n\r\ncountries  like  China.   And  the  Singapore  population\r\n\r\nprofile and economy have also changed.  The population is\r\n\r\ngreying  and  Singaporeans are living  longer.   We  need\r\n\r\ntherefore to provide more for old age and retirement.  As\r\n\r\nthe environment has changed, so must CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF system ain't broke, but we can modify it to\r\n\r\nmaximise  its  usefulness  and  effectiveness   for   the\r\n\r\nindividuals  as  well  as for the economy.   I  therefore\r\n\r\nsupport the new measures, as announced.  Nevertheless,  I\r\n\r\nwish to raise some points of concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, one area of concern is the reduction in CPF\r\n\r\nrates  for  the older workers aged 50 to 55.   In  truth,\r\n\r\nthese  older workers will suffer a potential pay  cut  or\r\n\r\nstagnation.   There  is already a bias against  employing\r\n\r\nolder  workers.   The  new  move  is  intended,  in  this\r\n\r\ncontext, to lessen the seniority-based system and to make\r\n\r\nolder workers more employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I wonder if it will work that way in practice.\r\n\r\nThose  who do not wish to employ or retain older  workers\r\n\r\nmay,  in practice, not be moved by such measures at  all.\r\n\r\nWill  it not instead perpetuate the view that this  group\r\n\r\nof older workers is less useful or less relevant?  I hope\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some circumstances, those aged between 50\r\n\r\nand  55, give of their best, contribute significantly  to\r\n\r\nthe economy over many years, drawing upon their wealth of\r\n\r\nexperience,  their  wide  networking  and  their   tested\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some older workers will also suffer from the\r\n\r\ndrop in CPF payable from $6,000 to $5,000 per month.   It\r\n\r\nwill therefore be a double hit.  With the decline in  the\r\n\r\nCPF portion, which is tax exempt, and the increase in the\r\n\r\ncash  portion, their taxable income or tax liability will\r\n\r\nalso  go  up.  In this context, I urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  a  public  education programme to  emphasise  the\r\n\r\nmerits  of  employing  older workers,  and  provide  more\r\n\r\nfunding  and  avenues for the training and retraining  of\r\n\r\nthese older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of their relative decline in CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions,  I urge employers to reward  good  workers\r\n\r\nfrom  this  group  through bonuses and  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponents.   The private sector should,  in  particular,\r\n\r\nwalk the talk and join the public sector as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other area of concern is the related move\r\n\r\nby  HDB  to get more HDB home buyers to go to the  market\r\n\r\nand  borrow  from the banks, instead of  relying  on  HDB\r\n\r\nfinancing  and mortgages.  This is good news  indeed  for\r\n\r\nthe  banks.   But, HDB interest rates are very reasonably\r\n\r\npriced  for the HDB home owners, whereas market  interest\r\n\r\nrates  from  banks are expected to be higher,  especially\r\n\r\nover time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has so far been quite liberal in giving loans to\r\n\r\npotential HDB buyers.  In the new situation, what happens\r\n\r\nif  the  banks refuse to give loans to some  HDB  buyers,\r\n\r\nlooking closely at their credibility\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  creditworthiness?   HDB is  quite  understanding  and\r\n\r\nfriendly on mortgage default cases, whereas the banks are\r\n\r\nlikely   to   be   commercial-driven   and   tougher   in\r\n\r\nenforcement.  When residents come to see us at the  meet-the-people sessions, we, as Members of Parliament,  could\r\n\r\nwrite  to HDB and appeal for more time, leniency,  easier\r\n\r\npayment terms, ballooning scheme, delayed payment, and so\r\n\r\non.   HDB,  I  must  say, is rather obliging  and  rather\r\n\r\nhelpful in all these appeal cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in this new situation, it will be impractical\r\n\r\nfor  us to write to the banks or to pressurise the  banks\r\n\r\nin any way, and the commercial-driven banks are likely to\r\n\r\nbe   tougher   and  adopt  a  no-nonsense   profit-driven\r\n\r\napproach, as they should be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard my colleague, Ms Irene Ng, talking about\r\n\r\ncooperatives,  and  I know there is  the  NTUC  Loan  and\r\n\r\nThrift  Cooperative.   Maybe the  NTUC  Loan  and  Thrift\r\n\r\nCooperative  can play a more significant role,  a  higher\r\n\r\nprofile, in helping out some of the HDB residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB Home Ownership Scheme and mortgages have\r\n\r\nbeen  part and parcel of Singaporeans' way of  life.   We\r\n\r\nhave  got  used  to  it.  It is an important  channel  of\r\n\r\nbonding between the Government and the people.  Will  the\r\n\r\nchange or emphasis to commercial bank loans diminish this\r\n\r\nvery   vital  bonding  or  social  compact  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people?  I hope not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, for those who, for one reason or another,\r\n\r\nare  not  able  to  buy  or own an  HDB  flat,  will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  provide  more  HDB rental  housing  for  this\r\n\r\ncategory of people?  As we all know, currently, there are\r\n\r\nvery few HDB rental housing available, and the conditions\r\n\r\nare very stringent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CPF holders can use the CPF for purchase of\r\n\r\ncompany  shares from the Stock Exchange.  Many have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir hard-earned CPF money on speculation in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshares  as most individuals are not market-savvy or  have\r\n\r\nno  time  or  skills to keep track of  movements  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, therefore, to ask if it would be better to\r\n\r\nconfine  the purchase of shares through unit  trusts  or,\r\n\r\nbetter  still,  just  allow investments  in  the  private\r\n\r\npension  funds where there are professional  managers  to\r\n\r\nkeep track and manage the funds or the unit trusts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the new measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.  I\r\n\r\nhave a few points to highlight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a need to better communicate the\r\n\r\nintentions  and the objectives of the policy shifts  that\r\n\r\nare being proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed CPF and HDB loan changes have far-reaching consequences. It signals a fundamental shift in\r\n\r\nthe  way individuals base their decisions as well as  how\r\n\r\ninstitutions, especially the financial institutions, have\r\n\r\nto adjust to the new rules of the game, ie, be it tapping\r\n\r\ninto the CPF market or HDB loan market.  To this end,  we\r\n\r\nhave heard that the vested parties, meaning the banks and\r\n\r\nthe  fund managers, have been actively exploring and  re-modelling their business plans in order to maximise their\r\n\r\ngains  and  minimise their losses in the sea  of  change.\r\n\r\nBut, what about the individuals?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many individuals I spoke to appear to be quite\r\n\r\nnonchalant  about some of the proposed  changes.   Except\r\n\r\nissues with immediate or obvious impact, many people paid\r\n\r\nlittle  attention  to  the rest of the  proposed  changes\r\n\r\neither  because  they  did not  understand  or  feel  the\r\n\r\nimpact,  or  were not aware of the issues  at  hand.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  I  would  like  to  urge the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authority to consider mounting an  \"inform  and\r\n\r\neducate\" campaign to better inform Singaporeans of:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the intentions or the rationale behind the\r\n\r\nproposed changes, so as to achieve a greater buy-in;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the changes and their related consequences,\r\n\r\nwhether they are immediate or long-term; and,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) what are some of the coping mechanisms\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes proposed may have genuinely good\r\n\r\nintentions.   However,  given the  current  public  mood,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  somewhat  sceptical  and  negative,  any  good\r\n\r\nintentions  may be wrongfully misinterpreted  and  suffer\r\n\r\ndire  consequences.  Like a good father who does what  is\r\n\r\nright  for his children, our Government must do  more  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate and achieve a greater buy-in from the people.\r\n\r\nUnited, we stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, who are the intended beneficiaries of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed changes?  Ultimately, I believe it must  be\r\n\r\nthe  people - our Singaporeans.  But, no one policy would\r\n\r\nsatisfy  all.   Hence,  it is believed  that  with  these\r\n\r\nchanges, the economy will become more competitive and our\r\n\r\npeople will benefit in the long term.  However, to  quote\r\n\r\nthe  famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, \"In the  long\r\n\r\nterm, we are all dead.\"  Hence, while we make changes for\r\n\r\nlong-term  benefit, we must also urge our  Government  to\r\n\r\nintervene  to provide short-term and medium-term  reliefs\r\n\r\nand stimulus.  To this end, our Government has done so in\r\n\r\nthe economic arena.  However, our economy is built on our\r\n\r\npeople  and,  therefore, we should  also  then  turn  our\r\n\r\nattention to the people, and focus on the group of people\r\n\r\nwho  are  most  immediately affected  by  these  proposed\r\n\r\nchanges.  These people would include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the 50-55 years old or, in fact, when the policy\r\n\r\nkicks in in about three years' time, the 48-51 years  old\r\n\r\ntoday;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the group of people who are also affected by the\r\n\r\nlowering of the income ceiling for CPF contribution; and,\r\n\r\nof course\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) the group of people who are hit by this double\r\n\r\nwhammy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask: who are these people? Has\r\n\r\nthere been a detailed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprofiling of these people who would be affected by  these\r\n\r\nchanges?   Can we commission a study to enable  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of their needs, and how to help them?  Some\r\n\r\nquick areas of concern would be:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) what is their average income?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) what is their average loan repayment per month - whether it is mortgage or car loans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) what is their consumption pattern like; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) what is the average age of their children - are\r\n\r\ntheir  children financially independent or  are  they  of\r\n\r\nschool  or university-going age where financial resources\r\n\r\nare most needed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when we can better understand the demands and\r\n\r\nprofile of these affected cohorts of people, can we  then\r\n\r\ndesign help that is relevant and helpful and effective to\r\n\r\nthem.   Hence, since the intended beneficiaries  are  our\r\n\r\nfellow  Singaporeans,  let us hear  them,  see  them  and\r\n\r\nbetter understand their needs from a human angle, and not\r\n\r\njust mere statistics on a Government chart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Es - Empower, Enhance and Enable\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I think there is also a need not just to\r\n\r\nempower  the  people  but  to  enable  and  enhance   the\r\n\r\nindividuals' ability to look after themselves,  at  least\r\n\r\nfinancially.  I am in full agreement with the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nempowering  the  people  and moving  the  decision-making\r\n\r\nprocess  to  individuals.  With the proposed lowering  of\r\n\r\nthe   income  ceiling  from  $6,000  to  $5,000  for  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution and the raising of the income floor for  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  from between $200-$363  to  between  $500-$750,  there will be an increase in the disposable income\r\n\r\nof  the  people, as we put more cash in the hands of  the\r\n\r\nindividuals.  This is a good move, only IF we can  safely\r\n\r\nassume that people are generally financially savvy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare my interest here. As a\r\n\r\nfinancial  consultant who has seen  clients  directly  as\r\n\r\nwell  as trained hundreds of financial advisers,  I  find\r\n\r\nthe  financial literacy rate in Singapore  to  be  rather\r\n\r\nlow,  despite our high income.  Perhaps over  the  years,\r\n\r\nwe,  as a nation and as individuals, have acquired income\r\n\r\nand  wealth at an accelerated pace, and we have not  paid\r\n\r\nmuch  attention to financial education to help us  better\r\n\r\nmanage our hard-earned resources.  Sir, man has two legs,\r\n\r\nbut  the creature called \"money\" has four legs, two wings\r\n\r\nand  perhaps, in the IT age, a super-jet as well.  Hence,\r\n\r\nunless  we learn to better manage our resources, we  will\r\n\r\nalways   be  giving  endless  chase  to  money  and   the\r\n\r\nincreasing cost of living.  For some, they will always be\r\n\r\nin the phenomenon called \"Money No Enough\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for Singaporeans who are affected by the\r\n\r\nlowering  of the CPF contribution at age 50-55 and  those\r\n\r\nwhose mortgage loan repayment quantum may be affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  changes, they may not even  get  over  the\r\n\r\ntransition  phase  that DPM Lee spoke about  yesterday  - unless conscious efforts are there to help them make wise\r\n\r\nadjustments   in  financial  decisions,   some   may   be\r\n\r\npermanently stuck.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we must go beyond empowerment of the\r\n\r\nindividuals    to    enable   the    people    to    make\r\n\r\nchoices/decisions whose consequence or desired outcome is\r\n\r\ncongruent  with  the action they are about  to  take.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to advocate that the Government put in place a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  system  to  help educate  Singaporeans  on\r\n\r\nfinancial  decisions,  and  this  should  not   be   mere\r\n\r\nfinancial calculations alone, but also take into  account\r\n\r\nindividual's financial goals and objectives.  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nadvocating  that the 3 Es - empowerment, enhancement  and\r\n\r\nenablement - be tackled holistically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the move from HDB origination market rate\r\n\r\nloans to bank origination market rate loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who move to bank loans currently, they may\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  lower  interest rate.  As  such,  many  people,\r\n\r\nespecially   those  who  are  suffering  from   financial\r\n\r\nhardship now, may be tempted to switch to a lower monthly\r\n\r\ninstalment  payment.  However, in the  larger  scheme  of\r\n\r\nthings,  as  many  of  my parliamentary  colleagues  have\r\n\r\nspoken, banks are driven by commercial motives and do not\r\n\r\nhave  a  social obligation to mortgagors.  The HDB versus\r\n\r\nprivate  banks'  treatment of  default  cases  is  vastly\r\n\r\ndifferent.   HDB has frequently exercised compassion  and\r\n\r\nput  in  place many schemes to help hardship  cases,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  reduced or delayed repayment  system,  re-calibration of loans, no penalty interest-only repayment,\r\n\r\nso  on  and so forth.  My fear is genuine hardship  cases\r\n\r\nmay  not  enjoy  the same privileges as those  under  HDB\r\n\r\nloans and be forced out of their homes more easily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some may say this policy may affect only a\r\n\r\nminority, the question is: should people unwittingly fall\r\n\r\ninto  this  negative financial situation and banks  force\r\n\r\nsell  their HDB flats, is there any measure put in  place\r\n\r\nto  help  provide  a roof over their  heads?   Given  the\r\n\r\nnucleus  family criterion that HDB imposes, many of  them\r\n\r\nwill  need a roof over an entire family's head to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  grandparents  are not  left  on  the  streets,\r\n\r\nchildren  can continue schooling and the adults can  also\r\n\r\nfocus   their  energy  and  effort  at  correcting  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  situation, so as to prevent it from  spreading\r\n\r\nto become a family and a social problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if we move HDB loans into the free\r\n\r\nmarket,  are  we  also ready to liberalise  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  HDB restrictions and move the guidelines  closer\r\n\r\nto the free market?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the loan restriction from 150% to 120%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I echo Minister Lim Boon Heng's point on this scheme\r\n\r\nsounding a little bit like the balloon scheme.   I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  a  very  good  move  to  restrict  loan  quantum.\r\n\r\nHowever, to put the payment and the burden of the payment\r\n\r\nat the back end itself does sound\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  remind me of the balloon car loan scheme  where  the\r\n\r\ncash  upfront  is minimal but the back end or  the  later\r\n\r\npart of the loan will eventually catch up with the debtor\r\n\r\nin  due  course,  especially if one  has  not  made  wise\r\n\r\ncalculations  of his ability to pay, or has miscalculated\r\n\r\nand  thought that he is going to be selling the  property\r\n\r\nin 10 years, or has not properly invested the money saved\r\n\r\nupfront  for  later repayment.  This is made  worse  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  asset devaluation, or when loan interest  rate\r\n\r\ncatches up.  One may then be forced to repay the loan  in\r\n\r\ncash sooner than the original calculation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, the relaxation of the 20% cash\r\n\r\ndownpayment on housing loan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk about over investment in\r\n\r\nthe  property  market and how CPF was used  to  fuel  all\r\n\r\nthese  bubbles, and talks about how escalating land  cost\r\n\r\nhas made Singapore uncompetitive.  This liberalisation of\r\n\r\n10%  downpayment in cash and 10% downpayment in CPF sends\r\n\r\na  mixed signal to the market and the people.  Is there a\r\n\r\nneed to cushion the impact of the changes on the property\r\n\r\nmarket?   Already there is a suspension of the  16th  May\r\n\r\n1996 anti-speculation capital gains tax on property.  Who\r\n\r\nare  we  helping  in this exercise of  lowering  the  20%\r\n\r\ndownpayment   in  cash?   I  hope  the  Government   will\r\n\r\nseriously reconsider this proposed change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I would like to register that\r\n\r\nthe CPF changes, on the whole, will benefit Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe  long term.  I hope that the Government would  better\r\n\r\ncommunicate  with the public, and also look  after  those\r\n\r\npeople who are directly affected, especially in the short\r\n\r\nand medium term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of the proposed changes to the CPF\r\n\r\nsystem, as described in the Ministerial speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since its inception, the CPF system has been\r\n\r\npart and parcel of the working\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlives  of all Singaporean workers.  The success  of  this\r\n\r\nsystem  is  greatly due to the fact that we  believe  its\r\n\r\nprinciples  and  concept.  It is a good system.   It  has\r\n\r\nserved  us  well. It is one of the basic  tenets  of  our\r\n\r\nsocial  security system.  As opposed to the  common  pool\r\n\r\nretirement   fund  systems  that  exist  in  many   other\r\n\r\ncountries,   our  CPF  system  is  based  on   individual\r\n\r\ncompulsory  savings  for  retirement  for  every  worker.\r\n\r\nThrough  CPF Board facilitation, thousands of our workers\r\n\r\nand their families are able to benefit from the fruits of\r\n\r\ntheir labours during their twilight years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when there were hints that the system was going\r\n\r\nto  be  reviewed, many were worried.  Understandably  so,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are comfortable with it and many  depend  on\r\n\r\ntheir CPF savings to purchase property and some use their\r\n\r\nCPF accounts to invest in stocks.  Naturally, the idea of\r\n\r\nthe Government tampering with something that works and is\r\n\r\nnot broken is unnerving and disturbing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also understand times have changed. We have\r\n\r\njust  gotten through the worst economic recession of  our\r\n\r\nshort history and we are still not out of the woods.  The\r\n\r\nworld  and the regional economic landscape have  changed.\r\n\r\nTight  labour  market and full employment  that  we  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed  for  many years are no longer the order  of  the\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a relief that after lots of speculations,\r\n\r\ndiscussions and consultations that have taken place, here\r\n\r\nwe are and the ERC has spoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic, Sir, is very important and it touches\r\n\r\nacross  the  whole strata of our population.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  it  has been handled very, very well and it  speaks\r\n\r\nvery  well for ERC.  It has managed to get the  views  of\r\n\r\nthe    stakeholders   and   the   masses    before    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are made.  I believe  that  the  workers\r\n\r\nunderstand  that some of these changes are necessary  and\r\n\r\nthat  we have to do it, no matter how painful it is going\r\n\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I can assure you that there are many out\r\n\r\nthere who still do not understand how these changes  will\r\n\r\nhave an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact  on  their  lives.   Many  are  just  hoping  that\r\n\r\npositive  change will come about.  We should continue  to\r\n\r\nengage  the  people  and  get their  views  because  this\r\n\r\nprocess of communications and consultations will minimise\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.   Naturally,  there  will   always   be\r\n\r\ndisgruntled  people  who will be bitter  and  cynical  of\r\n\r\nwhatever effort that we intend to do, or change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we ponder upon the means and\r\n\r\nways  to  make these changes and adapt, there are several\r\n\r\nissues  which,  I believe, I can highlight which  deserve\r\n\r\nsome attention from the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our older workers are constantly grappling with\r\n\r\nrapid  changes  and the need to acquire  new  skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge.  Many of them are struggling and some of  them\r\n\r\nare  resisting these changes.  Now, we are  telling  them\r\n\r\nthat their CPF is going to be affected.  How then can  we\r\n\r\nassist  them to manage this change?  Can we be sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  CPF  change will  help  them  to  be  more\r\n\r\nemployable?  As it is, Sir, many have tried to re-profile\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  acquire new skills, but yet  they  still\r\n\r\nstruggle  to get new jobs.  We know that it is not  going\r\n\r\nto  be easy to assess how effective this measure is going\r\n\r\nto  be,  but  we are surely going to be judged  for  this\r\n\r\ndecision.  So let us not make it more painful and  assure\r\n\r\nthose  who fall under the age bracket of 50-55 years  and\r\n\r\nare  directly affected by this change that, if they  need\r\n\r\nhelp, the help is there for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard for many years now that there\r\n\r\nneeds  to be a change in mindset towards the way  we  pay\r\n\r\nour  workers,  that  is, we should  move  away  from  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based  wage system and move towards  the  task-based and performance-based system, irrespective of  age.\r\n\r\nThe  progress  has  been slow.  Many  Members,  union  or\r\n\r\notherwise, have lamented in this Chamber of the slow take-up  rate  from the private sector.  I believe  we  should\r\n\r\nseriously look into how this could be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the seniority-based wage system is\r\n\r\nso  entrenched and rooted in our economy that, I believe,\r\n\r\nmaybe evolution is not enough, but rather a revolution is\r\n\r\nwhat we should start.  May I be bold to suggest that  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service, as the largest employer, should lead  the\r\n\r\nway  and revamp its wage system, rather than making minor\r\n\r\nchanges here and there?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the initiative to allow CPF members to invest\r\n\r\nin  approved  private pension funds  is  laudable.   This\r\n\r\ngives  the  workers opportunity to decide on  alternative\r\n\r\nschemes.  They should be responsible for their retirement\r\n\r\nand  if they feel that the returns from the pension funds\r\n\r\nare better and thus enhancing their safety net, so be it.\r\n\r\nMy  only concern is for the workers to be informed of the\r\n\r\npros  and  cons of such schemes.  Let them make  informed\r\n\r\nchoices and be responsible for their choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the move to fine-tune\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  system, and I believe that it is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprepare ourselves for future challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for allowing me to join in the debate on the  motion\r\n\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new CPF measures for workers above 50 years of\r\n\r\nage  will  surely have the effect of flattening the  wage\r\n\r\npyramid  for  employers,  as many  are  still  using  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based   system  for  a  variety   of   reasons.\r\n\r\nAlthough  many  may say that this is but a small  gesture\r\n\r\nand  that few jobs will actually be saved, I think we are\r\n\r\nmaking  an  important signal to investors  and  employers\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is  serious about remaining  competitive\r\n\r\nwhen addressing total wage cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao yesterday brought up statistics to\r\n\r\nshow that it was the older workers who are more likely to\r\n\r\nbe retrenched as companies restructure to face lean times\r\n\r\nahead.   So this measure is about helping to ensure  that\r\n\r\nolder workers will be able to keep their jobs for as long\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  possible while pursuing retraining, a second  career,\r\n\r\nor  new business of their own.  We want our people to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  be entrepreneurs.  But if we ask,  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  many of them would only have assets, the HDB  flat.\r\n\r\nWe  may then need to be prepared to provide large amounts\r\n\r\nof  rental  housing again, if Singaporeans,  having  lost\r\n\r\ntheir flats through business failure, are not to be  left\r\n\r\nto  fend  for  themselves  in  the  streets.   I  support\r\n\r\nsuggestions  that  will reduce the amounts  available  to\r\n\r\nservice housing loans through the CPF, and that is a good\r\n\r\nthing, because there is currently a temptation to upgrade\r\n\r\nto  a  housing unit that one can ill afford.   This  move\r\n\r\ntowards  making commercial loans for those who  have  had\r\n\r\ntwo  or  more subsidised housing opportunities  from  HDB\r\n\r\nwould  force people to consider carefully if  they  could\r\n\r\nreally  afford  their fancy new home, or their  expensive\r\n\r\nrenovation loan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans are having smaller families and\r\n\r\nthe  traditional  support system based  on  the  extended\r\n\r\nfamily  can  no longer be relied on.  We have  been  told\r\n\r\nthat  many  Singaporeans will be retiring with less  than\r\n\r\nhalf the recommended Minimum Sum of $80,000 in their  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts  and this situation will certainly continue  for\r\n\r\nmany  years.  For many of these Singaporeans, their  main\r\n\r\nasset  in old age is the HDB flat.  I hope the Government\r\n\r\nwould  consider revising some of the HDB policies, as  Ms\r\n\r\nIrene  Ng  has said, so that these people will  not  face\r\n\r\nunnecessary  obstacles in monetising the  last  asset  to\r\n\r\nsupport themselves in their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote you an example. I recently met a 73-year old man at one of our meet-the-people sessions. He\r\n\r\ntold me that he had been trying, without success, to sell\r\n\r\nhis  4-room flat for the last two years.  He had  been  a\r\n\r\nskilled  workman,  had led a frugal  lifestyle,  but  had\r\n\r\nexhausted  his  CPF  savings in  helping  to  look  after\r\n\r\nhimself  and  two  elderly and sickly siblings.   As  the\r\n\r\nsiblings  have bought a 4-room flat less than five  years\r\n\r\nago,  they would be ineligible for rental flat  had  they\r\n\r\nsold the flat, and they would also not have been able  to\r\n\r\nbuy a resale 3-room flat on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopen  market  after  paying back  HDB  for  their  rental\r\n\r\narrears.   These people were desperate because there  was\r\n\r\nno  way  that these three 70-year-old people  would  have\r\n\r\ngotten a commercial loan.  They also had less than $1,000\r\n\r\nleft in their CPF at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would need to consider making reverse\r\n\r\nmortgages  on HDB flats and easier option, or furthermore\r\n\r\nto   tweak   policies   meant  to   discourage   property\r\n\r\nspeculation,  such that they would not pose problems  for\r\n\r\nelderly   people  such  as  these.   The   move   towards\r\n\r\ncommercial  loans  for third time HDB flat  buyers  would\r\n\r\ninitially  not affect the majority of HDB flat  dwellers.\r\n\r\nBut,  I  think, as many Members do, the commercial  banks\r\n\r\nwill  never  be as generous as HDB in dealing with  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  difficulty in servicing their  housing  loans.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, HDB would need to revisit again this business of\r\n\r\nproviding   basic   rental   housing,   whether   heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised or not, to those people who need to  cash  out\r\n\r\ntheir  flats due to inadequate CPF savings, or  to  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  lost  their  flats  due  to  retrenchment,  or\r\n\r\nbusiness failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is that the Government should also not\r\n\r\nforget  those who have very little by way of CPF  because\r\n\r\nthey  are petty traders, or they are self-employed,  like\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers.  Some of these people have come to see  me\r\n\r\nsaying  that as they did not even have enough spare  cash\r\n\r\nto  put  into  their  Medisave accounts  and  keep  their\r\n\r\ncontributions  up  to  date,  they  faced  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nrenewing their licences to operate as petty traders.  For\r\n\r\nthese  people,  surely we must find a way  to  help  them\r\n\r\nbecause if they, at this point in time, do not even  have\r\n\r\nthe  means  to pursue their trades and their occupations,\r\n\r\nthey really feel that they are at their road's end.   For\r\n\r\nthis  group  of people, how can the current CPF  measures\r\n\r\nhelp  them?  I hope that the ERC and the Government  will\r\n\r\nalso  consider the plight of these low wage  earners  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  really no business in their  shops  and\r\n\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproposed  changes in the Deputy Prime Minister's  speech.\r\n\r\nHowever, like some of my colleagues before me, I wish  to\r\n\r\nexpress  some concerns, specifically in relation  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket rate loans for HDB flats.  Some of my points  have\r\n\r\nbeen raised by my colleagues earlier, but I still wish to\r\n\r\nreiterate one or two salient points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, among those people who wish to take market\r\n\r\nrate loans in the purchase of HDB flats, many of them are\r\n\r\nfully aware of the implications and ramifications of bank\r\n\r\nloans.  Many, I believe, are not fully aware of the terms\r\n\r\nwith regard to forced closure, how and when they operate.\r\n\r\nMany are not aware that banks normally have the right  to\r\n\r\nutilise the accounts of the borrowers held in the lending\r\n\r\nbanks.   Many also are not fully aware of the quantum  of\r\n\r\nprincipal  and  interest  in their  monthly  instalments,\r\n\r\ncoming to an unpleasant surprise whenever they come to  a\r\n\r\nstage when they wish to redeem the loans.  There will  be\r\n\r\nthose  who  will  find  themselves  in  these  unpleasant\r\n\r\nsituations, and the problem is that when they come to  it\r\n\r\nthey are not prepared for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is another group of people who, even\r\n\r\nif  they are aware of these terms and conditions, do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  financial nimbleness or capacity  to  overcome\r\n\r\nthem.   We can say that they have a choice - if they  are\r\n\r\nfully  aware of the pitfalls of bank loans, then  do  not\r\n\r\ntake bank loans, do not buy a flat.  This is not really a\r\n\r\nchoice, for owning an HDB flat is really almost akin,  at\r\n\r\nleast in Singapore, to the basic need of having a shelter\r\n\r\nfor  one's family and oneself.  For this group of people,\r\n\r\nit  is  not exactly a real choice to say, \"Do not  borrow\r\n\r\nfrom  a  bank.\"   These are also the same  ones  who  are\r\n\r\nhardest  hit  during  a  macro economic  downturn  or  an\r\n\r\nindividual financial setback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what happens when they default on their housing\r\n\r\npayments?   This  brings me to my third  point,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nreadiness  of banks to meet financial hardship defaulters\r\n\r\nhalfway.   This  point  has been raised  by  some  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLet  me  just reiterate my agreement with it,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  difference  in  approach,  attitude  and  philosophy\r\n\r\nbetween  the  HDB as a lender, and banks as lenders.   It\r\n\r\ncan be argued that the right of the bank to foreclose, to\r\n\r\ntake  legal action, is the same as the rights of the  HDB\r\n\r\npresently.   Therefore, the argument is that the  rights,\r\n\r\nduties and obligations of HDB flat owners, ie, borrowers,\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis  the  banks  after 2003 are  the  same  as  the\r\n\r\nrights, duties and obligations of HDB flat owners now vis-a-vis the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legally, that is correct. But only legally,\r\n\r\nbecause,  actually, it is different.  The difference  has\r\n\r\nbeen   enunciated  quite  eloquently  by  my   colleagues\r\n\r\nearlier,  but  the main difference arises from  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  HDB  has a social mission.  In my  very  short\r\n\r\nstint  in  this  House, I have heard the  Minister  state\r\n\r\nclearly  that  the  role  and function  of  the  HDB  is,\r\n\r\nprimarily,  to provide basic housing to all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nat  affordable  prices.  And even  when  HDB  acts  as  a\r\n\r\nlender,   we   see  this  reflected  in  their   actions.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when we have defaulters as  a  result  of  an\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn,  we have the HDB  bending  backwards,\r\n\r\nsideways,   forwards,   in  all   directions,   to   help\r\n\r\naccommodate the awkward positions that the HDB flat owner\r\n\r\nis in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine, even as I speak now, one HDB officer\r\n\r\npaying  attention to a HDB flat owner, trying to  give  a\r\n\r\nproposal  that would work out for him, either a deferment\r\n\r\nof  monthly  payments or an extension of  housing  loans,\r\n\r\nthereby  reducing monthly quantum sums.  Try as  I  might\r\n\r\nvery hard, it is quite difficult for me to imagine a bank\r\n\r\nofficer  doing the same thing.  This is not  to  put  any\r\n\r\nblame on the banks.  It is in the nature of banks to  run\r\n\r\non a commercial basis, and a purely commercial one.  They\r\n\r\nhave  to answer to their shareholders.  Profit making  is\r\n\r\ntheir  bottom  line.  If there are loan defaulters,  bank\r\n\r\nofficers will have to answer to their shareholders, \"What\r\n\r\nactions  have  you  taken?\"  There is,  therefore,  great\r\n\r\npressure  on  banks, in the case of defaulters,  to  take\r\n\r\naction, file writs of summonses, enter judgments, enforce\r\n\r\njudgments, ie, to foreclose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I appreciate the rationale for\r\n\r\nthe  changes  that are proposed by the Hon. Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, one of which is to enable the HDB to  focus  on\r\n\r\nits  core role.  I also understand that these changes are\r\n\r\nin line with the desire to allow commercial transactions,\r\n\r\nincluding property loans, to be governed more and more by\r\n\r\nthe  forces  of the free market.  This also accords  with\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  prepare Singaporeans for the new  economy.\r\n\r\nThe  changes  also  would jolt ordinary  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that, ultimately, they cannot rely on  statutory\r\n\r\nboards as another safety net or source of security.   But\r\n\r\nwe, Singaporeans, ourselves, have to plan and prepare for\r\n\r\nour own future and security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree with these changes, in view of\r\n\r\nthe concerns that I have raised, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider embarking  on  a  very  thorough\r\n\r\npublic education programme on the changes - not only what\r\n\r\nthey  are,  but  what  they imply, the  ramifications  of\r\n\r\nloans,  as I mentioned earlier - what they actually  mean\r\n\r\nto  those people who take loans, eg, the usual terms that\r\n\r\nbanks   would   normally  apply.   I  believe   my   hon.\r\n\r\ncolleagues, Ms Irene Ng and Miss Penny Low, have  alluded\r\n\r\nto this prior to my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would also urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\nallowing some of these buyers to still obtain market-rate\r\n\r\nloans  from the HDB after 2003.  There can be  a  cap  on\r\n\r\ntheir income or a cap on the amount of loan that they can\r\n\r\ntake,  in  order to prevent abuse.  Perhaps, we can  also\r\n\r\nput  a cap on this break period, say, until 2006 or 2008.\r\n\r\nThe  idea  is  to  soften the otherwise  abrupt  learning\r\n\r\ncurve.  I think this would go a long way to help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, save for the concerns I have mentioned, I\r\n\r\nsupport the proposed changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  my opinion, the title of the just-released report  by\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  Sub-Committee on CPF and  Wages  is  most  apt.\r\n\r\n\"Refocusing the CPF system\" is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  bold call for the system to return to its basics.   It\r\n\r\nwas  originally  conceived  as  a  compulsory  retirement\r\n\r\nsavings  scheme.  Requiring both employers and  employees\r\n\r\nto   participate   helps  the  workers   accelerate   the\r\n\r\naccumulation  of  retirement  resources,  and  make   the\r\n\r\nemployer an indispensable part of the workers' retirement\r\n\r\nplans.   The  CPF  system  has served  the  nation  well.\r\n\r\nHowever,   over   the  years,  the   system   has   grown\r\n\r\nconsiderably in complexity, as its role crept outwards to\r\n\r\ninclude housing, healthcare, and even as a macro economic\r\n\r\nmanagement  tool.  It is time for the CPF to strip  clean\r\n\r\nof the clutter accumulated over the years and re-focus on\r\n\r\nits  core  objectives.   In some ways,  for  the  average\r\n\r\nworkers, the CPF system is also a deferred social  safety\r\n\r\nnet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated goals of the refocusing exercise are:\r\n\r\nensuring    adequate   retirement   resources,   reducing\r\n\r\nexcessive   consumption,  and  promoting  labour   market\r\n\r\nflexibility.  The unstated goals, as some observers  have\r\n\r\npointed  out,  seem  to  be that of  encouraging  greater\r\n\r\npersonal  choice.  An increasingly capitalistic  approach\r\n\r\nis  being  taken.   The  safety  nets  are  being  slowly\r\n\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the principle of personal choice and\r\n\r\naccountability,  but would urge that  this  principle  be\r\n\r\ntempered by special consideration of the lowest 10th  or,\r\n\r\nindeed, perhaps even the lowest 20th income percentile of\r\n\r\nthe  population who are more vulnerable and who are  less\r\n\r\nable  to  make the best choices for themselves.  We  need\r\n\r\ncapitalism,  doused with a great deal of  compassion  for\r\n\r\nthe less able.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, whilst I support the spirit and\r\n\r\nessence  of  taking the CPF back to basics,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to apply a gentle hand and move gradually  in\r\n\r\nimplementing the changes to the system.  I note that this\r\n\r\nis  indeed the tone of the Government's response  to  the\r\n\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to three areas of the ERC report and\r\n\r\nthe Minister's response which I wish to comment on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Retirement adequacy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support raising of the Minimum Sum, higher\r\n\r\ncontributions  to the Special Account, Medisave  Account,\r\n\r\nand the need to take a long-term view of CPF, instead  of\r\n\r\nrelying  on  it  as  a  counter-cyclical  macro  economic\r\n\r\nstabilisation tool.  In so far as property investment  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I am pleased to note that the report offers  a\r\n\r\nvery  balanced and circumspect view.  While pointing  out\r\n\r\nthe  dangers  of  over-consumption, it  does  not  vilify\r\n\r\nproperty investment per se.  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is rational and sensible for Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  property.  Not only does this  provide  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  a roof over their heads, it also gives  them  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial asset that offers added financial security in\r\n\r\nretirement.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this statement rightly puts in perspective the\r\n\r\nfact  that property investment per se is not the  villain\r\n\r\nit  is  made  out  to  be for our  current  woes,  as  is\r\n\r\nfashionable to allude to nowadays.  On the positive side,\r\n\r\nmany  economists  have recently pointed out  that  rising\r\n\r\nhouse  prices  in the US and Europe are helping  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  economies afloat after the battering  their  stock\r\n\r\nmarkets have received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, it is really our greed, our\r\n\r\noftentimes  misplaced optimism, \"irrational  exuberance\",\r\n\r\nthat  property prices will keep heading north  that  have\r\n\r\ncaused  many  to  over-invest in property.   Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nstock market is more famously irrationally exuberant than\r\n\r\nproperty.   It is true, however, that current  CPF  rules\r\n\r\nhave exacerbated the problem, and the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Sub-Committee and the Government's response will  go\r\n\r\nsome way to reverse the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report points out - correctly in my view - the need to have more flexibility to be able to convert\r\n\r\nthe  property asset into cash during a person's  twilight\r\n\r\nyears.   Like the authors of the report, I would like  to\r\n\r\nurge the Government to explore more exhaustively ways and\r\n\r\nmeans to monetise a person's housing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassets,  to  enable  that person to enjoy  as  reasonably\r\n\r\ncomfortable a retirement as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least three possibilities have been mentioned in\r\n\r\nthe  report,  which I wish to comment  on  briefly.   The\r\n\r\nbasic  point  I wish to make is that, presently,  various\r\n\r\nobstacles     hinder    monetisation    through     these\r\n\r\npossibilities, and several HDB rules will have to be  re-evaluated  and changed for the possibilities  highlighted\r\n\r\nto be workable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Subletting</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, subletting of the entire HDB flat by\r\n\r\nelderly  lessees to augment their retirement  savings  is\r\n\r\nsubject to various criteria, which are that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the lessees must be aged 65 years and above;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) they must be living in a 3-room or smaller flat;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) they must have occupied their flat for at least\r\n\r\n25 years; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) they must have no outstanding mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel these restrictions are stringent and\r\n\r\nseriously  inhibit  the  ability of  elderly  lessees  to\r\n\r\nsublet   their  entire  flat  for  additional  retirement\r\n\r\nincome.  Based on the current set of restrictions, only a\r\n\r\nhandful  of  retirees will be able to make  use  of  this\r\n\r\navenue to augment their retirement income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the current retirement age is 60 years,\r\n\r\nas  well  as the fact that more may be forced  to  retire\r\n\r\nearly  due to structural unemployment, we should consider\r\n\r\nlowering  the minimum age requirement from 65  years  to,\r\n\r\nsay, 60 or 55 years old.  Furthermore, subletting of  the\r\n\r\nentire  flat  should  not  be allowed  only  for  elderly\r\n\r\nlessees of 3-room or smaller flats.  Rather, it should be\r\n\r\nopen  to  all retirees, whether they live in a 3-room  or\r\n\r\nbigger flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for a start, to prevent abuse, this could\r\n\r\nbe liberalised to include both\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n3-  and 4-room flats.  As the scheme stabilises, it could\r\n\r\nbe  extended  to  bigger flat types.   This  would  allow\r\n\r\nretirees  greater  and freer choice in  monetising  their\r\n\r\nassets for old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the objective is to allow retirees to augment\r\n\r\ntheir  income by subletting their HDB flat,  if  they  so\r\n\r\nwish,  the  restriction that they must have occupied  the\r\n\r\nflat  for  at least 25 years and that they must  have  no\r\n\r\noutstanding mortgage loan are not only onerous  but  also\r\n\r\nappear  superfluous.  The rationale for  these  stringent\r\n\r\nconditions appears to be a concern that public  funds  to\r\n\r\nbuild subsidised flats for their owners are being used to\r\n\r\nhelp  lessees  generate income.  Since  subletting  of  a\r\n\r\nwhole  flat is, in this case, only allowed for  retirees,\r\n\r\nthe worry of such a public outcry is unfounded.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reverse mortgage</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, reverse mortgage. In concept, reverse\r\n\r\nmortgage is a useful device.  However, there are risks to\r\n\r\nthe  financial institutions offering it.  Properties with\r\n\r\nan  ageing lease will be hard to dispose of in the  event\r\n\r\nof  default,  especially given that CPF itself  currently\r\n\r\ndoes  not  allow withdrawals for properties  with  leases\r\n\r\nshorter  than  60  years.  Pricing those  risks  properly\r\n\r\nwould  imply  a relatively high interest rate,  but  this\r\n\r\nmeans  a double whammy - low valuation plus high cost  of\r\n\r\nservicing the loan through lower annuity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the reason why reverse mortgage\r\n\r\nremains  unpopular,  with only NTUC Income  offering  the\r\n\r\nscheme  for  private  properties  and  with  few  takers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, current reverse mortgage proposals are for a\r\n\r\nfixed  term  of,  say,  10 years.  This  means  that  the\r\n\r\nproperty  owner faces the risk of losing his property  if\r\n\r\nhe  is  unable  to  pay the reverse  mortgage  loan  with\r\n\r\ninterest  at  the end of the term.  This is a significant\r\n\r\ndrawback of reverse mortgage today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, in view of the need to allow more ways\r\n\r\nfor  retirees to monetise their assets, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development could and should explore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvarious  reverse  mortgage  schemes  together  with   the\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions for the benefit of HDB lessees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Downgrading</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elderly HDB flat lessees could also monetise the\r\n\r\nvalue of their HDB flat by downgrading either to a rental\r\n\r\nor  to  a  smaller  flat.  However, there  are  currently\r\n\r\nseveral impediments for them to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, current HDB rules only allow low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies  with  a household income of $800  or  less  per\r\n\r\nmonth  to rent HDB flats.  This rule for rental HDB flats\r\n\r\nwould   have  to  be  relaxed  to  accommodate  a   wider\r\n\r\npopulation of elderly lessees to rent a flat, instead  of\r\n\r\npurchasing  a smaller flat.  Renting is pure  consumption\r\n\r\nand  for  the  elderly, this should not  be  a  cause  of\r\n\r\nconcern for policy makers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC report notes that presently, every two out\r\n\r\nof  three  elderly households live in 3-room  or  smaller\r\n\r\nflats and have no smaller accommodation to downgrade  to.\r\n\r\nThis  would limit the number of elderly HDB flat  lessees\r\n\r\nwho  can  sell  their existing flat and  downgrade  to  a\r\n\r\nsmaller flat.  Such residents could perhaps downgrade  to\r\n\r\nstudio  apartments. To facilitate this avenue for elderly\r\n\r\nflat  lessees  to  monetise their properties,  HDB  could\r\n\r\nconsider building more studio apartments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the ERC report notes that only 3.6% of\r\n\r\nelderly  living in HDB flats have downgraded  to  smaller\r\n\r\nflats and hence, downgrading by the elderly to unlock the\r\n\r\nvalue   of  their  assets  could  require  a  significant\r\n\r\nbehavourial  change.   Indeed,  most  elderly  do   value\r\n\r\nstability more than many other things.  Familiarity  with\r\n\r\nthe  ground, community ties painstakingly built  up  over\r\n\r\nthe years are especially hard to break.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own experience with collective sales of older\r\n\r\nproperties  bears  this out, with some elderly  residents\r\n\r\nsaying  that  they would rather die in their  matrimonial\r\n\r\nhome  or  from where they have lived most of their  life,\r\n\r\nthan to become a multi-millionaire.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know of a colleague whose widowed mother is\r\n\r\nliving all alone in a 5-room HDB flat and refuses to move\r\n\r\nout  to  a smaller flat despite repeated advice from  her\r\n\r\nchildren.   One  way to mitigate this  problem  and  make\r\n\r\ndowngrading  more attractive to elderly  residents  would\r\n\r\nperhaps be to build more studio apartments in areas where\r\n\r\nthere  are  high concentrations of the elderly,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  would at least be able to move to another  flat  in\r\n\r\nthe same neighbourhood which they are familiar with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Home ownership</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is the impact of\r\n\r\nthe ERC Sub-Committee's recommendation on home ownership.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been  a chorus of concerns  about  the  over-investment  problem  and fears that  retirement  adequacy\r\n\r\nwill be compromised by it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure to curb this is the 150% valuation limit\r\n\r\non   the  use  of  CPF  funds  for  purchase  of  private\r\n\r\nproperties  and  HDB  flats with  bank-originated  loans.\r\n\r\nOver  a  period of five years, this will gradually reduce\r\n\r\nto 120%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has revealed that even at 120%, most\r\n\r\nhome  buyers should still be able to use their CPF  funds\r\n\r\nwithout  having  to  resort to cash top-up  for  some  19\r\n\r\nyears.   Enough  has already been said by the  media  and\r\n\r\nmarket  watchers to lead me to conclude  that  this  will\r\n\r\nhave  minimal impact on the property market in the short-term and that it will help to prevent over-investment  in\r\n\r\nproperties.  Notwithstanding this, the Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState  for  Trade and Industry has noted  that  this  cap\r\n\r\ncould be further reduced in the future.  I would urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to carefully assess the ramifications  of  any\r\n\r\nfurther future cuts before implementation in order not to\r\n\r\nunduly destabilise the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to briefly comment on the\r\n\r\nMinister's  announcement that from next  year,  HDB  flat\r\n\r\npurchasers  who  are  not  eligible  for  HDB  subsidised\r\n\r\ninterest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrate  loans  would  have to obtain their  financing  from\r\n\r\nbanks.   Again,  this seems to be a case  of  encouraging\r\n\r\ngreater  personal  choice and accountability  by  pulling\r\n\r\nback  some  of  the  safety nets put  in  place  earlier.\r\n\r\nHowever well meaning as these changes are intended to be,\r\n\r\nthey  would  bring considerable anxiety to purchasers  of\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  who  are  not eligible for subsidised  loans.\r\n\r\nThis is because they will fear that the commercial banks,\r\n\r\nwho  are  bottom  line  driven,  will  not  hesitate   to\r\n\r\nforeclose  on the flat, if they are delinquent  in  their\r\n\r\ndebt servicing.  For many, the HDB flat could be the only\r\n\r\nroof over their heads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues have alluded to, HDB currently has\r\n\r\na  number of assistance schemes, such as deferred payment\r\n\r\nand  temporary reduction of debt service to help HDB flat\r\n\r\nlessees affected by the economic downturn.  On the  other\r\n\r\nhand, commercial banks are under no compulsion to provide\r\n\r\nsuch assistance, nor are they expected to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree with the broad principle that HDB\r\n\r\nshould focus only on basic housing needs and there should\r\n\r\nbe  more  personal  responsibility  of  one's  investment\r\n\r\ndecision,   it  is  important  that  this   be   properly\r\n\r\ncommunicated to the broad population and their  anxieties\r\n\r\nallayed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks, for instance, could be asked to give\r\n\r\nassurance  that  for HDB purchasers, they  would  provide\r\n\r\nadequate moratorium periods and/or some deferred  payment\r\n\r\nschemes  for  a  period  of time  if  the  borrower  were\r\n\r\naffected  by  an  economic downturn and the  property  is\r\n\r\ntheir only home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the HDB could further assure the\r\n\r\npublic  that the home ownership policy is not compromised\r\n\r\nby  offering to step in, as the lessor, to work with  the\r\n\r\nbanks to assist affected homeowners in such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could also set up a special relief fund to\r\n\r\nassist such homeowners. This could be for a transitionary\r\n\r\nperiod of,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsay,  3 years until HDB flat buyers are more astute  with\r\n\r\nfinancial  planning and discipline and able to  do  their\r\n\r\nsums and adapt to the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing labour market flexibility</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC's proposal to cut employer's and employee's\r\n\r\nCPF contribution rate to 16% each for the age group of 50-55  years has, as many of my colleagues before me  noted,\r\n\r\nbrought on the loudest chorus of anguished protests among\r\n\r\nworkers.   It  is understandable, given that  many  feel,\r\n\r\nrightly  or  wrongly, that it is an indictment  of  their\r\n\r\neconomic  worth.   Many  are  also  skeptical  about  how\r\n\r\neffective  the CPF cuts could be in helping  to  preserve\r\n\r\njobs, as well as open new ones for this age group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worry, to paraphrase the Minister of State, Dr\r\n\r\nNg  Eng Hen, is not that the elderly have lost all  their\r\n\r\nvalue, but that their value is deemed diminished by  such\r\n\r\na move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is despite repeated assurances from Ministers\r\n\r\nand  the unions that the cut is not to be seen as a  wage\r\n\r\nreduction, or that their value is diminished, but  rather\r\n\r\nas  a means to inject some labour market flexibility  and\r\n\r\nis  only one amongst many measures aimed at improving the\r\n\r\nemployability of older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the bid to improve the overall\r\n\r\nemployability of older workers in the face of  persistent\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment.  In fact,  after  Minister  Lim\r\n\r\nBoon Heng's eloquent explanation of the rationale for the\r\n\r\nCPF  cut  for  this age group, I think it  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  me  to  argue  otherwise.   However,  the\r\n\r\nconcerns  and  arguments of this group  are  not  without\r\n\r\nmerit and should be addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate these concerns, suggestions have already\r\n\r\nbeen made to give older workers special treatment in  the\r\n\r\nnext wealth-sharing exercise, as well as paying deserving\r\n\r\nolder workers special bonuses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor introducing a monthly variable component in their wage\r\n\r\npackage.  Sir, I fervently support these proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I am also heartened to note that the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  has  taken  the  lead  by  introducing  a\r\n\r\nTransitional CPF Top-up Component for this age group when\r\n\r\nthe new rates are effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also join in the call for employers to move\r\n\r\ntowards   a  more  flexible  wage  system.   And   again,\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  call of Minister Lim Boon Heng,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to urge the Government and the statutory boards  to\r\n\r\ntake  the lead in this instance and introduce the base-up\r\n\r\nwage  system  wherever possible.  My fellow  MP  and  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Secretary-General of the NTUC, Mr  Matthias  Yao,\r\n\r\nhit  the  nail  on  the head when he said  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nyesterday, \"The real issue is not the CPF, and the  long-term  solution is not in the CPF.\"  Indeed, the  mindsets\r\n\r\nof  both  employers and employees must change to mitigate\r\n\r\nthe problem of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore applaud the ERC's well-thought out\r\n\r\nand   carefully  crafted  set  of  recommendations  which\r\n\r\nattempt  to remodel the CPF system and shed the  excesses\r\n\r\nand  clutter  it  had accumulated over  the  years.   The\r\n\r\npractical phased-in approach of the implementation  which\r\n\r\nallows people and institutions time to appreciate,  adapt\r\n\r\nand accept the change is welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the specifics of the report and the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  response,  lie  a  gradual  but  deliberate\r\n\r\nshrinking of the social safety net.  One ultimate  intent\r\n\r\nappears to be that of creating a more entrepreneurial and\r\n\r\nself-dependent culture, necessary for survival in the new\r\n\r\nworld  order. This is indeed a worthwhile goal, but  will\r\n\r\nno  doubt engender anxiety and disorientation among  many\r\n\r\nordinary citizens already reeling from the shock  of  one\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's worst recessions and painful  adjustments\r\n\r\nin jobs and cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to again urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to be even-handed in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of the proposed changes, as  well  as\r\n\r\nrefine  and  modify some of the proposals to address  the\r\n\r\nconcerns  raised.  Public servants at the front  desk  of\r\n\r\nthe various Government agencies, policy makers, my fellow\r\n\r\nMPs  and  I  myself would need to exercise  patience  and\r\n\r\nbalanced  judgement to hear the ground and take  time  to\r\n\r\ncarefully  communicate these changes and their rationale.\r\n\r\nIn  particular, I agree with my colleagues before me that\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to mount a public education campaign  of\r\n\r\nall these changes and their implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these, I support the Government's response\r\n\r\nto the ERC's recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

During the last  two\r\n\r\ndays, the bulk of the debate was on the immediate effects\r\n\r\nof the proposed changes.  Many Members spoke about the 4%\r\n\r\nreduction  of CPF contributions for those between  50-55.\r\n\r\nTo  me,  this cut is necessary. However, if the companies\r\n\r\nfeel  that this is unnecessary, then please pass  on  the\r\n\r\nsavings  to the workers as a variable component of  their\r\n\r\nsalaries, or as bonuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Chiam See Tong remarked that it\r\n\r\nappeared very strange to him because in the past  it  was\r\n\r\nalways  the  Opposition  that  was  asking  for  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates  to  be  cut,  and  now  it  is   the\r\n\r\nGovernment asking for the cut.  This is indeed a \"turn of\r\n\r\nthe tides\".  Everything seems to have changed, but he has\r\n\r\nnot  changed.  In fact, just some two months ago, he  was\r\n\r\ndebating  with me as to whether the CPF reduction  should\r\n\r\nbe  exercised.  I told him that the most important  thing\r\n\r\nwas  to keep the job.  If you have no job, why talk about\r\n\r\nCPF.   I  think we have to look at the long-term benefits\r\n\r\nof  the  proposed changes to the CPF system  rather  than\r\n\r\ntheir immediate effects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, this recommendation by the Economic\r\n\r\nReview Committee can be described as wei min licai,  fang\r\n\r\nyan jianglai (minding the people's wealth, and looking at\r\n\r\nthe  future).  What are our concerns?  We are looking  at\r\n\r\nan  aging  population.  Do we have enough to provide  for\r\n\r\nour  retirement?  Do we have enough funds for our medical\r\n\r\nexpenses? If the Minimum Sum is not enough, then how much\r\n\r\nis enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, many of our people are buying properties\r\n\r\nbeyond   their  means.  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang   mentioned\r\n\r\nyesterday that he agreed with the Government's policy  of\r\n\r\ngradually adjusting the CPF scheme.  In Parliament,  most\r\n\r\nof  the  time,  I could not agree with the arguments  put\r\n\r\nforward  by  Mr Low.  But on this occasion, I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim. I feel that he is speaking more and more like a  PAP\r\n\r\nMember, and I begin to wonder who the Opposition is now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Special Account, the proposal is to change\r\n\r\nfrom the 4-6-8% formula to a 5-7-9% formula. Mr Low wants\r\n\r\nto  propose a further change to 7-9-9-6, making it  a  4-digit formula.  Inspiration for the 4-D punters!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the financial crisis in 1997, many people\r\n\r\nthought  they  could  strike it rich  by  speculating  on\r\n\r\nproperty.   Now they get their fingers burnt,  and  their\r\n\r\nproperty  becomes a negative asset.  It is said  that  if\r\n\r\nyou speculate on property, you become\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  landlord because you cannot dispose of it and have  to\r\n\r\nhold  it.  Likewise, if you speculate on shares  and  get\r\n\r\ncaught  by a downturn in the share market, you  hold  the\r\n\r\nshares and become a \"share-holder\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may remember the \"Hello Kitty\" incident in\r\n\r\nSingapore some years ago.  Many people thought that  they\r\n\r\ncould  make  a lot of money by buying up all these  Hello\r\n\r\nKitty  toys offered by a fast-food chain.  They ended  up\r\n\r\nspending a lot of money buying stacks of hamburgers which\r\n\r\nthey  could not consume, and even landed up in court  for\r\n\r\ndisorderly behaviour while queueing up to purchase  these\r\n\r\nvalueless toys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, indeed, there are a lot of people in Singapore\r\n\r\nwho have a lot of money but do not know how to mind their\r\n\r\nwealth.   When  the  CPF  Board  relaxed  the  rules  for\r\n\r\nwithdrawal, they just spent their savings as though  they\r\n\r\nwere  not  their own money. They say it is gong  ji  jin,\r\n\r\ntherefore it is money accumulated by the Government.  Let\r\n\r\nus spend them all while they are available to us. They do\r\n\r\nnot  realise that they are actually spending  away  their\r\n\r\nown  money.   Some  may say, \"I have  so  much  money  in\r\n\r\nMedisave,  why  not  stay  in a  luxury  ward  and  enjoy\r\n\r\nmyself?\"   They do not realise that money in the Medisave\r\n\r\naccount  is meant for medical care in their old age,  and\r\n\r\nas  you grow older, you would need more money for medical\r\n\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember the multi-billionaire,\r\n\r\nMr  Li  Ka  Shing  of Hong Kong once said,  \"I  may  have\r\n\r\ndonated  millions to charity, but if I  see  a  five-cent\r\n\r\ncoin  on  the ground, I would bend down to pick  it  up.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he may have billions, the 5 cents still count to\r\n\r\nhim.   I  think Singaporeans are losing their  virtue  of\r\n\r\nthrift.   Many people want to make maximum use  of  their\r\n\r\nfunds  in the Ordinary Account.  The Government now wants\r\n\r\nto increase the contribution to the Special Account.  The\r\n\r\nreason  is to make sure that people have enough funds  in\r\n\r\ntheir  savings for old age.  You may not realise it.   If\r\n\r\nyou  cook  a little handful less of rice every  meal,  in\r\n\r\nthree  years' time, you would have saved a whole tank  of\r\n\r\nrice.   I  think Singaporeans have forgotten  how  to  be\r\n\r\nthrifty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, fellow Member, Ms Penny Low, said\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  did not know how to mind their  wealth  and\r\n\r\ncomplained of \"Money not enough!\".  I must say that  they\r\n\r\nshould  know  that the CPF money is not enough.   In  the\r\n\r\nUnited States there is a best-seller entitled, \"Rich Dad,\r\n\r\nPoor  Dad\".  Perhaps our Government should publish a book\r\n\r\nentitled,  \"Rich Government, Poor Government\" to  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  we  must  have a rich reserve.  This  is  a  way  to\r\n\r\neducate  our people, and we may be looking at yet another\r\n\r\nbest-seller!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel that these changes proposed by the\r\n\r\nERC  are  some sort of interference in their  lives.   No\r\n\r\nmatter  how they look at it, it is a good thing that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has done, and we must commend the  Government\r\n\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look at the long-term effects, we can see\r\n\r\nthat,  to a large extent, there is some problem with  our\r\n\r\nexisting seniority-based salary system, because  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  older  workers will be the first to be  retrenched\r\n\r\nwhenever  there is a retrenchment exercise.  We  must  do\r\n\r\nsomething to help them.  Mr Low Thia Khiang said that  we\r\n\r\nshould  look  after  them.  I can  assure  him  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is looking after them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many colleagues have also asked whether this 4%\r\n\r\nreduction  in  CPF contribution rate would guarantee  job\r\n\r\nsecurity.  Of course, it is not as simple as that.  There\r\n\r\nare  many  other things to do.  We have to look into  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  the  workers.  Last year alone,  among  the\r\n\r\n500,000  training places, 20% were run by  NTUC  and  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions.  We must train our workers  so  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  the right attitude, the right skills, so that  they\r\n\r\nhave good employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we create a balance sheet for\r\n\r\nour  workers, on the assets side, you would have tangible\r\n\r\nfixed  assets  such as the HDB flat or  private  property\r\n\r\nwhich hopefully is not a negative asset.  And, these  are\r\n\r\ncurrent assets, CPF Minimum Sum, Medisave, etc.  The NTUC\r\n\r\nhas  also created for the workers some intangible assets,\r\n\r\nsuch as the skills, the knowledge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  their  work attitude.  These intangible assets  will\r\n\r\nhelp  them  find a job.  There are many workers  who  are\r\n\r\nchoosy and they are not prepared to take on the jobs that\r\n\r\nare  offered  to them.  I think we have to  change  their\r\n\r\nmindset.   We  must train them in such a  way  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not only have skills and good attitude,  but  also\r\n\r\ngoodwill.  So, in this respect, we must work very hard to\r\n\r\nbuild up the goodwill of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this Committee headed by Dr Vivian\r\n\r\nBalakrishnan  will look into not only remaking  Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  also  remaking the people, to change their  mindset.\r\n\r\nMany  people  are saying, \"Well, I have been working  the\r\n\r\nwhole  life and now you want me to start all over again.\"\r\n\r\nIt  is  just like I have been drinking PUB-supplied water\r\n\r\nall my life and now we have to drink a new type of water.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to learn to drink this NEWater.  So,  everybody\r\n\r\nhas  to  learn.   We  must adapt  to  changes  and  start\r\n\r\ndrinking  NEWater and prepare ourselves for many  changes\r\n\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on\r\n\r\nthe  Order  Paper  for today be exempted  at  this  day's\r\n\r\nsitting  from the provisions of Standing Order No.  1.  - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND AND RELATED CHANGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Lee announced the\r\n\r\nGovernment's acceptance of the Economic Review  Committee\r\n\r\nWork  Group's  recommendations on Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nand  related  issues.  Since then, 38 hon.  Members  have\r\n\r\nspoken\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmostly  in support and also, at the same time,  to  raise\r\n\r\nvalid  and important points to reflect public concern  on\r\n\r\nthese  changes.       Sir,  I would  like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to respond to Members' queries and  concerns.\r\n\r\nBut  before  I  go  into the specific  issues  raised  by\r\n\r\nindividual  hon.  Members I would like to  say  something\r\n\r\nabout the employment market to provide a backdrop for the\r\n\r\nGovernment's    acceptance    of    these    wide-ranging\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to talk about the changes in the\r\n\r\nexternal  environment  and the employment  market.   From\r\n\r\n1990   to   1997,  Singapore's  economy  grew   strongly.\r\n\r\nEmployment  creation rose by 413,200 jobs in  total,  and\r\n\r\nthat  did  not  include jobs that  were  created  by  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector.  Members will remember  those  were\r\n\r\nthe  boom  years, and the construction sector  was  going\r\n\r\ngreat  guns.  So if we took those out, in effect, we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about creating about 52,000 jobs a year.  That is\r\n\r\nmore  than  the  average  cohort  of  young  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nentering  the  workforce.  The result is full  employment\r\n\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much has changed in the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe  1997  Asian financial crisis caused  a  downturn  in\r\n\r\n1998.   Then, after a brief recovery, we were hit by  the\r\n\r\nglobal economic slowdown in 2001.  These are some of  the\r\n\r\nshifts.  Some of these are cyclical trends which come and\r\n\r\ngo.   More  importantly, over and  above  these  cyclical\r\n\r\nchanges, we also have to face structural challenges ahead\r\n\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of new players bigger and better\r\n\r\nendowed  than Singapore is rapidly reshaping our business\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Multi-nationals are on the  prowl  looking\r\n\r\nfor   locations   which   can  offer   more   comparative\r\n\r\nadvantages.   That is why Singapore and many other  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries   face  strong  competition  from   China   for\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  job  creation.   In  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry, China's vast resources of land, labour and  the\r\n\r\nsheer  enormity  of  its  domestic  market  give   it   a\r\n\r\ncomparative  advantage way ahead of us.  Furthermore,  we\r\n\r\nare not only competing against countries like China.   In\r\n\r\nthe higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvalue-added industries, Singapore faces competition  from\r\n\r\nthe  mature  developed countries such as the Netherlands,\r\n\r\nIreland,  Denmark  and  Finland.   These  countries  have\r\n\r\nhighly   trained,  highly  skilled,  very  creative   and\r\n\r\ninnovative workers much needed by the knowledge economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of intense economic competition, and the\r\n\r\nrapid  pace  of  corporate restructuring, our  employment\r\n\r\npatterns  will change.  Instead of secure jobs in  stable\r\n\r\ncompanies, the future will see frequent job creation  and\r\n\r\njob  destruction  at  the same  time.   This  is  already\r\n\r\nhappening in countries such as the US, when many jobs are\r\n\r\nbeing  replaced or lost, while new jobs are being created\r\n\r\nin  different  industries.  So, how  will  these  changes\r\n\r\naffect us here in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot compete on low cost manufacturing in\r\n\r\nthe  years  ahead  of us.  This is not where  we  have  a\r\n\r\ncomparative  advantage.   Instead,  we  must  shift  into\r\n\r\nhigher value-added production and services over the years\r\n\r\nin  the  future.  A decade ago, investments in  Singapore\r\n\r\namounted   to  S$3.3  billion  (based  on  1990  prices),\r\n\r\ncreating  18,000  jobs.   33% of  these  jobs  were  jobs\r\n\r\nrequiring  people  with  at least  NTC-2  qualifications.\r\n\r\nLast  year, investment commitments were more than doubled\r\n\r\nat  S$8.3 billion.  But these investments will result  in\r\n\r\nonly  24,000 jobs.  However, three-quarters of these jobs\r\n\r\nwill be skilled jobs.  So, for every investment dollar in\r\n\r\nfuture,  fewer jobs are going to be created, but more  of\r\n\r\nthese   jobs  will  be  skilled  ones  requiring  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, we are also experiencing more job\r\n\r\nturnovers  in  Singapore.  Singaporeans of all  ages  and\r\n\r\neducational  qualifications have  been  affected  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of economic restructuring.  Even when the economy\r\n\r\nwas  growing strongly in the years between 1991 and 1996,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of workers retrenched rose at an  annualised\r\n\r\nrate  of  17%.   Whilst  we were enjoying  good  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  some  years 6-8% growth, we  were  still  seeing\r\n\r\nincreased  number of workers being laid off purely  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the retrenchment from structural changes taking\r\n\r\nplace in the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst new jobs are being created, the demand will be for\r\n\r\nmore skilled and knowledge workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, older workers will be hard\r\n\r\nhit  by  this  changing environment.   This  is  in  part\r\n\r\nbecause  a  significant proportion of our  older  workers\r\n\r\nhave  only  secondary  and below qualifications.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthey  do  not have the skills necessary for the new  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  are being created.  But, even for some of the older\r\n\r\nworkers  with higher educational qualifications, on-going\r\n\r\nrestructuring is creating difficulties for them, and they\r\n\r\nface greater job competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, the unemployment rate of\r\n\r\nresidents  aged  50  to  55  years  was  4.6%.   This  is\r\n\r\nsignificantly higher than the 4.1% for workers aged 40 to\r\n\r\n49  and  the 3.9% for workers in the 30 to 39 age  group.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is still lower than the unemployment rate for\r\n\r\nyoung  workers below 30, which stood at 5.5%.   Recently,\r\n\r\nthe  media and yesterday several Members in this House  - as  pointed out to me by my Minister of State, Dr Ng  Eng\r\n\r\nHen - had mentioned that the unemployment rate for the 50-55  stood  at 11%.  I think this was a mistake.  Somehow,\r\n\r\nit has crept in.  People have got this impression that it\r\n\r\nwas  11%.   Let  me say that this was a mistake.   It  is\r\n\r\nwrong.   It  is  not the right figure.  We  do  not  have\r\n\r\ndouble-digit unemployment rate in Singapore, not even for\r\n\r\nthe  older  workers.  But this is no cause  for  comfort.\r\n\r\nWhen  an  older worker is retrenched, he or she tends  to\r\n\r\nremain  jobless  for a longer period.   As  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Lee pointed out yesterday, last year, older  job\r\n\r\nseekers  aged 50 to 55 experienced a median  duration  of\r\n\r\nunemployment of 21 weeks, compared to 14 weeks and  below\r\n\r\nfor  younger workers.  The re-employment rate for workers\r\n\r\nabove 50 was 37% compared to 56% for younger workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are jobs available in Singapore, and most\r\n\r\nof these older workers are able to do these jobs.  But it\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  different job, in a different  sector,  which\r\n\r\nrequires the older workers to make an effort to  learn  a\r\n\r\nnew skill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOtherwise, older workers will have to accept lower  wage.\r\n\r\nAnd,  in  fact,  older workers above  50  who  found  re-employment  were already likely to earn less than  before\r\n\r\ntheir  retrenchment, as mentioned by DPM  Lee  yesterday.\r\n\r\nClearly,  what  is happening is that we are  experiencing\r\n\r\ngrowing  structural unemployment and  older  workers  are\r\n\r\nfacing the greatest risk of prolonged unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with growing global competition, changing\r\n\r\ncorporate  structures and the emergence of new employment\r\n\r\ntrends,  we  have  to  examine our existing  systems  and\r\n\r\nstructures to identify whether they will still  serve  us\r\n\r\nwell  in  the  new  operating  environment.   It  is  the\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  these new trends and growing  threat  of\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment that has prompted Government  to\r\n\r\naccept   the   ERC   Work  Group's   recommendations   to\r\n\r\nrestructure the CPF system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the CPF is concerned, this institution has\r\n\r\nstood  the  test  of  time.  As both Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState,  Mr  Tharman, and DPM Lee had said,  the  CPF  has\r\n\r\nserved us well and is in no danger of a collapse.   Going\r\n\r\nforward, we are confident that it will continue to  serve\r\n\r\nus  well, provided we refine and retune the system for  a\r\n\r\nmore competitive environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not dwell on the core areas of\r\n\r\nretirement,  housing and health care.   These  have  been\r\n\r\nmore than adequately addressed and explained by DPM Lee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In refining the CPF system, we must take care not to\r\n\r\nadd  to  or  reinforce existing rigidities in the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket, which could eventually make the Singapore  worker\r\n\r\nless   competitive   than  his  counterparts   in   other\r\n\r\ncountries.   It  must  be  made more  flexible  and  more\r\n\r\nresilient so as to better serve workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government knows that these changes will cause\r\n\r\nsome  difficulties  for  some of  our  CPF  members,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  50-55  age group or  those  earning  above\r\n\r\n$5,000.  We are sympathetic that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  have  to make this adjustment.  But the  underlying\r\n\r\ndriving  forces  causing  job  losses  in  many  sectors,\r\n\r\nnamely,  global competition, corporate restructuring  and\r\n\r\nthe  changes  in  the employment trends,  will  only  get\r\n\r\nstronger with time.  We did not cause these changes.  But\r\n\r\nwe cannot avoid them.  So we must adjust to them.  Sooner\r\n\r\nor  later, we have to adjust.  It is better to make these\r\n\r\nchanges  earlier, so that the younger members  have  more\r\n\r\ntime  to  prepare and will be better placed to  face  the\r\n\r\nrealities of competitive global environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to the issues raised\r\n\r\nby  hon. Members.  I will group them into key areas where\r\n\r\nthe  changes  have  been recommended, starting  with  the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum.  The recommendation is to retain the Minimum\r\n\r\nSum, the present framework, to reach $80,000 by July next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang supported the concept of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the Minimum Sum framework and  he  asked  if\r\n\r\nGovernment were to revise the Minimum Sum, what  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  future Minimum Sum like.  I believe Dr Amy Khor also\r\n\r\nsupported  the  idea  of  raising  the  Minimum  Sum  and\r\n\r\nemphasised that it should be done gradually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we started to revise the Minimum Sum back in\r\n\r\n1995.  By next year, ie, after 8 years, we will reach the\r\n\r\ntarget  of  $80,000.   That Singaporeans  need  a  higher\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  in future is beyond doubt.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  study what would be an appropriate Minimum Sum  and\r\n\r\nthe schedule of implementation after we have achieved our\r\n\r\ncurrent  target.   The amount will be  increased,  taking\r\n\r\ninto  consideration inflation, higher standards of living\r\n\r\nand the rising expectation of basic retirement needs.  In\r\n\r\nresponse  to Dr Khor who pointed out that we should  move\r\n\r\ngradually,  let me assure Members that we will  give  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers plenty of time to adjust to any revision  in  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum in future.  We will certainly not rush  this\r\n\r\nissue.  We took eight years in the last revision.  We can\r\n\r\ntake equally long, or maybe a little longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether we will allow\r\n\r\nmembers  to opt out from the Minimum Sum Scheme, if  they\r\n\r\nhave  a  pension plan.  Let me point out that,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthis is already the existing position.  Members who, upon\r\n\r\nreaching the age of 55, can enjoy a pension that will pay\r\n\r\nthem an annuity, or a monthly pension, more than what the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  can pay, will be allowed to withdraw  their\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum.  Those who have enough in their CPF account\r\n\r\ncan  convert to an annuity at the age of 55.  An  annuity\r\n\r\nwhich will pay more than what the Minimum Sum would allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  draw on a monthly basis would also  be  allowed\r\n\r\nand, in fact, we encourage them to withdraw all their CPF\r\n\r\nto purchase their annuity, or to place it in a bank which\r\n\r\nwill  then allow them to withdraw a monthly amount.   So,\r\n\r\nin fact, we already have this mechanism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to the Special Account where the\r\n\r\nrecommendation is to increase the contribution rate  from\r\n\r\nour  present rate of 4-6-6 to 5-7-9 for the different age\r\n\r\ngroups.   Here, like Mr Seng Han Thong, I was also  quite\r\n\r\nsurprised  that  Mr Low Thia Khiang has  taken  a  fairly\r\n\r\nstrong  position on this issue.  He has agreed  with  the\r\n\r\ngradual adjustment, and he also pointed out that it  will\r\n\r\nget people to be more self-reliant.  I agree with him.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say  that his  idea  is  not  wrong,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple.  And I am also very glad that he supports  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's principle of putting more into  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount and also cutting back on the contribution to  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account for housing.  However,  his  scheme  of\r\n\r\nhaving  four  age  groups  contributing  7-9-9-6  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account is quite drastic.  It is  front  loaded,\r\n\r\nvery heavy for the younger workers, and will make it very\r\n\r\ndifficult  for young people to start buying  their  first\r\n\r\nhouse.   So  we have no reason to cause people  to  delay\r\n\r\nmarrying, starting a family and buying a home.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthat is what our home ownership programme is all about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is that they over commit either by\r\n\r\nbuying  too  big  a house, or by upgrading  beyond  their\r\n\r\nfinancial limits.  So the way to address this concern  is\r\n\r\nto  have a Special Account which increases with age.   So\r\n\r\nthere has to be a balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  ERC  Work  Group's recommendation  of  having  5-7-9\r\n\r\npercentage  point  contribution to  the  Special  Account\r\n\r\nstrikes  a  better  balance  between  old-age  needs  and\r\n\r\nhousing  needs of the younger CPF members.  The  proposed\r\n\r\nfour-step  rate  by  Mr Low Thia Khiang  would  have  too\r\n\r\nadverse  an  impact on the existing younger members,  ie,\r\n\r\nthose in the 35-45 age group.  The sharp increase in  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Account contribution would seriously affect their\r\n\r\nability  to  service their existing mortgages.   For  new\r\n\r\nmembers  adopting the four-step proposal  it  will  delay\r\n\r\ntheir  ability to purchase a first property  using  their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings.   So, on balance, I would not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsupport Mr Low's proposal and I would prefer to go  along\r\n\r\nwith the ERC's  recommendation  of  5-7-9.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron Eusofe, Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr\r\n\r\nAndy  Gan, Dr Chong Weng Chiew and Mr Zainudin  have  all\r\n\r\nspoken on the proposal to facilitate pooling of CPF funds\r\n\r\nfor  investment in private pension plans.   They  support\r\n\r\nthe  idea, but they urge the Government to enhance public\r\n\r\neducation  in the use of pension plans because they  have\r\n\r\nserious  doubts  whether  the average  Singaporean  knows\r\n\r\nexactly how to participate in a pension plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public education on the use of CPF investment\r\n\r\nscheme  or pool pension plans would be critical  for  its\r\n\r\nacceptance  by Singaporeans.  We agree that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nneed to understand the concept and the mechanics of how a\r\n\r\npension  plan  works in order to be  able  to  take  full\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the  potential to  enhance  their  savings\r\n\r\nthrough  pension plans.  So public investor education  on\r\n\r\npension plans should be driven along three tracks  -  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the non-profit industry body as well  as  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  and  fund  management  companies\r\n\r\noperating pension plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Central Provident Fund Board, we\r\n\r\nwill   disseminate   information  to   enhance   consumer\r\n\r\nawareness  of  pension  plans.  We  will  promote  public\r\n\r\ninvestor  education  on pension funds  through  publicity\r\n\r\nactivities as well as in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with  agencies, such as  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development  and  Sports  and  the  Financial\r\n\r\nPlanner Association of Singapore.  Industry bodies,  such\r\n\r\nas  the Investment Manager Association of Singapore could\r\n\r\nalso help consumers learn more about pension funds.   The\r\n\r\nrelevant  Government bodies will work with these industry\r\n\r\nplayers to promote better understanding of pension plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF Board will also study existing\r\n\r\nrestrictions,   such  as  foreign  currency   denominated\r\n\r\nequity, and the difficulty faced by CPF members to have a\r\n\r\nflow  through of CPF contributions to pension plans.   We\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate members' access to these pension  plans.\r\n\r\nFinally,   the  financial  institutions  and   the   fund\r\n\r\nmanagement companies themselves should also promote their\r\n\r\nproducts professionally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with each party playing their part in providing\r\n\r\ninformation and educational material, CPF members  should\r\n\r\nhave ample opportunities to better understand the use  of\r\n\r\npension plans for their financial planning.  What we hope\r\n\r\nto  achieve  is  to  provide all the information  to  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  so that he or she can make an educated  decision\r\n\r\non  whether  to  join any pension plan.   The  CPF  Board\r\n\r\ncannot make this decision for the members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung suggested that we confine\r\n\r\ninvestments   under   the  CPF   Investment   Scheme   to\r\n\r\ninvestments in unit trusts and pension plans, and not  to\r\n\r\nshare  purchases.  We have been moving in that direction.\r\n\r\nWe started out with a fairly liberal regime under the CPF\r\n\r\nInvestment Scheme where members can invest about  80%  of\r\n\r\ntheir investible funds in shares.  Then we scaled it back\r\n\r\nto 50% and, I think, more recently, it was scaled back to\r\n\r\n35%.   On the other hand, we allow them to invest  up  to\r\n\r\n100%  of  the  investible  funds  in  the  professionally\r\n\r\nmanaged  funds.  We also allow them to use their  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  savings for such investments.  So we are  moving\r\n\r\nin   that   direction,  scaling  back  on  the   personal\r\n\r\ninvestments   in  shares,  where  there   is   a   highly\r\n\r\nspeculative\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelement,   and   encouraging  members  to  move   towards\r\n\r\nprofessionally managed funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the salary cap recommended by the ERC Work\r\n\r\nGroup,  that  is,  to  lower  the  salary  cap  for   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution from $6,000 to $5,000.  Dr Teo Ho Pin  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  the reduction in salary ceiling will affect  the\r\n\r\nmembers' ability to upgrade their housing type in future.\r\n\r\nSir,   let  me  point  out  that  the  changes  will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented gradually in tandem with CPF restoration.  We\r\n\r\nstill  have this outstanding 4% CPF that has  got  to  be\r\n\r\nrestored  for  most of the workers over the  next  three,\r\n\r\nmaybe four, years, depending on how the economy performs.\r\n\r\nSo  any negative impact on mortgage payment would thus be\r\n\r\nmoderated because we are not implementing this measure in\r\n\r\none  go.   The  labour market itself will adjust  to  the\r\n\r\nreduction in the employer's CPF contribution, and part of\r\n\r\nthis  will  work  its way back into the  member's  salary\r\n\r\nwhich he can, of course, use to service his mortgage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Andy Gan asked whether\r\n\r\nreducing the CPF salary ceiling may lead to higher  take-home pay for those earning about $5,000 or above, but  as\r\n\r\na  result  of  higher take-home pay, they  would  end  up\r\n\r\npaying  more taxes.  Are they not worse off than  before?\r\n\r\nReducing the salary ceiling for CPF will enable  them  to\r\n\r\nhave  a higher take-home pay.  We have to look at it this\r\n\r\nway.  All along we have used CPF for the past 47 years as\r\n\r\none-size-fits-all  kind of plan.   Everybody  contributes\r\n\r\nthe  same amount.  But increasingly, we notice that,  for\r\n\r\nthe higher income earners, there is less need for them to\r\n\r\nhave  the  same level of mandatory saving  as  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome.  I think we should start to free up some of this,\r\n\r\nallow those in the higher income to have more control and\r\n\r\ndiscretion  over how much more they should save.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe idea of trying to limit the CPF to serve the 10th  to\r\n\r\n80th percentile group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC Sub-Committee's recommendation to lower\r\n\r\nthe salary cap from $6,000 to $5,000 should also be taken\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  previous  recommendation  to   lower\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax.  So CPF members in this income  tax\r\n\r\ngroup  facing a cut in the ceiling will also benefit,  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent, from the new tax regime that was  announced\r\n\r\nby  DPM  in the Budget Statement.  Furthermore,  for  the\r\n\r\nhigher  income group, while income tax obligation may  go\r\n\r\nup,  we  now  have  a mechanism called the  Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme for them to make tax exempt investments\r\n\r\nto  mitigate  their  tax burden.   So  there  are  offset\r\n\r\nmechanisms  available for this group of people  who  will\r\n\r\nenjoy  a higher take-home pay as a result of this  change\r\n\r\nin the ceiling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about the income floor, the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  here  is to raise the  income  floor  for\r\n\r\nemployee's  CPF contribution for low wage earners.   Many\r\n\r\nMPs  have spoken on this.  Mr Gan Kim Yong, Mr Heng  Chee\r\n\r\nHow, Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Ravindran, Mr Sin Boon Ann,\r\n\r\nMr  Ang Mong Seng, and Miss Penny Low all supported  this\r\n\r\nmove.   They understand that it will allow the low income\r\n\r\ngroup  to  have  a  higher take-home  pay,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea behind this move to raise the CPF floor\r\n\r\nlevel  is to encourage more part-timers to enter the  job\r\n\r\nmarket.   Because in the past, with a wage floor of  $200\r\n\r\nattracting  CPF  contribution,  many  would-be  part-time\r\n\r\nworkers, or odd job workers, say that by the time the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  is deducted, the take-home pay  becomes  so\r\n\r\nsmall   and  miserable  that  they  just  did  not   feel\r\n\r\nsufficiently incentivised to take on the job.   So,  with\r\n\r\nthis  raise of the CPF floor to $500-$750, we  hope  that\r\n\r\nmore homemakers and housewives will join the workforce to\r\n\r\nsupplement  their  household  income.   Others  who  will\r\n\r\nbenefit from this change include the odd-job workers.  We\r\n\r\nhope  that  the higher take-home pay from odd  jobs  will\r\n\r\nencourage more of such people to enter the job market  in\r\n\r\nthis manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to point out that there is no reduction\r\n\r\nto  the  employer's CPF contribution for  this  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  So\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalthough  they  are not making full contribution,  as  an\r\n\r\nemployee, they still receive full employer's contribution\r\n\r\nand  they are still saving some money for their old  age.\r\n\r\nAnd   with  the  higher  take-home  pay,  they  will   be\r\n\r\nsupplementing  the family income and, I  think,  that  is\r\n\r\ngood  for  the family.  Of course, there are  those  with\r\n\r\nvery  low  income  and they would have  great  difficulty\r\n\r\nsaving for their future retirement needs, and this is the\r\n\r\ngroup  that may eventually have to fall upon some  social\r\n\r\nassistance  measures.   We also  have  schemes,  such  as\r\n\r\nMedifund,  to look after the very poor to help them  meet\r\n\r\ntheir  medical  expenses.   We have  rent  and  utilities\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme and also many other community  welfare\r\n\r\nschemes  to  help the very poor.  When the  economy  does\r\n\r\nwell  and  the  Government is able to  achieve  a  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus, then we will try to give some CPF top-ups or New\r\n\r\nSingapore Shares.  We can try to allocate more  to  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  poor and those who are in greater need of  such\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of older workers aged 50-55 has been the\r\n\r\nmost controversial element of the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nERC Work Group.  Many Members have spoken on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to respond to Mr Leong Horn Kee,\r\n\r\nwho  suggested that the reduction in CPF contribution for\r\n\r\nthe  group of workers aged 50-55 should not be done  now,\r\n\r\nbut  should be done for future cohorts of older  workers.\r\n\r\nWe  are  beginning  to  see the emergence  of  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,  as I explained earlier on.   It  would  be\r\n\r\nunwise  and irresponsible for this Government to  pretend\r\n\r\nthat there is no problem now and to leave the problem  to\r\n\r\nbe tackled for future cohorts of workers.  The problem is\r\n\r\nemerging now.  The sooner we tackle it, the better off we\r\n\r\nare.   We  should give notice that we are going  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  move.  The change itself is going to be phased  out\r\n\r\ngradually, so that it is not a sudden shock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo observed that the non-restoration\r\n\r\nof  CPF  contribution for the older workers in  this  age\r\n\r\ngroup will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresult  in an 8% reduction in the Ordinary Account,  from\r\n\r\n22%  currently,  to  14%,  and this  could  affect  their\r\n\r\nability to meet their mortgage payment.  Workers in  this\r\n\r\nage group will see an 8-percentage point reduction in the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account  as a result of the non-restoration  of\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution,  together with  a  4-percentage  point\r\n\r\nreduction  in the employee's contribution, and  also  the\r\n\r\nmigration  of  1-percentage  point  to  Medisave  and  3-percentage  point  to Special Account under  the  earlier\r\n\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the 4-percentage point cut in the employee's CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  is  not lost to the employee.   It  becomes\r\n\r\nhigher  take-home pay for him.  So, he should be able  to\r\n\r\nuse  that to supplement his mortgage payment through  his\r\n\r\nCPF  account.   Effectively, the reduction for  this  age\r\n\r\ngroup is only 4-percentage point, because today they  are\r\n\r\nalready short of 4-percentage point which is not going to\r\n\r\nbe  restored.   So,  the effective reduction  is  the  4-percentage  point which will be migrated to his  Medisave\r\n\r\nand  Special  Account.   We feel that  the  shortfall  in\r\n\r\nmortgage repayment will not be as drastic as suggested by\r\n\r\nthis  presentation  that the Ordinary  Account  has  been\r\n\r\nreduced from 22% to 14%.  The impact is less than that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind Members that DPM Lee\r\n\r\nannounced yesterday that CPF members who are affected and\r\n\r\nare  in  this age group will be allowed to draw on  their\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account  to meet their mortgage  payment.   This\r\n\r\nwill  help  those  in  the 50-55  age  group  during  the\r\n\r\ntransition period to ease their financial burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia yesterday supported the changes\r\n\r\nrecommended by the ERC.  But he asked that we should  not\r\n\r\nmicro-manage the CPF system, that we should let employers\r\n\r\nand  employees to decide on their own contribution  rate,\r\n\r\nbased  on company performance.  Dr Jennifer Lee,  Mr  Sin\r\n\r\nBoon  Ann and many other hon. Members asked whether a  4-percentage  point  reduction in  employer's  contribution\r\n\r\nwill be effective.  Will it only just hurt the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworker by cutting his CPF, without actually enhancing his\r\n\r\nemployability?   We  have  to look  at  it  in  totality.\r\n\r\nFreezing the contribution rate at 16% is one of the  many\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help  enhance the  employability  of  older\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  these  are the older workers  who  are  at\r\n\r\ngreatest   risk  of  retrenchment  and   who   are   most\r\n\r\nvulnerable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have, over the years, tried to narrow the\r\n\r\nsalary  minimum-to-maximum ratio for  workers  doing  the\r\n\r\nsame  job.   Because of our seniority-based  wage  scale,\r\n\r\nthis  minimum-to-maximum ratio is quite  wide.   In  some\r\n\r\nindustries,  it may be as wide as two or even  more  than\r\n\r\ntwo.    However,  despite  many  years  of  effort,   the\r\n\r\nseniority-based wage system is still deeply entrenched in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Not many employers are able  to  change  the\r\n\r\nsystem on their own.  Any change will also result in much\r\n\r\nunhappiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members who expressed reservations over this\r\n\r\nrecommendation had also at the same time considered  that\r\n\r\nwage  cost is not an insignificant factor.   For example,\r\n\r\nDr  Jennifer  Lee  noted  that wage  cost  is  a  factor,\r\n\r\nalthough  she questioned whether this 4-percentage  point\r\n\r\nreduction would make a big difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we agree that we should make\r\n\r\ngreater  effort  to  replace  the  seniority-based   wage\r\n\r\nsystem,  or to progressively change it to a system  where\r\n\r\nwages  are  paid based on value of jobs and  performance.\r\n\r\nBut  this  will take time.  We just cannot wait  for  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based wage system to be completely  phased  out\r\n\r\nover  many, many years, in order to address the immediate\r\n\r\nproblem  of rising structural unemployment.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nmove  on  every front.  We have to tackle the problem  in\r\n\r\nmany  ways,  because  this is a problem  that  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsolved  with  one  magic bullet.  It is  a  problem  that\r\n\r\nrequires  a plethora of solutions or efforts in order  to\r\n\r\naddress it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither can we leave it entirely to the workers\r\n\r\nto  negotiate  with their employers, as suggested  by  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve Chia.  If, in fact, our CPF structure today\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreinforces or makes the seniority-based wage system  even\r\n\r\nmore   inflexible  and  difficult  in  this   competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment,  then we should be prepared  to  restructure\r\n\r\nand  change  it to make it more relevant to  the  current\r\n\r\nemployment market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while many Members have questioned whether the\r\n\r\n4-percentage  point reduction will be sufficient  on  its\r\n\r\nown,  I would like to point out that, yes, a 4-percentage\r\n\r\npoint reduction is not a very big difference.  It is  not\r\n\r\na  solution  or alternative for the seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.   But  it is a move in the right  direction.   It\r\n\r\nsends  a strong signal.  Here, I am cheered when Mr Ahmad\r\n\r\nMagad expressed the view that, in fact, it is a pragmatic\r\n\r\nway  to  address  the  rigidity  in  our  labour  market.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  Dr  Amy  Khor  and also  Dr  Warren  Lee  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  support for this move and said  that  it  will\r\n\r\nhelp us to address the seniority-based wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on balance, while this is an issue that many\r\n\r\nMembers  have  reservations, we must also recognise  that\r\n\r\nthe  seniority-based wage system is going to be here  for\r\n\r\nquite some time, and we will have to begin to address it,\r\n\r\nand  this is the first step that we are taking to address\r\n\r\nthis issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that the freezing of the employer's\r\n\r\nCPF  for  the  50-55  age group is unfair  to  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  that  the 4% saving is  not  a  sufficient\r\n\r\nincentive  to employ workers.  As I said, in  itself,  it\r\n\r\nmay  not solve the problem completely, but if it is  seen\r\n\r\nas  part  of the rest of the measures - some of  which  I\r\n\r\nwill  touch  on  later on - it is a  step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam went on to say that it is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nSurprise!   Surprise!   If  it  is  unconstitutional,  he\r\n\r\nhimself  has decided not to do anything, but he suggested\r\n\r\nto  my colleague, the Secretary General of NTUC, that the\r\n\r\nunions  should  do something about it,  because  this  is\r\n\r\nunconstitutional.  If indeed this is unconstitutional, Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  knows what the remedy is.  If he feels  that  this\r\n\r\nmeasure is unconstitutional, he knows how to take it  up.\r\n\r\nSo, I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nask  Mr  Chiam  to follow up, rather than ask  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions to do it, because the representatives of the trade\r\n\r\nunions have in this House supported such a move.   As  Mr\r\n\r\nNithiah  Nandan has pointed out, he has to deal with  his\r\n\r\nmembers' anxiety and difficulty in finding re-employment,\r\n\r\nand  he sees this as one of the helpful measures.    Even\r\n\r\nthough  it is not the single most important solution,  it\r\n\r\nwill  help  his  members in addressing  their  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment concerns.  So, I will leave it to Mr  Chiam.\r\n\r\nIf  he sincerely believes that it is unconstitutional, he\r\n\r\ncertainly knows what to do with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong made an interesting point that by\r\n\r\nfreezing  the employer's CPF contribution for  the  50-55\r\n\r\nage group, we are creating a situation where there is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  equal  pay  for  equal  work.   I  do  not  quite\r\n\r\nunderstand the logic behind that.  I would like to  point\r\n\r\nout that under today's seniority-based wage system, there\r\n\r\nis already an element of distortion.  In some jobs, where\r\n\r\ntwo  persons are doing the same work, an older person can\r\n\r\nget  paid  one-and-a-half or even twice as  much  as  the\r\n\r\nyounger person.  So, there is already this element.  What\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing  with this freezing of the employer's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  is to take one small step to try  to  level\r\n\r\nthe  playing field, to try to bring it back, and make  it\r\n\r\nmore  equal.   So,  I hope that Dr Ong, who  believes  in\r\n\r\nequal  pay for equal work, will support the NTUC in their\r\n\r\neffort  to  promote revision of the seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem to promote paying workers by job rate.  If he does\r\n\r\nso,  then  he will be helping us to overcome the rigidity\r\n\r\nin our employment market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we accept this recommendation to freeze the\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF contribution, employers should  also  not\r\n\r\njust  stay  put and keep to the old mindset  about  older\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  be  too  quick to want  to  release  older\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  event that they have to restructure  or\r\n\r\nreorganise  their companies.  We hope employers  will  be\r\n\r\nmore   open-minded  and  more  willing  to  employ  older\r\n\r\nworkers.    Many  of  the  older  workers   are   equally\r\n\r\nproductive  and reliable in their jobs.  In this  regard,\r\n\r\nour  employer  organisations in  Singapore  have  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant role to play in changing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe mindsets of employers.  DPM Lee had already announced\r\n\r\nyesterday that the Government will set the example in the\r\n\r\ncivil  service by providing civil servants with a special\r\n\r\npayment,  the  Transitional  CPF  Non-restoration  Top-up\r\n\r\nComponent,  to offset the non-restoration of the  4%  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.   I certainly hope that this  will  send  a\r\n\r\nstrong  signal  to  employers in the  private  sector  to\r\n\r\nconsider adopting the same approach to return all or part\r\n\r\nof this non-restored CPF portion to older workers who are\r\n\r\nmaking  good contribution to the company.  Employers  can\r\n\r\ndo  so by way of giving mid-year and end-of-year bonus or\r\n\r\nsome other variable payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many other Members have also spoken about the\r\n\r\nneed  not  just to freeze the employer's CPF contribution\r\n\r\nto enhance employability of the 50-55 age group, but also\r\n\r\nto  enhance  their  skills.  Skill is  a  very  important\r\n\r\nfactor.   I  agree with Mr Othman Haron Eusofe,  Mr  Heng\r\n\r\nChee  How,  Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang  and  Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki that skills are a very important factor.  This  is\r\n\r\nanother  area that the Government is tackling  with  full\r\n\r\ncommitment.  In fact, freezing the older workers' CPF  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  only  way  that  we are  going  about  tackling\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment.  We have,  indeed,  implemented\r\n\r\nprogrammes   to   help   older  workers   enhance   their\r\n\r\nemployability through skills upgrading and training.   We\r\n\r\nhave  put  in  place  programmes to  address  the  skills\r\n\r\nmismatch between older workers and the new jobs that  are\r\n\r\nbeing created in the economy.  We have introduced a  wide\r\n\r\nrange   of   programmes,  including  the  People-for-Jobs\r\n\r\nTraineeship  Programme,  to help particularly  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers  to  acquire  the necessary skills  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With immediate effect, workers above age 50 can\r\n\r\nqualify for an additional three months, after the initial\r\n\r\nsix  months  of  wage  support under  the  People-for-Job\r\n\r\nTraineeship  Programme.  This means we are extending  the\r\n\r\nPeople-for-Job  Traineeship  Programme  to  a  full  nine\r\n\r\nmonths,  provided they were recruited after  retrenchment\r\n\r\nor  switched jobs with some retraining required  for  the\r\n\r\nnew jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member asked whether we would extend it for two\r\n\r\nyears.   Let  me  say  that we should proceed  with  this\r\n\r\nextension,  try it out and then, based on the  experience\r\n\r\nthat  we  get from managing this more generous  programme\r\n\r\nfor  another year, we can decide whether it needs  to  be\r\n\r\nextended  for  a  longer period.   We  are  open  to  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to programmes like the People-for-Job Traineeship Programme, we have also set up a job task\r\n\r\nforce chaired by the Minister of State, Dr Ng Eng Hen, to\r\n\r\nlook  more  holistically into ways of helping  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers  who are retrenched or who are unable  to  secure\r\n\r\nalternative jobs. This would, in a way, address the point\r\n\r\nraised  by  Ms  Irene  Ng that we need  some  central  or\r\n\r\nnational body to look at the plight of the older workers.\r\n\r\nThis  Committee would continue to examine ways of helping\r\n\r\nolder   workers   to  enhance  their  employability,   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate skills upgrading and retraining for them.   We\r\n\r\nwill  certainly continue to work with the  employers  and\r\n\r\nthe trade unions to invest in worker training because  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that ultimately, it is the skills and competency\r\n\r\nof  our workers that would ensure their employability  in\r\n\r\nthe  future.  It is more so for the older workers because\r\n\r\nthere  is an increasing challenge for them. Each  younger\r\n\r\ncohort  of workers that goes into the job market is  more\r\n\r\nskilled,  better educated, more capable  than  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  It must be so because of our education  system.\r\n\r\nThe   older   workers  are  going  to   be   increasingly\r\n\r\nchallenged.  We will have to invest efforts in continuing\r\n\r\neducation and training so that they can also keep  up-to-date  and  also  face the increasing challenge  from  the\r\n\r\nyounger workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah and Mr Heng Chee How spoke on the need\r\n\r\nto  introduce greater flexibility in our wage  structure.\r\n\r\nThis  is  exactly  what  the ERC's  recommendation  about\r\n\r\nrestructuring the CPF scheme is all about.  We do want to\r\n\r\nintroduce greater flexibility in our wage structure.   So\r\n\r\nfreezing  the employer's CPF contribution for this  group\r\n\r\nof  workers,  aged 50-55, should be seen as part  of  the\r\n\r\noverall   package  to  enhance  employability  and   also\r\n\r\nflexibility\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  our  wage  structure for this group of  workers.   In\r\n\r\nterms  of flexibility of wage structure, we will continue\r\n\r\nto  promote and push the idea of building up the  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable  component  so  that companies  can  make  quick\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  their wage costs when they  face  severe\r\n\r\nbusiness  downturn,  instead of having  to  rely  on  the\r\n\r\nacross-the-board CPF cut, as we had done twice already in\r\n\r\nrecent history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me respond to Mr Othman Haron Eusofe.\r\n\r\nThe  point he made was that older workers need to upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir skills.  I agree with that.  As I have said earlier\r\n\r\non,  we will continue to invest in efforts to upgrade the\r\n\r\nskills  of the older workers to help them cope  with  the\r\n\r\nnew skills demand in the job market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has suggested setting aside 1%\r\n\r\nfor  personal  training from the CPF  account.  Sir,  our\r\n\r\nproblem   today  is  that  allocating  the  limited   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the three accounts for home,  retirement\r\n\r\nand  healthcare is already a difficult balancing act,  as\r\n\r\nwe  have  all debated over the last two days.  We  should\r\n\r\nnot further complicate the matter by creating another sub-account within the overall CPF framework, even though  it\r\n\r\nis  for  an admirable objective of encouraging the member\r\n\r\nto  be more responsible for his continuing education  and\r\n\r\ntraining.  Let me say that this does not mean that people\r\n\r\nwill  have  no  opportunity to go for training.   On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,   the   Government   already   provides   ample\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  financial support  for  training  and\r\n\r\nskills upgrading for all workers.  These programmes  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be reviewed, updated and when necessary  and\r\n\r\nbeneficial,  it would be enhanced.  Let us  make  use  of\r\n\r\nthese resources, instead of trying to draw on the already\r\n\r\nlimited CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee mentioned a not quite related point\r\n\r\nbut allow me to respond.  That is the difficulty faced by\r\n\r\nself-employed who want to renew their trade  licence  but\r\n\r\ndid not contribute to their Medisave. This is actually an\r\n\r\nunrelated issue but let me assure him that the CPF  Board\r\n\r\nis very sympathetic.  If a self-employed cannot renew his\r\n\r\nlicence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  he is not up-to-date with his Medisave  payment,\r\n\r\nall  we  require  is that he makes us a promise  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  make  some  payment.  We  will  work  out  a  very\r\n\r\nreasonable  instalment payment plan for him  to  pay  the\r\n\r\ncontribution.  But bear in mind that it is not  really  a\r\n\r\npayment  - he is contributing for his own future  medical\r\n\r\nand healthcare needs.  Self-employed are well-advised  to\r\n\r\nkeep  their Medisave updated so that they do not run into\r\n\r\nthis difficulty.  But if they do have the difficulty, let\r\n\r\nme   assure  Dr  Warren  Lee  that  the  Board  is   very\r\n\r\nsympathetic  and we will help the self-employed  to  work\r\n\r\nout an appropriate payment plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in summary, the ERC Work Group's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  is  wide-ranging.   It  touches  on  many\r\n\r\npeople.   It  sets  in  train a  series  of  changes  and\r\n\r\nadjustments for the CPF system.  But these are not sudden\r\n\r\nchanges.  These  are  changes that  would  be  introduced\r\n\r\ngradually  and progressively over time as we restore  the\r\n\r\nCPF  to  the target contribution rate of 20% plus another\r\n\r\n20%  from the employee.  If we do not make these changes,\r\n\r\nif  we remain status quo, we will be allowing rigidities,\r\n\r\nemployment problems and inadequacy of retirement  savings\r\n\r\nto become more deep-rooted and intractable.  If we tackle\r\n\r\nthese  problems  head-on  and  early,  we  will  have   a\r\n\r\nreasonable  chance of overcoming them.  By acting  early,\r\n\r\nquickly  and  decisively, we will  be  better  placed  to\r\n\r\nenhance   our  long-term  competitiveness  and   economic\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, only clarification, no\r\n\r\nspeeches, no debates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  in  his  speech that my proposal  is  not  feasible\r\n\r\nbecause  it  would affect the ability of Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nown  flats.

So Mr Low's example of having 7-9-9-6,  having\r\n\r\na  very  high contribution to the Special Account, simply\r\n\r\nmakes  it  more difficult for the younger CPF members  to\r\n\r\nput  aside sufficient CPF savings by the time they  reach\r\n\r\nthe  typical  marriage age of around 28-30  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndownpayment  to buy a home that they want.  What  we  are\r\n\r\nsaying   is   that   we  should  not  handicap,   further\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  or make it more difficult for this  younger\r\n\r\ngroup  of  Singaporeans.  We should  allow  them  to  put\r\n\r\nsufficient savings into their Ordinary Account at a young\r\n\r\nage  to  be able to afford their first home.  Thereafter,\r\n\r\nthey  will have to plan carefully if they want to upgrade\r\n\r\nto  a  bigger  home,  or  to even upgrade  to  a  private\r\n\r\nproperty.  The prices of HDB flats are not based  on  how\r\n\r\nmuch money that is left in the Ordinary Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Ong, do you want to seek a\r\n\r\nclarification too?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to clarify my point because the Minister  said\r\n\r\nthat  he could not understand what I meant yesterday.   I\r\n\r\nwas  saying  that the main problem of the  older  workers\r\n\r\nbeing  unable to find a job is, we all know,  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  seniority-based wage system.  But if we  freeze  and\r\n\r\nlower  the  CPF  contribution  rate  for  this  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  it may result in a certain reluctance  when  we\r\n\r\nreally want to push for a job-based wage system.  Because\r\n\r\nfrom  the  employers' point of view, they say that  since\r\n\r\nthe  Government will take care of it from the CPF  front,\r\n\r\nthey  do not have to do anything.  Therefore, there is  a\r\n\r\nreluctance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere.  From the workers' point of view, they say that if\r\n\r\nthey  are going to accept a CPF cut when they grow older,\r\n\r\nwhy should they accept a job-based wage system?  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat I meant that by introducing this CPF freeze, it  may\r\n\r\ncreate some problems later when we want to push for a job-based wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, he was actually\r\n\r\nmaking a speech rather than seeking a clarification.   As\r\n\r\nI  explained  in  my response, we should  work  from  all\r\n\r\nfronts.  We do not just try to find one solution for  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  We all know that the seniority-based wage scale\r\n\r\nis   a  rigidity  in  our  employment  market.   That  is\r\n\r\nsomething  we have to address, in the light  of  all  the\r\n\r\nchanges  that are happening. Freezing the employees'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution for the older workers is one of the  parcels\r\n\r\nof  measures  that  we  have to  do,  along  with  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading, retraining for the workers, redeploying  older\r\n\r\nworkers  to  new  jobs in different sectors.   All  these\r\n\r\nwould  have to be done.  And also, the continuing  effort\r\n\r\nto scale back this seniority-based wage system. The trade\r\n\r\nunions  have  done much work on this.  In fact,  in  some\r\n\r\nsectors, if I am not mistaken, from the starting  pay  to\r\n\r\nthe end point, it used to be a factor of 2.5.  Today,  it\r\n\r\nis  probably back to maybe 1.5 or 1.8.  Even then,  there\r\n\r\nis  still a valid element of seniority pay which, earlier\r\n\r\non,  we  heard  from Mr Lim Boon Heng how this  has  done\r\n\r\ndamage to Japan in its competitiveness.  We should  learn\r\n\r\nfrom those lessons.  We should try as many measures as we\r\n\r\ncan in order to address this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Low, what is your\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister mentioned that my\r\n\r\nproposal is front rolling.  I would like to clarify  that\r\n\r\nin  my  speech  yesterday,  I mentioned  that  the  ERC's\r\n\r\nproposal is actually back rolling, especially for the age\r\n\r\ngroup  between  50-55.   This group  of  people  actually\r\n\r\nsuffers  a  double blow. On the one hand, the  total  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate was cut to 32%, and then  we  increase\r\n\r\nthe contribution to the Special Account to 9%,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanother  3%,  and  only  14%  of  the  balance   of   the\r\n\r\ncontribution is left in the Ordinary Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say this would put the age group in a\r\n\r\ndifficult  position  because of the  life  cycle  of  the\r\n\r\nperson's age, where a person has probably committed to  a\r\n\r\nsecond  property or already upgraded to another property.\r\n\r\nThey  would  probably need more money  to  service  their\r\n\r\nmortgage  loan.  Secondly, in such a life cycle, probably\r\n\r\ntheir  children are in tertiary education,  like  in  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics,  they may need CPF money to  finance  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  education.   I  find  that  this  is  totally\r\n\r\nunbalanced.   I am of the view that it is perhaps  better\r\n\r\nto  have  a  balanced front loading that will enable  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  to save while they are young and still  working,\r\n\r\nand not be in a position where they could lose their jobs\r\n\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I responded\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Low earlier, I said that I agreed with his  idea.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,  I  was  happy  that  he  was  supporting  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  effort to try to put more  money  into  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Account.  But the question is one of balance.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  balance home ownership with retirement savings.\r\n\r\nHis  proposition will make home ownership very much  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  the younger group of Singaporeans.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthere will be more savings for them in their old age.  We\r\n\r\nwant to have a situation where there is a little bit more\r\n\r\nbalance  in the sense that the younger workers  will  not\r\n\r\nface  an  uphill  task in putting aside enough  money  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Ordinary  Account  to  finance  their  first  home\r\n\r\npurchase.   And  if  they  want to  upgrade,  that  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter.  They have to carefully work out  their\r\n\r\nfinancial position, whether or not they will be  able  to\r\n\r\nafford  it  with  the new CPF contribution  rate  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are already affected by the CPF cut\r\n\r\nand  non-restoration, we are going to allow them  to  use\r\n\r\nthe  Special Account, as announced by DPM Lee, to  bridge\r\n\r\nthis  transition period.  But for many other CPF members,\r\n\r\nthe  sooner  we send the signal that they have  to  think\r\n\r\ncarefully for their future upgrading, the better off\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  we.

Mr Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow\r\n\r\nTan):  Mr Speaker, Sir, DPM Lee announced yesterday  that\r\n\r\nHDB  will be implementing bank origination of HDB  market\r\n\r\nrate  loans  from 1st January 2003.  Let me elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthis  and  related issues, as well as respond to Members'\r\n\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me explain the difference between\r\n\r\nHDB's  concessionary loans and market rate loans because,\r\n\r\nI  believe,  some Members may not have fully  appreciated\r\n\r\nthe distinction between the two, and the fact that we are\r\n\r\nactually making changes only to one and not to the other.\r\n\r\nHDB  provides mortgage loans at a concessionary  interest\r\n\r\nrate in order to ensure that HDB flats are affordable  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  need  them.   And  this  includes  first-time\r\n\r\nsubsidised flat buyers as well as second-time buyers  who\r\n\r\nare  upgrading  from  the  smaller  flats.   We  peg  the\r\n\r\ninterest  to the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate  plus\r\n\r\n0.1%.   Last  year, 63% of the loans granted by  the  HDB\r\n\r\nwere concessionary rate loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Lee mentioned yesterday, the changes related\r\n\r\nto  the  use  of CPF for the purchase of HDB flats  -  in\r\n\r\nother   words,   the  valuation  limits  and   the   cash\r\n\r\ndownpayment requirements - will not apply to these loans.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, the majority of HDB flat buyers will not\r\n\r\nbe  affected  by these changes.  I believe  this  is  the\r\n\r\ngroup of buyers that most Members are concerned about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from concessionary rate loans, HDB currently\r\n\r\nalso provides loans at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket  rates.  Market rate loans are for HDB flat buyers\r\n\r\nwho  have  either  previously consumed HDB  housing  loan\r\n\r\nsubsidies  or  who do not qualify for HDB  loans  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place.  There are five categories of such  buyers.\r\n\r\nLet me go through them one by one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore permanent residents. Obviously, non-citizens are not eligible for HDB subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Private property owners. Again, it is quite\r\n\r\nself-evident that private property owners should  not  be\r\n\r\neligible for HDB subsidised concessionary rate loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The high income households. In other words,\r\n\r\nthose  who earn $8,000 or more a month.  Again,  I  think\r\n\r\nMembers would agree that this is self-evident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Those who have already enjoyed two\r\n\r\nconcessionary loans.  In other words, they have bought at\r\n\r\nleast  two  HDB subsidised flats, and are now  going  for\r\n\r\nanother  flat and therefore we do not wish to offer  them\r\n\r\nany more concessionary loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Those who have previously enjoyed one\r\n\r\nconcessionary  loan  and are buying a  similar  sized  or\r\n\r\nsmaller HDB flat - those who are moving sideways or those\r\n\r\nwho are downgrading.  The rationale here is that for both\r\n\r\nthese  categories of buyers, they would  have  some  cash\r\n\r\nleft  over  from  the  sale of their previous  flats  and\r\n\r\ntherefore they can make use of this cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB market rate is pegged to the interest rate\r\n\r\nthat  DBS  Bank imposes on its ex-Credit POSB  customers,\r\n\r\nand this currently stands at 3.75%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that I had informed this House\r\n\r\nduring  the  Budget  debate earlier  this  year  that  my\r\n\r\nMinistry was reviewing the roles and functions of the HDB\r\n\r\nto  see  in  what way HDB could better fulfill  its  core\r\n\r\nresponsibility;   in  other  words,  to   provide   basic\r\n\r\naffordable  housing  to  the  majority  of  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThat is HDB's core responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, HDB should consider allowing the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to take over those functions which  extend\r\n\r\nbeyond  this  core responsibility.  One such activity  is\r\n\r\nthe  provision of market rate loans.  As these loans  are\r\n\r\nnot  subsidised and are pegged to commercial rates, there\r\n\r\nis  really  no  special reason for  HDB  to  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide  them.  Furthermore, the private sector  is  well\r\n\r\npositioned to provide such loans.  Currently,  there  are\r\n\r\nmore than 100 financial institutions licensed by MAS  who\r\n\r\nare  allowed to provide housing loans, and this  includes\r\n\r\nthe  three local banks as well as the six qualifying full\r\n\r\nbanks (QFBs).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided that HDB will\r\n\r\nno  longer provide market rate loans with effect from 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2003.  Flat buyers who are not eligible for HDB's\r\n\r\nconcessionary rate loans can take market rate loans  from\r\n\r\nthe many banks which are licensed to offer housing loans.\r\n\r\nExisting  HDB  market rate mortgagors can transfer  their\r\n\r\nremaining mortgages to the banks if they so wish.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat buyers can enjoy immediate benefits from\r\n\r\nbank origination.  HDB market rate loans which are pegged\r\n\r\nto  the  interest rate that DBS Bank imposes on  its  ex-Credit POSB customers currently stands at 3.75%.  Several\r\n\r\nMembers, including Mr Ravindran, Dr Lily Neo and  Dr  Ong\r\n\r\nChit  Chung, commented that while the banks may be giving\r\n\r\npromotional  rates now, in the first  few  years  of  the\r\n\r\nmortgage,  HDB's  market  rates  may  actually  be   more\r\n\r\nattractive than the rates offered by the banks  over  the\r\n\r\nlonger term.  I wish to just alert them to the fact  that\r\n\r\nthis  market rate loan of 3.75% that is currently offered\r\n\r\nby  HDB,  one  cannot assume that this rate  will  remain\r\n\r\nforever.   If Members will recall, DBS Bank had  actually\r\n\r\nstated its intention, at some point in time, to harmonise\r\n\r\nthe  mortgage  rate imposed on ex-Credit  POSB  customers\r\n\r\nwith  its board rate, and the board rate stands at  5.75%\r\n\r\nat this moment.  If and when that happens,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen HDB market rate loans would also go up to that 5.75%\r\n\r\nfigure, and it may become more expensive.  In fact,  some\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public have been asking us why they  must\r\n\r\ntake  loans  from  HDB  instead of the  banks  which  are\r\n\r\noffering  more competitive mortgage rates, especially  at\r\n\r\nthis point in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the move in bank origination, HDB flat buyers\r\n\r\nwill now have more choices and the opportunity to take up\r\n\r\nthe  most  competitive interest rates.   They  may  enjoy\r\n\r\nlonger  repayment periods because I understand that  some\r\n\r\nbanks  do offer loans up to 35 years, as compared to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  of 30 years which HDB currently offers.   Others\r\n\r\nmay  decide to offer customised special loan packages for\r\n\r\nHDB  customers.  And banks also do not require mortgagors\r\n\r\nto  fully draw down their CPF balances before giving them\r\n\r\nthe  mortgage loans, unlike HDB, and this may  appeal  to\r\n\r\nsome HDB flat buyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the implementation of bank origination will\r\n\r\nallow  HDB to exercise greater flexibility in the  future\r\n\r\nfor  those  who take market rate loans to buy HDB  flats.\r\n\r\nIt will reduce HDB's role as a lender.  It will allow HDB\r\n\r\nto  focus  on  the  provision of subsidised  housing  and\r\n\r\nsubsidised  loans.   It is another step  towards  further\r\n\r\nrelaxation of HDB's rules and regulations in the purchase\r\n\r\nand  resale of HDB flats.  This is something that MND has\r\n\r\nbeen  studying as part of the review of HDB's  roles  and\r\n\r\nfunctions.    And  this  is  also  in   line   with   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the ERC to help home-owners to monetise\r\n\r\ntheir  assets, something which the Government accepts  in\r\n\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, allow me at this point to briefly explain why\r\n\r\nwe  have these rules and regulations in the first  place.\r\n\r\nOur  public  housing programme started in the  early  60s\r\n\r\nwhen  many  people  lived in overcrowded  and  unhygienic\r\n\r\nconditions.   The  Government  needed  to  provide  basic\r\n\r\nhousing  fast.   At the same time, we wanted  to  promote\r\n\r\nhome  ownership to give people a stake in Singapore.   To\r\n\r\nachieve   this,   subsidies   were   given   to    ensure\r\n\r\naffordability.  Safeguards to protect HDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhome-owners  were  also put in place.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\nHousing   and   Development  Act  prevents  third   party\r\n\r\ncreditors  from recovering their loans from the  sale  of\r\n\r\nthe HDB flat upon the bankruptcy of the flat lessee.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, restrictions on the use of HDB flats were\r\n\r\nimposed  to  ensure  home ownership and  to  justify  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies enjoyed by HDB flat lessees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules have been relaxed over time. In the\r\n\r\n60s, lessees who wanted to dispose of their flats had  to\r\n\r\nreturn  them to HDB.  In the early 70s, HDB allowed  flat\r\n\r\nlessees to sell their flats at market prices in the  open\r\n\r\nmarket  after  satisfying the minimum occupation  period.\r\n\r\nIn  the  80s,  the eligibility criteria for resale  flats\r\n\r\nwere broadened to include permanent residents as well  as\r\n\r\nprivate  property  owners.  In the 90s,  the  rules  were\r\n\r\nrelaxed  further to allow single citizens to  buy  3-room\r\n\r\nand   smaller  resale  flats,  and  also  to  permit  the\r\n\r\nsubletting of whole flats under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By moving towards market practice, bank origination\r\n\r\ncan  gradually pave the way, at the appropriate time, for\r\n\r\nHDB  to  further  relax  its  rules.   Mr  Ong  Kian  Min\r\n\r\nsuggested yesterday that with loans being given by banks,\r\n\r\nwe  should  at  the  same time relax rules  such  as  the\r\n\r\nminimum   occupation  period  policy  and  the   existing\r\n\r\nsubletting restrictions.  Ms Irene Ng, Miss Penny Low, Dr\r\n\r\nWarren  Lee,  Dr  Amy Khor and many others  made  similar\r\n\r\nsuggestions  along  these lines.  Sir,  I  believe  their\r\n\r\nsuggestions are reasonable and logical, and I would  like\r\n\r\nto  inform  Members that MND is actively  studying  these\r\n\r\nissues  to see whether and how we can make such  changes,\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can treat HDB flats bought with bank  loans\r\n\r\nmore like private properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, while allowing banks to grant loans to give\r\n\r\nflat  buyers  greater flexibility, I want to stress  that\r\n\r\nthis   greater   flexibility  also  comes  with   greater\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   Flat buyers should  exercise  financial\r\n\r\nprudence and buy a flat within their means.  They must go\r\n\r\ninto the purchases\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  their  eyes  wide open.  They  must  expect  to  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to the mortgage financing rules that are imposed\r\n\r\nby  the  commercial  banks, including  credit  assessment\r\n\r\nrules and foreclosure policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concern that the\r\n\r\nimplementation of bank origination is, in fact, a partial\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  by Government of its social safety  net.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, several Members, like Mr Ravindran,  Mr  Andy\r\n\r\nGan, Dr Lily Neo and Dr Maliki, have pointed out that the\r\n\r\nHDB  is  generally very sympathetic towards flat  lessees\r\n\r\nwho  are  in arrears, and only repossesses flats  due  to\r\n\r\nloan  default  as a last resort.  They are  worried  that\r\n\r\nbanks would be less forbearing compared to HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address these concerns, which are valid\r\n\r\nconcerns, by making the following points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I wish to assure Members that there is no\r\n\r\nchange in the Government's commitment to the provision of\r\n\r\nbasic  housing in the form of subsidised HDB  flats.   We\r\n\r\nare  not  touching  our basic housing  safety  net.   Our\r\n\r\nhousing  subsidies  have enabled  the  vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to own their own homes.  When we started  in\r\n\r\n1960, 9% of Singaporeans lived in public housing.  Today,\r\n\r\nit is 85%.  Almost all of them, or 96% of them, own their\r\n\r\nflats.   Concessionary  loans are  a  key  instrument  to\r\n\r\npromote  home  ownership.   Hence,  the  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to provide HDB loans at concessionary rates  to\r\n\r\neligible buyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with this move, the Government is indeed\r\n\r\npulling back the safety net a little bit at the edges for\r\n\r\nthose  who  should not need the safety net in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace.  They are the financially better off, they are the\r\n\r\nones  who  already have a flat.  And who are  we  talking\r\n\r\nabout?   Specifically, we are talking about non-citizens.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about the private property owners.  We are\r\n\r\ntalking  about  the high-income owners.  We  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  the  second or even third-timers  who  are  either\r\n\r\nmoving  sideways or downgrading.  They are not those  who\r\n\r\nare buying a flat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  time.  I believe this is  the  group  of\r\n\r\npeople  whom Mr Ahmad Khalis was most concerned about  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech.   And  they  are  not  the  people  who  are\r\n\r\nupgrading to a second flat when they are ready to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not tenable for Government to continue to\r\n\r\nmaintain  such a wide safety net such that people  become\r\n\r\nover-dependent on Government and are unable  to  exercise\r\n\r\nindividual responsibility.  This move will give them more\r\n\r\nflexibility.  But, as I said, at the same time, they must\r\n\r\nbe  prepared to exercise more responsibility, as Dr Chong\r\n\r\nWeng  Chiew mentioned just now, and as Dr Amy Khor agreed\r\n\r\nwith.  It is in line with what we have been talking about\r\n\r\nin   remaking   Singapore  -  how   to   encourage   more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship and more risk-taking, how to let  people\r\n\r\ntake  more responsibility in their lives, how to be  more\r\n\r\ndependent   on  themselves  rather  than  on  Government.\r\n\r\nHowever,  let me assure Members that we are  not  yanking\r\n\r\naway  the  safety net from those who need  it.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  maintain  our  home  ownership  policy   by\r\n\r\nproviding subsidised loans for subsidised flats, so  that\r\n\r\neligible  Singaporeans  can afford  good  quality  public\r\n\r\nhousing.   To  ensure that this remains so,  the  changes\r\n\r\nannounced  yesterday will not apply to  such  buyers.   I\r\n\r\nwish  to assure Dr Ong Chit Chung that the social compact\r\n\r\nbetween  Government and people that he talked about  will\r\n\r\nnot be diminished by these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, like banks, the HDB today already conducts\r\n\r\ncredit   evaluation  for  most  buyers  before   granting\r\n\r\nmortgage  loans.  As a result of this, the  arrears  rate\r\n\r\nfor  HDB  market rate loan is not excessive.   Government\r\n\r\nwill continue to encourage prudence and responsibility in\r\n\r\nhousing  purchases,  regardless of whether  the  loan  is\r\n\r\nprovided  by HDB or by banks.  While it is probably  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  HDB  is  more forbearing  than  banks  in  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  arrears, I must inform Members  that  HDB\r\n\r\ndoes  exercise its right to take back the flats when  the\r\n\r\nlessees  are in arrears and are unlikely to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrepay their loans, although such cases are not that many.\r\n\r\nIt is important for buyers to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  exercise prudence.  We have  cases  of  HDB\r\n\r\nmortgagors  running into arrears within a few  months  of\r\n\r\ntheir  flat purchases.  In one case, the lessee was  only\r\n\r\nable  to  service  two instalments before  he  went  into\r\n\r\ntrouble, and that was for his third HDB flat.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nHDB  must constantly review its own mortgage policies for\r\n\r\nflat  buyers who clearly do not have the means to service\r\n\r\ntheir mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with bank origination, HDB flat buyers should\r\n\r\nexercise greater financial prudence before taking up bank\r\n\r\nloans.   We  cannot expect the banks to behave like  HDB.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  their social responsibility to  do  so.   We\r\n\r\ncannot, for example, tell the banks not to foreclose  for\r\n\r\nhardship   cases,   as  suggested   by   Dr   Amy   Khor.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,   the   Government  recognises   that   bank\r\n\r\norigination is a very significant move for some HDB  flat\r\n\r\nbuyers and, therefore, intends to keep certain safeguards\r\n\r\nintact, in their place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Mr Ravindran that the current\r\n\r\nprotection  clause  in the Housing  and  Development  Act\r\n\r\nagainst third party creditors will be retained.  We  have\r\n\r\nno  intention of changing this.  This ensures  that  flat\r\n\r\nbuyers and their families do not lose the roof over their\r\n\r\nheads as a result of claims by third parties, other  than\r\n\r\nthe  banks, in the event that the owners become bankrupt.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, we will continue to disallow a HDB flat  to\r\n\r\nbe  used as collateral for purposes other than to finance\r\n\r\nits  purchase.  In other words, one cannot, for instance,\r\n\r\nmortgage the flat to raise capital for business ventures.\r\n\r\nThe refinancing of existing loans will also be capped  at\r\n\r\nthe outstanding loan amount.  So, these measures will  be\r\n\r\nadopted for prudential reasons and they will minimise the\r\n\r\nrisk of default in mortgage payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, some Members have suggested that Government\r\n\r\nshould provide a safety net for those who lose their  HDB\r\n\r\nflats due to foreclosure by the banks.  I do not think it\r\n\r\nmakes  sense for us to pull back the safety  net  in  one\r\n\r\nform and then replace it in another form, in the form  of\r\n\r\nsubsidised rental housing.  I would like to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstress  again that the individual must exercise care  and\r\n\r\nprudence  in deciding what type of flat he wants  to  buy\r\n\r\nand   how  much  he  wants  to  borrow  from  the   bank,\r\n\r\nparticularly  if it is for the purchase  of  his  second,\r\n\r\nthird or even fourth flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think Members here will know\r\n\r\nthat  HDB  looks at all appeal cases carefully and  where\r\n\r\nthere  are deserving cases, HDB will bend over backwards,\r\n\r\nforward,  sideways, as Mr Ahmad Khalis put it, to  render\r\n\r\nappropriate assistance.  So, I do not think that Dr  Lily\r\n\r\nNeo has anything to worry about that she no longer has  a\r\n\r\nrole to play.  She will have a lot of things to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Members were also concerned that CPF Board\r\n\r\nwould  rank  second  to  the mortgagee  for  bank  loans,\r\n\r\ndespite  the need to safeguard CPF savings for retirement\r\n\r\nneeds.  As DPM Lee explained yesterday, allowing banks to\r\n\r\nstand first is very necessary for prudential reasons.  In\r\n\r\naddition, I would like to point out that in the  case  of\r\n\r\nHDB  flats, there is really no change to the status  quo,\r\n\r\nbecause  HDB  currently already has first charge  on  the\r\n\r\nmortgage  loans that it lends out, followed by CPF  Board\r\n\r\nstanding second.  So, the banks will merely step into the\r\n\r\nshoes  of HDB and take first charge on the mortgage  when\r\n\r\nthey  grant  loans to HDB flat buyers, come  1st  January\r\n\r\n2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the changes related to the imposition of\r\n\r\nvaluation  limits  and cash downpayment requirements  are\r\n\r\nnecessary and major changes.  So, it is prudent that they\r\n\r\nbe phased in slowly to allow HDB flat buyers to adjust to\r\n\r\nthem.   Capping CPF withdrawals for housing purchases  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  encourage  prudent  housing  purchase  and\r\n\r\nsafeguard CPF savings for retirement.  The limit has been\r\n\r\nset  at  150% of the property value initially,  gradually\r\n\r\ngoing  down  to 120% over five years.  These limits  will\r\n\r\napply to HDB flat buyers who take loans from banks.   But\r\n\r\nthey  will not apply to the new market rate loans granted\r\n\r\nby HDB between 1st September 2002 and 31st\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDecember  2002;  in  other  words,  this  year.   As  the\r\n\r\nvaluation limits will be gradually phased in, they should\r\n\r\nnot have a significant impact on the HDB resale market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat buyers taking loans from banks will pay a\r\n\r\nminimum  10% cash downpayment, so that there is a  buffer\r\n\r\nto protect their CPF savings against losses in case of  a\r\n\r\ndown  market.  Again, there will be ample time given  for\r\n\r\nHDB  flat  buyers  to get used to this cash  downpayment,\r\n\r\nbecause we will be phasing it in over five years.   There\r\n\r\nwill be no change, come 1st January 2003; in other words,\r\n\r\nzero  cash  payment will continue from 1st January  2003.\r\n\r\nThe  cash  payment will then be imposed,  two  percentage\r\n\r\npoints   from  1st  January  2004,  increasing   by   two\r\n\r\npercentage points a year until we reach 10% in 2008.   So\r\n\r\nlong  as  borrowers  do  not over-stretch  themselves,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  should  be  no problems  with  this  cash\r\n\r\ndownpayment requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will work with CPF, MAS, the banks and other\r\n\r\nrelevant  agencies on the administrative and  operational\r\n\r\nissues  to  ensure that the transition from HDB  to  bank\r\n\r\noriginated loans will be a smooth one.  Flat buyers  will\r\n\r\nbe fully informed and they will be advised on the changes\r\n\r\nso   that  they  can  benefit  from  this  move  to  bank\r\n\r\norigination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, bank origination of HDB market\r\n\r\nrate  loans  is  a  major step towards injecting  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility into the public housing market.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  it  allows  the private sector  to  take  over  an\r\n\r\nactivity  which  is not part of HDB's core responsibility\r\n\r\nof  providing  basic affordable public  housing.   So  it\r\n\r\ngives  flat buyers more choice and it allows HDB to focus\r\n\r\non what it does best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I believe it is in the right direction.\r\n\r\nTogether  with the changes that we will make in the  CPF,\r\n\r\nthis  will  ensure  that  our  home  ownership  programme\r\n\r\nremains  relevant  in  the years  ahead  and  our  public\r\n\r\nhousing  market  can  cope  with  the  challenges   going\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I be\r\n\r\nallowed to seek a clarification?

I believe that is so.\r\n\r\n<br>5.14 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance\r\n\r\n(Mr Lee Hsien Loong):  Mdm Deputy Speaker, it has been  a\r\n\r\nlong  debate and I shall be brief.  I would like to  take\r\n\r\nup  just  three  or  four  points  which  have  not  been\r\n\r\naddressed by the two Ministers and then wind up with some\r\n\r\ngeneral remarks on the whole thrust of this approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the 50-55 age group. This is the key and\r\n\r\nmost controversial recommendation in the ERC report -  to\r\n\r\ncap the employer's CPF contribution for this age group at\r\n\r\n16%.   What  is not challenged, and what all the  Members\r\n\r\nagree,  is  that  older workers in  this  age  group  are\r\n\r\nvulnerable.   They  are vulnerable  to  competition  from\r\n\r\nlabour  forces elsewhere, better educated or  less  paid.\r\n\r\nThey  are  vulnerable because their education and  skills\r\n\r\nlevels  are lower than younger workers, and also  because\r\n\r\nthe seniority-based wage system ends up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaying   them   more  than  productivity  can,   strictly\r\n\r\nspeaking,  justify.  The question is how  to  solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  Training and skills upgrading, that is a given.\r\n\r\nWe  need to do it, but it is not easy.  And if you  heard\r\n\r\nMr Nithiah Nandan, you will know that it is a slog.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to bring wage costs in line with, or at\r\n\r\nleast,  more in line with, productivity.  We will  tackle\r\n\r\nthe  seniority-based wage system.  But doing  that  is  a\r\n\r\nprolonged and arduous process.  Because the labour market\r\n\r\nis  inflexible downwards, not just in Singapore  but,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  everywhere.   Because  if  we  are  talking  about\r\n\r\nbringing   down  people's  wage  levels,   the   national\r\n\r\npsychological resistance is very, very strong.   Even  if\r\n\r\nsomeone has lost a job, and has agreed to accept a  lower\r\n\r\npay  for  a  new  job, he has to overcome a psychological\r\n\r\nhurdle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To undo the seniority-based system, either the older\r\n\r\nworkers must get paid less than now, or have their pay go\r\n\r\nup  not  as  fast as the younger workers and as  fast  as\r\n\r\nproductivity.   Hopefully, over a period  of  time,  this\r\n\r\nwill  narrow the gap and reduce the problem.  But neither\r\n\r\nis  easy  to  accept.   To bring down  wages  immediately\r\n\r\ngenerates a strong psychological reaction.  To go up less\r\n\r\nslowly   than  other  people  will  generate   the   same\r\n\r\npsychological reaction, as we can see when we are talking\r\n\r\nabout  the non-restoration of CPF in this case.   We  are\r\n\r\nnot  talking  about bringing down the CPF rate.   We  are\r\n\r\njust  saying,  hold  it while the CPF  rates  go  up  for\r\n\r\nothers,  and your wages will go up in time.  But this  is\r\n\r\nnot easy to accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF adds to wage costs, because it is a\r\n\r\ncompulsory  scheme.  I did not use to  believe  this.   I\r\n\r\nused  to  argue  that  the  CPF is  the  worker's  money.\r\n\r\nPutting $1 into his account, it is the same as paying him\r\n\r\n$1,  and  he does not mind.  And the employer should  not\r\n\r\nmind too.  So it is not a tax.  But, actually, the worker\r\n\r\ndoes mind.  The worker prefers $1 taken home, instead  of\r\n\r\n$1  locked up on his behalf.  Because what he took  home,\r\n\r\nhe  could  save if he wishes.  What is locked up  on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf, he cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspend even if he wants to.  So when you impose the CPF on\r\n\r\ntop   of   wages,   particularly   the   employer's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate, in fact, you are adding to wage  costs\r\n\r\nand adding to the inflexibility of the wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for older workers who are most vulnerable, the\r\n\r\nless you do this, the less problem you are going to cause\r\n\r\ntheir  employment prospects.  In fact, because wages  are\r\n\r\nseniority-based and the CPF is a percentage of the wages,\r\n\r\nwhen  everybody  has a 20% rate of CPF contribution  from\r\n\r\nthe  employers,  the older workers have a  higher  burden\r\n\r\nthan  the younger workers.  So this is a good reason  why\r\n\r\nif  you  want to lower the burden on employment of  older\r\n\r\nworkers,  we have to lower the CPF contribution rate  for\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said it is unconstitutional and that it is\r\n\r\nan   enormity  which  has  just  been  perpetrated   upon\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   But  there  is  nothing   new   in   this\r\n\r\nprinciple.  Already, there is a step-down at 55 and there\r\n\r\nis  another  step-down at 60.  What we are saying  is  to\r\n\r\nstart   stepping  down  at  55,  in  terms  of  the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate, is a little bit late.  Let  us  start\r\n\r\nstepping  down at the age of 50.  So from 40%, below  50;\r\n\r\nyou  go to 32%, when you cross 50; and then to 20%,  when\r\n\r\nyou reach 55.  So there are even steps downwards in order\r\n\r\nto  help  workers adjust, and in order to help keep  them\r\n\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four percent on the employer's CPF is not going to\r\n\r\nmake a big, or immediate, difference to retrenchment  and\r\n\r\nhiring  decisions.  It is not a quick fix.  But it  is  a\r\n\r\nstep in the right direction.  The employers who have been\r\n\r\ninterviewed, none of them want to take the flak and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is going to help me.\"  So they say, \"Well, 4%\r\n\r\nis neither here nor there.  I don't need this.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Seng Han Thong said just now, \"If you do not\r\n\r\nneed  it,  why  don't you contribute it to  the  workers'\r\n\r\nwelfare fund?\"  I would put an opposite argument, just to\r\n\r\nthink through this exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSupposing we had taken literally the argument,  which  Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer  Lee  made  yesterday,  to  say,  reducing   the\r\n\r\npressure  is  bad because then you will not  address  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based  wage  system.  We  should  increase  the\r\n\r\npressure.  Supposing we had then said that, in  order  to\r\n\r\nincrease the pressure, we will raise the CPF contribution\r\n\r\nrate for this group from 20% to 24%.  Can you imagine the\r\n\r\nrow,  the uproar, the outrage, the anxiety and the  extra\r\n\r\nburden  which is put on older workers, and  how  that  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  impact  the  employers  and,  therefore,   the\r\n\r\nemployees?   It is still the same 4%.  But  I  think  the\r\n\r\npsychological effect would have been different.  Now,  we\r\n\r\nare talking about reducing it by 4%, from 20% to 16%.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  small adjustment, but it is an adjustment  in  the\r\n\r\nright direction, and one which will help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also reducing the employee's contribution by\r\n\r\n4%,  from 20% to 16%.  Members have not discussed this  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal, but it is a significant move too.   In  most\r\n\r\ncases,  when we reduce the employee's contribution  rate,\r\n\r\nit will flow straight through to higher take-home pay for\r\n\r\nthe  worker.  It will not affect the employer.   But,  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases, if the employer is facing a tough  situation\r\n\r\nand   if  he  has  to  retrench,  I  think  a  lower  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  will  make it easier for  the  employer  to\r\n\r\npersuade the worker to accept a wage cut, keep his  take-home  pay  constant, reduce total wage cost and keep  his\r\n\r\njob.   Without  that, wage cut means less take-home  pay.\r\n\r\nWith that, there is some scope for adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by reducing the combined CPF contribution rate to\r\n\r\n32%  for  this age group, we are actually making the  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem less inflexible.  And we are not intervening  more\r\n\r\ninto the labour market.  We are intervening less into the\r\n\r\nlabour  market by offsetting part of the negative effects\r\n\r\nof  the  seniority-based system.  And we  are  making  it\r\n\r\neasier for older workers to hold on to their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This non-restoration is part of the move to a more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  wage  structure in Singapore.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nreduce the statutory component, not as a substitute\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor greater wage flexibility, but as part and parcel of a\r\n\r\nbroader shift.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have to start doing this now. We can address\r\n\r\nthe  problems of the present cohort of the  50-55s.   The\r\n\r\ncivil  service has got the TCTC.  It is a catchy acronym.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the idea also catches on.  It is not  a  problem\r\n\r\nwhich  is  upon  us today, but it is a problem  which  is\r\n\r\ncoming  upon us which we can see and we can either  start\r\n\r\naddressing  it  now, or we can talk about  it,  and  then\r\n\r\npostpone  the  problem for 4-5 years.  I  discussed  this\r\n\r\nwith  several of the union MPs before we decided on this.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  said,  the alternative for us is to  say,  \"Let's\r\n\r\npostpone  this  problem.  Restore to  40%.   After  that,\r\n\r\ngradually  bring it back down again because I would  have\r\n\r\ngiven  due  warning, 4-5 years would have  passed  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  take  another five years to bring it down.   Would\r\n\r\nyou prefer that?\"  And they said, \"No.  You know there is\r\n\r\na  problem.  You are at the point when people accept that\r\n\r\nthings have to be changed.  Better change now.\"  Over  10\r\n\r\nyears, any number of mishaps can come along.  We may have\r\n\r\nanother  crisis  come our way, better to  get  this  done\r\n\r\nwith, and past.  And that is why we are proposing to  act\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue, which I would like to address\r\n\r\nbriefly, is bank loans - the question of charge reversal.\r\n\r\nSeveral  MPs  have  asked why we need  to  do  this.   Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran  said  the present system of CPF  having  first\r\n\r\nlien  is fundamentally sound.  Dr Lily Neo asked why  fix\r\n\r\nit if it ain't broke.  I can understand this because this\r\n\r\nis an arrangement which we have made for 21 years and now\r\n\r\nwe   have  decided  to  change  the  arrangement.    But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, there is a need to change the arrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic reason is this. As things now stand, when\r\n\r\nyou  have  a  mortgage loan, it is not really  a  secured\r\n\r\nloan.   A secured loan means that when you borrow,  there\r\n\r\nis a house, the house is a surety.  If you do not service\r\n\r\nthe  loan, the house is available and it can be sold  and\r\n\r\nthe  bank can recover its money.  Therefore, the bank has\r\n\r\nconfidence.  But as it stands today, the CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nranks  first.  And it is not just 10% or 20% of the value\r\n\r\nof  the  house which is the CPF's claim, but all of  your\r\n\r\nCPF money you put into the house month by month, year  by\r\n\r\nyear, stands first, and stands more and more at the front\r\n\r\nand grows every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as you service the loan, as the loan matures, far\r\n\r\nfrom the bank feeling relieved that the journey is nearly\r\n\r\nover,  in fact, the bank is getting into a more and  more\r\n\r\nserious   position  when  its  loan  is  less  and   less\r\n\r\ncollateralised.  This is fine if your property  value  is\r\n\r\nincreasing because then, although you put money  in,  the\r\n\r\nvalue  increases even more and there is always a  buffer.\r\n\r\nAnd  before  you get into trouble, you sell the  property\r\n\r\nand move on to another project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the property value falls, which is not\r\n\r\ninconceivable, then beyond a point, the mortgage may  not\r\n\r\nbe  collateralised at all because the CPF you have put in\r\n\r\nmay  be worth more than the current value of the property\r\n\r\nafter  five  or seven years.  And then the bank  actually\r\n\r\nhas an unsecured personal loan in everything, but name.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We start off with the 20% cash buffer when you buy a\r\n\r\nhouse.  It is a requirement which MAS imposed in 1996 and\r\n\r\nwhich   we  have  stringently  adhered  to  despite   any\r\n\r\nentreaties, pleadings, demands, requests, we  just  said,\r\n\r\n\"no\".   Because we knew we were in a vulnerable  position\r\n\r\nand we needed this 20% cash buffer at the bottom.  It  is\r\n\r\na  buffer for the bank and, then beyond that, buffer  for\r\n\r\nthe  CPF.   But  because the CPF claim  builds  up  quite\r\n\r\nquickly  within  five  or  six  years,  the  cash  buffer\r\n\r\nactually  is  reduced to zero, unless the property  value\r\n\r\nhas gone up.  So the cash buffer is necessary, but it  is\r\n\r\nnot sufficient.  We have not had a serious problem up  to\r\n\r\nnow.   Firstly, because property values have  appreciated\r\n\r\nsteadily  over the last couple of decades, and typically,\r\n\r\npeople  have  resold properties frequently.  On  average,\r\n\r\nfrom  bank  mortgages, the duration is only  five  years,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  on average, every five years,  people  sell\r\n\r\ntheir  property, they pay off their mortgage, they go  on\r\n\r\nto  buy  a new property.  But going forward, this is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to be the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason we have not had a problem so far\r\n\r\nis  because, even though some of the mortgages are  under\r\n\r\nwater,  people have continued to service their mortgages.\r\n\r\nIt  is partly a cultural thing.  You feel that it is your\r\n\r\nduty to pay back the loan, and not just to default on it.\r\n\r\nAnd  partly  it  is  our good luck that our  unemployment\r\n\r\nrates are not that high and most people are working  and,\r\n\r\nas  long as he is working, the customer will service  the\r\n\r\nloan.  But that is not the experience in other countries.\r\n\r\nIn  America, if your loan is under water, you  ask,  \"Why\r\n\r\nshould  I  bust my guts out?  I return the  keys  to  the\r\n\r\nbank,  and  good luck to the bank.\"  Now,  if  ever  that\r\n\r\nhappens  to Singaporeans, we are in very serious trouble.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have to reverse the lien.  The CPF is  your\r\n\r\nown  money.  You are borrowing from the bank.   The  bank\r\n\r\nhas to come first before you and therefore CPF.  Just  as\r\n\r\nyou  borrow from HDB, HDB has to come first.  So you must\r\n\r\npay back the bank before you get back your own money.  It\r\n\r\nis a basic principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, refinancing. Mr Leong Horn Kee suggested\r\n\r\nallowing  refinancing of existing loan not to be  subject\r\n\r\nto the Valuation Limit.  We have examined this in detail.\r\n\r\nThe  arguments  go  both ways.  It is  not  a  very  tidy\r\n\r\nsituation because the old loans were on one set of  rules\r\n\r\nand the new loans are put on to a different set of rules,\r\n\r\nreversal  of  lien plus the Valuation Limit.   But  after\r\n\r\nmuch deliberation, we have decided in MAS that if you are\r\n\r\nrefinancing with another bank, then the new mortgage must\r\n\r\nbe  subject to the Valuation Limit, because there will be\r\n\r\na  new agreement.  The new agreement has to have a charge\r\n\r\nreversal and you must have the bank standing first, which\r\n\r\nis  different from the status quo where the  bank  stands\r\n\r\nsecond.   We  cannot allow the CPF to have second  charge\r\n\r\nand,  on  top  of that, to have the CPF not capped  by  a\r\n\r\nValuation Limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are going to a second bank to refinance\r\n\r\nyour  loan,  then new rules will apply.  We also  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  the second bank to make a new mortgage on old terms\r\n\r\nand  have the CPF rank ahead, in which case, the  problem\r\n\r\nwhich was with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  first  bank is now taken and has moved to  a  second\r\n\r\nbank, and we will be in a situation where you do not know\r\n\r\nwhere  the  bad  loans are and the bad  loans  are  being\r\n\r\nshuffled  around.   So, if we have a refinancing  with  a\r\n\r\nsecond bank, then the new mortgage will be subject to the\r\n\r\nValuation Limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, if your current bank is willing to\r\n\r\nvary  and  improve  the  terms of the  mortgage,  without\r\n\r\nreversing  the  lien  position,  and  without  having  to\r\n\r\nconclude a new agreement, it is between you and your bank\r\n\r\nand the CPF is not involved, then we will allow that.  It\r\n\r\nis  not entirely what Mr Leong Horn Kee hoped for, but it\r\n\r\nis what is practical to do in this situation and, I hope,\r\n\r\nwill be of some help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I make a few\r\n\r\nremarks on the overall philosophy of this exercise.   The\r\n\r\nCPF is a critical part of our social safety net.  It is a\r\n\r\ngood  system.   It is based on individual  responsibility\r\n\r\nand  on  self-funding.  It is comprehensive.   It  covers\r\n\r\nretirement  as well as housing and medical expenses.   It\r\n\r\nallows  members  a very wide range of investment  choices\r\n\r\nand, if we allow pension funds, an even wider range.   It\r\n\r\nenables Singaporeans to own homes, gives them a stake  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and substantial savings, whose value they  will\r\n\r\nwant to protect.  So, they will not take a chance with  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  which will devalue our currency  or  let  the\r\n\r\ncountry go down the drain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is a unique system. It evolved in special\r\n\r\ncircumstances during the period of our economic take-off.\r\n\r\nIt  was  built  up  over  many  years,  starting  at  10%\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  in  1955, long  before  independence.\r\n\r\nAfter  independence, we built up the  contribution  rates\r\n\r\nsteadily year by year.  At the time of our economic take-up  when the economy was growing at 8%, 9%, 10%, 12%  per\r\n\r\nyear, wages went up correspondingly, and we put aside 2%,\r\n\r\n3%,  sometimes 4%, a year into the CPF as wages went  up,\r\n\r\nin  order to enable Singaporeans to own their homes.   By\r\n\r\n1984 - which was nearly 20 years after\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindependence - we had built up the rate from 10% to  50%.\r\n\r\nBut  we could not keep it there.  The following year,  we\r\n\r\nhad a sharp recession, we had to bring the rate back down\r\n\r\nall the way to 35% to get out of the recession.  Then  we\r\n\r\nbuilt it back up again painfully.  This time, we did  not\r\n\r\naim for 50%; we aimed for 40%.  It took us six years.  We\r\n\r\ngot there in 1991.  But when the Asian crisis struck,  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  reduce the rate in 1998, and we had to bring  it\r\n\r\ndown to 30% again.  Now we are back to 36%, hoping to get\r\n\r\nback to 40% over the next 2-4 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we lose this unique institution, we will never\r\n\r\nget  it  back again.  Therefore, we have to build on  and\r\n\r\npreserve this system.  Every country needs to provide for\r\n\r\nthe  retirement needs of its people.  Our system is based\r\n\r\non  savings.  In other countries which do not  have  high\r\n\r\nsavings  rates and a CPF-type system, their  solution  is\r\n\r\ntax  - social security based on tax or on social security\r\n\r\ncontributions  -  pay as you go.  In  other  words,  this\r\n\r\ngeneration of young people pays tax to contribute to  the\r\n\r\npension  for  the current generation of old people.   And\r\n\r\nwhen  they themselves grow old, they had better hope that\r\n\r\nthere  are  enough young people who are  willing  to  pay\r\n\r\nenough  taxes  to  meet their needs.  It creates  serious\r\n\r\nproblems of solvency and sustainability.  It has done  so\r\n\r\nin  Europe.   The Americans have had their share  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems.  Our CPF avoids that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee recommendations will\r\n\r\nadjust the balance in the CPF between the retirement  and\r\n\r\nhousing needs.  It will focus the scheme on the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  central group of Singaporeans, ie, those between the\r\n\r\n10th  and the 80th income percentiles, and it will reduce\r\n\r\nthe  negative impact of too high a CPF rate on the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   These are very important improvements  to  the\r\n\r\nCPF system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB changes are also a significant policy shift.\r\n\r\nIt  is not just a matter of banks offering lower mortgage\r\n\r\nrates  than the HDB can.  The issue is how extensive  our\r\n\r\nhousing   safety   net  should  be,  and   how   we   can\r\n\r\nprogressively allow and encourage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  be  more  self-reliant,   rather   than\r\n\r\ndepending on the Government for many of their needs.  The\r\n\r\ncore of our home ownership policy remains unchanged.  But\r\n\r\nat the margins we need to adjust, not only to free up the\r\n\r\nhousing  market, but to have Singaporeans make their  own\r\n\r\ndecisions, and take responsibility for them.  If  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking  about  being entrepreneurial, taking  risks,  or\r\n\r\nabout   people   being   self-reliant,   answering    for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  then  we have to be self-propelled  and,  we\r\n\r\nhave to be, to a much greater extent than before, on  our\r\n\r\nown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By shifting to bank origination, and allowing banks\r\n\r\nto  take first charge when granting housing loans, we are\r\n\r\ntaking just one important step in this direction.  We are\r\n\r\ntaking  it  carefully, we know there are risks,  we  know\r\n\r\nthere will be consequences, and there will be some people\r\n\r\nwho  will  still think there is a safety net.   And  when\r\n\r\nthey  realise there is not one, they will try and  create\r\n\r\none,  and may look for Dr Lily Neo and the other  Members\r\n\r\nto  ask  for one.  But these are problems which  we  will\r\n\r\nhave to manage in the context of our moving forward to  a\r\n\r\nmore   self-reliant  system.   And  today's  move  is   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  step,  as  far as a housing  safety  net  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank all Members for participating in this\r\n\r\ndebate  and I beg leave, Mdm Deputy Speaker, to  withdraw\r\n\r\nthe Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CURRENCY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>5.38 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nMdm  Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Government announced its\r\n\r\nplans  to  merge the Board of Commissioners of  Currency,\r\n\r\nSingapore (BCCS) with the Monetary Authority of Singapore\r\n\r\n(MAS).  The merged entity\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould still be called the MAS.  This is an organisational\r\n\r\nchange to streamline our institutional structure.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be  no change in the way currency is managed.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar notes and coins that are  currently  in\r\n\r\ncirculation  will  continue to be  fully  backed  by  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Background</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCCS was set up in 1967 to implement the currency\r\n\r\nboard  system,  which  Singapore  then  practised.    The\r\n\r\nfeatures  of the currency board system were:  first,  the\r\n\r\nexchange rate was fixed between the domestic currency and\r\n\r\na  specified foreign currency; second, domestic notes and\r\n\r\ncoins  were fully convertible at the fixed exchange rate;\r\n\r\nand  third,  the  domestic currency was fully  backed  by\r\n\r\nforeign assets or gold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has progressively evolved away from the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  a  fixed  exchange rate since  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar  was floated in 1973.  In 1982, convertibility  of\r\n\r\ndomestic  currency notes and coins into  gold  and  other\r\n\r\nforeign  currencies on demand was repealed.   Today,  the\r\n\r\nexchange rate of the Singapore dollar is managed by  MAS,\r\n\r\nagainst  a  basket  of  currencies of  our  main  trading\r\n\r\npartners, with the objective of keeping inflation low and\r\n\r\nmaintaining the purchasing power of the Singapore dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only feature of the currency board system that\r\n\r\nwe  have  retained  is the full backing  of  currency-in-circulation  by  external assets.   Hence,  Singapore  no\r\n\r\nlonger  operates a currency board system, except for  the\r\n\r\nfull   backing  of  currency-in-circulation.    This   is\r\n\r\nrequired  under the Currency Act, and has contributed  to\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the Singapore dollar.  This  feature  will\r\n\r\nnot  change  after  the  merger.  Currency-in-circulation\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be fully backed by external assets  all\r\n\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a broader perspective, confidence in the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar exchange rate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nderives  from  the  consistency  and  soundness  of   our\r\n\r\nmonetary  and  fiscal policies, as well  as  our  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves.  The merger of MAS and BCCS will enable  us  to\r\n\r\nrationalise  common  functions  and  realise   efficiency\r\n\r\ngains,  without compromising the overriding objective  of\r\n\r\nmanaging the currency and maintaining confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar.  MAS will become a full-fledged central\r\n\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks legislative amendments to the\r\n\r\nCurrency Act to effect the merger of MAS and BCCS.   This\r\n\r\nBill also contains other amendments which are intended to\r\n\r\nupdate  and  streamline certain procedures and provisions\r\n\r\nin the Currency Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now highlight the main amendments\r\n\r\nproposed in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>BCCS Funds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Currency Act requires that the face\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the currency issued by BCCS must be  at  least\r\n\r\n100%  backed by external assets in the Currency Fund.   A\r\n\r\nseparate fund - the Currency Reserve Fund - serves  as  a\r\n\r\nbuffer  for  the  Currency Fund,  as  the  value  of  the\r\n\r\nexternal  assets  that  make up  the  Currency  Fund  may\r\n\r\nfluctuate.   All  dividends, interest, or  other  revenue\r\n\r\nfrom the Currency Fund and the Currency Reserve Fund  are\r\n\r\npaid  into a Currency Fund Income Account.  All  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred by BCCS are charged to this Currency Fund Income\r\n\r\nAccount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the merger, the Currency Fund and the Currency\r\n\r\nReserve  Fund will be combined into one fund, which  will\r\n\r\nstill be called the Currency Fund.  The new Currency Fund\r\n\r\nwill  continue to provide at least 100% backing  for  the\r\n\r\ncurrency-in-circulation at all times.   Clause  6  amends\r\n\r\nsection 21 to provide that assets in the Currency Fund in\r\n\r\nexcess   of  100%  of  the  face  value  of  currency-in-circulation could be transferred to MAS' other  funds  at\r\n\r\nany time.  Section 21 is also amended to provide that any\r\n\r\ndeficiencies  in the Currency Fund will be made  up  from\r\n\r\nMAS'  funds.  If MAS' funds are insufficient, the balance\r\n\r\nof  the  deficiency will be paid out of the  Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 repeals sections 22A and 23 pertaining to\r\n\r\nthe  Currency Reserve Fund and the Currency  Fund  Income\r\n\r\nAccount.   Under  the new arrangement,  income  from  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Fund will be ploughed back to the Currency  Fund\r\n\r\nitself,  and  expenses arising from  currency  issue  and\r\n\r\ninvestments will be charged against the Currency Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Definition of Legal Tender</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 13 provides the legal tender\r\n\r\nlimits  for  the various denominations of  the  currency.\r\n\r\nThe notes and coins issued by BCCS are legal tender up to\r\n\r\nthe  value  specified in section 13 for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ndischarging any debt or paying for goods and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, BCCS has regularly received queries\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public  regarding  the  definition  of  \"legal\r\n\r\ntender\".  Some members of the public were unclear whether\r\n\r\nmerchants could refuse to accept certain coins  of  small\r\n\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment for goods and services is essentially a\r\n\r\ncontractual  agreement  between a  willing  buyer  and  a\r\n\r\nwilling  seller.   Neither party can be forced  to  enter\r\n\r\ninto a transaction unless he willingly does so.  In order\r\n\r\nto  clarify the intent and purpose of the law,  clause  5\r\n\r\nwill amend section 13 to allow a merchant to specify that\r\n\r\nhe  will not accept one or more denominations of notes or\r\n\r\ncoins  as  payment  for his goods or  services.   If  the\r\n\r\nmerchant does not specify any conditions on how he  would\r\n\r\nlike to be paid, then he must accept legal tender for the\r\n\r\nsettlement of the debt, or else the debt may be forgiven.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments in this Bill are part of the\r\n\r\nlegislative amendments required to implement  the  merger\r\n\r\nof BCCS with MAS.

It was last amended in April 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Act for the purpose of\r\n\r\nestablishing a Cheque Truncation System, or CTS in short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Overview of Cheque Truncation System (CTS)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by giving an overview and benefits of\r\n\r\nthe  Cheque Truncation System.  Singaporeans have written\r\n\r\nan  average of more than 83 million cheques a  year  over\r\n\r\nthe  last  10 years.  In 2001, the figure was 92 million.\r\n\r\nSignificant costs are incurred by the banking industry to\r\n\r\nclear  these  cheques.  Today, after  a  bank's  customer\r\n\r\ndeposits  a cheque at his bank, also referred to  as  the\r\n\r\npresenting  bank,  the bank will batch it  together  with\r\n\r\nother   cheques  and  transport  them  to  the  Automated\r\n\r\nClearing  House.   The  Clearing  House  then  sorts  the\r\n\r\ncheques  for  the  respective paying  banks  to  collect,\r\n\r\nwhereupon  each paying bank verifies whether the  cheques\r\n\r\ncan be paid.  If the cheque\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot  be  paid, it is then returned to  the  presenting\r\n\r\nbank in the same way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the banking industry in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  introduced new technologies to improve  this  cheque\r\n\r\nclearing process.  An example of this is the magnetic-ink\r\n\r\ncharacter recognition (MICR) information on cheques  that\r\n\r\nbanks  have  been exchanging to facilitate faster  cheque\r\n\r\nclearing.   However, physical cheques are still  required\r\n\r\nby   the   paying  bank  because  they  need  to   verify\r\n\r\ninformation such as dates and signatures on the cheques.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cheque Truncation System, to be launched later\r\n\r\nthis  year,  leverages  on  new imaging  technology  that\r\n\r\nenables  banks to exchange electronic images of  cheques.\r\n\r\nCheques   will  be  scanned  when  deposited  and   their\r\n\r\nelectronic  images  will  be transmitted  throughout  the\r\n\r\nentire clearing cycle.  The new system will use a private\r\n\r\nnetwork  with  public  key cryptography  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nimages  are  encrypted and transmitted  securely  between\r\n\r\nbanks.   In  addition, the system includes a  centralised\r\n\r\nimage  archive  for  banks to store and  retrieve  cheque\r\n\r\nimages.   Since a cheque image contains all the necessary\r\n\r\ninformation  required  by  a  paying  bank  to  determine\r\n\r\nwhether  the  cheque can be paid, there is no  longer  an\r\n\r\noperational  necessity  for them  to  have  the  physical\r\n\r\ncheque.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill contains amendments to allow banks to\r\n\r\npresent a cheque by electronic means in place of physical\r\n\r\npresentment.  This Bill will also recognise the rights of\r\n\r\na  holder  of an Image Return Document, or IRD in  short,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  document that banks will issue  instead  of\r\n\r\nreturning   the  original  cheque  when   a   cheque   is\r\n\r\ndishonoured.   The amendments have been drafted  so  that\r\n\r\nunder  the new process, the respective rights and  duties\r\n\r\nof the various parties to a cheque will be the same as at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other jurisdictions have passed, or are in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  passing, similar amendments to their  cheque\r\n\r\nlegislation.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom has allowed the clearance and payment  of\r\n\r\ncheques    using   magnetic-ink   character   recognition\r\n\r\ninformation  instead of physical presentment since  1996.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve Board is in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  getting Congress to enact a Check Truncation\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain the proposed amendments in\r\n\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Allowing   electronic  presentment  to  replace  physical presentment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill introduces section 87A that\r\n\r\nwill  allow  the  presentment between banks  to  be  done\r\n\r\nthrough  electronic  transmission  of  cheque  image  and\r\n\r\npayment  information  instead  of  the  physical  cheque.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  paying bank will still have the  right  to\r\n\r\ndemand that the physical cheque be presented instead,  if\r\n\r\nit deems it necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Image Return Document (IRD)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 also introduces section 87B, which will\r\n\r\nallow  for  the presenting bank to issue an Image  Return\r\n\r\nDocument  (IRD) instead of returning the original  cheque\r\n\r\nto  its  customer  if  the cheque is dishonoured  by  the\r\n\r\ndrawer's bank.  An IRD is a banking document bearing  the\r\n\r\nimage   of   the  cheque  together  with  other   related\r\n\r\ninformation.   However,  if  the  customer  requires  the\r\n\r\noriginal cheque, he or she can still request it from  the\r\n\r\nbank.   The  bank may also choose to return the  original\r\n\r\ncheque  instead of issuing an IRD.  If the holder of  the\r\n\r\nIRD  deems that the reason for the original dishonour  is\r\n\r\nno  longer  valid, for instance, the original cheque  was\r\n\r\npost-dated  or the account had insufficient  funds,  this\r\n\r\nholder  can  present  the IRD for  payment  at  the  same\r\n\r\npresenting  bank as if the IRD were the original  cheque.\r\n\r\nThe Bill also gives a person who has lost an IRD the same\r\n\r\nrights  of recourse against the drawer that are currently\r\n\r\navailable to a person who has lost a cheque.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 49 to allow an IRD to serve\r\n\r\nas a notice of dishonour to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe drawer of the cheque, as per a dishonoured cheque  in\r\n\r\ntoday's  context.  The holder of the IRD will be able  to\r\n\r\nuse the IRD to notify the drawer that the cheque has been\r\n\r\ndishonoured.   The  holder can then  request  for  a  new\r\n\r\ncheque from the drawer if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 86 of the Act to clarify\r\n\r\nthat the new cheque truncation provisions in the Act that\r\n\r\nare  applicable  to  cheques will  also  apply  to  other\r\n\r\ninstruments such as cash cheques and banker's drafts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of section 87C of the Act will allow\r\n\r\nthe   Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore  (MAS)  to  make\r\n\r\nregulations  relating  to  cheque  truncation  with   the\r\n\r\napproval  of the Minister.  MAS intends to prescribe  via\r\n\r\nregulations, the electronic payment information  required\r\n\r\nwhen  a  cheque  is  presented  electronically  and   the\r\n\r\nparticulars contained in an IRD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has incorporated the various comments that\r\n\r\nMAS has received through consultation with public bodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Cheque Truncation System\r\n\r\nwill   enhance   the   banks'  efficiency   by   reducing\r\n\r\ntransportation  and  microfilming  costs,  thus  allowing\r\n\r\nbanks to offer new services to customers.  The amendments\r\n\r\nin   this  Bill  will  enable  banks  to  keep  up   with\r\n\r\ntechnological changes and help Singapore move to  a  more\r\n\r\nefficient payment system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that under the Cheque Truncation System,  the\r\n\r\nphysical cheque is deposited with the presenting bank but\r\n\r\nis  no  longer transported physically to the paying  bank\r\n\r\nfor   verification.   Instead,  the  cheque  is   scanned\r\n\r\nelectronically into the CTS and the image is  transmitted\r\n\r\nto  the  paying bank for clearance. At the paying  bank's\r\n\r\nend, the signature\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  be verified based on the electronic image  of  the\r\n\r\nscanned cheque and the customer's specimen signature.  If\r\n\r\nthe  signature  tallies,  the  presenting  bank  will  be\r\n\r\nnotified  and funds will be paid to the payee's  account.\r\n\r\nIf  a cheque is dishonoured, the original cheque need not\r\n\r\nbe   returned  unless  it  is  requested.   Instead,   an\r\n\r\nelectronic image of the dishonoured cheque will be  given\r\n\r\nback to the holder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that we are the first in the world to\r\n\r\nadopt this system.  My concerns are:  is it secure?   Are\r\n\r\nthere  adequate  safeguards  against  electronic  frauds?\r\n\r\nUnder  the current paper-based system, cheque frauds  can\r\n\r\nbe  committed  when  someone gets hold  of  the  physical\r\n\r\ncheque  and forges the signature, figures, etc,  and  the\r\n\r\nofficer  at  the paying bank did not detect the  physical\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the CTS, I would like to know firstly, how\r\n\r\nfoolproof  are  the safeguards against  hacking?   Is  it\r\n\r\npossible  for  outsiders to hack into the  system,  steal\r\n\r\nimages of signatures and scan them into other documents?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what systems are in place in the banks to\r\n\r\nensure that there is no internal fraud, for instance,  to\r\n\r\nprevent  employees, who are authorised to handle archived\r\n\r\nsignatures,    from   misusing   the    signatures    and\r\n\r\nmisappropriation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will verifying against an electronic image\r\n\r\nbe  less  accurate  than verifying  against  an  original\r\n\r\ncheque?  I suppose that for any kind of electronic image,\r\n\r\nit is more or less not as accurate as the original one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, who is making the decision whether to\r\n\r\nclear  the cheque, ie, whether the signature matches  the\r\n\r\nspecimen that the customer has with the bank?  Is it by a\r\n\r\nhuman being, like a bank officer, or is it automated?  If\r\n\r\nit  is automated, then how stringent are the criteria for\r\n\r\nmatching  as opposed to human judgment?  If  it  is  more\r\n\r\nstringent,  then it will lead to dishonouring of  cheques\r\n\r\ncaused  by variation in the customer's signature  due  to\r\n\r\nnatural process.  We all understand that our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsignature  may  not always be the same.  If  it  is  less\r\n\r\nstringent, then the system is less safe than the  current\r\n\r\nsystem.   Will  the banks be underwriting the  customer's\r\n\r\nlosses under CTS?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would also like to know what\r\n\r\nevaluation system has been conducted to ascertain that it\r\n\r\nwill work.  What is the confidence level of the result of\r\n\r\nthis  evaluation,  because we are  changing  to  quite  a\r\n\r\ndrastic system of clearance?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me congratulate the Member\r\n\r\nfor  displaying  a tremendous knowledge  of  the  system.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, although Singapore may be the first country\r\n\r\nto  adopt this system as a whole, because we are a  small\r\n\r\ncountry,  it is therefore easy for us to implement.   But\r\n\r\nin  many countries, this system is implemented by a group\r\n\r\nof  banks or within a state.  He is partially right  that\r\n\r\nwe are the first country to adopt this system nationally.\r\n\r\nBut  this  technology and practice is  fairly  widespread\r\n\r\nbetween groups of banks or within states.  As I mentioned\r\n\r\nin  my  speech, countries like the UK or US  are  already\r\n\r\nprogressing to make this a national system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that security is of paramount\r\n\r\nimportance to the Cheque Truncation System.  I can assure\r\n\r\nMembers  here that much effort has been put in to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  infrastructure is fully trusted  and  secured.\r\n\r\nThe  cheque  images that are captured  at  the  point  of\r\n\r\ndeposit   are  sealed  and  encrypted  before  they   are\r\n\r\ntransmitted,  and  therefore they are tamper-proof.   The\r\n\r\npresenting  bank  will  also take the  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nensure that the scanned cheque images are of sufficiently\r\n\r\ngood  quality for the paying bank to rely on  for  cheque\r\n\r\nverification.  The whole idea of this system is  that  we\r\n\r\nare  handling more than 80-90 million cheques and we need\r\n\r\nvery good technology for the images for verification  and\r\n\r\nautomation.   But, at the same time, we  must  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat the customers have confidence in the system and,  to\r\n\r\ndo so, the system that the banks\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  put  together  has  to  comply  with  international\r\n\r\nstandards of security and of encryption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signature matching is done by matching the\r\n\r\nimages and the specimen signature.  Human intervention is\r\n\r\navoided  unless there is a controversy.  The  Association\r\n\r\nof Banks, in implementing this system, has taken relevant\r\n\r\nsteps to bring this system progressively.  This has  been\r\n\r\nworked  on  for many years.  We started in the middle  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, and it will only be fully implemented  around\r\n\r\nOctober  this  year. They have gone through  the  system.\r\n\r\nThey  have  verified it.  I agree with  the  Member  that\r\n\r\nsecurity is of the utmost importance, so that people have\r\n\r\nconfidence in the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Do the banks underwrite to\r\n\r\ncover losses of customers if there is a problem with  the\r\n\r\nCTS?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If there is any doubt with the\r\n\r\ncheque  and  it  is  dishonoured and  sent  back  to  the\r\n\r\noriginal  drawer, then, of course, the person can  verify\r\n\r\nwhether the reason for the dishonoured cheque is valid or\r\n\r\nnot  -  whether  it is because of the date,  insufficient\r\n\r\nfunds or that the signature does not match, in which case\r\n\r\nhe  can  go through the same processes today to  get  the\r\n\r\ndrawer  to  re-issue the cheque.   I  do  not  think  the\r\n\r\nprocesses  of writing cheques and verifying cheques  have\r\n\r\nchanged  by  the process of introducing this new  system.\r\n\r\nThis  is  just a way of using technology to  replace  the\r\n\r\nhuman  verification that goes on today in  our  automated\r\n\r\nclearing system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am referring to a case of\r\n\r\nforgery.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I said, the system has not\r\n\r\nchanged  compared to present practices.

The driving  licence\r\n\r\nserves  as  a reference document not just for the  Police\r\n\r\nbut  also other interested parties like insurance and car\r\n\r\nrental   companies,  overseas  traffic  authorities   and\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing driving licence has remained unchanged\r\n\r\nsince 1969.  It is made of paper, flimsy, and awkward  to\r\n\r\ncarry  around  in  standard  card  holders.   Unlike  the\r\n\r\ndriving  licences of many other countries,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nbear a photograph of the licence holder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current system, drivers are required to\r\n\r\nrenew  their  licences once every  one  or  three  years,\r\n\r\npaying  a  fee  of $20 or $60 respectively.   Each  year,\r\n\r\napproximately  700,000 people renew their licences,  with\r\n\r\nabout  62%  of  drivers renewing their licences  for  one\r\n\r\nyear,  while  the  remaining 38% of drivers  renew  their\r\n\r\nlicences for three years.  This current system of regular\r\n\r\nrenewals was introduced a long time ago when the lack  of\r\n\r\ncomputer  technology  made it difficult  to  retrieve  or\r\n\r\ncheck  licensing records that were more than three  years\r\n\r\nold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes to amend the Road Traffic Act to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  new driving licence.  This driving  licence\r\n\r\nwill  be  durable,  credit-card sized  and  will  bear  a\r\n\r\nphotograph of the licence holder.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew  driving  licence will also be  valid  for  life  for\r\n\r\nSingaporean citizens and permanent residents.  Technology\r\n\r\nnow  allows  Traffic Police to maintain  licence  records\r\n\r\nover  long  periods  of time.  This  system  of  lifetime\r\n\r\ndriving  licences is already in place in several European\r\n\r\ncountries,  such as Belgium, France, Germany, Norway  and\r\n\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, foreigners who convert their native driving\r\n\r\nlicences  to the new photocard driving licence  will  not\r\n\r\nreceive the lifetime licence, but one that is valid for a\r\n\r\nmaximum  period of five years.  This is because  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  will not be working in Singapore after five  years.\r\n\r\nThey will not need the Singapore licence when they do not\r\n\r\nlive  and work here anymore.  If they do, they can  renew\r\n\r\ntheir licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road safety will not be compromised by the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the new lifetime driving licence.  As  is\r\n\r\nthe  case now, elderly drivers will still be required  to\r\n\r\nundergo  regular medical checks at age 60, 63  and  every\r\n\r\nyear  thereafter to certify their fitness  to  drive,  in\r\n\r\norder to retain their licences.  The Traffic Police  also\r\n\r\nhas  several  measures in place to  revoke,  suspend  and\r\n\r\ndisqualify the licences of incompetent drivers,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe Driver Improvement Points System.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new photocard driving licence will be introduced\r\n\r\nin  December this year.  Existing drivers will only  need\r\n\r\nto  obtain  the  new driving licence upon the  expiry  of\r\n\r\ntheir existing paper driving licences.  For example, if a\r\n\r\nmotorist currently holds a licence that expires  in  July\r\n\r\n2003,  he  will only be able to obtain the new  photocard\r\n\r\ndriving licence in July next year.  There is therefore no\r\n\r\nneed  to  rush  to obtain the new driving  licence.   All\r\n\r\ndrivers will be able to obtain it progressively, as their\r\n\r\nexisting paper licences expire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the new driving licence will\r\n\r\nbring  greater  convenience and reduce cost  for  licence\r\n\r\nholders.  Motorists will only pay a fee of $50 to  obtain\r\n\r\nthe  new driving licence, instead of the $20 or $60  they\r\n\r\npay  every one or three years currently.  Traffic  Police\r\n\r\ninformed me that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmost drivers obtain their driving licence around the  age\r\n\r\nof  21.   If  they drive until the age of 60, they  would\r\n\r\nhave to pay a total of $780 over the years to renew their\r\n\r\nlicence,  under the current system of periodic  renewals,\r\n\r\nassuming, of course, the fee remains unchanged at $20 per\r\n\r\nyear,  and assuming that they stop driving at  60.   With\r\n\r\nthe  new  driving  licence, they only have  to  pay  $50,\r\n\r\nprovided  they  do  not  lose  or  damage  their  driving\r\n\r\nlicence.   Motorists will also no longer  need  to  worry\r\n\r\nabout the hassle of renewing their licences every year or\r\n\r\nevery  three years.  If their licence is lost or damaged,\r\n\r\nthen they would have to pay $25 for a replacement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will affect a large number of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   and   Members'  constituents   may   have\r\n\r\nquestions regarding the new driving licence.  The Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  will  send a letter to every household  informing\r\n\r\nthem  about the changes.  They will also post a  list  of\r\n\r\nquestions  and  answers  on  their  Internet  website  to\r\n\r\nexplain the details.  I had earlier on asked the Clerk of\r\n\r\nParliament  to distribute to all Members a  copy  of  the\r\n\r\nquestions and answers, and the press release on  the  new\r\n\r\ndriving   licence.   I  hope  Members  will  find   these\r\n\r\nmaterials useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deletion  of section 62A (2) and section 62A (3)  of  the Road Traffic Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also taking the opportunity to delete some\r\n\r\nobsolete  sections in the Road Traffic Act.  In 1990,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  introduced section 62A(1) to  disallow  drivers\r\n\r\nabove  70  years of age from driving heavy vehicles.   At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  we  gave elderly drivers a three-year  grace\r\n\r\nperiod,  up  till  April 1993, to comply  with  this  new\r\n\r\nprovision.   This  was to ensure that no  elderly  driver\r\n\r\nwould  suddenly  be  deprived of a livelihood.   Sections\r\n\r\n62A(2)  and  (3) provided for this 3-year  grace  period.\r\n\r\nNow  that  the  grace  period is  long  over,  these  two\r\n\r\nprovisions are therefore obsolete and will be repealed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to emphasise that section 62A(1)\r\n\r\nstill remains in force, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  changed  our stand on disallowing  drivers\r\n\r\nabove 70 years of age from driving heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced measures against hit-and-run drivers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Road Traffic Act is also amended to enhance the\r\n\r\nmeasures  we  can take against hit-and-run drivers.   The\r\n\r\nnumber   of  hit-and-run  cases  involving  injuries   or\r\n\r\nfatalities  remains  high.  There  were  179  hit-and-run\r\n\r\ncases  in  the year 2000, and 154 cases in  2001.   These\r\n\r\nfigures were higher than any of the preceding years since\r\n\r\n1993.   The  act  of  hitting a person  and  driving  off\r\n\r\nwithout   stopping  is  wholly  unacceptable.   This   is\r\n\r\nespecially  so  when such a failure to render  assistance\r\n\r\ncan  mean  the difference between life and death  to  the\r\n\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to enhance the measures against\r\n\r\nhit-and-run drivers in the following ways:\r\n\r\n.     Firstly, the Deputy Commissioner of Police will  be\r\n\r\nempowered to suspend the licence of a driver charged  for\r\n\r\nfailing to stop in an accident, which has caused death or\r\n\r\nserious  injury, while he awaits court trial.  Under  the\r\n\r\nRoad Traffic Act, a serious injury means any injury which\r\n\r\ncauses  a  person to be in severe bodily pain, or  to  be\r\n\r\nunable to follow his ordinary lifestyle, for a period  of\r\n\r\nseven days, as certified by a medical doctor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will enhance the penalty for hit-and-run drivers by making it mandatory for the court to\r\n\r\ndisqualify a person convicted of a hit-and-run case, from\r\n\r\nholding  or obtaining a driving licence for at  least  12\r\n\r\nmonths from the date of conviction.\r\n\r\n.     Thirdly,  Police officers will be given  powers  of\r\n\r\narrest,  search and seizure without a warrant in hit-and-run  cases.  This power is crucial as investigations into\r\n\r\nthese   cases   are  time-sensitive.    In   past   cases\r\n\r\ninvestigated  by the Traffic Police, the  Traffic  Police\r\n\r\nhave found drivers who would attempt to replace or remove\r\n\r\ndamaged parts of their cars to evade\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narrest.   For example, in one case, a hit-and-run  driver\r\n\r\nhad  tried  to evade arrest by replacing his car's  front\r\n\r\nbumper,  bonnet and side mirror, which had  been  damaged\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  accident.  With the powers  of  arrest,\r\n\r\nsearch  and  seizure  without a  warrant  in  hit-and-run\r\n\r\ncases,  the  Police  would be able to  swiftly  search  a\r\n\r\nsuspect's  car and seize any evidence before  the  driver\r\n\r\ntries  to  dispose  of  it.  Such  powers  are  therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary  to prevent offenders from tampering  with  any\r\n\r\nevidence of the offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a person convicted of hit-and-run where\r\n\r\ndeath  or serious injury is caused can expect to be fined\r\n\r\nup  to  $3,000 and/or imprisoned for a term of up  to  12\r\n\r\nmonths.   However, there is currently a disparity between\r\n\r\nthe  penalties  for drink-driving and  hit-and-run.   The\r\n\r\nexisting penalties for drink-driving are a fine of up  to\r\n\r\n$5,000  and/or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months,\r\n\r\nand  mandatory disqualification from driving all  classes\r\n\r\nof vehicles for a period of 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This disparity between the penalties may result in a\r\n\r\ndrink-driver  who causes an accident to flee  the  scene.\r\n\r\nIf the culprit driver surrenders himself to the Police or\r\n\r\nis traced through Police investigations after the alcohol\r\n\r\nin  his body has subsided several hours later, the Police\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  able to prove that the driver was  driving\r\n\r\nunder  the  influence of alcohol, as his  blood  specimen\r\n\r\nwill  not indicate the presence of alcohol.  In this way,\r\n\r\na drink-driver who flees the accident scene will not face\r\n\r\nmandatory disqualification of his driving licence even if\r\n\r\nhe  had caused death or serious injury in the hit-and-run\r\n\r\naccident.   To  address this, the amendment to  introduce\r\n\r\nmandatory disqualification of the driving licence in  the\r\n\r\ncase of hit-and-run drivers where death or serious injury\r\n\r\nis  caused, will create parity in the penalties for  both\r\n\r\ndrink-driving and hit-and-run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, these measures will make our\r\n\r\nroads safer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I rise to speak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\nI  particularly  welcome  the  move  to  provide  driving\r\n\r\nlicences for life at a reasonable cost announced  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  $50.   I  do hope that the  Minister  would\r\n\r\nconsider  free licences, as is the case with ICs  or,  at\r\n\r\nleast, on a cost recovery basis for such licences.   But,\r\n\r\nI  suppose,  $50 would be regarded by most as  reasonable\r\n\r\nfor a life-time licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the powers of suspension of licences which\r\n\r\nhave been increased as far as the Deputy Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice is concerned.  This is a very necessary power  but\r\n\r\nmust be used judiciously.  This is especially so when the\r\n\r\ndriver  is  the sole breadwinner of the family  and  when\r\n\r\ndriving  is  a necessary part of his work.   Very  often,\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  would have to write to Traffic  Police  to\r\n\r\nreview the suspension of drivers whose family incomes are\r\n\r\nseriously affected when the drivers are suspended.  While\r\n\r\nI  am,  of  course, not questioning the need for  such  a\r\n\r\npower or the exercise of it in appropriate circumstances,\r\n\r\nI  would  hope  that  there will be at  least  an  appeal\r\n\r\nprocedure set up for the driver to take when he wishes to\r\n\r\ncontest suspension.  Decisions made must be consistent as\r\n\r\nthis is a quasi-judicial function and made only after due\r\n\r\nconsideration is given to the seriousness of the offence,\r\n\r\nthe driving record of the driver concerned and the effect\r\n\r\nsuch an suspension has on the driver and his family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to ask the Minister to look\r\n\r\ninto  the rule that says that after a driver is suspended\r\n\r\nfor a reasonably long period such as a year and above, he\r\n\r\nor she must retake the road test.  While I agree that the\r\n\r\ndriver must show proficiency in driving after such a long\r\n\r\nlayoff, I would also like to suggest that they be allowed\r\n\r\nto take the test, and perhaps an amended test, as soon as\r\n\r\nthe  period of suspension ends, instead of waiting in the\r\n\r\nqueue  with  the others.  This has frequently meant  that\r\n\r\nthey are actually suspended for a longer period currently\r\n\r\nwhile waiting for the test.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIn   many  instances,  their  income  has  already   been\r\n\r\nseriously affected and this prolongs the suspension  even\r\n\r\nmore.   The suspended driver should be allowed to  return\r\n\r\nto  driving  within a reasonable period  and  that  means\r\n\r\nproviding a test as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Traffic Police and LTA have been doing a\r\n\r\ngood  job in educating the driving community to drive  or\r\n\r\nride  with care and not to speed.  It would seem that  in\r\n\r\nmany  instances, the public education campaigns  may  not\r\n\r\nhave  had  the desired effects and I would hope that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would  still look into new  ways  of  educating\r\n\r\ndrivers,  especially those booked for speeding  offences.\r\n\r\nSuspension  should  be  used only  on  the  most  serious\r\n\r\noffences  with  the  demerit  system,  and  with  certain\r\n\r\noffences  having  their  points  increased,  it  is  easy\r\n\r\nespecially  for  those who drive for  a  living  to  fall\r\n\r\nwithin  the suspension range.  I believe we should review\r\n\r\nthe system to see whether before suspension, a driver can\r\n\r\nhave  sufficient  warning about his poor  driving  record\r\n\r\nand,  if  needed, educate as to how he may  be  a  better\r\n\r\ndriver before he commits another offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Madam Deputy Speaker, regarding\r\n\r\nthe  power given to the Deputy Commissioner of Police  to\r\n\r\nsuspend  the driving licence of a person who  is  charged\r\n\r\nfor  hit-and-run where death or serious injury is caused,\r\n\r\nsuch  power is not new.  In the case of a person  charged\r\n\r\nfor  causing  death or serious injury to  another  person\r\n\r\nwhile  under  the  influence of drink  driving,  reckless\r\n\r\ndriving or dangerous driving, the Deputy Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice  already  has such powers.  But I can  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the  Deputy Commissioner will  exercise  his\r\n\r\npower  to  suspend the driving licence  judiciously.   It\r\n\r\nwill  only  be  invoked  if the errant  driver  has  been\r\n\r\ncharged  for an offence of hit-and-run.  He will  not  be\r\n\r\nsuspended if he has not been charged.  The moment  he  is\r\n\r\ncharged, then, of course, the Deputy Commissioner has the\r\n\r\npower to suspend the licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the suspension or disqualification of a\r\n\r\nperson's driving licence may cause some hardship  to  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  especially  if the person makes  his  living  by\r\n\r\ndriving,  such suspension or disqualification of  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  is  necessary in the interest of safety  of  all\r\n\r\nother road users.  Suspension or disqualification takes a\r\n\r\ndangerous  driver off the roads and, therefore,  it  will\r\n\r\nensure  that  other  road users are protected  from  such\r\n\r\npeople.  Of course, the person who is to be suspended can\r\n\r\nalways  make  an  appeal.  The Deputy  Commissioner  will\r\n\r\nconsider the appeal.  But when considering the appeal, he\r\n\r\nwill  be very cautious in not putting a dangerous  driver\r\n\r\nback on the roads again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who have been suspended or disqualified from\r\n\r\ndriving  for  a year or more are required to  retake  the\r\n\r\ndriving  test, as is currently the case.  This is because\r\n\r\nthese  are  persons  who have already  committed  serious\r\n\r\ntraffic  offences.   By  requiring  them  to  retake  the\r\n\r\ndriving test, it will then ensure that they have improved\r\n\r\non  their  skills  and  they have changed  their  driving\r\n\r\nhabits  before they are allowed to get on  to  the  roads\r\n\r\nagain.   In the case of a person who makes his living  by\r\n\r\ndriving, the Traffic Police is always prepared to help to\r\n\r\nspeed  up his retest if he has a case to ask for an early\r\n\r\ntest.  But that depends on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked whether under the demerit point\r\n\r\nsystem,  we warn drivers about their poor driving  record\r\n\r\nif  they  have  a poor driving record.  Indeed,  this  is\r\n\r\nalready  done  by  the Traffic Police.   Under  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act,  the  Traffic Police is  required  to  warn\r\n\r\ndrivers  by giving them notice in writing when  a  person\r\n\r\naccumulates  50% of the maximum number of demerit  points\r\n\r\nat which suspension will be imposed.  More importantly, I\r\n\r\nwould  say  for  such people who have to  make  a  living\r\n\r\nthrough driving, they should be more careful on the roads\r\n\r\nand  not  to do anything that may cause danger  or  great\r\n\r\nharm  to  other  motorists or road users, so  that  their\r\n\r\nlicence would not be suspended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of educating the motorists, I think\r\n\r\nevery year the Traffic Police\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconducts road safety campaigns.  People do not pay  heed.\r\n\r\nThey  think  that they are safe drivers, until  they  get\r\n\r\ninto  trouble.   For  those who speed anyway,  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to speed until they get caught.  While we try to\r\n\r\neducate  them as much as possible, basically  it  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of the drivers to be courteous on the road,  to\r\n\r\ngive way to other people and to consider the interest  of\r\n\r\nother  road users as well.  I hope that our motorists  on\r\n\r\nour  roads  can be as courteous as some of the others  in\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>6.22 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b>\r\n\r\nMdm  Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Industrial Relations Act (Cap. 136)\r\n\r\nprovides for the regulation of the relations of employers\r\n\r\nand  employees and the prevention and settlement of trade\r\n\r\ndisputes  by  collective  bargaining,  conciliation   and\r\n\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing laws, executive employees are already\r\n\r\nallowed  to  form  their own unions  to  represent  their\r\n\r\ninterests  and  engage  in  collective  bargaining   with\r\n\r\nemployers.  However, the current Industrial Relations Act\r\n\r\nprohibits  rank-and-file trade unions to seek recognition\r\n\r\nin   representing   employees  holding   managerial   and\r\n\r\nexecutive    positions.     The   Industrial    Relations\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill presented to the House today would allow\r\n\r\nrank-and-file  unions  to  represent  certain   executive\r\n\r\nemployees in limited areas.  However, representation will\r\n\r\nnot be enabled for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  executive  employees  entrusted  with  substantial\r\n\r\nmanagerial  and decision-making responsibilities  as  the\r\n\r\nemployer  is  granted  the  right  to  object  to   their\r\n\r\nrepresentation by the rank-and-file unions.  This  is  to\r\n\r\navoid  conflicts  of  interest  and  consequent  loss  of\r\n\r\nmanagement effectiveness and flexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive employees can only be represented by the\r\n\r\nrank-and-file  unions  in disputes concerning  dismissal,\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits and breach of individual  contract.\r\n\r\nI  also  like to point out that representation is allowed\r\n\r\nonly on an individual basis.  There will be no collective\r\n\r\nbargaining   rights   for   executive   employees    when\r\n\r\nrepresented by rank-and-file unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major review of the Act was carried out in\r\n\r\n1968.   The  1968 amendments restored certain  management\r\n\r\nrights  to  employers  and  put  in  place  a  collective\r\n\r\nbargaining, conciliation and arbitration system which has\r\n\r\nenabled  Singapore to achieve industrial harmony  through\r\n\r\ntripartite cooperation for the past three decades.   This\r\n\r\nBill   will  further  strengthen  the  harmonious  labour\r\n\r\nrelations that Singapore has enjoyed over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments presented in the Bill are in line\r\n\r\nwith  recommendations  from the Tripartite  Committee  on\r\n\r\nUnion  Representation of Executives formed  in  September\r\n\r\n1999  and  chaired  by  the then Minister  of  State  for\r\n\r\nManpower,  Mr  Othman Haron Eusofe.   During  the  months\r\n\r\npreceding the formation of this Tripartite Committee, our\r\n\r\neconomy was in severe recession following the 1997  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis.  That recession saw a higher incidence\r\n\r\nof  retrenchment  of  both  executive  and  rank-and-file\r\n\r\nemployees.    While   their   rank-and-file   colleagues,\r\n\r\nespecially those represented by trade unions,  were  paid\r\n\r\nreasonably good compensation by their employers based  on\r\n\r\nthe company's financial position, industry norm and years\r\n\r\nof  service, some executives and managers received little\r\n\r\nor  no compensation.  Consequently, dissatisfaction among\r\n\r\nthem grew.  Since executive employees are not covered  by\r\n\r\nthe Employment Act, their only legal recourse\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas  under the Common Law.  Civil litigation is, however,\r\n\r\na  costly affair.  The desire to form executive unions to\r\n\r\nprovide  them  with  a lower cost alternative  for  their\r\n\r\ndisputes therefore increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was against this backdrop that the Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Union  Representation  of  Executives  was\r\n\r\nappointed.  In its deliberation, the Committee noted that\r\n\r\nthe  profile of our local workforce had changed with more\r\n\r\nemployees  joining the executive ranks.  Correspondingly,\r\n\r\nthe  rank-and-file membership would dwindle, giving  rise\r\n\r\nto  concern  that the trade union movement  led  by  NTUC\r\n\r\nmight reduce in relevance, if that trend persisted.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee also noted that as the number of executives and\r\n\r\nmanagers grew larger, the formation of executive  unions,\r\n\r\nand  hence  increase  in the number of  unions  within  a\r\n\r\nworkplace,   would   be  inevitable.    This   would   be\r\n\r\nundesirable  as  multiple unions, by their  very  nature,\r\n\r\ntend  to  represent the interests of different groups  of\r\n\r\nemployees.   Indeed,  the experience of  other  countries\r\n\r\nconfirms  that  the  dynamics arising  from  many  unions\r\n\r\nwithin  a workplace hinders labour-management cooperation\r\n\r\nand teamwork resulting in lowered productivity.  Within a\r\n\r\nsingle  union, the interests of employees could be better\r\n\r\nharmonised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriately, the Committee recommended that\r\n\r\ncertain   executives  and  managers  should  be   allowed\r\n\r\nrepresentation  by rank-and-file unions to  provide  them\r\n\r\nwith  an  additional  avenue to  seek  remedy  for  their\r\n\r\ndisputes.   To  address  employers'  concern  that   such\r\n\r\nrepresentation  would give rise to conflict  of  interest\r\n\r\nand  undermine  management effectiveness,  the  Committee\r\n\r\nsensibly  recommended  that senior management  staff  and\r\n\r\ncertain   core   management  personnel   could   not   be\r\n\r\nrepresented.   These included those involved  in  hiring,\r\n\r\nfiring,  promotion,  dismissals and disciplinary  duties;\r\n\r\nthose  with access to confidential information,  such  as\r\n\r\npayroll  and  budgeting information; those who  represent\r\n\r\nemployers' interest in union-management matters and those\r\n\r\nwhose union affiliation would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngive  rise  to conflict of interest.  Executive employees\r\n\r\ncould  only be represented by rank-and-file union  on  an\r\n\r\nindividual,  but  not for collective bargaining  purpose.\r\n\r\nRepresentation should be limited to only three  areas  of\r\n\r\ndisputes, involving dismissal, retrenchment benefits  and\r\n\r\nbreach  of contracts.  Further, these executive employees\r\n\r\ncannot  be  involved in industrial action  although  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  allowed to hold union office  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nleadership  of  rank-and-file  unions.   The  Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been accepted by the Government  and\r\n\r\nnow form the basis of these legislative amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of these legislative amendments are\r\n\r\ngiven  in  the Explanatory Statement at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Now let me address the key features of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Representation of Executives by Rank-and-File Unions and Procedures for Negotiation and Conciliation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, as mentioned earlier, the\r\n\r\ncurrent  Industrial  Relations Act, specifically  section\r\n\r\n16(3), prohibits unions, the majority of whose membership\r\n\r\nconsists  of employees in non-managerial or non-executive\r\n\r\npositions,   that   is,   rank-and-file   unions,    from\r\n\r\nrepresenting   employees  in  managerial   or   executive\r\n\r\npositions.   As  it  is a departure from  section  16(3),\r\n\r\nclause  5  of the Bill inserts a new Part IIIA to  enable\r\n\r\nrank-and-file   trade   unions  to  represent   executive\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IIIA consists of six sections, ie, sections 30A\r\n\r\nto   30F.    While  section  30A  provides  the  required\r\n\r\ndefinitions  to  support  the  operation  of  Part  IIIA,\r\n\r\nsection 30B stipulates that an executive employee may  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  a  rank-and-file  union   only   on   an\r\n\r\nindividual  basis and limited to disputes  pertaining  to\r\n\r\ndismissal, retrenchment benefits and breach of contracts.\r\n\r\nSection  30B allows employers to raise objection to  such\r\n\r\nrepresentation on the ground that the executive  employee\r\n\r\nperforms, or exercises a function, duty or power that may\r\n\r\ngive rise to a real or potential conflict of interest  if\r\n\r\nhe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  she  is represented by the trade union.  The  section\r\n\r\nfurther  provides that, where an employer raises such  an\r\n\r\nobjection,  the  employer and trade union  shall  make  a\r\n\r\njoint application to the Industrial Arbitration Court for\r\n\r\narbitration,  if  the dispute cannot be  settled  through\r\n\r\nconciliation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 30C to 30F prescribe procedures to regulate\r\n\r\nnegotiation   and   conciliation  of   disputes   between\r\n\r\nexecutives who are represented and their employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Court to Take Cognizance of Trade Disputes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 31 by inserting a new\r\n\r\nparagraph  (ca)  to  allow  trade  disputes  relating  to\r\n\r\nretrenchment   benefits  and  breach  of   contracts   of\r\n\r\nexecutive  employees  to  be  submitted  to  arbitration.\r\n\r\nParagraph (ca) empowers the Industrial Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nto  take  cognizance of a trade dispute  related  to  the\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits payable to an executive  employee,\r\n\r\nor  a  breach of contract of employment by the  executive\r\n\r\nemployee, or his employer.  To enable the court  to  take\r\n\r\nsuch  cognizance of the dispute, either the  employer  or\r\n\r\nthe trade union representing the employee may make an exparte  application, or unilateral request, in writing  to\r\n\r\nthe Registrar.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Inducing Persons Not to Join Trade Unions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under section 79(2), an employer can\r\n\r\nrequire  an employee who is to be appointed, or promoted,\r\n\r\nto a managerial, or executive position, to cease to be an\r\n\r\nofficer  or member of a rank-and-file trade union.   This\r\n\r\nsection  will  be  amended to disallow an  employer  from\r\n\r\nimposing such a condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments to the Trade Unions Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill makes consequential amendments\r\n\r\nto  sections 27 and 39 of the Trade Unions Act.   Section\r\n\r\n27  is amended to prohibit a rank-and-file union and  its\r\n\r\nmembers  from participating in, or taking any  industrial\r\n\r\naction, in connection\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  any  trade  dispute  between  members  employed  in\r\n\r\nmanagerial  and  executive positions and their  employer.\r\n\r\nThe amendment will also prohibit members in executive and\r\n\r\nmanagerial  positions from participating in or commencing\r\n\r\nany industrial action taken by the trade union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 39 is amended by inserting subsection (1A)\r\n\r\nto prohibit rank-and-file trade unions from conferring to\r\n\r\nmembers employed in executive or managerial position  the\r\n\r\nright  to vote in secret ballot taken for the purpose  of\r\n\r\ncommencing a strike, or any form of industrial action.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Repeal of Section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, section 25 of the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Act has outlived its usefulness, and this would\r\n\r\nbe  an  appropriate  time for it  to  be  repealed.   The\r\n\r\nsection  prohibited collective agreements from containing\r\n\r\nterms  and conditions that are more favourable than those\r\n\r\ncontained  in  Part  IV of the Employment  Act.   It  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  1968  to  impose  a  ceiling  on  certain\r\n\r\nemployees'  benefits  which are contained  in  collective\r\n\r\nagreements.  These benefits in the collective  agreements\r\n\r\nare  now  in line with those in non-unionised sector  and\r\n\r\nare  determined by market forces.  Hence, the prohibition\r\n\r\nis no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill is introduced to repeal section\r\n\r\n25.   Consequent  on  the repeal of section  25,  section\r\n\r\n42(b) is also deleted, while sections 42(a) and 59(1) are\r\n\r\namended.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the Tripartite  Committee  on  Union\r\n\r\nRepresentation of Executives were formulated taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  concerns  of employers,  trade  unions  and\r\n\r\nexecutive employees.  To prevent conflict of interest and\r\n\r\nensure   that  management  effectiveness  would  not   be\r\n\r\nundermined,  safeguards have been introduced by  limiting\r\n\r\nthe   representation  of  executive  employees  to  three\r\n\r\npertinent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nareas on an individual basis and by allowing the employer\r\n\r\nto  object  to  the  representation of senior  management\r\n\r\npersonnel  and certain categories of executive employees.\r\n\r\nFurther,  employees  who  can be  represented  and  their\r\n\r\nunions as well as their rank-and-file colleagues are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  commence, or participate in  any  industrial\r\n\r\naction  in connection with a trade dispute affecting  the\r\n\r\nexecutive employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative amendments would serve the interest\r\n\r\nof the executive employees in that they will provide them\r\n\r\nwith  an additional and lower cost alternative to  settle\r\n\r\ntheir employment disputes.  The amendments will serve the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the rank-and-file unions as it would  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  enlarge  their membership and invigorate  their\r\n\r\nleadership.   The amendments also serve the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  employers as this will discourage the  formation  of\r\n\r\nmultiple  unions  at the workplace since  executives  can\r\n\r\nchoose  to  be  represented by the rank-and-file  unions,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  forming  executive  unions.   A  multi-union\r\n\r\nworkplace  could subject employers to tedious  collective\r\n\r\nbargaining processes, or costly and time-consuming  civil\r\n\r\nlitigation  to  settle  disputes.  As  representation  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to  three areas and allowed only  an  individual\r\n\r\nbasis  with  no collective bargaining rights,  management\r\n\r\neffectiveness   will  not  be  undermined.    Since   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  safeguards are in place, we do not  anticipate\r\n\r\nany  major problems during the process of implementation.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as with any new piece of legislation,  teething\r\n\r\nproblems  could arise.  It is envisaged that  with  close\r\n\r\ntripartite  cooperation and the release of the tripartite\r\n\r\nguidelines   to   facilitate  the  implementation,   such\r\n\r\nteething  problems  could be resolved amicably  with  the\r\n\r\ncommon goal of maintaining our industrial harmony for the\r\n\r\nbenefit of executive employees, unions, employers and the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nI support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road leading to this Bill has been a long one.\r\n\r\nThe labour movement here has, for a long time, called for\r\n\r\nboth  executives and rank-and-file workers to be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  join  the same union.  Although the current law  does\r\n\r\nnot  prevent executives from forming unions,  and  indeed\r\n\r\nthere  are  already  several executive  staff  unions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, executives however, under our law,  cannot  be\r\n\r\nrepresented by unions whose membership consists of  rank-and-file employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, executives, like rank-and-file\r\n\r\nworkers,  are  affected  by restructuring  in  companies.\r\n\r\nExecutives,  like rank-and-file workers, also  want  fair\r\n\r\ntreatment  in  the workplace.  Therefore,  executives  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  like executives in all other countries,  have\r\n\r\nfelt the need to be represented by trade unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement has not made much progress on\r\n\r\nthis  in  the  past.  Our current law takes the  position\r\n\r\nthat  executives should be able to look after  their  own\r\n\r\ninterests  as they are better educated and can  negotiate\r\n\r\nand  enter  into  employment contract by themselves.   We\r\n\r\nalso face resistance from employers.  The usual objection\r\n\r\nfrom  the  employers is that there will be  \"conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest\" on areas, such as management control, grievance\r\n\r\nand disciplinary matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, this concern is overstated. In\r\n\r\nSingapore, unions are not confrontational.  They act in a\r\n\r\nvery  responsible  manner.  While the situation  did  not\r\n\r\ncause  any  major problems in the past, it was  far  from\r\n\r\ndesirable.   It  became  pronounced  during   the   Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial   crisis.    We  see  more  executives   facing\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at some of the statistics. For\r\n\r\nthe  year 1998, the percentage of retrenched workers with\r\n\r\npost-secondary,  diploma  and degree  qualifications  was\r\n\r\ngetting higher.  It was at 20.8%.  For year 1999, it went\r\n\r\nup  to  27.4%.   And for last year, as  we  were  hit  by\r\n\r\nanother downturn, the percentage went even higher to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n30.2%.   And for this year, with only the first quarter's\r\n\r\nfigure, the percentage is 31.8%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, at the height of the Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis, the labour movement found an increasing\r\n\r\nnumber  of  executives coming to us for help.  They  were\r\n\r\nmainly  over  retrenchments, dismissals,  non-payment  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits and salaries.  The  problems  they\r\n\r\nfaced  were  no different from the rank-and-file  workers\r\n\r\nthat  our  unions  represent.  It was a clear  sign  that\r\n\r\nsomething must be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1999, I filed a question in Parliament and\r\n\r\nthe  Manpower Minister, Dr Lee Boon Yang, agreed that  we\r\n\r\nshould  review the law.  And here, we are today  debating\r\n\r\non the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, much has happened since 1999\r\n\r\nwhen  the  NTUC  first  started pushing  for  legislative\r\n\r\nchanges  of union representation for the executives.   We\r\n\r\nrecovered  from the Asian financial crisis only  to  find\r\n\r\nourselves in another downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the recession last year and even now, we\r\n\r\nagain  saw many executives looking for help, as I  showed\r\n\r\nyou  the  figures  just  now.   Although  executives  can\r\n\r\napproach MOM to assist in conciliation, there is  no  law\r\n\r\nto   compel   employers  to  respond  to   requests   for\r\n\r\nconciliation.  Executives who feel aggrieved  would  have\r\n\r\nto  resort  to costly legal action.  At that point,  some\r\n\r\nunion  leaders  wished the laws had been  amended.   They\r\n\r\nwished  they  could do more for the executives  who  were\r\n\r\nretrenched  or  faced  dispute  arising  from  breach  of\r\n\r\nemployment terms, but they felt helpless!  They asked why\r\n\r\nthe process took so long!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I have also wished that the laws had\r\n\r\nbeen  amended before this recession so that we would have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to do more for the executives who  have  been\r\n\r\naffected by the downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, we can expect workers to get better\r\n\r\neducated and the proportion\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  executives  will  increase.   The  amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Act will thus be timely.   It  will\r\n\r\nachieve a win-win-win outcome for workers, employers  and\r\n\r\nSingapore as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For junior executives, the amendment will allow them\r\n\r\nto  join  unions to protect their interest.  This expands\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of protection to those who are not  protected\r\n\r\nunder the current law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employers, they can continue to work with one\r\n\r\nunion   representing  all  their  workers,  rather   than\r\n\r\nmultiple   unions.   Having  one  union  will  strengthen\r\n\r\nindustrial  harmony,  and more  than  one  union  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace  does not promote teamwork.  This  will  expand\r\n\r\nthe  scope  and depth of partnership between  unions  and\r\n\r\ncompanies further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, the amendment will strengthen\r\n\r\nindustrial  harmony.   Executives can  seek  redress  for\r\n\r\ntheir  grievances  through the unions.   It  avoids  them\r\n\r\nhaving  to  seek  legal recourse,  which  is  costly  and\r\n\r\ndisruptive    to   industrial   harmony.    Strengthening\r\n\r\nindustrial  harmony  will give us a  greater  competitive\r\n\r\nedge  as  we seek to attract more investments and  create\r\n\r\nmore jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the changes to the Act is a\r\n\r\npositive step for industrial harmony in Singapore.  Thus,\r\n\r\nI support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the changing\r\n\r\nlandscape of the operating environment impacts us on many\r\n\r\nfronts.   To be able to maintain an effective and  value-add  employment  relations climate, it is  important  for\r\n\r\nboth  employers and employees to evolve a new  engagement\r\n\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, employers are having to deal with a\r\n\r\nmore  sophisticated and educated workforce.   Singapore's\r\n\r\nunique    tripartite   formula   and   the   increasingly\r\n\r\nprofessional  and  pragmatic  HR  practices   have   been\r\n\r\ninstrumental  in  providing a congenial work  environment\r\n\r\nand  nurturing  a  productive and competitive  workforce.\r\n\r\nThese  have contributed to attracting foreign investments\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is to address the outcry\r\n\r\nfrom  the  many  executives,  managers  and  professional\r\n\r\nstaff.   The last two recessions had seen many executives\r\n\r\nbeing  unfairly treated by their employers, some of  whom\r\n\r\nhad  even  faulted  on  payments.   These  professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives  and  managerial staff were  and  are  without\r\n\r\nrecourse to any institution other than the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is supposed to give the executives,\r\n\r\nprofessionals and managerial staff an avenue of  recourse\r\n\r\nat  MOM, as well as the Industrial Arbitration Court, but\r\n\r\nvia  the  trade union only.  While the intention  may  be\r\n\r\nclear,  the  Bill,  in  fact,  will  still  exclude  many\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  executives and managers.   Representation\r\n\r\nis  only  by a \"recognised trade union\".  But by defining\r\n\r\nthe  term  to  mean  a  union  that  \"has  been  accorded\r\n\r\nrecognition   by   an   employed   ...\",   an   aggrieved\r\n\r\nprofessional, executive or manager still does not have  a\r\n\r\nrecourse, if there is no union at his or her workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this amendment Bill is that it caters\r\n\r\nfor only the junior executives who are in companies where\r\n\r\nthere  are  unions that are already accorded recognition.\r\n\r\nAs  statistics show, union membership, as a percentage of\r\n\r\nthe  working  population, is low, at  about  16%  and  is\r\n\r\ndeclining.   So,  there will still be  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nprofessionals, executives and managerial staff  who  will\r\n\r\nbe  unprotected, ie, the more senior levels, as  well  as\r\n\r\nthose  lower level executives who are in companies  where\r\n\r\nthere    are    no   unions.    For   these   unprotected\r\n\r\nprofessionals, executives and managerial staff, going  to\r\n\r\ncourt  is  not the solution when the outcomes  are  never\r\n\r\ncertain,  and  the fear of exorbitant legal  costs  looms\r\n\r\nlarge over their heads.  What is the solution then?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM today actively encourages \"best\" HR practices\r\n\r\namong  employers.  I would like to propose that MOM  take\r\n\r\nthe  lead to establish a self-regulatory body to  monitor\r\n\r\nand deal with cases which do not come within the ambit of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  will  cover  executives of all  levels  in  a  non-unionised environment, as well as senior executives in  a\r\n\r\nunionised environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Employment Act should also incorporate a\r\n\r\nproviso that addresses salary claims.  The last recession\r\n\r\nhas  borne out many cases of senior executives  who  were\r\n\r\nnot  paid  for work carried out, and yet had no  recourse\r\n\r\nexcept  through  the costly and protracted  legal  route.\r\n\r\nOther avenues that could be considered could be the Small\r\n\r\nClaims Tribunal for claims up to a certain amount.   Such\r\n\r\nadditional   avenues  would  complement  and   supplement\r\n\r\nexisting  mechanisms to cater to the needs of  executives\r\n\r\nwho fall outside the ambit of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related amendments to the Trade Unions Act must also\r\n\r\nbe  considered.  The amendments leave open for executives\r\n\r\nto  be  elected to the union's decision-making body,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  executive  committee.  Once there,  they  can  bring\r\n\r\ninfluence  to bear on the unions.  Therefore,  we  should\r\n\r\nhave  an  amendment that executives cannot serve  on  the\r\n\r\ndecision-making body of the union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the proposed repeal of section 25,\r\n\r\nthe rationale given is that this section has outlived its\r\n\r\nusefulness and, therefore, it is appropriate for it to be\r\n\r\nrepealed.   This  rationale  is  questionable   for   the\r\n\r\nfollowing  reasons.   In  the  New  Economy  and   global\r\n\r\nbusiness era, Singapore will be attracting a new breed of\r\n\r\ninvestors.   With  the  repeal  of  section   25,   these\r\n\r\ninvestors   may   perceive  themselves   to   be   at   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage,  if  the  unions  chose  to   invoke   more\r\n\r\nfavourable   benefits  than  what  the   Employment   Act\r\n\r\nprovides.   In the initial years of a new investment,  no\r\n\r\ninvestor  or his management would want to be  engaged  in\r\n\r\nunnecessary discussion or negotiation for enhancement  of\r\n\r\nterms  if the management could simply benchmark its terms\r\n\r\nto an existing piece of document, ie, the Employment Act.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, I do not see the main existing terms  in\r\n\r\nsection  25  making things worse off.  So,  if  it  ain't\r\n\r\nbroke, why fix it?  If the management feels that it could\r\n\r\nafford to give more, then let them do it on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  own  accord.  What is important is to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe minimum terms are specified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this argument, section 25 should not\r\n\r\nbe  repealed  for  the reason given,  ie,  \"outlived  its\r\n\r\nusefulness\".   The purpose and intent of  section  25  is\r\n\r\nstill  relevant.  It is important to assure our investors\r\n\r\nthat the amendment to the Industrial Relations Act serves\r\n\r\nto  enhance the employment relations climate and  promote\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthank  you for giving me the floor.  I rise to  speak  in\r\n\r\nsupport of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes two key amendments. The first one\r\n\r\nconcerns  section  25  of the Industrial  Relations  Act,\r\n\r\nwhich the Bill proposes that it be repealed.  Section  25\r\n\r\nwas  inserted  by way of an amendment to  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act  in  1968.  Under this provision,  pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus  companies  are  prohibited from  giving  benefits\r\n\r\nwhich  are more favourable than that provided under  Part\r\n\r\nIV   of   the  Employment  Act.   In  practice,   though,\r\n\r\nexemptions  are  allowed from this  provision  which,  in\r\n\r\npractical terms, apply only to the annual and sick  leave\r\n\r\nentitlements  under the Act.  Most employers  treat  such\r\n\r\nleave  entitlements as minimum standards, and the pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus  companies that want to attract good staff  cannot\r\n\r\nprovide  benefits  which are less  favourable  than  that\r\n\r\nprovided   by  the  market.   So,  many  pioneer   status\r\n\r\ncompanies  had  to  ask  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  for\r\n\r\nexemptions.   The  NTUC  had for  many  years  asked  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to remove these restrictions, as they  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  relevant  and hinder the implementation  of  good\r\n\r\nhuman  resource practices at the workplace.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nimpractical  as  good employers can give other  forms  of\r\n\r\npaid  leave  without violating the law, so long  as  they\r\n\r\nprovide  paid  leave to their employees in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nchild-care leave, marriage leave or compassionate  leave,\r\n\r\nfor instance, they will not be breaking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  law.  Hence, it is nonsensical that an employer  can\r\n\r\nprovide other forms of paid leave but cannot provide more\r\n\r\nannual leave without approval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for this reason, I would disagree with the point\r\n\r\nraised  by my parliamentary colleague, Mdm Ho Geok  Choo,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think the amendment is appropriate,  relevant\r\n\r\nand necessary, as it has very limited application and  is\r\n\r\nreally no longer relevant in the present context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also very happy that the Government has\r\n\r\nacceded  to  our request to remove this anachronism  from\r\n\r\nour  law.   I am also glad to say that by repealing  this\r\n\r\nprovision,  our Government is bringing our  law  more  in\r\n\r\nline  with  ILO  Convention 98, which is  on  freedom  of\r\n\r\nassociation and the right to collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the second key amendment\r\n\r\nconcerns  section 16(3) of the Act.  This  provision  was\r\n\r\nalso  inserted  into  our  law  in  1968  by  way  of  an\r\n\r\namendment.  The original law did not restrict  the  right\r\n\r\nof  executives to join and be represented by a  rank-and-file union, so long as its constitution permits it.   The\r\n\r\nlaw  was  amended in 1968 to prohibit unions representing\r\n\r\nnon-managers   and   non-executives   from   representing\r\n\r\nmanagers   and   executives,  to  prevent   conflict   of\r\n\r\ninterests.   This restriction remains in our laws  today.\r\n\r\nBut  what  the present amendment seeks to do is to  allow\r\n\r\nsuch  rank-and-file  unions to  represent  executives  in\r\n\r\ntheir  individual  capacities on  matters  pertaining  to\r\n\r\nretrenchments,  dismissals and breach of contract.   This\r\n\r\namendment  is  a step forward and is beneficial  to  both\r\n\r\nexecutives and employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, executives already have the right to form\r\n\r\ntheir  own  unions  to represent their interests  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace,  and  have full collective bargaining  rights.\r\n\r\nBut,  because of their small number, this is not  a  very\r\n\r\npractical solution.  At the same time, as executives  are\r\n\r\nnot covered under the Employment Act, they cannot legally\r\n\r\nseek  recourse  through the Ministry  of  Manpower.   The\r\n\r\nalternative  for them is to pursue their  claims  through\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlaw.  Legal actions, however, are costly, time-consuming,\r\n\r\nand  attract unnecessary publicity, which may be  adverse\r\n\r\nto  the  executive  as  it could  jeopardise  his  future\r\n\r\nemployment prospects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a fundamental issue that we need to\r\n\r\naddress.   Do we prefer employment matters to be  settled\r\n\r\nthrough  the  courts, or do we want them  to  be  settled\r\n\r\nthrough  union and management negotiations  and,  failing\r\n\r\nwhich,  through conciliation by the Ministry of Manpower?\r\n\r\nThe  experience of other countries, such as the  US,  has\r\n\r\nshown  that  more litigation over employment disputes  is\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous to employers as well, as long  protracted\r\n\r\ndisputes  affect productivity and increase the  level  of\r\n\r\nhostility in the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the last recession was a turning\r\n\r\npoint for many executives.  Many were retrenched but find\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  little  recourse,  except  through  the\r\n\r\ncourts.   The Ministry of Manpower had rendered  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal   of  assistance  to  such  executives,  but   where\r\n\r\nemployers  are  reluctant or unwilling to cooperate,  not\r\n\r\nmuch can be done as there are no laws to compel employers\r\n\r\nto  attend  conciliation  meetings.   We,  in  NTUC,  had\r\n\r\nreceived  many requests for assistance, and  we  too  had\r\n\r\nrendered  as  much help as we possibly could, considering\r\n\r\nthe  constraints.   There  is no  reason  why  executives\r\n\r\nshould be treated so differently from other rank-and-file\r\n\r\nemployees,  as  they too have families to  think  of  and\r\n\r\nloans to service.  They, too, need protection and a voice\r\n\r\nto represent their interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the NTUC strongly\r\n\r\nsupports  this amendment, as it is reasonable  and  fair,\r\n\r\nand  would make it easier for us to assist executives who\r\n\r\nare  in need of help in companies where there is a  rank-and-file  union.   On  the  concerns  expressed  by  some\r\n\r\nemployers  over union representation of executives  under\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  I  wish to state that employers,  who  treat\r\n\r\ntheir employees fairly and with respect, have nothing  to\r\n\r\nworry about.  On\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  I think it is not in the  interest  of\r\n\r\nemployers to protect the errant ones among them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Deputy Speaker, now that the Government\r\n\r\nis  amending this law and, therefore, clearly sending its\r\n\r\nsignal  that  it  supports the principle of  fairness  at\r\n\r\nwork,  can I ask the Ministry of Education to review  its\r\n\r\npolicy  of  asking  school principals  to  indemnify  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education for losses of  school  assets  or\r\n\r\nproperties.    One  of  NTUC's  affiliated  unions,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Teachers' Union, has raised this issue with us,\r\n\r\nand  we think that it is unfair to impose such an onerous\r\n\r\nobligation  on them.  We know that principals  cannot  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by the Singapore Teachers'  Union.   But  in\r\n\r\nline  with  this  new amendment and the  spirit  of  this\r\n\r\namendment,  I  wonder  whether  we  should  now  ask  for\r\n\r\nprincipals  to  be represented, so that we  can  take  up\r\n\r\ntheir grievances officially.  We all know that principals\r\n\r\nwho  fail  to discharge their duties will be  subject  to\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  action, which is, by itself,  a  very  huge\r\n\r\ndeterrent   to   irresponsible  behaviour.    There   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, no need to go one step further and ask them to\r\n\r\nindemnify for the losses.  Imagine the principal who,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to losing her job, has also to pay the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education $1 million, for instance, if  that  is  the\r\n\r\ntotal cost of the losses incurred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any other employees in Singapore,\r\n\r\nnot even other civil servants, who have to undertake such\r\n\r\nan  indemnity.  I hope that, once again, in the spirit of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment, the Ministry of Manpower, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education, can seriously look into  this\r\n\r\nmatter and allay the fears of our principals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I support this\r\n\r\nBill,   as   it   will   further  strengthen   tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation  and  partnership in  Singapore,  and  ensure\r\n\r\ncontinued industrial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nithiah Nandan:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I agree with\r\n\r\nthe amendments that will allow rank-and-file unions to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrepresent   employees   in   managerial   and   executive\r\n\r\npositions.   These amendments will provide protection  to\r\n\r\nthese  executives,  and  encourage  greater  bonding  and\r\n\r\ncohesion amongst different categories of employees.  This\r\n\r\nbonding will, in turn, promote harmony at workplaces  and\r\n\r\ngenerate an increase in productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly support the intent of the Bill. It\r\n\r\nwill  avoid multiple unions in one organisation.  A union\r\n\r\nrepresenting  executive and non-executive employees  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  a better position to understand the workings  and\r\n\r\nneeds  of  a company in the broader sense.  It  can  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  company  to  achieve  its  objectives  without\r\n\r\nundermining the interests of all the employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a knowledge-based economy, the composition of our\r\n\r\nworkforce constantly changes.  The new entrants into  the\r\n\r\njob  market  are mostly diploma and degree holders.  They\r\n\r\nhave  different needs and aspirations.  The economy needs\r\n\r\nthem.  It is therefore in the interest of the nation that\r\n\r\nthey be given fair and adequate protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, as we are all aware, the only thing that is\r\n\r\nconstant  in  the industry and business are the  changes.\r\n\r\nRestructuring, liberalisation, mergers and  globalisation\r\n\r\nbecome  the norm in both the private and public  sectors.\r\n\r\nThese  changes, if not handled properly, can  destabilise\r\n\r\nthe  strong industrial harmony and stability that we have\r\n\r\nbuilt   and   sustained  through  tripartie  partnership.\r\n\r\nHence,  it is more critical now that we place a mechanism\r\n\r\nthat can respond quickly and efficiently to address these\r\n\r\nchanges,   and  minimise  the  impact  on  the   workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  strongly believe that these amendments  to\r\n\r\nallow   the   rank-and-file  unions  to   represent   the\r\n\r\nexecutives  will pave the way to a smooth  transition  in\r\n\r\neffecting the changes.  I say this with strong conviction\r\n\r\nbecause, as the Executive Secretary of the Union of Power\r\n\r\nand   Gas  Employees  (UPAGE)  and  the  Senior  Officers\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Singapore (SOASPOWER), a house  union,  I\r\n\r\nsaw  and  experienced the practicality and  effectiveness\r\n\r\nwhen one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunion  represents  both the executive  and  non-executive\r\n\r\nemployees of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, please allow me to elaborate a\r\n\r\nlittle  on  this  experience.  In April 2001,  the  power\r\n\r\nindustry  was  liberalised.  As a result, the  generation\r\n\r\ncompanies, namely, Senoko Power Limited and Power  Seraya\r\n\r\nLimited  were  divested and no longer form  part  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Power group.  They each became an entity of its\r\n\r\nown.  The managerial and executive staff of the companies\r\n\r\nthus could no longer be represented by SOASPOWER, a house\r\n\r\nunion.   Jointly,  UPAGE and SOASPOWER  highlighted  this\r\n\r\ndifficult  situation  to  the  management  of   the   two\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The  senior management of Senoko  Power  and\r\n\r\nPower  Seraya  saw  the  merit of  having  one  union  to\r\n\r\nrepresent both the executive and non-executive employees.\r\n\r\nThey  allowed UPAGE, a rank-and-file industry  union,  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  both  categories of  their  employees.   Thus,\r\n\r\nUPAGE   made  parallel  representations  for   both   the\r\n\r\nexecutives   and  non-executives  on  industrial   issues\r\n\r\narising  out  of  the  divestment of the  two  generation\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberalisation and divestment process went very\r\n\r\nsmoothly with no effect on the function and operation  of\r\n\r\nthe   companies  involved.  Today,  we  have   a   highly\r\n\r\nproductive  workforce, working towards the betterment  of\r\n\r\nthe companies.  Conflict of interest is a non-issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UPAGE and SOASPOWER are now in the process of\r\n\r\nmerging into a single union, representing the interest of\r\n\r\nemployees  in  the power and gas industries.   This  will\r\n\r\nfurther  strengthen the union and its strong  links  with\r\n\r\nthe  companies.   The  senior  managements  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower,  Power Seraya and Senoko Power, acknowledging  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of such a pact, lend further support by  joining\r\n\r\nas general branch union members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, earlier on, Mdm Ho mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  repealing section 25.  I disagree with  her  view.\r\n\r\nIn fact, section 25 is no longer relevant.  Besides that,\r\n\r\nshe also mentioned about representation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnon-union members.  I think the way to go forward is  for\r\n\r\neveryone to join a union.  If there is no union in  their\r\n\r\nworkplace  and  if Members of Parliament  are  in  senior\r\n\r\npositions   in  companies,  they  should  encourage   the\r\n\r\nformation  of  unions.  I think that is  the  way  to  go\r\n\r\nforward   and   more   should   join   the   unions   and\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of  executives or even senior  management\r\n\r\ncan be properly handled through a union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I fully support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, many of the\r\n\r\npoints  I  wanted to make have been made by  my  esteemed\r\n\r\ncolleagues.  I rise in support of the Bill.  I just  want\r\n\r\nto  say  how happy I feel now that there is an  amendment\r\n\r\nthat  would  allow  the  representation,  especially   in\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and business practices, for executives  and\r\n\r\njunior  managers because, previously, these people  would\r\n\r\nhave nowhere to go.  At the same time, employers need not\r\n\r\nfear  that there would be a conflict of interest  in  the\r\n\r\nproper functioning of the companies with respect to trade\r\n\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  last  year's economic downturn has  set  a  new\r\n\r\nprecedent  in  terms  of unemployment,  in  that  it  has\r\n\r\naffected many more mid-level executives in comparison  to\r\n\r\nthe Asian financial crisis or the 1985 recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding that a large number of\r\n\r\nexecutives were retrenched by irresponsible companies and\r\n\r\nemployers  without  any form of severance  break  pay  or\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits.  This has resulted in many of them\r\n\r\nrunning  into  major  difficulties owing  to  their  high\r\n\r\nfinancial  commitments,  particularly  in  home  and  car\r\n\r\npurchases.  To make matters worse, the prolonged downturn\r\n\r\nhas  made  securing  another job  more  difficult.   Many\r\n\r\nprospective employers also took advantage of the soft job\r\n\r\nmarket by offering lower pay.  In desperation to gain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployment, many unemployed executives have to settle for\r\n\r\nlower   paying  jobs  in  comparison  to  their  previous\r\n\r\npositions.   They are suffering in silence.  I  therefore\r\n\r\nsee  this Bill as timely to allow executives to join  the\r\n\r\nrank-and-file unions, so as to protect them in situations\r\n\r\nof  dismissals,  retrenchments and breach  of  employment\r\n\r\ncontracts.  It is important to stress that the areas  for\r\n\r\nunion  representation  for  executives  are  limited   to\r\n\r\nindividuals in these three areas only and that collective\r\n\r\nbargaining,  as  a  separate class, is  disallowed.  This\r\n\r\nshould  be  reassuring to employers  and  provide  for  a\r\n\r\ngreater expediency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on this Bill, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would\r\n\r\nlike to give my perspective from an employer's viewpoint,\r\n\r\nconsidering the fact that I am also responsible  for  the\r\n\r\noperation  of a multi-national company here.   Generally,\r\n\r\nit  is  my  opinion  that  this amendment  Bill  is  well\r\n\r\nconceived  and  has  provided for sufficient  safeguards,\r\n\r\nparticularly to prevent conflict of interest between  the\r\n\r\nemployer and the executive who chooses to join the union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that new section 30B(2) clearly\r\n\r\nprovides  for  an  employer to  object  to  an  executive\r\n\r\njoining a trade union if the executive performs duties or\r\n\r\nexercises  functions which, among others, involve  access\r\n\r\nto  confidential  information  and  decision-making.    I\r\n\r\nbelieve the stipulations in this section are detailed and\r\n\r\ntherefore  adequately stipulate the  real  and  potential\r\n\r\nareas of conflict of interest.  This should alleviate the\r\n\r\nconcerns  of  the  management of companies  and  preserve\r\n\r\nmanagement effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, like Mdm Ho Geok Choo, my only concern is\r\n\r\nthe  repeal  of  section  25 which  prohibits  collective\r\n\r\nagreements  in new selected business ventures to  contain\r\n\r\nterms and conditions of service to be more favourable  to\r\n\r\nemployees  than  those permissible under  the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct, unless such provisions are approved by the Minister.\r\n\r\nI  am afraid I have to disagree with both Mdm Halimah and\r\n\r\nMr  Nithiah with regard to the repeal of section  25.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the presence of this section has served us  well\r\n\r\nthroughout the years, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit has also been instrumental in attracting investors and\r\n\r\nputting  them at ease from a standpoint that there  would\r\n\r\nnot  be any surprise or sudden pressure by the unions  to\r\n\r\ndemand  for  unreasonable terms.   In  the  light  of  us\r\n\r\ncontinuing and wanting to attract higher value-added  and\r\n\r\ncapital-intensive investments into our country, which was\r\n\r\nalso  stressed  by Mdm Ho earlier on,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that section 25 not be repealed, or if it  is  to\r\n\r\nbe  repealed,  it should be postponed to  a  later  date.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that new investors and new undertakings\r\n\r\nfeel protected with the presence of such restrictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Deputy Speaker, it is my hope that the\r\n\r\nintent  of  this amendment Bill is not aimed at primarily\r\n\r\nenlarging  the  membership of the trade  unions,  but  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  greater  responsibility at the  workplaces  in\r\n\r\ntandem  with the changing profiles of our workforce.   As\r\n\r\nMr  Yeo Guat Kwang has said earlier on, this would  be  a\r\n\r\nwin-win situation for all parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am gratified\r\n\r\nby  the  response  from  Members speaking  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nemployers and unions in supporting this Bill.  They  have\r\n\r\nvery strongly endorsed that this is needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have disagreed on section 25 and this is\r\n\r\nillustrative  of  the tensions that would  arise  in  any\r\n\r\nnegotiations between employers and unions.  Those  issues\r\n\r\nwere  extensively deliberated in the tripartie committee,\r\n\r\nand  this is the best case scenario.  We never get  quite\r\n\r\nwhat  we  want but we have arrived at the best  position,\r\n\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo also argued that, in fact, junior\r\n\r\nexecutives should be even\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  protected,  and  that they should  have  even  more\r\n\r\navenues  apart from unions.  Yes, this is being  studied.\r\n\r\nWith  the review of the Employment Act, we will be making\r\n\r\nmore deliberations regarding whether protection is to  be\r\n\r\nextended to junior executives as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah spoke on principles and indemnity. She\r\n\r\nand  I both know that this is quite a departure from  the\r\n\r\nsubject  that is being discussed.  But I would compliment\r\n\r\nher  on  her creativity and choose another time to answer\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, this piece of legislative\r\n\r\namendment, which allows limited representation of certain\r\n\r\nexecutives  by rank-and-file unions, has no precedent  in\r\n\r\nother  countries.  It is illustrative of the ability  and\r\n\r\nthe   uniqueness  of  our  relationships  and  the  close\r\n\r\ntripartite consultation and cooperation that have allowed\r\n\r\nthis.    This  implementation  would  benefit  employers,\r\n\r\nexecutives,  employees,  trade  unions  as  well  as  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Dr Ng Eng Hen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed. \" - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fifteen minutes past Seven o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
