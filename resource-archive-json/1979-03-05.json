In the same years, 121, 105 and 251 scholarships respectively were awarded to Singapore citizens. This is about five or six times more than those awarded to foreign students. In addition, about 100 scholarships were awarded to Singapore citizens to study overseas every year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of ASEAN scholarships awarded does not affect the number of scholarships for Singaporeans. We can afford to give as many scholarships as there are deserving Singaporeans. In any case, many of these ASEAN scholarships are for teaching; scholarships which are not keenly sought after by Singaporeans. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers of scholarships awarded are insignificant to the places we provide for private students from ASEAN countries for further studies here.

The vacancies arising in the 32 schools were filled mainly by cadet teachers. The withdrawal of even a single teacher from any school must cause some disruption. However, a breakdown shows that of the 32 schools, one released three teachers, eight released two teachers and the remaining 23 released one teacher each. The release of more than one teacher by a school was conditioned by such factors as distance, the specific needs of schools and the standing of the teachers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, would the 42 teachers from the 32 schools transferred to the nine selected Chinese secondary schools be sufficient to meet the requirements of teaching?

Of this number, 15 declined appointment and were not only released immediately but were posted back to their original schools. No officer will be compelled to accept appointment or suffer any penalty if he or she indicates a preference to continue teaching. However, it is incumbent on the Ministry to initially offer appointment to all eligible officers. The initial appointment of 122 Vice-Principals could not have had the effect of so disrupting schools that, as late as 15th January, 1979, they were not able to draw up time-tables.

Salient features of the full-day school programme will be the provision of a wider choice of elective subjects; time for remedial teaching, small group tutorials, private studies with close supervision by teachers; and the provision of guidance and counselling to help pupils who have difficulties in their work. Pupils in full-day schools should be able to do all the work they may be given during the school day itself. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites for the successful implementation of the project include the commitment of principals and teachers to its objectives; the cooperation of teachers' unions; and the careful selection of schools that should be adequately equipped with all the necessary facilities required for a full-day school. Schools which are to pioneer this scheme should be preferably located in HDB estates so that teachers and pupils involved in the project need not travel far from their homes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is in the process of finalising the implementation details of this project. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>BOARD OF TERTIARY EDUCATION</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> whether it is considered necessary to set up a Board of Tertiary Education to be solely in charge of the two universities, the Institute of Education, the Singapore Polytechnic and the Ngee Ann Technical College so that the curricular planning, academic development, use of facilities, staffing and the allocation and distribution of students in the five institutes can be better co-ordinated and complemented in order to prevent wastage and unnecessary duplication or overlapping. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, the Ministry does not consider it necessary to set up a Board of Tertiary Education to be solely in charge of the two Universities, the Institute of Education, the Singapore Polytechnic and the Ngee Ann Technical College. This step is not only unnecessary but it is not likely to achieve the objectives that the hon. Member has in mind. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as admission of students is concerned, there has been established since 1978 a joint admission board which considers applications from students who passed their 'O' level for entry into Junior Colleges, Pre-U Centres, Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Technical College and the Industrial Training Board. Admissions into the University of Singapore and Nanyang University are considered by a Joint Universities Admission Selection Committee established in 1974. The processing of applications to institutions of higher studies helps to maintain the standards of admission as well as fairness in the award of places which must be decided solely on the basis of merit, given students' preferences. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member seems to be worried about \"wastage and unnecessary duplication or overlapping\". I assume he is referring to courses offered at these institutions. There are, of course, courses common both to Nanyang and Singapore Universities and to Ngee Ann and the Polytechnic. For instance, both Universities teach Mathematics, Political Science, Statistics, Economics, Geography and History in the Arts and Social Science Departments. In Science subjects, Chemistry, Physics and Applied Physics are common to both Universities. I do not know \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> whether the Member believes that these subjects should be farmed out to one or the other of the Universities. I am not certain what merit there is in this idea, but serious problems of dislocation will arise for both staff and students. The two Universities have enough problems on their hands at the moment, and now is not the time to consider further innovations unless these have obvious merit. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much the same of what I said applies to courses common to the Singapore Polytechnic and the Ngee Ann Technical College. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not feasible to have a single authority to take charge of Universities, Polytechnics and the Institute of Education, as well as the Industrial Training Board. The levels of instruction, the qualifications of students, the objectives of these institutions are so varied that combining them into one organisation is likely to create more problems than it solves. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ASEAN SOLIDARITY</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether ASEAN's political solidarity hitherto demonstrated and its pace of responding to sudden events such as the Australian air fare policy and the recent flare-ups among the Asian communist countries are satisfactory; (b) what is the best way to preserve the neutrality, peace and the territorial integrity of ASEAN; and (c) whether the recent events and developments in Indochina have created the need for a defence pact among ASEAN member countries to deter outside threats and to enhance the sense of stability within ASEAN. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Sir, ASEAN's response to the various developments in Indochina has demonstrated the solidarity of the group. The Vietnamese believed that ASEAN was a western imperialist creation and expected the group to fall into disarray with the withdrawal of United States military troops from Indochina. Instead of falling into disarray, ASEAN has become more united in its reaction to the turbulent political developments in the region. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN solidarity was demonstrated by the unity of the ASEAN response to the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea. In fact, many non-aligned nations and members of the UN Security Council responded with the ASEAN line in their reaction to events in Kampuchea. The Sino-Vietnamese conflict has shown again the common ASEAN response and attitude to such events, Members would have noted from press reports that the ASEAN draft resolution, which was to be presented to the Security Council, commanded the most support and would have been presented and adopted by the Security Council were it not for USSR opposition. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian International Civil Aviation Policy is yet another example where ASEAN unity of purpose and solidarity were underestimated. Approaches were made, unsuccessfully, to ASEAN states individually with offers aimed at breaking rank. Statements were also made by some Australian officials that ASEAN solidarity was a fragile facade that would crack easily. Events so far have shown, while the coming meeting in Jakarta with the Australian Ministers will confirm, the grave error of such views. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible, indeed natural, that when five countries get together, there will be occasions when they will have disagreements, when each may have different ideas about particular regional or bilateral endeavours and questions. These occasional differences are often over less fundamental issues but they may be seen by others quite erroneously as lack of solidarity. The acid test of ASEAN solidarity is what ASEAN does when major issues affecting the vital interest of the region arise. The identity of purpose and swiftness of response to events that I have mentioned have amply demonstrated ASEAN solidarity. This has in fact become so clear that nations in other parts of the world have begun to look to ASEAN for a lead in matters affecting this region. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part of the question, we have a region which has traditionally been an arena of great power rivalry and conflict. We \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> can expect that subversion, insurgency and limited proxy wars will continue as part of great power rivalry. It is therefore only prudent for ASEAN to recognise this reality. We in ASEAN will have to make a conscious effort to resist being drawn into these rivalries and conflicts. If we are not careful, we may find ourselves as proxies of the contending great powers. Non-involvement however does not mean that we turn a blind eye to regional and international issues which have serious political, economic ind security implications for ASEAN. We have to make known our position quite clearly. This we have done. The reaction of the ASEAN countries to each crisis in Southeast Asia has established clearly that ASEAN has a common and united position on major issues. Further we have shown that ASEAN's collective interest comes first and that we are not going to be drawn into taking sides in any great power rivalry. I can assure the hon. Member that this is the best way to preserve the neutrality, peace and territorial integrity of ASEAN. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the third and final part of the question, when ASEAN was formed in 1967, it was clearly aimed at cooperation in economic, social and political fields. A military pact was never considered. In the 12 years since, there has never been any keen interest or effort in that direction. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of Communism cannot be contested by military pacts. It has to be fought through successful political, social and economic policies. Defence pacts are not geared to tackle the social and economic problems which provide fertile ground for Communist exploitation. Communist insurgencies and subversion thrive on poverty, class differences, uneven distribution of wealth, lack of economic opportunities and ignorance. The best method to combat the communist threat is through rapid social and economic development and by providing a better life for the people so that the people will find their society worth defending against the Communists. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic cooperation within ASEAN can assist in solving these socio-economic problems. The conflicts among the Communist countries in Indochina provide ASEAN time to consolidate and to expand its efforts in economic development. We have to seize the opportunity presented to us now and use it to the fullest. More efforts have to be put into economic cooperation within ASEAN than has been the case in the past. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current conflicts in Indochina have introduced new forms of intervention in addition to subversion and externally supported insurgencies. The threat of a similar military intervention in ASEAN countries in the immediate future is small. As matters stand today, a military defence pact is not called for. But it is clear that the integrity of any partner in ASEAN is vital to the security of all partners. Any ASEAN response to events will therefore be guided by this principle. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>NON-METRIC WEIGHING AND</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MEASURING INSTRUMENTS</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Banning of)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law and Science and Technology, in order that the metric system will be fully implemented, if he will consider introducing legislation to set a target date banning the use and sale of any non-metric weighing and measuring instruments in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Chee Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lim Chee Onn (Bukit Merah) (for the Minister for Law and Science and Technology):</b> Sir, the Government's policy is one of gradual conversion to the metric system.

As it is Government policy to encourage home ownership, it is not proposed to raise the income ceiling. However, in genuine hardship cases, special consideration will be given on the merits of each case. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for National Development whether he is aware that although the family income may exceed $500, the take-home pay can be less than $500 because of deduction for contribution to CPF. Under such circumstances, will the Minister consider an application from such a family to rent a two-room flat? He is not buying a flat; he only wants to rent, and so there is no question of his using his CPF savings. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the $500 income limit has been set because if a person's monthly income is $500 he is likely to make a CPF contribution of $150 per month. Now, the monthly instalment for the purchase of a three-room flat is about $100. Therefore, the income limit has been set in such a way that a person with an income of $500 per month is in a position to buy a three-room flat. If he is not prepared to buy a flat, then he will have to rent a three-room flat. He is not allowed to rent a one-room flat. The difference in size between the one-room \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> improved flats and two-room flats is not so great. Moreover, we know that the people who live in the one-room improved flats usually partition off the area into two-room flats. In fact, those who have been denied one-room flats have moved into two-room flats. So really there is no cause for complaint of hardship. But if he wants to move to a better flat, then we encourage him to purchase a three-room flat. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Request for medical officers)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Haji Rahmat bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. \n  <b>Haji Rahmat bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs if he will consider arranging for two Medical Officers to accompany Singapore Muslims on pilgrimage to Mecca as the three Welfare Officers sent by the Singapore Muslim Religious Council cannot help those pilgrims who fall sick. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Geylang Serai may be interested to know that recently officials of the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) and the Ministry of Social Affairs held a meeting with pilgrims who went on the Haj in 1978, to find out the shortcomings, if any, of the pilgrimage organised by MUIS and whether the Pilgrimage Welfare Officers played a useful role during the trip. These were the pilgrims who responded to MUIS' invitation through the press to the discussion held on 16th January, 1979. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, the pilgrims who attended the discussion were satisfied with the arrangements made by MUIS. We have ascertained from them that owing to climatic conditions and the crammed living conditions in Mecca and the other holy cities, many of the pilgrims contracted influenza, cough, cold, sore eyes and diarrhoea. These pilgrims, however, were able to overcome these minor ailments by taking patent medicines which they had brought along with them. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not, therefore, consider it necessary at this stage to appoint medical officers to accompany the pilgrims during their \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> pilgrimage. There are hospitals in Mecca and the other holy cities where pilgrims can seek medical attention if their illnesses become serious. The Pilgrimage Welfare Officers are there to assist them in gaining admission into hospitals, if hospitalisation is necessary. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry is exploring the possibility of inviting Muslim male or female nurses to serve as Pilgrimage Welfare Officers for the next pilgrimage. We have written to the Ministry of Health for assistance in identifying Muslim officers in the Nursing service, as well as those who have retired from the service, who would be interested in taking on the job of Pilgrimage Welfare Officers. With their training and experience, we feel that these nurses will be able to diagnose the common ailments and treat the pilgrims accordingly.

Minister-in-charge had given figures on the number of accidents and Government vehicles involved as well as the disclosure that \"thirty-two departments were involved.\". This is contained in Hansard, Vol. 37, No. 7, col. 395. He also pointed out that \"a sum of $200,000 was originally voted for this item for expenditure on accidents involving Government vehicles.\" The sum did not, of course, cover repairs to Government vehicles. I sought an assurance that \"accidents involving Government vehicles be kept to a minimum.\" But as the Hon. Minister pointed out, \"I cannot speak for the other departments concerned.\" He went on to state further \"that the majority of the accidents comes from the Armed Forces and the number of Government vehicles has been increasing over the years. So has the number of accidents.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day, Sir, this House is again asked to approve a sum of $168,180 and according to the explanatory note \"The need .... is because of the payment of compensation for damages arising from the increase in the number and seriousness of cases involving Government negligence....\" This sum now sought for represents more than a 55% increase over the vote of $300,000 approved last year, FY 78. As for FY 79 some $400,000 will be sought for. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the House to two words in the statement \"seriousness\" and \"negligence\". In short, I believe this House should be alarmed at this frank and honest disclosure. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I would like to ask what is being done to curb or reduce the number of accidents involving Government vehicles. Are the Government departments made aware of this aspect? To me, the campaign mounted last year by the Traffic Police on \"Road Safety\" appears to have fallen on deaf ears! Therefore, I would like to reiterate that something should be done. If the number of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> accidents involved comes mainly from the Armed Forces, then the Hon. Minister-in-charge should look into this. The heavy vehicles of the Armed Forces and others too of the various Government departments are \"monsters\" on the road. Those driving them should exercise more caution and consideration to small vehicles on the roods. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Hon. Minister to state how many accidents involving Government vehicles were involved in the current fiscal year, FY 78; how many fatalities were there, and what steps are being taken or will be taken to reduce the number of accidents? Also, would the Hon. Minister, although he is in charge of the Attorney-General's Chambers which represent the Government in all accidents and claims against accidents involving Government vehicles, kindly notify his fellow Ministers on this as he had earlier stated that he cannot speak for them, I am sure this can be done, but if it is not possible then I would suggest that each Ministry make provision for this item and face the queries instead. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the note to the Supplementary Estimates is a bit misleading, at least the first part which states: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The need for supplementary provision under the above object group is because of the payment of compensation for damages arising from the increase in the number and seriousness of cases involving Government negligence ...'. \n  <br> \n  <br>In fact, the number of accidents involving Government vehicles last year has gone down when compared to the figure for 1977. But the amount of compensation. has increased because of inflation and the higher cost of repairs to motor vehicles. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures on the number of accidents involving vehicles for the last four years are as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n   1975      1,545;\r\n   1976      a drop to 1,373;\r\n   1977      an increase to 1,819; and\r\n   1978      a decrease to 1,784.\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out previously to the hon. Member for Punggol, criminal proceedings \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> are taken against the drivers of vehicles, whether Government or outside the Government. But in addition, Government drivers are subject to disciplinary proceedings which are taken by the departments concerned in appropriate cases. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of accidents for the various departments, I have a list here but I do not think it would be appropriate for me to read it out in detail. Of the 405 accidents for the period 1st April 1978 to 28th February 1979, the Ministry of Defence was concerned in 291 cases; the Ministry of the Environment 50; the Police 33, and the rest (whether it was the Fire Brigade or the Public Works Department) were all less than 10. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Ministry of Defence has the largest number of accidents does not mean that our Army drivers are just no good. It is because the Ministry of Defence has the largest number of vehicles in Singapore. I am afraid I cannot tell him the number. It is not top secret but it is a secret. If he is not satisfied with this answer, I would suggest that he pose a question to the Minister in Charge on some other occasion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Ministry of the Environment, I have relinquished my duties there and I would again suggest that he take it up with the Minister concerned. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the dollars and cents that we are asking for, Sir, during the period which I mentioned (1st April 1978 to 28th February 1979), the Attorney-General's Chambers dealt with and reached settlement in respect of 499 accidents. Of these accidents involving Government vehicles, claims in respect of 405 accidents have been settled and we paid out a total sum of $359,981.96. Agreement has been reached in respect of the claims for the remaining 94 accidents but payments totalling $168,180 have yet to be made. Hence the requirement of the supplementary vote for this sum. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am not thoroughly satisfied and convinced with the answers given by the Hon. Minister. He gave the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> figures for the four years from 1975 to 1978. I would just like to make a quick subtraction of the figures compared, 1977 against 1978. In 1977, the Minister gave the figure of the number of accidents as 1,819 against a slight drop to 1,784 in 1978. In real numbers, there is only a decrease of 35, i.e. less than 20%. But in the previous reply, the Hon. Minister indicated that this sum did not include repairs. Today he has explained that this includes repairs. And also the increase in compensation was due to inflation. Sir, I was just wondering how high is our rate of inflation in terms of compensation given. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> 4.8%. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, my Backbench colleague says 4.8%. I am not an economist. I do not really know how this figure can really be inflated. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Lawyers cost more! \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Lawyers cost more, as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education has pointed out. I must thank him. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mindef was concerned in 291 accidents and it has the largest number of vehicles. The number is supposed to be secret; how secret it is I do not know. Mindef being the Ministry with the largest number of vehicles, most of which I have described as monsters on the road, these 291 accidents ought to bring home one point. Our roads are not that wide and not that straight. And there are also other road users. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment was concerned in 50 accidents. The Minister has suggested that I direct my question to his successor, the new Minister for the Environment. On Mindef he has asked me to direct my questions to the Minister of Defence. Sir, I can merely say that the buck has to stop somewhere. I well understand that the Attorney-General's Chambers looks after all these claims. But somebody must provide satisfactory answers to my questions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless I get satisfactory answers, I am not going to withdraw my amendment. [Applause.] \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, we seem to be speaking at cross purposes. May I remind the hon. Member that his notice of amendment to cut $10 is merely confined to Subhead GA-02 in respect of item (a) Accidents involving Government vehicles. If you look at the Supplementary Estimates, the second part is item (c) Legal fees, claims and costs for all departments. Last year the Member spoke on all these. This year his amendment is confined merely to the first part which deals with the accidents. Hence, I have said nothing about legal fees, claims and compensation. But let me assure him that we are not passing the buck. We Ministers work together. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Good.

Copies \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> have also been given to the press, and the press has reported in two parts the salient features of the Economic Survey. Nevertheless before spelling out the financial policy for the coming year, I would like to highlight the more important features of our economic performance last year, and set out our economic objectives for the coming year. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Singapore's Economy in 1978</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World economic performance in 1978 may be described as lackadaisical. The industrialised countries grew at 3.5%, a quarter of a per cent lower than the previous year. The volume of world trade grew at 5%, marginally higher than the rate in 1977. The rate of inflation, however, eased slightly, and for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, it was around 8%. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was the Year of the Horse and my confidence that Singapore would put on the extra gallop to challenge and beat the 1977 growth rate was not misplaced. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy grew by 8.6%, better than our expectation of a 6-8% growth, and higher than the 7.8% achieved in 1977. At current prices, growth was 9.7%. Growth was achieved amidst price stability as the GDP deflator rose by only 1.0% compared to 1.5% in 1977. However, as a result of rising food prices, particularly of rice, the Consumer Price Index rose by 4.8% against an increase of 3.2% in 1977. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our growth can be considered satisfactory, our workhorse was no match for the swifter stallions in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Their economies raced along at between 10-13% last year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine of growth in Singapore last year was the transport and communications sector. It grew by 16% and accounted for 30% of the increase in GDP. The manufacturing sector came second, growing by 12% and contributing 28% of the incremental GDP. Especially heartening was the invigorating recovery in private investments in capital equipment. After three years of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> continuous decline following the oil crisis in 1974, private investments in plant and machinery increased by 20% in 1978. This augurs well for the manufacturing sector and the economy in the next few years. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1978, 41,000 jobs were created, mostly in the manufacturing sector (21,000). and the commerce sector (12,000). As a result, unemployment fell to a record low of 3.6%. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's external trade rose by 15% to reach $52.6 billion in 1978. This was, however, lower than the rate of 18% achieved in 1977. Imports increased at a faster rate than exports thus widening the visible trade deficit by $1,183 million to $6.6 billion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reversal of the trend since 1975. The main reason for this was the slower expansion of our exports, both domestic and re-exports. Notwithstanding this, Singapore's balance of payments continued to be in healthy surplus because of higher capital inflows. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitor arrivals in the tourist sector exceeded two million during the year, registering a growth of 10%. Our financial and business services also continued to expand. Loans and advances of banks and ACUs increased by 20% and 21% respectively. Activity was much higher in the local stock market than the previous year's. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, 1978 was a satisfactory year for us. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Problems and Prospects for 1979</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not optimistic about the outlook for world economic growth in 1979. The present cautious growth policies of industrialised countries are not expected to generate growth of more than 3% in 1979. Many believe that the United States economy in the wake of recent stringent monetary policies will decelerate. It is hoped that there will be an off-setting expansion in Japan, West Germany and other smaller industrialised countries. Given our open economy, and our dependence on industrialised countries for export markets, any \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> slowdown in the world economy will have an adverse effect on Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An added depressant to the world economic outlook is the proposed 4-stage oil price increase totalling 14.5% in 1979 by OPEC. Even more sombre is the prospect of a world oil shortage following disruption of supply from Iran. The future supply and price of oil will determine the world economic performance. As for ourselves, we should step up efforts to economise on the consumption of oil and electricity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, my Minister warned the House of the protectionist sentiments in the world. Protectionism has now been extended to the air. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new duopolistic end-to-end International Civil Aviation Policy initiated by Australia and apparently supported by other developed countries, will stifle the growth of airlines of intermediate developing countries and affect their tourist-related industries. Singapore stands to lose about 50% of the present number of Australian tourists, besides the loss of revenue for our national carrier. Singapore together with ASEAN and the Group of 77 developing countries must resist the protectionist tendencies of developed countries and help bring about an international economic order that will benefit the developing countries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above problems, we must improve on our past efforts and performance if we wish to achieve the same growth rate in 1979 as in 1978. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to examine in more detail the specific objectives that we will be pursuing in 1979. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Industrial Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1978 was the best year for the manufacturing investments since 1975. Investment commitments totalled $825 million, representing an increase of 100% over 1977. If a major petroleum project of $330 million was excluded, the increase was still a creditable 43%. Our major investors continued to be Japan and the United States. Expansions and diversifications of existing \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> industries in 1978 as a percentage of total commitments rise to 56%. from 48% the previous year. This testimonial on our investment climate from those who are here is our best promotional tool for new investments. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the volume of commitments matters, the quality of such commitments matters even more. Over the years, the type of industries that we have attracted has become increasingly sophisticated, with higher value added per worker. The value added per worker in manufacturing has risen in real terms by 31% since 1970. In 1978 the value added per worker was $21,000. But we still have many more rungs to climb. The value added per worker in 1976 was $47,000 in Germany and $53,000 in the United States. Compare this with $21,000 for Singapore in 1978. We have therefore a long way to go before our industries can reach the standards of those of the developed countries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our future investment promotion, we should recognise our strengths and weaknesses. We should promote industries that can take full advantage of our intrinsic strengths such as a good geographical location with developed infrastructure and a pool of increasingly skilled and semi-skilled labour available at competitive prices. We should recognise our limitations of a small domestic market, lack of energy and other natural resources, and a small land area. The industrial products we would favour in the future should be small, high value, readily transportable, non-pollutive, and which use relatively less natural resources such as land, water and energy. Thus the products that EDB will be promoting in the future will include precision instruments such as watches, cameras and measuring instruments, pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals, aircraft servicing and parts production, automotive components and computer related products. In promoting specific products, we must also be aware of the need to have those which would be less sensitive to protectionist sentiments in the industrialised countries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far our industrialisation drive has depended largely on foreign expertise and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> technology through the multinationals. This is inevitable if we wish to have access to modern technology. But it is also time that we complement this with indigenous research and development, if only to imbibe foreign technology and adapt them to local uses. The Product Development Assistance Scheme which was introduced last year has received a fair response. Some 10 applications are being considered. To further assist product development we will be prepared to extend to new manufacturing companies the existing provision which currently permits only existing companies to deduct expenditure incurred on research and development for income tax purposes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently developing a long term research and development plan for Singapore in conjunction with interested bodies such as the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR), the Science Council of Singapore, the Applied Research Corporation (ARC), and the Ministry of Science and Technology. Such a plan must provide for the development and training of sufficient scientists, researchers and designers to make our efforts successful. We do not intend to undertake the type of basic research that can best be done by large countries with ample resources. There are, however, areas where product related research can help us raise the technological sophistication of our industries. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Trade Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects for world trade expansion in 1979 are not bright. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The much delayed Multilateral Trade Negotiations which will reduce or eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade appear ready for endorsement soon by participating countries. But its effects on trade liberalisation will be very gradual as the implementaion of the MTN Agreement will be spread over a number of years. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome this dim outlook, aggressive export promotion of competitively produced goods is our only answer. In 1978, Singapore \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> participated in 11 international trade fairs and nine trade missions overseas. These efforts enabled 130 Singapore companies to secure $88 million worth of orders. Greater emphasis was given to the promotion of higher value products. Local firms were also encouraged to pool their resources in joint marketing efforts. A trade office was established in Los Angeles in 1978 whilst new offices in West Asia will be opened in 1979. During the year, 10 training programmes and export promotion were also organised to enhance the skills of local exporters. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double tax deduction scheme currently applicable to expenses incurred in the participation in trade fairs, trade missions and setting up of overseas offices has been found to be useful to exporters. Since its introduction, 503 companies have taken advantage of the scheme. To encourage more aggressive marketing overseas, the double tax deduction scheme will now also apply to expenses incurred in advertising and promotional campaigns overseas. the production of sales literature and brochures, and the undertaking of market surveys. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Trade Development Committee was set up in my Ministry in August 1978 to consider the feasibility of setting up a Trade Development Council, its organisational structure and financial requirements. The Committee has the participation of the various Chambers of Commerce and the Singapore Manufacturers' Association as well as the Trade Department and the Economic Development Board. The Committee is expected to make its recommendation very soon to Government. We are prepared to support the setting up of such a Council provided it serves the real needs of our exporters and have their active support and participation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Services Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our services sector continued to be a major growth sector, led by air and sea transport and telecommunication services. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of financial services, two significant events took place last year. Firstly, exchange controls were completely removed in June last year. This should \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> facilitate the growth of trade. Secondly, a gold exchange was established in November. It is the first gold exchange for the Asian Pacific region to be opened to international investors. Trading on the exchange so far has been encouraging. Meanwhile the Asian Dollar Market continued to grow, by 29% in 1978. For the coming year, we will see to it that our financial centre develops further. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of tourism, there was further growth in 1978. The average hotel room occupancy rose by 4% to 87%, indicating a tight hotel room supply situation even though 960 rooms were added during 1978. An additional 3,300 rooms which have been approved for construction will be available in mid-1981. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the protectionist policy in civil aviation of Australia succeeds, and worse, proliferates, the volume of tourist stopover traffic in Singapore will decrease. We must therefore increasingly develop Singapore as a destination point in the Pacific area. Tourists can only be attracted to Singapore if there are sufficient attractions and diversions here and in the neighbouring countries. One way to do this is to develop Singapore into a resort destination. Unfortunately there are currently no resort hotels of international class in Singapore. We are therefore prepared to consider giving incentives to a limited number of first class resort hotels which could be developed on Sentosa. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need also to further develop our convention business in Singapore. Some success has been achieved so far with 151 conventions held in Singapore in 1978 compared to 120 in 1977. To ensure the availability of convention services, the Raffles International Centre project will incorporate a convention centre. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not been maximizing the export of our professional and technical expertise. I hope the reduction in company taxation for such overseas earnings to 20% on which legislation will be introduced in the immediate future, will stimulate more efforts by the private sector in this direction. It has been contended that a good track record in the home country is a sine qua non for \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> penetration of an overseas market. In order to beef up the experience of our local contractors and builders we will be introducing a scheme to provide a preferential margin for local contractors of up to 5% with regard to Government tenders for building projects. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>ASEAN Economic Cooperation</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was further progress made in ASEAN economic cooperation in 1978. ASEAN countries decided to accelerate the pace on trade liberalisation by increasing the number of items exchanged in each round of negotiations to 100 per country. At the end of 1978, 1,326 items were exchanged under the Preferential Trading Arrangements of which 836 items were already in force with the rest to be implemented in March this year. In the industrial sector, the industrial projects of three countries, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, have already been approved and are now ready for financing consideration by Japan. In the case of Singapore, we have decided to proceed with our diesel engine project as a normal national project. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN's major achievement during the year was in the field of external dialogues with the industrialised countries. Through meetings with the EEC and the USA at ministerial level, ASEAN won international recognition at the highest political level, setting the stage for future closer economic relations with the industrialised countries. We shall do our part to foster closer economic cooperation within ASEAN and to build up its strength as a regional entity. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Manpower Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last Budget Statement, the unemployment rate has dropped further to 3.6%. the lowest on record. Inevitably, the tighter labour market has given rise to shortages in some sectors of the economy, particularly in labour intensive operations. This has been alleviated by a more liberal work permit policy which enabled the recruitment of more workers from neighbouring countries. At some future time when these workers return home, they could add to their \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> supply of skilled and semi-skilled manpower for their industrial development. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tighter labour market, however, underlines the importance of our policy to upgrade all our operations, whether in servicing or in manufacturing. Every worker must increase his skills and contribute his maximum. Labour intensive operations should restrain their labour demands and switch to more capital intensive investments to achieve an increase in productivity. At the same time the Government will be increasing its institutional capability to produce more skilled workers. The EDB will be expanding its enrolment in the Government-industry training centres while the Industrial Training Board will also be building up its capacity for vocational training. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant development during the year was the acceptance by the University of Singapore of graduates from the Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Technical College for admission into the undergraduate courses for engineering. This would help to increase our pool of higher level manpower. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Wage Policy</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue with our policy on orderly wage increases through the National Wages Council mechanism. It is only by rewarding workers commensurate with their productivity that our industries can remain competitive. Our objective must also be to narrow the wage differentials between blue collar and white collar jobs. Last year, it was gratifying to note that wage increases for production and related workers increased by 7%, higher than the national average of 6%. This in part reflects the intention of the 1978 NWC wage recommendation to narrow the differentials between industrial and service workers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Monetary Policy</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall continue to strive for monetary and exchange rate conditions which will help achieve our overall growth objectives. In our monetary policy we must ensure that there is adequate liquidity in our banking system to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> cater for economic growth. In our exchange rate policy, we aim to keep the Singapore dollar strong and stable. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Concluding Remarks on Economic Policy</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1978, we trotted like the Horse, outpacing our performance in 1977 despite the sluggishness of the world economy. In 1979, the world looks like becoming a more difficult place to make a living in. Nevertheless, I am confident that Singaporeans will put on their mettle and will respond with that extra spun. In the Year of the Goat, we should not lack the resilience, adaptability and cooperative effort to make 1979 another good year. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>The FY 79 Budget</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to move on to the FY 79 Budget. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Expenditure</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated expenditure for FY 79 is $5,934 million. Of this, $2,560 million or 43% is for development. principally for economic services and public housing, which together account for 75% of the proposed development expenditure. The allocation for economic services is $1,071 million, of which a sum of $562 million is to be spent on industrial and commercial development (largely as loans to the Jurong Town Corporation and Industrial and Commercial Enterprises) and $393 million on development of Changi Airport and roads. Expenditure on public housing takes up $836 million or 33% of the development budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure under the Main Estimates will be $3,374 million, excluding transfer to the Development Fund. This is 12% higher than for FY 78. It is required to maintain the present level of Government services. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff increases have been provided only for new functions or the expansion of present activities. The net increase in the permanent establishment for FY 79 including those posts created by Establishment Warrants during FY 78 is 926 posts or 1% over the FY 78 establishment. Recruitment, to meet the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> shortages of officers in a number of Ministries, is progressing satisfactorily. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stringent criteria have been used in approving increases in Other Operating Expenditure. The increase in such Expenditure, excluding the Armed Forces Expenditure, of $31 million or 12% over the FY 78 figure is because of expenditure on the replacement of Marine Police boats and on RTS engineering and production equipment, on rentals for the CPF Building and World Trade Centre by Ministries and Departments, and on the new Residents' Committees in Constituencies. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants, Subsidies and Other Transfers, comprising largely grants for the recurrent expenditure of Statutory Boards, tertiary education institutions and aided schools will increase by $45 million or 12% over the current provision. This increase is to cater for normal salary increments, increase in CPF contributions and provision for new posts. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Revenue</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated revenue for FY 79 at existing tax rates is $3,885 million, representing an increase of 5.6% over the revised estimate for FY 78. This increase compares favourably with the expected revenue growth of 3.4% for FY 78 over FY 77. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax continues to account for the largest single source of revenue at 36% of total revenue receipts. For FY 79, income tax is expected to yield $1,400 million, an increase of 8% over the expected receipts in FY 78. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimate of $3,885 million covers the estimated recurrent expenditure of $3,374 million, leaving a surplus of $511 million available for transfer to the Development Fund. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this transfer, however, there is still a deficit of $1,186 million to finance the large development expenditure. This will be met by borrowings and a drawdown of the Development Fund. The question can be asked whether this deficit should not also be partially financed by additional taxes - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> which brings me to the bugbear of every Budget Session - tax changes. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>TAX CHANGES</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 79, I intend to introduce no new taxes. [Applause] Mr Speaker, Sir, the applause is slightly premature, because I do intend to introduce the following surprises. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our policy that effort, talent and skills at all levels should be equitably rewarded. Tax is a necessary evil of any good government but it must never be so high as to become a disincentive to work harder. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the burden of personal income tax was lightened. The tax reduction varied from 7.7% to 20.7%. depending on the tax bracket. The average tax cut was 14.8%. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax cut last year has checked the rising trend of personal income tax expressed as a percentage of total revenue. In 1970, personal income tax represented 7.3% of total government revenue. It rose steadily every year until 1977 when it reached 13.8%. With the substantial revision to personal income tax lost year, its proportion to total government revenue has been brought down to within 10%. I am satisfied that the general tax burden on individuals in Singapore is well within the international average. I shall therefore not make any changes to personal income tax rates this year but will periodically review them to ensure that both the marginal tax rates and the effective average tax rates of taxpayers in various income brackets will never be so high as to deter them from wanting to strive for more rewards through excellence in performance and diligence in application of time and effort. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first three surprises which I intend to introduce are, therefore, concessions aimed at rewarding hard work and encouraging saving for home ownership and old age security. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First. Members will recall that after the general revision to personal income tax rates last year, the CPF contribution was raised from 15 1/2% to 16 1/2% in July 1978. The maximum allowable deduction for CPF \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> contribution and life insurance premia remained at $4,000 per year. As a result, the benefits gained from the concession by the lower-middle income groups were eroded by their increased CPF contributions. Relatively most affected are those earning between $1,900 and $2,500 per month whose CPF contributions at the present rate of 161/2% exceed $4,000 per year and those whose income brackets are in the ranges which did not benefit from the reduced tax rates last year, i.e. those with chargeable income between $20,000 and $35,000. To rectify this, I have decided to increase the allowable deduction for statutory CPF contributions to $5,000 per year. This will also benefit all other taxpayers whose CPF contributions exceed $4,000 per year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exemption applies equally to contributions to other approved pension and provident fund schemes in lieu of CPF. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the statutory contributions exceed $4,000 a year, no tax relief will be given for life insurance premia and other voluntary contributions to superannuation schemes. However, where the statutory contributions do not exceed $4,000 a year, the difference is allowable for tax deduction on contributions made to other approved pension and provident fund schemes and premia on life insurance policies. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will take effect from Year of Assessment 1980. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue loss is estimated at $4.9 million per year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second. At present, only half the pension received by resident pensioners is taxed. Out of the total number of 1,240 resident pensioners who paid income tax in 1977, 800, or 64.5% of them, ,had chargeable income, including pension income, of less than $7,500 per year. 412, or 33.2%. had chargeable income of $2,500 per year or less. For this group of pensioners, the pension income constitutes 82% of the chargeable income. For them, the pension is practically the only source of income and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> sustenance. Another 260 pensioners, or 21.0% of the total number of tax-paying pensioners, had chargeable income including pension of between $2,500 and $5,000 per year. Having considered this, and recognising both the past services rendered to the nation by pensioners and the ravages of inflation, I have decided to remove the tax burden on resident pensioners, even though, as I have told the House on another occasion, there was nothing immoral in taxing pension which is income for past services. We have to be a hard-headed Government, but we are not hard-hearted. Wherever we can afford to, we shall show in some tangible way that those who have served are not forgotten. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from Year of Assessment 1979, tax will be exempted on the whole of the pension income of resident pensioners. The largest group of pensioners who will benefit from this concession are those with chargeable income of less than $5,000 per year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue loss as a result of this concession is estimated at $290,000 per annum. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third. Rising prices of properties have had the effect of increasing the value of estates. at all levels. The present exemption ceiling of $100,000 for estate duty does not provide sufficient relief in many cases if the deceased had a house. Therefore, to further encourage home ownership and to relieve the hardship of those most affected by the escalation in property prices, I have decided to exempt from estate duty any one house in a deceased's estate, subject to a maximum value of $200,000. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession is in addition to the existing exemption limit of $100,000 which will still apply regardless of the composition of the estate, but excluding houses. The effect of this concession will be that the existing exemption limit of $100,000 is being raised by $200,000 only if the deceased's estate includes \"one\" house. For example, if the estate comprises a house assessed at $250,000 and other assets of $100,000,, estate duty will be payable on $50,000 only, i.e. on the value of the house \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> above $200,000. If the $350,000 estate comprises entirely of assets other than a house, estate duty will be payable on $250,000, as at present. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption limit of $200,000 for the house will apply to the full share of any one house in a deceased's estate. This should cover most public and private flats, and terrace and semi-detached houses. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the deceased is a pan owner of a house, the exemption will depend on his proportionate share of that house. For example, if the deceased owned one-fourth of a house valued at $350,000; the maximum exemption granted to the estate for that house will be one-fourth of $200,000 or $50,000. A house which is given as an inter vivos gift will not qualify for the exemption, notwithstanding that the value of the house is included in the valuation of the estate if the gift is made within five years of the date of death. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will apply only to residential units. Houses which are registered in the names of companies will not be eligible for the concession, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession, which will take effect from 1st April, 1979, will ensure that in almost all cases, families will not lose their family homes on account of estate duties. The revenue loss is estimated at $16-$17 million per year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and fifth surprises are for the business sector. These are the last two surprises. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth. In my Minister's 1977 Budget Statement he granted a 10% concessionary tax on income derived from offshore reinsurance business. To, further encourage offshore insurance business in Singapore, I have decided to extend the 10% concessionary tax rate to income derived from general inward direct insurance business covering offshore risks. This concession will take effect from Year of Assessment 1980. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth. Under the income tax legislation, the existing capital allowance allowed for company registered cars is restricted to a \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> maximum of $15,000. With effect from 1st April, 1979, I have decided to raise the ceiling of capital allowance for company-owned cars to $25,000 to take into account the higher present day prices of company cars. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget Statement does not match the excitement of last year's. This is as it should be, as we should take stock of the effects of the various tax changes made last year before we embark on further tax changes. It is a completely painless budget, and even mildly pleasurable. But there is a moral to this, and that is, to achieve nirvana you must first experience pain. We have all worked hard in the past. We have all made sacrifices. We have never flinched from the harsh realities of the world. We have had the perseverance and courage to overcome the many obstacles to our survival and gone on to achieve a higher standard of living. We have exercised prudence in our financial policy and we will continue to exercise careful restraint on government expenditure. Now we have a sound foundation for sustained growth. Provided we continue to be practical and realistic, adapting rapidly to changed circumstances and always prepared to work hard to earn and pay for our needs we can face the uncertain and wintry economic climate without the fears and anxieties which plagued us from 1965-1969, and again from 1973-1974. The outlook for the world, is sombre. Even before the cut-off of oil supplies in Iran, the U.S. was expected to have a downturn in its economy later this year. Now there are all the imponderables of when and at what levels oil will be exported by Iran. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of unemployment and protectionism in the industrial countries are persisting. And the world is nervous over the dangers of further escalation and involvement in the conflicts caused by Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea and Chinese troops in Vietnam. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore in 1979 as it has been from time to time in 1965, 1968 and 1973, it \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> means, prepare for the worst and work to achieve the best. This is the philosophy of this budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1979, to 31st March, 1980.\" In accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing Order 84, the debate now stands adjourned. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh, debate to be resumed on what day? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> On 14th March, 1979. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to take the Suspension now.

Barker (Minister for Law and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is not to alter or change the law but merely to re-state it beyond any doubt. Section 7 subsection (1) of the Civil Law Act states that, \"All contracts or agreements, whether by parol or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering shall be null and void.\" What does \"null and void\" mean? This is set out in subsection (2), I quote: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No action shall be brought or maintained in the court for recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager or which has been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager has been made.' \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of betting going on in this town: whether Singapore will beat Kelantan by at least four goals, whether Saas Fee will win the Singapore Gold Cup, or whether, as in the last by-elections, all the seven PAP candidates will win. But, sad to say, it was difficult to get a bet against our candidates, even at long odds, in the last by-elections. That is simple enough. That is plain betting. But when it comes to the commodity market, we can get into difficulties. If one buys rubber, ready delivery, there is no problem. But if one buys rubber for delivery in the future, there may be problems. If the intention of the parties is that no delivery is to be made but merely to pay each other on the difference in the contract prices at the date of the contract and the date of purported delivery, then the question arises: is it or is it not a wagering contract? In the case of Mizrahie v Stenton Nelson &amp; Co. Ltd., in 1958, reported in Volume 24 of the Malayan Law Journal at page 97, the Court of Appeal held that certain transactions in future contracts for the delivery of rubber were colourable and therefore null and void, being wagering contracts. But, the decision in the case should have been confined to its facts. However, because of this case which did not go to the Privy Council, rubber brokers in Singapore were rather concerned as to the state of the law. Hence in 1962 an amendment was moved to section 7, and the amendment is in section 7 subsection 3(b), which states: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall not be deemed to apply - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) ... \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to any contract or agreement which purports to be a contract or agreement for the sale or purchase of rubber either for immediate or future delivery. \n  <br> \n  <br>But members will note that this subsection is confined merely to contracts in rubber. Since then the commodity market has grown, not only in popper and sugar. We even have a gold market which was set up last year. Does subsection (3) (b) cover transactions in commodities besides rubber? To make the position clear, we have decided to delete this subsection and substitute it with a \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> declaratory provision stating beyond doubt, in subsection (4), that: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the avoidance of doubt, whom any contract for the future delivery of any commodity is entered into in any exchange or market in Singapore, the fact that the contract is entered into by one or both parties with no intention of actual delivery of the commodity but with the intention of realising a profit arising out of differences in the price of the commodity shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the contract.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1962 Amendment which I referred to sought to preclude the application of subsection (1), the effect of which is to render a wagering contract void to futures contracts in rubber. This is far from satisfactory as futures contracts are not, as such, wagering contracts and there is no necessity to exempt them from the application of subsection (1) of section 7. What this Bill seeks to do is merely to declare the accepted position at common law with regard to all futures contracts. That is to say, the mere fact that there is no physical delivery of the commodities in question does not by itself affect the validity of such contracts. This clarifies the law in Singapore in a manner which is consistent with the established common law position. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W.

There are commodity brokers in Singapore who deal \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> with local clients in international markets and exchanges. It is therefore desirable, as far as the law of Singapore is concerned, that there should be no doubt as to the validity of these transactions.

The reference to the Civil Law Act in the existing subsection (1) of section 19 of the Rubber Association of Singapore (incorporation) Act is inappropriate and unnecessary and the new subsection to be substituted in its place will have no reference to the Civil Law Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W.

As a consequence of Government's decision to consolidate the 1973-1977 NWC allowances into salary scales with effect from 1st November 1977, the pensionable salaries of the Chief Justice and Judges have been correspondingly increased. The pensionable salary of the Chief Justice has been increased from $7.500 per mensem to $10,815 per mensem, that of the most senior of the Puisne Judges from $6,000 per mensem to $8,650 per mensem and the pensionable salaries of the other Puisne Judges from $5,500 per mensem to $7,930 per mensem.

The Bill also provides that the registration of private vocational training institutions, at present carried out under the Education Act, may be progressively transferred to the new Board. Responsibility for vocational and industrial training and for continuing education will be centralised in the new body. The training to be provided will extend across areas of skilled employment in commerce and industry, including the service trades and applied arts. These developments cut across the functions presently discharged by the AEB and the ITB. The amalgamation of the existing two boards into a single body will rationalise the provision of vocational and industrial training. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, gone are the days when anyone can get meaningful employment without training. As the years go by, employment in Singapore will depend increasingly upon possession of needed skills. Therefore, for a significant proportion of our youth, the VITB will represent a transitory stage between school and their world of work. VITB will place equal emphasis within its training institutes and centres on attitudinal development, work discipline and safety consciousness. One of the concomitant functions of the VITB will be the continued provision of advanced skill training and conversion training or retraining of workers. The VITB in conjunction with the Economic Development Board (EDB) will continue the policy of promoting apprenticeship training within industry. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, training for commercial skills and vocations has been left largely to the private sector. As a result, the latter have developed their own courses and certificates or have followed programmes of other countries. In 1967, the AEB launched its first full-time commercial courses which proved very popular because they met a great need. The VITB will progressively develop comprehensive programmes of commercial education to meet the requirements of our increasingly sophisticated commercial and financial sector in the same way that the ITB has done for the industrial sector. The VITB will seek to establish a higher commercial \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> institute to satisfy the demand for commercial education in Singapore, fulfilling the vacuum between the programmes now offered at the tertiary institutions and elementary skills learned on-the-job or at private institutes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult education, or continuing education as it is more contemporarily called, will be a vital function of the VITB. This will be an integral part of the further personal development and skill advancement of the work force. Thus courses leading to the General Certificate of Education 'O' and 'A' levels will continue to be offered in the evenings. The new Board will also continue to offer programmes in the further study of the official languages of the Republic. An increasingly important aspect of the Board's work will be the mounting of courses in foreign languages. Courses of purely general interest or of a hobby-oriented nature will be discontinued. These will be adequately catered for by the Ministry of Culture's mass media and the community education courses of the People's Association and other bodies. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides developing the necessary wide-ranging curricula and offering the programmes of training, the VITB will become the authority in Singapore for the setting and conduct of examinations and tests in areas of vocational and industrial skills and for the certification of standards. In this role, the VITB will progressively establish an overall national system of vocational certification for skills and vocations in commerce and industry, as the ITB has done for industrial skills under the National Trade Certification (NTC) system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill enacts substantially the same detailed provisions as are contained in the Education Act for the registration of private vocational institutions. There is a consequential amendment made to the latter Act to avoid duplication of registration by the Ministry of Education and the VITB. The Bill provides that the registration provisions may be brought into force separately and applied to specific categories of vocational training institutions. The Bill will repeal the Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa Act and the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Industrial Training Board Act and these worthy boards will cease to exist. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>5.42 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Vocational and Industrial Training Board Bill was introduced in the House on 10th January 1979, I looked forward with great interest to this debate. As the Minister in charge has just pointed out, the Bill is to set up the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) through the merger of the Adult Education Board and the Industrial Training Board. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VITB has a crucial dual role. Firstly, the VITB, through Government's heavy investments in it, must meet the nation's requirements for skilled workers. Secondly, the VITB represents the parallel avenue to self-fulfilment, through vocational and industrial training, for those students who are unable to continue with academic education for one reason or another. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the pace of development of our society would also depend upon an ever-expanding base of vocations and skills. A decade and a half ago computer programmers and technicians were in limited demand. Today it is undeniably true that business and public administration would be inconceivable without them. To give an illustration, the expansion of our public housing, road network and factories would not have been possible without construction workers. And if we decide to introduce MRT in the 80's we shall need not only more construction workers, but also maintenance and systems-control technicians, and a host of support skills as well. The growth of consumer products creates its own demand for service and repair skills. Industry itself will depend on a growing army of skilled workers with a broadened scope. Naturally it will be the role of the VITB to match all these and other needs by realistic planning and providing the training necessary. In doing so, it will offer our school-leavers who are vocationally-inclined the means to take up these jobs. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the VITB also represents the extension of the now tested training system developed by the ITB to all vocational sectors. I agree that the needs of the commercial and service sectors cannot be left to themselves. The steps taken by the Adult Education Board to introduce commercial courses should now be consolidated within a nationally embracive scheme of commercial education and certification. I hope the now board will not confine itself to out-dated and old fashioned programmes like typing, book-keeping and mere secretarial procedures. Our youths should be prepared to take their places in the banks, the financial houses, insurance and the modern marketing corporations equipped with skills to apply high-level commercial techniques and electronics. They should also possess sound and polished office skills. Therefore, I welcome the announcement that the VITB will seek to set up a commercial institute. That indicates that my expectations are likely to be fulfilled. Through the extension of the VITB's planning, curriculum development and training infrastructure to tHe commercial and service sectors, the latter will enjoy the benefits of these complementary functions originally directed (and rightly so) at industrial needs. The provision of commercial education by the VITB will have a stabilising effect on fees in the private sector. The transfer of registration of private vocational and commercial schools to the VITB is a move in the right direction and is also an administrative improvement. Sir, I hope that the transfer will be done in such a way as not to cause inconvenience or disruption. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the merging of the Adult Education Board and the Industrial Training Board. The Adult Education Board has, since its inception in 1960, played a credible and important role in public education, I am glad this role will remain under the Continuing Education programme. However, I hope that the merger will result in a more comprehensive orientation of the AEB's and ITB's part-time programmes into \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> related modules, so that the upgrading of workers will lead to higher qualifications and prospects. The better geographical spread of the institutional facilities of the two boards taken together will make these courses more accessible to workers. I have heard that workers are sometimes unable to follow ITB's part-time courses because of the distances of the vocational institutes from their homes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ITB, since its inception in 1973, has proved a good number of our educationists wrong by successfully graduating tens of thousands of trainees with basic skills who have found employment in industry. These trainees were termed as \"school-dropouts\" in the early 60's as they could not pass their PSLE. But through a more realistic reorganisation of courses for them in the vocational schools then and subsequently through ITB some five years later or so; they proved that they were more vocationally inclined and could, given the right training, find gainful employment without much difficulty. Hence the bold moves made in 1968-71 to establish the vocational institutes have paid off handsome dividends. The NTC certification system has gained increasing acceptance. Those associated with the Adult Education Board - and I pause here because I recognise in this House a person none other than the hon. Member for Anson, who was the founder Chairman of the AEB - that he and others can rest satisfied that their good work will be continued. Those who have served on the ITB can also feel gratified that the larger role of the VITB will be well founded on ITB's experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly pleased to see that it has been decided to retain the tripartite Government-Employers-NTUC representation on the new board. This formula is not only essential for close consultation leading to realistic programmes; but this tripartite collaboration is also the very foundation of Singapore as a nation and which thus underlies our success. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge two things. First, that VITB must place the highest emphasis \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> on attitudinal development. Work discipline, courtesy, pride in work are as important as pure skill. Whether at the level of junior trainee, apprentice, or the advanced skilled worker, the distinguishing quality of a VITB graduate should be the quiet pride and professionalism of the man - or woman - founded in the confidence that no job is too tough or too undignified if one has the tools and the skills. Second, I would also urge that maximum attention be given in the schools to guide vocationally-inclined children towards vocational development. It is more than about time that we must overcome the prejudices of parents for academic education, and develop techniques for determining the aptitudes of children for vocational development \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to refer to two matters in the Bill. Amongst other functions and powers contained in Part IV, clauses 19 to 21 inclusive and Part VI, clause 38(1), the Board will have to appoint a Director, with the approval of the Minister, as well as one of its officers to be the Registrar of Vocational Training Institutions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the appointment of a Director is concerned, I do not know whether or not them is a need to have a deputy director also, although the Bill does provide that \"any person may be appointed by the Board to act in the place of the Director during any period of such absence from duty\". This subclause (3) of clause 38 does not seem, to my mind, to reflect the importance of the post. One seems to get the impression that the provision of a Director to such an institution for vocational and industrial training is sufficient to cope with the demands of the work involved. May I say that even in schools there are either vice-principals or senior assistants to assist the principals. What more the VITB? I would therefore submit that this matter be looked into. Of course, the Minister in charge may, in reply, refer me to clause 39 which concerns \"Employment of Staff\" and point out that the Director as Chief Executive would have assistants. I would therefore add that though it is only too true, is this not going to be a much bigger outfit than before? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter concerns the post of Registrar. He has to keep a register of every vocational training institution registered under this Act. Whereas the term \"Vocational training institution\" in the Bill adequately covers its intention, it should have been realised that there are so many such institutions providing the kind of instruction or training described. Therefore, with the Act in operation, the Registrar will need some time to fully discharge his function because of compulsory registration as required under clause 25 of the Bill. I do not really know whether the \"three months from the date of coming into operation of this Part\" will be sufficient time or will the Registrar alone be efficient and effective enough to handle all this? I raise this point because clause 22 empowers the Minister to specify the types of vocational training institutions to be transferred. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would urge the Minister in charge to have a periodic review of VITB's policies by closely monitoring the impact of its results relating to our manpower needs in the development of Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I give my full support to the Bill. \n  <br>5.57 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to make a very brief comment, in view of the rather important objective of this Bill. Clause 4, paragraph (a), outlines the objects of the Board. Among other things, it seeks to regulate the training of persons employed in both commerce and industry. Judging from the very long statement just made by my colleague, the hon. Member for Punggol, once this Bill becomes law, it is evident that it is going to have very far-reaching effects on the training of personnel in both commerce and industry. I wonder whether those people in the private sector have been given the opportunity to give their views and whether the hon. Minister has consulted the employers as well as the employees. If there is no great hurry, I would suggest that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee so that the various Chambers of Commerce, the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> NTUC, and a number of professional bodies who are conducting their own training could all be invited to give their views. On that basis perhaps we could achieve this very noble objective of upgrading the skills and regulating any training programme as outlined in clause 4. paragraph (a), of the Bill. \n  <br>6.00 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the hon. Member for Punggol for raising no less than six very valid points concerning the nature and scope of vocational and industrial training in Singapore in the future. I would also like to comment on the observation raised by the hon. Member for Jalan Kayu. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, allow me to answer the points raised by the hon. Member for Punggol. Sir, I concur fully with the Member that the VITB should not limit itself to providing only the traditional office skills under its commercial education programmes. As the hon. Member has rightly pointed out, our youths will have to be prepared to take their places in the banks, financial houses, insurance companies and the modern marketing corporations. equipped with skills to apply high-level commercial techniques. Sir, the VITB will therefore act as the pace-setter in commercial education as the ITB has done over the last six years in industrial training. It will train hand-in-hand with commercial firms to meet their needs, as the ITB has done for manufacturing firms. I confirm that the VITB will seek to develop commercial education within a national system of certification in the same way as the ITB has done to industrial training under the National Trade Certification system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grouses of workers who are unable to follow ITB's part-time courses because of the distance of the vocational institutes from their homes, it is not always possible for the ITB to please mill workers all the time. Some are bound to be inconvenienced by the long distances they have to commute between home and the institute. For example, courses in electronics and the electrical trades can \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> only be conducted at three vocational institutes, namely, Aljunied, Bukit Merah and the Jurong Vocational Institutes. Consequently, workers living, say, in Bedok will invariably find these institutes far from their homes. Nonetheless, I would like to assure the hon. Member for Punggol that the VITB will do its best to try to minimise this inconvenience. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a Deputy Director and other assistants to support the Director, clause 38 of the Bill is intended specifically to provide that the Chief Executive or the person to assume overall responsibility for the implementation of the Board's policies shall be the Director of Vocational and Industrial Training and that he is to be appointed by the Board subject to the Minister's approval. The Director will, in fact, be assisted at Headquarters by a Deputy Director and Divisional Directors. Each training institute will be under a Training Manager responsible to the Director. The Training Manager, in turn, will be assisted by heads of departments in charge of training in the individual trades and vocations. I entirely share the sentiments of the hon. Member for Punggol that adequate competent supporting staff is a prerequisite for a sound training system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the post of Registrar, the hon. Member may wish to note that one of the officers of the Board will be appointed the Registrar of Vocational Training Institutions. He will be provided with supporting staff to carry out his functions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill which deals with the registration of vocational training institutions will be brought into force separately. The Registrar and his staff will therefore have ample time to prepare for it. The transfer of registration to the VITB will be done in stages, without inconvenience or disruption. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the emphasis on attitudinal development, I wish to state that VITB raining will be founded on the belief that a good worker is a person with competent skills and sound work attitudes. Equal emphasis is placed on both. The basic full-time programmes for the school-leavers have \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> been revised to increase training in attitudinal development, work discipline, safety and team dependence, among others. Co-curricular activities and visits to industries have been built in to complete the social and work environment experiences. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point raised by the hon. Member for Punggol was on the effort to educate the less academically-inclined school children. I agree entirely with the Member that every effort must be made to educate the less academically-inclined school children and their parents about the prospects and value of vocational and industrial training. I might add the same for employers about the advantages of employing our graduates, who represent a sizable subsidy in training. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VITB will continue to publish the ITB News (to be retitled WTB News) for employers and the public: Techmac and Junior Trainee for the schools, besides a wide range of pamphlets and brochures. Competitions like \"Top-of-the-Trade\", exhibitions on vocational guidance, talks and other activities will be stepped up. I have been very heartened by the support given by the news media to industrial training. I have no doubt they will do the same, perhaps even more, for vocational and industrial training. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to assure the hon. Member for Punggol that policies and programmes of vocational training will be kept under constant review and revision. Otherwise we shall not achieve our promise of vocational training being a parallel avenue for personal development and fulfilment nor our task for creating a skilled, competent and flexible work force. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the observation raised by the hon. Member for Jalan Kayu, the Bill has been carefully studied by the various bodies he mentioned, the NTUC, the Singapore Manufacturers Association, the Chambers of Commerce, because these bodies are represented at present on both the Industrial \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Training Board as well as the Adult Education Board. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Just one additional observation, Sir. Why should we not simply call it commercial and industrial training? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> For the simple reason that besides industrial and commercial education, the VITB will also be conducting other courses. As I have said in my speech on the Second Reading, the VITB will still be conducting courses leading to the General Certificate of Education, both at 'O' and 'A' levels. The Board will also be conducting courses on hairdressing and tailoring for students channelled under the Junior Trainee Scheme, just to name a few. So we cover more than just commercial and industrial training. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ahmad Mattar] \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>CIVIL LIST</b> \n  </div> \n  <br>6.14 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Senior Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Goh Chok Tong) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in the name of the Minister for Finance under item 6 on the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> *The motion reads as follows: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be varied by deleting the figures \"$224,900\", \"$873,680\", \"$219,450\" and \"$17,760\" appearing in the second column thereof and substituting therefor the figures \"$257,900\", \"$935,900\", \"$229,820\" and \"$48,200\" respectively. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provision for the Privy Purse (Class I) and the salaries of Personal Staff (Class II) by $33,000 and $62,220 respectively to meet the 1978 NWC wage supplement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increase of $10,370 for Expenses of the Istana Household (Class III) is required mainly to meet rising costs of utility services, telephone services and the maintenance of vehicles. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $48,200 has been provided under Special Services (Class IV) for the purchase of silverware, crockery, compartment glass racks, and the replacement of one vehicle and one electric typewriter. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to vary the provisions in the Schedule to the Civil List as follows: - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the \"Privy Purse\" from $224,900 to $257,900; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the \"Salaries of Personal Staff\" from $873,680 to $935,900; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for \"Expenses of Household\" from $219,450 to $229,820; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for \"Special Services\" from $17,760 to $48,200. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be varied by deleting the figures \"$224,900\", \"$873,680\", \"$219,450\" and \"$17,760\" appearing in the second column thereof and substituting therefor the figures \"$257,900\", \"$935,900\", \"$229,820\" and \"$48,200\" respectively. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Wednesday, 14th March 1979.\" - [Mr E.W.
