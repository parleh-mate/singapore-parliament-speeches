Member for Toa Payoh that the $750 per month wage ceiling laid down in Sections 33, 35 and 144 of the Employment Act will be raised with effect from 1st December, 1980, to $1,250 p.m. in view of the substantial increase in the level of wages since the ceiling was fixed 12 years ago. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members may wish to know that section 35 of the Employment Act stipulates that Part IV of the Act applies to non-manual employees whose salaries are not more than $750 p.m. However, Part IV applies also to manual employees irrespective of the amount of their monthly salaries. Part IV lays down conditions of service like rest days, holidays, hours of work and payment for overtime work. On the other hand, section 33 provides that where the property of an employer is sold, or any money due to such employer is garnished on the application of a person holding a mortgage, charge or lien or of a person who has obtained a judgment or decree, the court ordering the sale or garnishment shall not distribute the proceeds of such sale or such money unless the salaries due to all employees of the employer have been paid.

Eighteen have been tried in Court and sentenced to death. Six of them were executed after they failed in their appeals to the Privy Council. With vigorous and sustained enforcement, the organised drug trafficking syndicates have been smashed. The deterrent effect of enforcement, convictions and executions is reflected in the declining number of major drug traffickers arrested for such offences after the introduction of the death penalty. In 1976, 11 major drug traffickers were arrested. The figure dropped to six in 1977, one in 1978 and one in 1979. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more significant is that the pattern of trafficking has changed to ant trafficking. The ant traffickers smuggle very small amounts of drugs from Johore Bahru into Singapore. With strict enforcement action at our checkpoints, not much could get through. As a result the addicts are finding it difficult to get their supplies from the street pushers and they have to pay a high price for the drugs. This scarcity has \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> resulted in an increase in the price of heroin at the street level from $35 per gram in 1977 to $333 per gram in the first half of this year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the foreseeable future, I have no intention of introducing amending legislation.

Members are aware, the Hansen Review Team which was recently asked to examine all previous MRT-related studies has finished its task. They have disputed the findings of earlier studies. They state that an MRT is not inevitable and that we will be able to manage quite well in the 1990s and beyond with buses - provided we redesign our bus system in the radical manner that they have proposed. But they have not been able to substantiate their views in a con- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> vincing manner. Serious operational implications, such as high-boarding volumes in the Central Area, have not been considered. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has therefore been decided to do further quantitative work to settle, conclusively, this issue of whether an all-bus system will be able to cope. This will be done as part of the Comprehensive Traffic Study to be undertaken by the Provisional MRT Authority. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Study, which is scheduled to start in January, will be conducted in two phases. Phase A, which will take about 6 to 9 months to complete, will examine in detail the Hansen Team's proposed all-bus system to see if it can be implemented, and if so, with what consequences. Other all-bus systems thought to be comparable or superior to the Hansen Team's system will also be evaluated. In addition to looking at the operational details such as commuter travelling times, bus fleet size and so on, the Study will do an economic benefit-cost analysis that will rank the various all-bus alternatives in their order of merit. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase B which will be done concurrently with Phase A will take about 2 1/2 years. It will do a refined analysis and examine the basic MRT system established in Phase III of the Mass Transit Study to see how it compares with the all-bus system. In addition, at least two other limited but possibly more cost-effective MRT configurations will also be analysed. All these systems will then be subjected to a benefit-cost and financial analysis and ranked in order of merit. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding all that I have said, we should not forget that the MRT is more than just a transportation issue. Its implementation has wide implications, and a decision can only be taken after all factors have been carefully considered. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst the House appreciates the due care and caution taken by the Hon.

And it will be longer than that because the Minister disclosed to the House just now that another Comprehensive Traffic Study will be carried out in two phases, Phase A and Phase B, which will take some 30 months or so. In short, can the Hon. Minister indicate to this House how much more money will have to be spent on such further feasibility studies on the MRT?

When the consultants have made their submission, the Provisional MRT Authority will have to evaluate the proposal and negotiate before actual work on the Study could be implemented. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage for me to give any indication. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the quantum or additional cost involved in the delay on the decision of the MRT, this again is something which is difficult to quantify.

We aim to minimize it. Ours is an open economy and inflation is mostly imported. The Government will, however, continue to keep domestic inflation down by improving productivity in the economy. Our inflation rate for this year is estimated to be around 9%. Barring any major oil price increase in the next 12 \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> months, our inflation rate in 1981 should be lower than this year's. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further oil price increase is a major factor that will determine the rate of inflation in Singapore in 1981. Higher oil prices will mean that we have to pay more for our oil and other imports. Our inflation will therefore depend on the action of OPEC and the consequences of the Iraq-Iran war in the next 12 months. On the domestic front, higher cost of housing construction due to higher oil and labour costs will affect the level of inflation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the effect of any price increase in oil imports is to be ameliorated in the next 12 months, there must be a conscious effort by Singaporeans to conserve energy, thereby reducing our need for oil imports. They must also be more productive and use energy-saving devices so that higher oil import and wage costs are offset by productivity increases. As consumers, they must spend wisely and not excessively. With these efforts, we should be able to minimize the rate of increase in our inflation in the next 12 months. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, possibly, one effective way of combatting inflation is to help Singaporeans to increase their earning capacity.

I do not see the direct linkage or cause of inflation in that question. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> I am no economist, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Minister should be in a better position to clarify this. But let me explain. I go with the layman's understanding that if a person is able to earn more wages, he would possibly be able to withstand the effects of inflation. Therefore, I thought it would be logical for Singapore to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> use this as the main rationale rather than, for example, in some countries where they used to dole out subsidies or financial assistance. In so far as the healthy workers are concerned, it would be possible to train them with new and better skills so that they can take on jobs which can provide better wages. But in certain categories, for example, pensioners, we really cannot use this rationale of helping them to earn more wages. But, at the same time, we do not practise the giving out of doles or subsidies to pensioners. So how do we solve the problem of such a category of Singaporeans? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am now clear as to the import of the question and, that is, the effect of inflation on people who are unable to increase their earning capacity. That is quite different from the causes of inflation. If a person is a pensioner, it is true that he will suffer the impact of inflation and, frankly, there is no way in which the pensioner can be compensated for such pernicious effects of inflation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H.

But, in essence, if the Member is talking about the free-play of market forces as a means to check inflation, and that is generally the thrust of Dr Friedman's arguments, then we think that is applicable in Singapore. We are trying to use market forces to improve efficiency in the economy so that cost increases as a result of wage-cost increases and oil price increases will be offset by productivity increases. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that Milton Friedman said many things, but is the Minister not aware that Milton Friedman blamed excessive supply of money as the basic cause of inflation?

Whether or not money supply is excessive in Singapore is best seen in the inflation rate which we have in Singapore, and I think an inflation rate of 9%, taking into account factors which have caused price increases, such as the oil price increase, would seem to suggest that money supply in Singapore has not been excessive. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, why does the Hon.

There is evidence that the Soviet Union has obtained the use of naval and air facilities in Cam-Ranh Bay from its ally, Vietnam. This has enhanced Soviet strategic capability both in the Pacific and in the Indian Oceans and, if unchecked, will eventually tilt the power balance in Asia to Soviet advantage. Soviet intentions in the region are clear.

There are provisions for military cooperation in the treaty.

It is in the nature of things that big powers will seek to extend their power and influence wherever they can and to exclude the other contending powers from these areas. This is why Singapore has consistently argued for a multi-power presence in the region. A multi-power presence is the best guarantee. No single big power will then be in a position to dominate the region. Singapore has publicly enunciated this and has called on friendly powers to play a role in the region. As the hon. Member knows, we have repeatedly urged the US and the West to play a part in this region as it is so much in their interest as well as ours for them to continue maintaining an active interest and presence in the region. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member is aware that ASEAN is primarily a socio-economic organization. This is prescribed in the Bangkok Declaration of 1967. However, in the recent past ASEAN has increasingly played a political role, as evidenced by its action to mobilize world support to deny legitimacy to the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea. ASEAN has no intention of pursuing a military role unless this is forced upon ASEAN by others. Although ASEAN does not have a military dimension, this has not precluded individual ASEAN countries from instituting bilateral defence cooperation among themselves to enable them to better withstand external threats to their security. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>REPAIRS TO SCHOOL FIELDS</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Delay)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister of Education how many school fields were repaired during the last two financial years; and how many of them were completed and commissioned for re-use within eight months after repair work began. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister of Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> during the last two fiscal years, that is, FY 79 and FY 80, 84 school fields were repaired.

The size of the field is one factor. The other factors are the availability of materials, the efficiency of the contractors and, of course, the supervision of the work involved. I am, therefore, not in a position to say whether the time taken to repair school fields is too long or too short. But from the Ministry of Education's point of view, I definitely agree with him that we would like to have the fields repaired, if we can, within one or two months. But that is obviously not possible because grass takes time to grow and then it will have to be trimmed before the fields can be made suitable for re-use. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, I am grateful to the Senior Minister of State for his comments and clarification.

Member's question first. My Minister has stated in this House before that public assistance allowances are not enough to meet all the basic needs of the recipient. Indeed, it is not intended that they should be. The Social Welfare Department does not see its role as the mere handing out of public assistance allowances. If a public assistance recipient is physically able to work, the Department will find him light work or part-time work so that his earnings, together with his public assistance allowance, will be adequate for subsistence. In the case of the less fortunate ones who are unable to take on any kind of work, the Department will arrange supplementary assistance from privately administered charitable funds. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of public assistance recipients do, of course, receive financial aid from friends and relatives. It is not true to say that a recipient will lose his public assistance allowance if he receives any aid from friends and relatives. On the contrary, as I said earlier, the Social Welfare Department recognises that the public assistance allowance by itself is not enough for subsistence and needs to be supplemented. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of public assistance allowance will be stopped if the Social Welfare Department is satisfied that a recipient has close relatives, for example, children or nephews and nieces or brothers and sisters, who are in a position to support him. In each case, the Department will make extensive investigations to ascertain the financial circumstances of the relatives. I can assure the hon. Member that the recipient will not lose his public assistance allowance if the relatives, who are in difficult financial straits themselves, can only give him occasional help. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Senior Parliamentary Secretary assure me that he will look into the matter if I can refer him to cases of recipients whose doles have been withdrawn on the ground that they are receiving financial aid from their friends? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, we will look into those cases, and if the assistance given is inadequate, we will consider them. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>SINGAPORE FIRE SERVICE</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Fire-fighting in high-rise buildings)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. \n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Acting Minister for Social Affairs whether the Singapore Fire Service is sufficiently and adequately equipped to fight fires in high-rise buildings. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Acting Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the equipment needed to fight fires in high-rise buildings is basically the same as those used to fight other fires. The Singapore Fire Service has the necessary equipment. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tallest mechanical ladders have a maximum height of 30 metres, fires which break out on the upper floors of high-rise buildings cannot be fought through exterior-based operations. They have to be fought from within, using built-in fire-fighting facilities such as internal fire water main systems, fire lifts, pressurised or ventilated staircases and fire-fighting lobbies. The local fire codes require the provision of these facilities in high-rise buildings. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Service practises high-rise fire-fighting procedures every week. Officers and men are sent to high-rise buildings on these occasions to practise fire-fighting and rescue drills and to familiarise themselves with the layout of the buildings. The High-rise Fire-fighting Unit, which was formed in 1976, carries out periodic inspections of fire-fighting, detection and protection systems in high-rise buildings. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Service has a Search and Rescue Squad consisting of 108 men who have undergone intensive training in the rescue of trapped victims of fires in high-rise buildings. They have been sent for specialised training with the Commando Battalion and Helicopter Squadron of the Singapore Armed Forces. In addition, there is a contingency plan for obtaining the assistance of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> RSAF helicopters for carrying out aerial evacuation of trapped victims and for lowering fire-fighting equipment onto the rooftops of high-rise buildings. Three-quarters of the efficacy of these fire practices depend on constant co-ordination and rehearsals of what to do in an emergency. If these practices are not being taken seriously by occupants of high-rise buildings, they will be repeated until the Singapore Fire Service is thoroughly satisfied. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to assure the House that the Singapore Fire Service keeps abreast of technological advances in the fighting of high-rise fires. Wherever practicable, the Service will adopt proven fire-fighting techniques. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, that is all fine for completed high-rise buildings.

The Bill seeks to allow such applicant or owner, his spouse or authorised occupier with the written consent of the Corporation to purchase any commercial property not exceeding $250,000 in value, or such higher value as the Minister may allow, if he uses it to carry on his own business. The amendment is similar to that made to the Housing and Development Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently amendments have been made to the Housing and Development Act to enable the Housing and Development Board, through its authorised officers, to act for parties in the resales and in other transactions of Housing Board flats in cases where the parties are not represented by any solicitors. The Bill seeks to empower the Corporation to provide similar services for owners of Jurong Town Corporation flats in the resale or other disposition of their flats. This is to help the flat owners to reduce legal costs. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act allows the Corporation to acquire a flat sold by the Corporation if the owner contravenes certain provisions of the Act. However, for less serious offences, this penalty is considered too harsh and can cause considerable hardship to a family. In line with the Housing and Development Act, the Bill seeks to enable the Corporation to impose penalties on the owners who contravene the Act, instead of acquiring the flats, where the offences are not serious. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing rules of the Corporation, a person cannot apply for a Jurong \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Town Corporation flat if he owns a property during the 30-month period before the date of his application for such flat. He is also prohibited from owning another property after the date of the purchase of a flat. The Bill seeks to extend this prohibition to cover the period between the date of application and the date of purchase of a flat. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Corporation to take enforcement action where the flat is misused by the owner or any other occupier of the flat. Under the existing law, the Corporation can take such action only if the owner has misused the flat. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the Bill is to make clear that any notice or document sent by the Corporation to the owner of a flat by registered post or affixed to some conspicuous part of the flat shall be deemed to be of good service. This will enable the Corporation to serve notices on owners of flats who try to evade service of notices by locking up their flats and staying away. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Goh Chok Tong]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment: read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr E.W.
