N. J. Vandehoop,  and\r\n\r\nthose submitted by the Science and Industry Museum  Com\r\n\r\nmittee set up in 1961. The Government has also obtained\r\n\r\nthe services of a Colombo Plan expert, Mr Y.

The  results\r\n\r\nshowed  a general preference for exhibits of flora  and\r\n\r\nfauna. In view of this preference and of the limitation\r\n\r\nof  funds  which makes it impossible to  build  up  the\r\n\r\nAnthropological Section of the Museum, it has now  been\r\n\r\ndecided  to develop the National Museum into a  Natural\r\n\r\nHistory   Museum.  In  the  meantime,  the  Development\r\n\r\nPlanning  Committee has given approval for  expenditure\r\n\r\nof  $245,000 to improve the existing building according\r\n\r\nto plans already made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will shortly be introduced to provide for\r\n\r\nthe establishment of a National Museum Board which will\r\n\r\nadvise  and  assist  in  the running  of  the  National\r\n\r\nMuseum.

It is fortunate that\r\n\r\ndefence expenditure can be met in 1969 without reducing\r\n\r\nessential  expenditure in other fields.

The biggest\r\n\r\nreclamation project at present is proceeding along the\r\n\r\nEast  Coast foreshore in two phases: the first reclama\r\n\r\ntion of about 1,000 acres of foreshores extending from\r\n\r\nBedok to the Singapore\r\n\r\nSwimming Club, and the second reclamation of about 125\r\n\r\nacres  from the Singapore Swimming Club to the tip  of\r\n\r\nTanjong Rhu. By the end of October last, 705 acres  of\r\n\r\nland  had  been  reclaimed. It is expected  that  both\r\n\r\nphases  will be completed by early 1970. Comprehensive\r\n\r\nplans  for the utilisation of the reclaimed land along\r\n\r\nthe  East Coast are now being prepared. A new  coastal\r\n\r\nhighway   will  first  be  constructed  to  meet   the\r\n\r\nincreasing needs of the East Coast area. In  addition,\r\n\r\nland will be set aside for housing, parks, hotels  and\r\n\r\nshops.  It  is likely that another 200 acres  of  land\r\n\r\nalong  Nicoll  Highway will be reclaimed  at  a  later\r\n\r\nstage  to  provide better open spaces and recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities for the people in the central areas of  the\r\n\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major reclamation project now in progress and\r\n\r\nnearing  completion is the Kallang Basin  Reclamation.\r\n\r\nOut  of  the 450 acres of swamp land in Kallang Basin,\r\n\r\n370  acres  had been reclaimed by the end  of  October\r\n\r\nlast. The remaining 80 acres will be reclaimed in  the\r\n\r\nnext  two years. Two-thirds of the reclaimed  land  in\r\n\r\nthe Kallang Basin will be used for labour\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintensive industries and one-third for low-cost  public\r\n\r\nhousing.  Two  blocks  of flatted factories  have  been\r\n\r\nconstructed and already occupied, and more  blocks  are\r\n\r\nnow  under  construction. About 3,550 units of  housing\r\n\r\nhave  been  completed and occupied and  another  12,000\r\n\r\nunits  are  expected to be built within the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pasir Panjang reclamation. Early this year, a\r\n\r\npilot  scheme  to reclaim the West Coast foreshores  at\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang  began.  By September,  the  scheme  was\r\n\r\ncompleted and ten acres of land near the 6th mile  were\r\n\r\nreclaimed.  This  piece of land will be  used  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   tourist   recreational   facilities.\r\n\r\nDetailed   investigations  into  the   feasibility   of\r\n\r\nreclaiming  more  land along the West Coast  are  being\r\n\r\nconducted at present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kranji reclamation. A total of 247 acres of swamp\r\n\r\nland  was  earmarked for reclamation out of  which  160\r\n\r\nacres  have already been reclaimed. This area is to  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped for sawmills and related industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, other reclamation projects which are being\r\n\r\nplanned or undertaken include the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 1,000 acres of swamp and foreshore at the east\r\n\r\nbank of Jurong for marine, woodworking and other\r\n\r\nindustries;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 307 acres of prawn-ponds and swamp at Sungei\r\n\r\nKadut for woodworking and other industries;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 108 acres of swamp close to the Armament Depot\r\n\r\nin   the   Naval  Base  for  marine  and   other\r\n\r\nindustries;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) extension of the East Coast Reclamation from\r\n\r\nBedok towards Changi; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) extension of the West Coast Reclamation towards\r\n\r\nthe city to provide an area for the construction\r\n\r\nof godowns.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0106 he reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 2013.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am confident that the Government\r\n\r\nis  still  desirous  of  promoting  and  uplifting  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the  Malays in the Republic  by  giving\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  Malay  children  who  are  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens to acquire higher education. The Malays in the\r\n\r\nRepublic  are  generally far behind in  all  fields  of\r\n\r\nhuman  endeavour.  I  believe the Government  is  fully\r\n\r\naware  of  this  fact.  That  is  the  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  setting  aside  special  bursaries  for\r\n\r\nMalays. But, unfortunately, the bursaries for the  year\r\n\r\n1969/70  have  been reduced. Each recipient  gets  only\r\n\r\n$750  per year. This is half the amount which the Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  received in previous years.  This  amount  is\r\n\r\ninadequate for a student studying in an institution  of\r\n\r\nhigher learning.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first time in the history\r\n\r\nof the Republic of Singapore, students from the Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  stream  are admitted to the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Nanyang  University.  Although   both\r\n\r\nuniversities   provide  courses  in  Malay   studies,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, they both require a pass in English and\r\n\r\nMandarin respectively before students can be admitted\r\n\r\nand  obtain their degrees. One of the ways to improve\r\n\r\nMalay students' knowledge of English and Mandarin  is\r\n\r\nto  stay in the hostel where they can mix freely  and\r\n\r\nharmoniously  with their non-Malay  fellow  students.\r\n\r\nBut  the  reduced amount of bursary of $750 per  year\r\n\r\nfor  each  student  will not  be  adequate  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  Because  the Malays are  still  behind  the\r\n\r\nother  communities in all fields, I make  the  appeal\r\n\r\nthat the special bursaries for Malay students be  con\r\n\r\ntinued  to be given in full for at least a period  of\r\n\r\nten years. If they are given in full, the Malays will\r\n\r\nnot  lag  behind  their  more advanced  brethren  and\r\n\r\nfellow citizens of other communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Acting Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Prime Minister (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the hon.

At  present\r\n\r\nSingapore  Malay  citizens enjoy  free  tuition  from\r\n\r\nprimary school to secondary school level and, if they\r\n\r\nare   qualified,  are  eligible  for   admission   to\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  higher learning.  They  enjoy  free\r\n\r\ntuition in the universities, the Polytechnic  and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the special Malay bursaries were first\r\n\r\nintroduced,  it  was possible to give  everybody  the\r\n\r\nmaximum amount of the award simply because there were\r\n\r\nat  that time very few students who were eligible for\r\n\r\nsuch   bursaries.  This  year  the  number  of  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  who  have obtained bursaries is  more  than\r\n\r\nthree\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntimes that of last year.

There is also an additional reason.\r\n\r\nInterest-free  study  loans  are  eligible   to   Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  as  well as to other students.  So  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in opportunities available to Malay students,\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary  to  modify the original  conditions.\r\n\r\nWhere  before there was no regard paid to the  academic\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the students, now  their  progress  in\r\n\r\ntheir  work, their family income, and the economic  cir\r\n\r\ncumstances  of their family, will have to be  borne  in\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that, all things considered, the\r\n\r\npresent  position  is  one  which  provides  sufficient\r\n\r\nbenefits  to Malays in pursuit of higher education  and\r\n\r\nthat  the new policy would in no way reduce the ability\r\n\r\nof  the Malays to gain admission to higher institutions\r\n\r\nof learning and profit from academic studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

This test has  so\r\n\r\nfar  not been applied on a very large scale. The reason\r\n\r\nis  that  most  of those base employees who  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough the training schemes are still employed at  the\r\n\r\nbases.  In  the  first batch of trainees,  out  of  561\r\n\r\nworkers,   427  successfully  completed   the   course.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the second batch, out of 524 workers, 417\r\n\r\npassed the course. But 90 per cent of the trainees  are\r\n\r\nstill in the employ of the British services. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhether the training would be good enough to get them a\r\n\r\nnew  job  in industry has yet to be seen.

These are not likely to  be\r\n\r\nreleased  until  very late in the rundown  programme,\r\n\r\nprobably at the end of December 1971. So far, only  a\r\n\r\nlimited  number of properties have been  taken  over.\r\n\r\nThese include Blakang Mati, Fort Canning, Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nMaintenance  Park,  30  buildings  and  a  hangar  in\r\n\r\nSeletar, some buildings and a hangar in Tengah, Pulau\r\n\r\nTekong,  Kiat Hong domestic accommodation, the  Naval\r\n\r\nDockyard  and  No. 5 Sub-depot of the  Base  Ordnance\r\n\r\nDepot at Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence has taken over all these\r\n\r\nproperties except the last which is being used as  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  training centre.

It will\r\n\r\nbe some time before a final decision is reached on\r\n\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the air base in Seletar, the present\r\n\r\nintention  is to develop it into a civilian  aircraft\r\n\r\nmaintenance\r\n\r\ncentre.  This project has been under intensive  study\r\n\r\nby the Economic Development Board which has engaged a\r\n\r\nteam  of American consultants to see in what form  or\r\n\r\nwhat shape this aircraft maintenance business can  be\r\n\r\ncarried  on  in Seletar. The study is in an  advanced\r\n\r\nstage of completion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the study by American consultants,\r\n\r\nHawker de Havilland has proposed that they be allowed\r\n\r\nto make use of some facilities in Seletar air base\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto run an aircraft maintenance and overhaul business on\r\n\r\ncommercial lines.

I  can\r\n\r\nreceive  only  one salary and I am being  paid  by  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  therefore  I  am  not  receiving   any\r\n\r\nemolument  from  the Government.

I\r\n\r\nmust  add that I have been relieved of a considerable\r\n\r\nload  of work by the Science Council of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have passed a lot of the problems addressed\r\n\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Ministry is involved in a\r\n\r\nsample  survey of professional and technical manpower\r\n\r\nin  conjunction with the Economic Research Centre  of\r\n\r\nthe University, and there has also been a proposal to\r\n\r\nform a placement agency attached to my Ministry.  The\r\n\r\nreason  is  that  graduates who  have  come  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  from abroad have found that they  are  not\r\n\r\nable to obtain jobs according to their qualifications\r\n\r\nor  training. Some have become square pegs  in  round\r\n\r\nholes and some have become unemployable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these graduates have approached or\r\n\r\nwritten  to  me for jobs. Being responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and the Polytechnic, I am in a favourable\r\n\r\nposition to understand the staffing\r\n\r\nposition in these two institutions. I do hope that  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to help them as far as I can. However,\r\n\r\nthere  is indeed a need for us to explain to students\r\n\r\nwho  go  abroad  for  a higher  degree,  or  even  an\r\n\r\nundergraduate   course,   what   studies   they   can\r\n\r\nprofitably  undertake so that  when  they  return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  they can be usefully employed.  It  is  my\r\n\r\nconcern that many of our young students who go abroad\r\n\r\nhave  not been so counselled and we see now  the  con\r\n\r\nsequences of students taking up esoteric studies and,\r\n\r\non returning, find that they cannot obtain employment\r\n\r\nfor the training which they have undergone. This is a\r\n\r\nproblem with which my Ministry is faced, and  as  the\r\n\r\nwork  accumulates it is my intention at  some  future\r\n\r\ndate to appoint perhaps a Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nassist  me  in  interviewing some of  these  returned\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this explanation satisfies the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, in view of the clarification\r\n\r\nand explanation given by the Minister, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $390,200 for Head 0301 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0401 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam\r\n\r\nChan Choy Siong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the Ministry of Finance has played a very\r\n\r\nimportant  part  in the building of  our  country.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  Ministry has formulated two  industrial\r\n\r\nprojects which have attracted many foreign investors to\r\n\r\nset  up  factories here and thereby create more  employ\r\n\r\nment  opportunities for our workers. The  stability  of\r\n\r\nour  currency has also been maintained, and our  people\r\n\r\nhave  confidence  in  it. This  contributes  to  social\r\n\r\nstability and economic well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At yesterday's sitting, the Member for River Valley\r\n\r\nand  other  Members spoke about the increased  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.   I  think  this  question  needs  our  special\r\n\r\nattention because in the past few years there have been\r\n\r\nmany  changes in the prices of goods. I would  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he will set up  a  Prices  Committee\r\n\r\ncomprising Members of Parliament who can represent  the\r\n\r\npeople of the various constituencies, because they  are\r\n\r\nin close contact with them and know the prices of goods\r\n\r\nvery  well, and officials from the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nas   well   as  representatives  from  industrial   and\r\n\r\ncommercial  circles. The Committee can gather  material\r\n\r\nand data on the prices of goods. Thus, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nthe Committee can prevent an increase in the prices  of\r\n\r\ngoods  and,  on the other hand, it can give information\r\n\r\non  the cost of living and the prices of various  goods\r\n\r\nand also think of a method to impose control on prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to deal with is currency. The\r\n\r\nold  currencies will no longer be used with effect from\r\n\r\n16th  January,  1969. I hope the authorities  concerned\r\n\r\nwill remind the people to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchange notes or coins in the old currency before 16th\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1969, in order to avoid any losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point concerns the question of\r\n\r\nunemployment.  According to information  supplied  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour, the unemployment figure  now\r\n\r\nstands   at   60,000.  After  the  British   military\r\r\n\r\nwithdrawal,  it  will be between 20,000  and  30,000.\r\n\r\nSince  our  Minister  for Finance  is  an  expert  in\r\n\r\neconomics,  I  think he can think of  a  solution  to\r\n\r\nresolve  this  problem, such  as  by  developing  the\r\n\r\nagricultural areas, the opening up of available  land\r\n\r\nfor this purpose and the building of fish ponds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem touches on the question of imports\r\n\r\nexceeding  exports. I think we are all worried  about\r\n\r\nthis.  There  are  also currency  problems  besetting\r\n\r\nother  countries, such as the French currency  crisis\r\n\r\nand  the  pressure  on  the  American  dollar.  These\r\n\r\nproblems are mainly due to the imbalance of trade. At\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  we  have  a deficit  of  $960  million,\r\n\r\nalthough  our total trade amounts to $6,720  million.\r\n\r\nIf  we  have  a  deficit  running  into  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars, it may in the end  lead  to  a\r\n\r\ncurrency crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will think of a solution to\r\n\r\nresolve this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to touch upon the  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  have already been mentioned by the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  just now, one of which being the  increase\r\n\r\nin  the  prices  of goods. I support the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang on this matter because the prices of  goods\r\n\r\nhave  been  fluctuating  according  to  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation.  In order to resolve this problem,  a  com\r\n\r\nmittee  should be set up to look into the  prices  of\r\n\r\ngoods. I hope that members of the committee will also\r\n\r\ninclude   representatives  from  the  Citizens'   Con\r\n\r\nsultative  Committees so that they may present  their\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to the Minister  after  having  duly\r\n\r\nconsidered the various problems connected  with  this\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the pound .sterling was\r\n\r\ndevalued, the expectation was that it should  not  have\r\n\r\naffected  the prices of our goods, but because  of  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  in  exchange, merchants were  able  to  make\r\n\r\nprofits  out  of it. In the end, goods  which  cost  15\r\n\r\ncents  were  charged at 20 cents because the  merchants\r\n\r\nsaid  that it was difficult to give an additional three\r\n\r\ncents change. Thus, the prices of goods were increased.\r\n\r\nTo people with a good income, this does not present any\r\n\r\nproblem, but those in the lower income group would have\r\n\r\nto bear the added burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Minister for Finance announced the Budget\r\n\r\nfor  the  ensuing financial year, he did  mention  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  not  have a painless  Budget  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming financial year. Because of this, the people were\r\n\r\nworried  and  there were rumours that  taxes  would  be\r\n\r\nlevied on refrigerators, television sets, etc. In order\r\n\r\nto  avoid paying additional taxes, the people rushed to\r\n\r\nbuy  these goods so that the Government might incur the\r\n\r\nlosses  in the end. I think the Trade Division has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  properly controlled. That is why such an incident\r\n\r\nhas  happened. Therefore, a committee is very necessary\r\n\r\nto resolve\r\n\r\nproblems concerning the prices of goods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to which the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nshould  pay  attention is this. I have found  out  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  our local goods are more expensive  than  the\r\n\r\nimported  goods. Being produced locally, the goods  are\r\n\r\nexempted  from certain taxes and therefore they  should\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\ncheaper. I can give a very simple example. I have  here\r\n\r\nsome samples of match-boxes. They have an elephant as a\r\n\r\ntrade mark.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One match-box is produced abroad and the other is\r\n\r\nproduced locally. There are ten small match-boxes in  a\r\n\r\npacket.  A local packet of match-boxes, each containing\r\n\r\n48 matches, costs 50 cents. An imported packet of match-boxes, each containing 62 matches, costs 60 -cents. The\r\n\r\nlocally-produced  match-boxes are  not  taxed,  whereas\r\n\r\nthere is a tariff\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  imported match-boxes. This means that  the  people\r\n\r\nare  cheated  in the price of locally-produced  match-boxes.  That is why some people buy cheaper matchboxes\r\n\r\nand goods that are made in China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, a committee should be\r\n\r\nset  up  to  look  into the prices of  various  goods,\r\n\r\nespecially  those produced locally,  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nimposing  some sort of control over them. How  can  we\r\n\r\nexpect  to  encourage the people to  buy  local  goods\r\n\r\nwhich are more expensive than imported goods?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  touch  on the subhead relating to the salaries  of\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless somebody says something now, our Ministers\r\n\r\nwill  be  getting $2,000 a month a hundred years  from\r\n\r\nnow!  I  realise that it will take some time to change\r\n\r\nthe  thinking in Government service, but  getting  the\r\n\r\nbest  at  the  cheapest rate is a clever scheme.  This\r\n\r\nkind  of  thinking  is  probably  inherited  from  the\r\n\r\ncolonial   past  and  has  led  to  some   unnecessary\r\n\r\nexploitation   of   our  talents.  Is   it   therefore\r\n\r\nsurprising that we are having a brain drain  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service to the private sector and  also  to\r\n\r\nother countries? Take, for example, the salary of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance. His salary  is  formulated  on\r\n\r\ncivil  service emoluments of 1955 and I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  much out of date and unrealistic in relation  to\r\n\r\nhis  status and to the work he has to do and  even  to\r\n\r\nthe rise in the cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the House will agree with me that we can\r\n\r\neasily  afford to pay our Ministers more.  I  suggest,\r\n\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\nthat their salary scales should be reviewed and\r\n\r\nrevised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I will start off with prices and  price\r\n\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my Parliamentary Secretary yesterday announced\r\n\r\nthat the retail price index had gone down from January\r\n\r\nto  September  this year from 113 to 111  points,  his\r\n\r\nstatement was greeted with\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  great  deal  of  scepticism, if not  with  downright\r\n\r\nderision.  Obviously people believe that  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving is increasing. But before we argue about whether\r\n\r\nprices  are  going up or down, I would like to  explain\r\n\r\nhow  the cost of living is measured statistically, what\r\n\r\nthe  retail price index means, and the basis  on  which\r\n\r\nthe index is computed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say that prices are going up, it is always\r\n\r\nvery  easy for anybody to point to particular examples.\r\n\r\nThe prices of bicycle-tubes, or shoes, or socks may  be\r\n\r\ngoing  up in one week and you say that on the basis  of\r\n\r\nthis  evidence, prices are going up. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nyou can point to the prices of other goods which may be\r\n\r\ngoing  down  - rice, or chillies, or blachan,  or  what\r\n\r\nhave you. So in our type of economy which is based on a\r\n\r\nfree  market,  prices are always changing  -  some  are\r\n\r\ngoing  up  and some are going down. So how do you  say,\r\n\r\n\"In  general, prices are going up or prices  are  going\r\n\r\ndown,  or  prices have remained stable  when  some  are\r\n\r\ngoing  up  and  some  are going  down  and  others  are\r\n\r\nremaining stable.\"? Obviously, there must be some  kind\r\n\r\nof  averaging process applied to prices of goods bought\r\n\r\nand sold in the market. This is exactly what the retail\r\n\r\nprice index attempts to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail price index is based on a study of what\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore  actually  bought  in  the   year\r\n\r\nnineteen fifty something - I have forgotten the  actual\r\n\r\nyear.  Some people went out and studied what  some  500\r\n\r\nworking  class  families  in Singapore  bought  in  one\r\n\r\nmonth. They kept detailed records of what the housewife\r\n\r\nspent  every  time she came back from the market.  They\r\n\r\nasked  other members of the family, \"How much  did  you\r\n\r\nspend     on    transport,    education,    cigarettes,\r\n\r\nentertainment,\r\n\r\nclothing,  and  so  on?\" Taking the  total  pattern  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure   of   these   few  hundred   working-class\r\n\r\nfamilies, you then arrive at the relative importance of\r\n\r\ndifferent types of consumer goods and\r\n\r\nservices that enter into a working-class family budget.\r\n\r\nThen you can say that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfood  will come to, say, 45 per cent or 51 per cent  -\r\n\r\nand  the  food  items are these: rice, noodles,  this,\r\n\r\nthat and the other. For each item, you can say that it\r\n\r\ncomes   to   a   certain  percentage  of   the   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  The  pattern  of  expenditure  of  these\r\n\r\nworking-class family budgets gives you what is  called\r\n\r\nthe  weights, that is, how much importance you  attach\r\n\r\nto  the different commodities - say if they spend ten.\r\n\r\nper  cent of their expenditure on rice, then rice will\r\n\r\noccupy one-tenth of the total expenditure, and if  the\r\n\r\nprice of rice goes up, then it has a weight of ten  as\r\n\r\ncompared with the total weight of 100. This is the way\r\n\r\nwe measure the cost of living movements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we get the weights which are based on actual\r\n\r\nbudget   surveys   of  working  class   families,   we\r\n\r\nperiodically  send out inspectors  to  take  down  the\r\n\r\nprices.  There is a team of price inspectors  attached\r\n\r\nto   the  Statistics.  Department,  each  of  whom  is\r\n\r\nprovided with detailed instructions. They do not  just\r\n\r\nfind  out whether the price of shoes this week is more\r\n\r\nexpensive  than that of last week. They are told,  \"Go\r\n\r\nto  this shop, check this kind of shoes and record its\r\n\r\nprice  regularly.\" Different inspectors,  will  go  to\r\n\r\ndifferent  shops  to  get  different  types  of  shoes\r\n\r\nproperly specified, so that we do not have changes  in\r\n\r\nprices  which  are  due to, changes  in  quality.  And\r\n\r\nsimilarly  with  the whole range of vegetables,  fish,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  Of  course,  there  are  many  technical\r\n\r\ndifficulties   of   definition  in  getting   standard\r\n\r\nqualities  and so on. But within what is  possible  to\r\n\r\nstandardise  and what is possible to define,  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  way  the  cost of living index is formulated  and\r\n\r\nkept up to date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be asked, \"How is it that in Singapore in the\r\n\r\nfirst nine months of this year, the retail price index\r\n\r\nhas  gone  down by two points, whereas we know  for  a\r\n\r\nfact  that in most other countries, the cost of living\r\n\r\nhas been going up?\" If advanced countries like Britain\r\n\r\nor  the  richest  country in  the  world,  the  United\r\n\r\nStates, are taken, it will be found that this year the\r\n\r\nretail\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprice  increases have been of the order of  between  4\ufffd\r\n\r\nand  6 per cent. That is the measure of inflation  that\r\n\r\nis  going  on  in these countries. But in  poorer  coun\r\n\r\ntries,  the  situation  is worse.  In  a  large  under-developed  country  like  Brazil  when  they  have   an\r\n\r\nincrease in prices of 80 per cent a year, they say that\r\n\r\nthey have done well because the prices had increased by\r\n\r\n200  per  cent  the previous year. Take our  neighbour,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  which  has been racked  by  inflation  ever\r\n\r\nsince  Dr Sukarno thought that economics was a  matter\r\n\r\nfor book-keepers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case, when the official price index showed a\r\n\r\ndecline of two points from 113 to 111 points this year,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  rational explanation  for  it.  You  will\r\n\r\nremember  that last year there was a very big  increase\r\n\r\nin  the  price of rice because of a drought in Thailand\r\n\r\nand   a   general  shortage  of  rice  from  our  other\r\n\r\ntraditional source - Burma. The price of rice  shot  up\r\n\r\nto  50 cents or more a katty for the best quality.  But\r\n\r\nsince  then it has gone down. And because rice is  such\r\n\r\nan  important  item  in the budget of  a  working-class\r\n\r\nfamily,  this decline in the price of rice has  brought\r\n\r\ndown  the retail price index. Therefore, when  you  say\r\n\r\nthat  the prices of shoes and socks have gone up,  they\r\n\r\nmight  have  gone  up  a little bit.  But  because  the\r\n\r\nproportion of money spent on shoes, socks, match-boxes,\r\n\r\nor what have you, is so small compared to that spent on\r\n\r\nrice, the general fall in the price of rice has brought\r\n\r\nabout a fall in our retail price index.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the background. Therefore, it is not\r\n\r\nnecessary,   in   order  to  measure  price   movements\r\n\r\nscientifically, to form a Price Committee.  Unless  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  works  according  to  these  principles   of\r\n\r\nmeasuring  prices, we will be constantly arguing  about\r\n\r\nwhether prices are going up or going down, because they\r\n\r\nmay  be  collecting prices at different  shops  and  at\r\n\r\ndifferent  markets and indeed in respect  of  different\r\n\r\nbrands or different qualities of products. So I do  not\r\n\r\nthink that a Price Committee will be more useful\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  giving us information as to movements in the  cost\r\n\r\nof living than the official retail price index.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang believes that a Price\r\n\r\nCommittee  can  prevent increases in prices.  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  King Canute thought. Governments have  tried  to\r\n\r\ncontrol prices and the net result is the emergence  of\r\n\r\nblack  markets, bribery and corruption.  Where  a  com\r\n\r\nmittee  has no statutory powers, I do not see  how  it\r\n\r\ncan  exert any influence over prices. Mind you, it can\r\n\r\nprobably  browbeat the grocer around the  corner,  but\r\n\r\nthat  is not going to help the people. So in order  to\r\n\r\nensure that the cost of living does not go up, we  can\r\n\r\ntake a number of precautions. The first, of course, is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that we run an efficient port. We get  most\r\n\r\nof  our consumer goods from abroad, including the bulk\r\n\r\nof  our foodstuffs, textiles, and so on. So long as we\r\n\r\nhave an efficient port, a competitive importing system\r\n\r\nand  an  absence of monopolies, we can ensure that  we\r\n\r\nbuy  the cheapest and the best goods from any part  of\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for locally produced goods. I will deal\r\n\r\nwith this subject in some detail later. The Member for\r\n\r\nDelta has raised this point also.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point raised by the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nwas  :  what would happen to the old notes  and  coins\r\n\r\nafter 16th January, 1969? They will no longer be legal\r\n\r\ntender.  Anybody who has these coins  had  better  put\r\n\r\nthem  either  into  the bank or  the  Currency  Board,\r\n\r\nbecause after 16th January, 1969 the bus conductor has\r\n\r\na  right  to say, \"I do not want this money.\" We  have\r\n\r\nalready  announced to the public to send in their  old\r\n\r\ncoins  and  old  notes  quickly,  because  after  16th\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1969, they will no longer be  legal  tender.\r\n\r\nThe  public  will be put to a lot of inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nget  par  value for these coins and notes.  They  will\r\n\r\nnot,  of  course,  be utterly worthless,  because  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  these old notes and coins is guaranteed  by\r\n\r\nlaw. But it would be very inconvenient.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to unemployment, the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nhas suggested opening up arable land, fish ponds and so\r\n\r\non  and  so  forth. The trouble with opening up  arable\r\n\r\nland  is that we have only 224 square miles of land  at\r\n\r\nlow  tide. Where are your vast areas - the new  western\r\n\r\nfrontiers? I do not see them. In fact, I am  trying  to\r\n\r\npersuade   my  colleague,  the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, to induce our pig farmers to raise pigs in\r\n\r\nflatted  concrete structures. This has  been  tried  in\r\n\r\nEngland,  and with such great success that the  British\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Agriculture have banned  this  method  of\r\n\r\nraising  pigs  because they say it will knock  out  the\r\n\r\nordinary farmers who raise pigs on the ground  and  not\r\n\r\nin concrete structures. This is a very efficient method\r\n\r\nof  raising  pigs. I hope I can convince  my  colleague\r\n\r\nthat  we should do likewise. But so far I have not been\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is greatly concerned about\r\n\r\nthe  gap  between imports and exports. He says that  we\r\n\r\nimported  more than we exported, and that there  was  a\r\n\r\ndeficit in our balance of trade. Of course, there is  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  in  the  balance of trade. There  has  been  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  ever  since Sir Stamford Raffles landed  here.\r\n\r\nMind you, each year, for some reason or another, within\r\n\r\na day or two after we have published the twelve months'\r\n\r\ntrade  figures, Radio Peking will say, \"There you  are,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  in  trouble again.  Exports  are  $2,000\r\n\r\nmillion  and  imports are $3,000 million.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  $1,000 million. They are going  bankrupt.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  this has been going on for years. I would ask  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang not to worry at all. We are in  no\r\n\r\ndanger of going bankrupt. What you want is not so  much\r\n\r\na  balance  of trade; that is, the goods you  buy,  the\r\n\r\ngoods  that are transported from the holds of the  ship\r\n\r\nto  the harbours and thence into the shops and godowns,\r\n\r\nand  what we export by sea or by air. That is only part\r\n\r\nof  what  the economists call the balance of  payments.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a deficit in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  balance of trade - that is, we import more  than\r\n\r\nwe  export, and the deficit is very substantial; this\r\n\r\nyear it will probably be short by $1,000 million - we\r\n\r\nmake  it up by what we call \"invisible exports\". They\r\n\r\nare, for example, the earnings of tourists, what  the\r\n\r\nseamen spend when they are on shore in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nBritish  base  expenditure,  which  unfortunately  is\r\n\r\ngetting less and less each year, and our earnings  on\r\n\r\nshipping,  insurance,  and on  the  general  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade. All this makes up the balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, nobody really knows what our balance of\r\n\r\npayments  position is in any given year. I  have  come\r\n\r\nacross dozens of estimates of balance of payments made\r\n\r\nby  the  International Monetary Fund, the World  Bank;\r\n\r\nestimates  made  by  our  own  statisticians,  by  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore Economics Department and so on\r\n\r\nand so forth. But, quite frankly, I do not believe any\r\n\r\nof  them.  At one time those who estimated Singapore's\r\n\r\nbalance  of payments were very modest. You  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  one of the biggest items will be what they  call\r\n\r\n\"E, and O.\" - Errors and Omissions, and they will  be\r\n\r\nrunning  to  $500 million. But now statisticians  have\r\n\r\npresumed  to  be more accurate and this  \"E, and  O.\"\r\n\r\nbusiness  seems to be getting smaller and  smaller.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether that is, in fact, the case. The  proof\r\n\r\nof the pudding, as they say, is in the eating. Whether\r\n\r\nwe  balance our trade or not, the question is  whether\r\n\r\nin  the end our external balances go up or go down. In\r\n\r\nthe  case of Britain, they say all the time that their\r\n\r\nassets go down and they have to borrow from people. So\r\n\r\nsterling  is in trouble. But in our case,  our  assets\r\n\r\nare  going  up year by year and, in fact,  at  a  very\r\n\r\nrapid rate. What are we going to do with such sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  with the international monetary system in  such\r\n\r\nan  insecure  situation? It gives  me  many  sleepless\r\n\r\nnights  to think of what to do with the $2,000 million\r\n\r\nthat we have All is well with our imports and exports.\r\n\r\nDo not worry about that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has dealt with the cost of\r\n\r\nliving. I think I probably\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanswered  her points when I replied to the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang. I do not know whether I have got her  right,\r\n\r\nbut I had the impression that she was complaining about\r\n\r\nmerchants making money as a result of devaluation. I do\r\n\r\nnot  know  why she should complain about other people's\r\n\r\ngood  fortune.  After  all, some make  profits,  others\r\n\r\nsuffer losses, and in the end it all evens up. She said\r\n\r\nthat  after  I  had  said that there  would  not  be  a\r\n\r\npainless budget, rumours apparently were quite rife  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and people rushed to buy refrigerators,  T.V.\r\n\r\nsets and what have you. So what ! She cannot blame  me.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell them that there would not be any increase\r\n\r\nin  tax  in refrigerators, T.V. sets or shoes  or  what\r\n\r\nhave  you.  So  if  they  listen  to  rumours  and  act\r\n\r\nfoolishly, that is their business.

Of  course, he could not tell the people  that\r\n\r\ntaxation would be increased on certain goods. But  what\r\n\r\nI  meant  to  say  was that when the  Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nannounced  that  there would not be a painless  budget,\r\n\r\nthe merchants had the impression that there might be  a\r\n\r\npurchase  tax  on certain goods. They, therefore,  took\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the situation. Hence, the people  thought\r\n\r\nthat it would be better to buy such goods earlier.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  a  refrigerator  -cost  $750,  then   the\r\n\r\nmerchants could sell it for a few dollars more, say, at\r\n\r\n$755  or $760, when the original cost should have  been\r\n\r\nless. Thus the people had to incur greater expenditure.\r\n\r\nBut  the  trade  section did not pay any  attention  to\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sit. I\r\n\r\ntake  the  point,  but  I am really  working  to  this\r\n\r\nposition. Instead of having a price committee, I think\r\n\r\nwhat  can be done is to form a consumers' association.\r\n\r\nThis is rather important, because of the example given\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Delta that locally-made matches are\r\n\r\nmore expensive than imported matches in spite of taxes\r\n\r\nlevied  on imported matches. What is really needed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a consumers' association. It  works  out\r\n\r\nthis  way.  When you form this consumers' association,\r\n\r\nit  can  do  many of the things which the  Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta has been suggesting; that is, it can keep an eye\r\n\r\non  local  industries to make sure that  they  produce\r\n\r\ngoods of the right quality at the right prices, and if\r\n\r\nprices in the retail markets are high, then who is  to\r\n\r\nblame,  whether it is the retailer, the wholesaler  or\r\n\r\nthe   manufacturer.  That  is  one  thing  which   the\r\n\r\nconsumers'  association can do. Also  it  can  get  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with the Industrial Research Unit and see  that\r\n\r\nthe  range  of  goods  which  is  being  sent  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Research  Unit  for  quality   tests   is\r\n\r\nadequate. They can satisfy themselves that the quality\r\n\r\ntests themselves conform to acceptable standards.  All\r\n\r\nthese  things are obviously needed here.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang and the Member for  Delta  will\r\n\r\ntake   the   initiative  in  forming  this  consumers'\r\n\r\nassociation.  If  they  want  any  literature  of  how\r\n\r\nconsumers'  associations of other  countries  operate,\r\n\r\nthe  Trade Division will be very glad to give them all\r\n\r\nthe assistance. This is a practical proposal. In Japan\r\n\r\nand in the United States, and I suspect in quite a lot\r\n\r\nof  other  industrial countries, you  have  consumers'\r\n\r\nassociations  which  can  be  a  very  powerful  lobby\r\n\r\npolitically. The Japanese Consumers' Association,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  maintains  its  own  laboratory  and  takes\r\n\r\nsamples  from  shops  and manufacturers,  and  lobbies\r\n\r\nM.P.s  from  industrial  areas  to  ensure  that  high\r\n\r\nstandards  of  quality are maintained in the  industry\r\n\r\nand  that reasonable prices are charged in the  retail\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Joo Chiat made the rather\r\n\r\ncheerful suggestion that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  deserve  more  pay.

I  have two points. The first  is  that  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board has done a good job  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of industries. However, I should  like  to\r\n\r\npoint out that some of the products of these industries\r\n\r\nare  not  very good. In fact, their quality  is  rather\r\n\r\npoor. If we compare these goods with similar goods from\r\n\r\nadvanced countries, the difference is quite marked. The\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board, in addition to  developing\r\n\r\nindustries,  should  also be engaged  in  the  task  of\r\n\r\nimproving the quality of the products of our industries\r\n\r\nso  that they can compare favourably with products from\r\n\r\nother  countries.  Or at least the  difference  in  the\r\n\r\nquality   should  not  be  so  great.  Otherwise,   our\r\n\r\ncompetitive position in international markets  will  be\r\n\r\nvery poor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local textile merchants have told me some of\r\n\r\ntheir  problems. They complain of the quota system  and\r\n\r\nsay that nowadays they can only sell a limited range of\r\n\r\ntextiles.  They say that the locally-produced  textiles\r\n\r\nare  of  very poor quality. Even though they are  cheap\r\n\r\nand  are  on display, most of their customers  are  not\r\n\r\nwilling  to buy them but prefer to buy goods from  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  or  the  Philippines.  Even  textiles  from   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines are being sold locally. Therefore,  if  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board is concentrating its efforts\r\n\r\nonly  on  the establishment of industries and  neglects\r\n\r\nthe  quality of their products, I feel that this is not\r\n\r\na good sign for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  should pay equal attention to helping the  large\r\n\r\nenterprises  as  well  as  the small  and  medium-sized\r\n\r\nindustries  with limited capital. These  industries  do\r\n\r\nnot  receive much encouragement or help from the E.D.B.\r\n\r\nI  hope the Development Bank, which has taken over some\r\n\r\nof   the  functions  of  the  E.D.B.,  will  pay  equal\r\n\r\nattention  to  large enterprises as well as  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized enterprises. It should give the small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized enterprises the same help that is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nextended  to  the big enterprises. In this  way,  the\r\n\r\nsmall  and medium-sized enterprises will also  assist\r\n\r\nin the industrialisation programme of our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that these two points will be carefully dealt\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> I do not think anyone\r\n\r\ncan  disagree with what the Member for Delta has said\r\n\r\non  what  we should do. On the quality of  goods,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  must ensure that our industries  produce\r\n\r\nnot  only quality goods but also goods that are cheap\r\n\r\nand competitive in the international market. That  is\r\n\r\na basic principle of our industrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the facts? The facts are that the textile\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore produces quality products  that\r\n\r\nare so competitive both in the U.S.A. and in the U.K.\r\n\r\nmarkets  that those markets cannot compete  with  us.\r\n\r\nThey  have  to resort to restrictions. They  have  im\r\n\r\nposed  a  quota system as well as putting tariffs  on\r\n\r\nour  textiles. The same applies to Canada.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nnot  long  ago we sent a team to Canada to  negotiate\r\n\r\nwith  them on the amount of yardage that we can  send\r\n\r\nto Canada in any one year. Actually all we ask for is\r\n\r\nthat  they  open their market to us and  we  will  be\r\n\r\nprosperous  in  Singapore. We can compete  very  well\r\n\r\nindeed  with other countries. The point is that  they\r\n\r\ndo not allow our goods to go in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there are various qualities of products. As\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Delta herself has said, in the shops,\r\n\r\nsome products are cheaper but their quality is not as\r\n\r\ngood.  In  Singapore, we have a very  wide  range  of\r\n\r\ngoods.  Take  your pick. If you like  better  quality\r\n\r\nproducts,  pay  more  for it.  If  you  like  cheaper\r\n\r\nquality goods, they are there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the answer perhaps is as suggested by my Minister,\r\n\r\nthat  we  set up a consumers' association which  could\r\n\r\ncompare  whether  the quality of  a  particular  brand\r\n\r\nselling at so much warrants that price. Or whether the\r\n\r\nquality of a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncheaper brand is comparable with another brand  at  the\r\n\r\nsame price or at a lower price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention that in the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard there is the Industrial Research Unit which  does\r\n\r\nresearch  into the quality of goods. It also undertakes\r\n\r\ntesting. But, of course, such testings are only done at\r\n\r\nthe    request   of   manufacturers.   The   consumers'\r\n\r\nassociation - the Member for Sembawang has said that he\r\n\r\nwill  invite the Minister for Finance to be  its  first\r\n\r\npresident - can request the Industrial Research Unit to\r\n\r\ntest  the quality of goods and then inform its  members\r\n\r\nof the range and quality of goods that are available to\r\n\r\nconsumers  in  Singapore  and  thereby  safeguard   the\r\n\r\ninterest of consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second suggestion that the E.D.B.\r\n\r\nshould encourage small and medium-sized industries  and\r\n\r\nnot just the big ones, again I agree with her. But that\r\n\r\nis  exactly what the E.D.B. is doing. In fact, in order\r\n\r\nto  help  small industries, the E.D.B. has set  up  the\r\n\r\nLight Industries Services Unit. The main object of this\r\n\r\nUnit  is to service light and small industries. It also\r\n\r\nfinances them provided, of course, they can make out  a\r\n\r\ncase and show that the projects they are promoting are,\r\n\r\nin  fact, beneficial to Singapore and are in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the Government's policy of industrialisation  and\r\n\r\nproviding jobs for its citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave\r\n\r\nto withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

I  think that you begin to get this  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the  civil  servant says to a  member  of  the\r\n\r\npublic who approaches him with a problem, that he  is\r\n\r\nsorry,  it  cannot be done, and it is said  with  the\r\n\r\nfinality  that  brooks  no further  question.  It  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not a desirable situation,  Sir.  What  we\r\n\r\nneed  is the civil servant who, when approached by  a\r\n\r\nmember of the public for a problem to be resolved and\r\n\r\nfinding  that he is unable to resolve it, is able  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  how  it can be resolved perhaps  in  another\r\n\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve that situation, I feel that,\r\n\r\nfirst of all, the civil servant needs to inject  some\r\n\r\nprofessionalism into his duties and  also  to  extend\r\n\r\nhis   knowledge  of  the  establishment  beyond   his\r\n\r\nimmediate activity. I think there is also a need  for\r\n\r\nan  inter-departmental  communication  whereby  civil\r\n\r\nservants  in the respective departments could  be  as\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  of  the definition of  duties  in  the\r\n\r\nother  departments  in respect  of  the  other  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  Sir,  I wonder to what extent  this  inter\r\n\r\ndepartmental  communication  exists  in  the  service\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is also necessary to see that powers do\r\n\r\nnot   continue  to  be  vested  with  the  particular\r\n\r\nindividual at the top in the department so  that  you\r\n\r\nwill   begin  to  get  the  civil  service   becoming\r\n\r\nauthoritarian.  I  think there should  be  sufficient\r\n\r\ndelegation  of  duties  so  that,  to  resort  to   a\r\n\r\ncolloquialism,  \"the  buck is not  passed  upstairs\",\r\n\r\nwhich  then makes it difficult for the public to  get\r\n\r\ntheir problems solved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I think it is also opportune for me to\r\n\r\nmention  at  this  stage  the unavailability  of  the\r\n\r\nInstruction  Manual in the civil service today.  This\r\n\r\nbook  is  becoming  as  rare as  the  dodo  nowadays.\r\n\r\nPerhaps   the   Parliamentary  Secretary   will   say\r\n\r\nsomething about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens has enunciated principles on  which\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot  disagree  with  him. He  says  that  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice  is  efficient.  The  objective  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  is to serve the public and it should  be  both\r\n\r\ncivil and helpful. The hon. Member quoted an example of\r\n\r\nsomebody going to an officer and asking him, \"Can  such\r\n\r\nand such a thing be done?\" and the officer replied,  \"I\r\n\r\nam  sorry.  It cannot be done.\" I think it  depends  on\r\n\r\nwhat   the  particular  matter  is.  Sometimes  certain\r\n\r\nmatters  can be said with finality that they cannot  be\r\n\r\ndone.  In fact, that is the very idea of the delegation\r\n\r\nof  authority that the Member for Serangoon Gardens has\r\n\r\nadvocated.   He   cannot  really  have  delegation   of\r\n\r\nauthority and yet be able to say, \"The matter cannot be\r\n\r\ndone.  I will refer it to my superior.\" Surely that  is\r\n\r\npassing the buck which the hon. Member is against.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a matter does not concern that particular\r\n\r\ndepartment but another department, it is expected  that\r\n\r\nthe  civil servant should know about it and be able  to\r\n\r\nhelp the enquirer with the problem. For example, if  an\r\n\r\nenquirer, by mistake, enters the Registrar of Citizens'\r\n\r\nOffice  and  wants to renew his Identity  Card,  it  is\r\n\r\nexpected  that the civil servant in that office  should\r\n\r\nbe able to advise the enquirer, \"Sorry, this is not the\r\n\r\noffice to come to. Will you please go next door to  the\r\n\r\nNational Registration Office? The officer there will be\r\n\r\nable  to  help  you.\"  This is expected  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  and  they  are supposed  to  be  helpful  and\r\n\r\ncourteous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member knows of any particular case in\r\n\r\nwhich  civil  servants are rude or adopt a bureaucratic\r\n\r\nattitude,  perhaps  he can give the necessary  details,\r\n\r\npreferably to the Parliamentary Secretary in charge  of\r\n\r\nthe particular Ministry or to the Minister, or even  to\r\n\r\nthe head of department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of communication between the various\r\n\r\ndepartments, the Government, as far as possible,  tries\r\n\r\nto let its left hand know what its right hand is doing.\r\n\r\nNormally,   correspondence   is   copied   to   another\r\n\r\ndepartment\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat has an interest in the matter concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the unavailability of the\r\n\r\nInstruction Manual, I can only say that, as far as I am\r\n\r\naware, copies of this manual have been distributed to\r\n\r\nall Division I officers as well as those in the\r\n\r\nExecutive grade for reference in the day-to-day\r\n\r\nadministration. Sufficient copies have also been\r\n\r\napproved for issue to various Ministries and\r\n\r\ndepartments, and regular reviews are also made of the\r\n\r\ndistribution of the Instruction Manual.

In practice,  this  means\r\n\r\nthat  if  the head of any office wants advice from  the\r\n\r\nOrganisation and Methods Branch, he must  ask  for  it.\r\n\r\nThe  Organisation and Methods Branch will not interfere\r\n\r\nwith  internal  administration unless it  is  asked  to\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Organisation and Methods - I shall call it \"O.\r\n\r\nand  M.\" in short - recognises that the problems  of  a\r\n\r\nsmall  office  are often as difficult as those  of  the\r\n\r\nlarger  ones.

He   draws\r\n\r\nconclusions  from his study and tests these conclusions\r\n\r\non the department. Finally he makes his recommendations\r\n\r\non  the remedies to be put into effect to overcome  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings which his study has revealed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major assignment in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  was  a  review  of  the  organisation  and\r\n\r\nprocedures of the Accounts Branch of the Ministry.

But  Division III officers  have  not  been\r\n\r\nasked to attend\r\n\r\ncourses at this centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, Divisions I and II officers have\r\n\r\nfewer opportunities than Division III officers to come\r\n\r\ninto contact with members of the public.

They  -are not meant to brainwash  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  but to enable them to understand  better  the\r\n\r\npeople and local conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine that the Political Study Centre should\r\n\r\nteach politics.

We know that  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants are not always wrong. The  Minister  is\r\n\r\nalways wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various sections in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational  Development which carry  out  their  official\r\n\r\nduties  very  harshly. They force people to  move  away\r\n\r\nfrom  their homes. Who is responsible for this?  It  is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister who is responsible. Ours is a  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry  and  it is no longer under colonial  rule.  If\r\n\r\nsettlers do not want to move from a site, we should try\r\n\r\npersuasion.  We should not chop down their  houses.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not  send  out  teams of people  to  drive  the\r\n\r\noccupiers out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, some civil servants who are sent out to the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  steal rambutans.

I believe that the Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre - as pointed out by the Member for Delta\r\n\r\n-  was set up not long after the P.A.P. took over  the\r\n\r\nadministration  of the State and its  activities  then\r\n\r\nwere at their peak. I do not see refresher courses for\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  Division I administrative  officers  in\r\n\r\nvarious   statutory  boards,  apart  from   superscale\r\n\r\nofficers  and  those  who  assist  directly   in   the\r\n\r\nformulation of government policies.

Although  it  was  not possible  to  give  such\r\n\r\ntraining  to  Division  III  officers  generally,  the\r\n\r\nPolitical Study Centre did conduct courses of lectures\r\n\r\nat  the Police Training School, the Teachers' Training\r\n\r\nCollege  and  the Nurses' Training School.  Where  the\r\n\r\nproblem was acute, a special course would be arranged,\r\n\r\nas in the case of the P.U.B. meter readers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware of the situation that civil\r\n\r\nservants  should  understand  and  be  alive  to   the\r\n\r\nsituation  obtaining in the country.  They  are  given\r\n\r\ntraining  in  the  constitutional  structure  of   the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  in political ideologies  as  opposed  to\r\n\r\nparty political ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the general example quoted by the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta  regarding resettlement officers going  down  to\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas and being scolded as puppets  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the officer concerned should know what  he  is\r\n\r\ndoing.  We  cannot,  of course,  train  him  in  party\r\n\r\npolitical  ideas.  What we can train  him  in  is  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  political  set-up  of  the  country  --   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  structure. All civil servants  have  a\r\n\r\nknowledge,  or  at least they should  have,  of  their\r\n\r\nplace  in  the  political set-up. Simply because  they\r\n\r\nhave  been scolded by somebody in the rural area, they\r\n\r\nshould  not give up doing what they are there  to  do.\r\n\r\nThis  is,  of course, a very general sort of  example.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Member concerned can give particulars  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for National Development  who  will  no\r\n\r\ndoubt look into the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member for Crawford's idea of increasing\r\n\r\nfacilities  at the Political Study Centre, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is always alive to the demands.

The original estimated subsidy  for\r\n\r\n1969 was $8.2 million as against $7.8 million for 1968,\r\n\r\nwhich includes some $1.7 million (comprising $1 million\r\n\r\nfor  designing  and  supervising the  erection  of  new\r\n\r\nbuildings,  $0.1  million  for  management  of  housing\r\n\r\nestates and $0.6 million for loan charges) representing\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  accelerated  building  programme  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  to  offset the effects of  British  forces\r\n\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This estimated subsidy was also computed before the\r\n\r\ndecision  allowing for the use of C.P.F. balances  and\r\n\r\ncontributions   to  purchase  flats  under   the   home\r\n\r\nownership  scheme and provided for estimated  sales  of\r\n\r\n4,000  units of flats in 1969. To date, more than 4,200\r\n\r\nC.P.F. contributors have applied to purchase flats with\r\n\r\nC.P.F. money  and expected sales for 1969  are  10,000\r\n\r\nunits  of  flats  - 5,000 new units and 5,000  existing\r\n\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, loans to the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  are at 7\ufffd per cent interest per annum. But  flat\r\n\r\npurchasers  are only charged 6\ufffd per cent per  annum  on\r\n\r\nloans  taken  to  buy  flats under the  home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of subsidy generally, the major\r\n\r\nportion  is in respect of one- and two-room  flats  let\r\n\r\nfor  rent,  whereas flats sold are principally  of  the\r\n\r\nthree-room  type  as one- and two-room  units  are  not\r\n\r\neasily  salable. As long as the level of one- and  two-room  flats let for rent remains as at present - 29,000\r\n\r\none-room  units and 25,000 two-room units -the  subsidy\r\n\r\nlevel will continue. But if the numbers of one- and two-room  units  that are at present rented are  increased,\r\n\r\nthe subsidy will have to increase.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the differential in rentals\r\n\r\nraised  by the Member for Mountbatten, it is, as  you\r\n\r\nhave rightly observed, Mr Speaker, Sir, not a matter\r\n\r\nwhich I am in a position to answer.

It  is  estimated  that   our\r\n\r\nparticipation  in the Teheran Fair  will  cost  about\r\n\r\n$200,000,  considering the additional  transportation\r\n\r\ncharges and the corresponding increase in expenditure\r\n\r\nto  be  incurred  in setting up and  maintaining  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Pavilion  at that fair.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of Government representatives to the fair will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  increased because we do  not  have  any\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  staff in Teheran, as we have in  Bangkok,\r\n\r\nto provide the necessary assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the provision is reserved for other\r\n\r\ntrade fairs.

Participation in each fair will  be\r\n\r\ndetermined, among other things, by the response  from\r\n\r\nlocal  manufacturers  and  traders  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nbenefits   which   might  be   expected   from   such\r\n\r\nparticipation.   For  instance, we   are   currently\r\n\r\nconsidering  invitations to participate in  the  33rd\r\n\r\nInternational  Exhibition Market for  handicraft  pro\r\n\r\nducts  in Florence as well as the Tripoli and  Sydney\r\n\r\nTrade Fairs which are\r\n\r\norganised on an international scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As existing industries get organised and get over\r\n\r\nthat   teething   stage   and  more   export-oriented\r\n\r\nindustries  go  into  operation, increasing  emphasis\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be placed on participation  in  inter\r\n\r\nnational   trade   fairs.   Participation   in   such\r\n\r\ninternational and specialised trade fairs in 1969  is\r\n\r\nbeing  organised by the Export Promotion Centre  with\r\n\r\nthe  advice  and  help of the Trade Division  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance.

At   this   juncture    of    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, it is important for the Government\r\n\r\nto   encourage   industrialists  and   exporters   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in trade fairs by meeting  part  of  the\r\n\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It is part of a very large scheme  and\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Finance  will  play  a  part   in\r\n\r\nencouraging  savings to mobilise  what  is  known  as\r\n\r\n\"domestic  savings\" with which we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nencourage the development of the country. A committee\r\n\r\nwas  formed composed of members from the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  and  the Post Office Savings Bank.  We  were\r\n\r\nalso  able  to  secure the services  of  three  other\r\n\r\ngentlemen, one of whom is the Member for Havelock and\r\n\r\nMr Tan Teck Chwee and Mr Han Fang Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this committee's findings, it was\r\n\r\ndecided,  among other things, to encourage  students\r\n\r\nin  our schools to develop the habit of savings.  As\r\n\r\nfrom  next  year, every Secondary I student  who  is\r\n\r\nable  to save $5 in his own account will get a  gift\r\n\r\nof  $5  from Government. This $5 is the maximum.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  a Secondary I student has a  well-to-do\r\n\r\nparent  and is prepared to put $100 into the  Postal\r\n\r\nSavings  Bank, the Government will give him  $5  and\r\n\r\nstop  there,  and not $100. We anticipate  that  for\r\n\r\neach year there may be as many as 45,000 Secondary I\r\n\r\nstudents. So at the rate of $5 per student,  we  are\r\n\r\nquite hopeful that we will probably get 100 per cent\r\n\r\nof  Secondary I students putting in $5 each into the\r\n\r\nPost Office\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSavings  Bank. The Government will then have to provide\r\n\r\na  sum  of $225,000 for one year, and as the Budget  is\r\n\r\nfor  a  period  of  15  months, the  provision  is  now\r\n\r\n$281,250.  But  there is a little catch to  this.  When\r\n\r\nGovernment  gives $5, it does not mean  that  the  very\r\n\r\nnext  day  the  boy concerned can draw  -out  $10.

The truth is that  some\r\n\r\nof  the expenditure has been recurring over many years\r\n\r\nin  the  past,  long before we became a separate  inde\r\n\r\npendent  state, before we were in Malaysia,  and  even\r\n\r\nbefore  we  were a self-governing state. I think  some\r\n\r\nitems date from the days of British rule. However,  it\r\n\r\nis  true  - as the Member said - that since we  became\r\n\r\nindependent  there  has  been  an  increase   in   our\r\n\r\ncontributions to international organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members can see, the contributions are made\r\n\r\nin  respect of our international obligations - I think\r\n\r\nthat  is a technical cliche used to get away with this\r\n\r\nexpenditure - and in the majority of cases,  the  work\r\n\r\nof these international bodies, I can assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten, has been of benefit to our  Republic\r\n\r\neither  directly  or indirectly.  I  was  hoping,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that he would not ask me to list out all\r\n\r\nof  them - there are 17 of them. And he also asked  me\r\n\r\nfor  the  respective amounts of the  contributions  we\r\n\r\nhave made. Since he has already asked the questions, I\r\n\r\ncannot run away from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we contribute $30,000 annually to the\r\n\r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organisation, $25,000  to\r\n\r\nthe   International  Atomic  Energy   Commission   and\r\n\r\n$215,000  to the Regular Budget of the United Nations,\r\n\r\n$7,000 to the World\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMeteorological  Organisation,  $6,000  to  the   United\r\n\r\nNations  Relief  Works Agency, $55,000  to  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  Educational, Scientific  and  Cultural  Organi\r\n\r\nsation  (better known as UNESCO), $98,000 to the  World\r\n\r\nHealth  Organisation, $215,000 to  the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nRegular  Budget  and  Working  Capital  Fund.  For  the\r\n\r\ninformation of the Member for Mountbatten, may  I  also\r\n\r\nstate  that under this head of $215,000 which  goes  to\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations Regular Budget and Working  Capital\r\n\r\nFund,  a  small amount of money comes back annually  in\r\n\r\nthe  way  of return air passages for five delegates  to\r\n\r\nthe  General  Assembly of the United Nations  to  which\r\n\r\nyou,  Mr Speaker, Sir, once went as a delegate  and  I\r\n\r\nmyself  recently  attended.  The  eighth  international\r\n\r\norganisation  on which we are obligated to  spend  some\r\n\r\nmoney  is  the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative\r\n\r\nOrganisation.  We pay $15,000 for that.  We  contribute\r\n\r\n$5,000  to  the  International Customs  Tariff  Bureau,\r\n\r\n$5,000   to   the  Commonwealth  Scientific  Committee,\r\n\r\n$255,000  to the United Nations Development  Programme,\r\n\r\n$8,000  to  the Permanent Southeast Asian Ministers  of\r\n\r\nEducation  Secretariat,  $60,000  to  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nFoundation,  only  $500 to the Asian  Highway  Project,\r\n\r\n$10,500  to the United Nations Emergency Force (Special\r\n\r\nAccount), $20,000 to the Economic Commission  for  Asia\r\n\r\nand  the Far East (better known as ECAFE).

The\r\n\r\nquestion  is whether our Property Tax Department  has\r\n\r\ndone  anything to revalue properties to  reflect  the\r\n\r\nincreased value of landed properties. To my  mind,  a\r\n\r\nperiodic  revaluation by the Property Tax  Department\r\n\r\nis  logical,  so  that taxes on  properties  will  be\r\n\r\nrealistic and not be based on values which no  longer\r\n\r\napply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another criticism I have to level\r\n\r\nat  the  Property  Tax Department is the  considerable\r\n\r\ndelay  it takes to assess the values of properties  of\r\n\r\nnew  housing estates. It may take as long  as  two  or\r\n\r\nthree years. When the assessment is finally made,  the\r\n\r\nproperty owner may sometimes be required to pay two or\r\n\r\nthree years' assessments in one lump sum. Besides  the\r\n\r\nhardship  this would cause to the property owner,  the\r\n\r\ndelay in the collection of property tax may result  in\r\n\r\na loss of Government revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the delay in assessing property values in new\r\n\r\nhousing  estates and the failure to revalue properties\r\n\r\nto reflect the current land values may be due to\r\n\r\na lack of sufficient technical staff in the Property\r\n\r\nTax Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the 1968 Estimates under Head\r\n\r\n0406,  subheads  1101  to  1133,  there  are  only  58\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff  in the Property Tax Department,  and\r\n\r\nthe  question arises whether this complement of  staff\r\n\r\nis adequate to carry out the technical duties. Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  my view that if the technical staff of valuers and\r\n\r\nassessment officers of the Property Tax Department  is\r\n\r\nincreased,  it  will  not  only  result  in   speedier\r\n\r\nassessment of property values, leading thereby to  the\r\n\r\nquicker collection of property tax, but also allow\r\n\r\nfor  a  periodic  revaluation of  landed  properties,\r\n\r\nleading to increased Government revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again I find it difficult to believe that all\r\n\r\npeople who are liable to income tax actually pay tax.\r\n\r\nI  would  like the Inland Revenue Department to  make\r\n\r\nevery  effort to see that all those who earn  taxable\r\n\r\nincomes pay income tax.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt is no use saying, \"Give us the information,\" because\r\n\r\nI just do not know what a person's income is.

When   their\r\n\r\nvehicles  are confiscated, they buy back their vehicles\r\n\r\nand  go into business again. Surely they cannot do this\r\n\r\nunless  they  earn  $500 or $600 a  month.

If I may make  a  rough\r\n\r\nprojection  from these figures to 1967,  counting  an\r\n\r\nannual  increase of 8,000 or so, we get a  figure  of\r\n\r\nabout 90,000 individual resident income taxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Year Book of Statistics for 1967, at page\r\n\r\n12,  the estimated population figure in Singapore for\r\n\r\npeople  between  the ages of 20 and 49  for  1967  is\r\n\r\n670,000.  Let us deduct from this figure  the  figure\r\n\r\nfor 1967 for workmen, clerks, industrial clerks, shop\r\n\r\nassistants,  namely, 213,700. I got this figure  from\r\n\r\nthe  Year Book of Statistics for 1967. Deducting this\r\n\r\n213,700  from 670,000, we get the figure of  456,300.\r\n\r\nFrom this figure, let us further deduct 72,350, being\r\n\r\nthe  number  of persons registered as at the  end  of\r\n\r\n1967 on the Employment Exchange. We get a balance  of\r\n\r\nabout 384,000 people. Making a further allowance  for\r\n\r\nhalf  of  this number to be females, we get a balance\r\n\r\nof  192.000.  There seems to me to be  a  discrepancy\r\n\r\nbetween  this figure of 192,000 and 90,000 people  as\r\n\r\nmy  projected number of people who had to pay  income\r\n\r\ntax  for 1967.

But even if further deductions have  to\r\n\r\nbe  made,  an impression is created in my  mind  that\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  large numbers of  people  who  escape\r\n\r\npaying  income tax although they would  belong  to  a\r\n\r\ncategory  of people who would be eligible to  pay  if\r\n\r\ntheir income could be assessed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that this impression is substantiated by the\r\n\r\nthought  in  the  minds  of the  people  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Member for Changi. People in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nforeign personnel as well as our own people, think that\r\n\r\nthat is, in fact, the case, namely, that people who may\r\n\r\nbe eligible for income tax do not square up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has commented, if my\r\n\r\nrecollection  is correct, that the figure of  $500,000,\r\n\r\nwhich  will accrue from the 5 per cent levy  on  P.U.B.\r\n\r\nconsumers whose bills are between $10 and $20,  is  not\r\n\r\nto  be  sneezed  at.  Presumably, a similar  or  larger\r\n\r\nfigure,  if  it  could  be collected  from  people  who\r\n\r\ncurrently  do  not  pay income tax  but  who  would  be\r\n\r\neligible  to pay if their income could be assessed,  is\r\n\r\nnot to be sneezed at either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also advised Government departments which are operating on a so to speak stand still budget to develop self-help procedures, if I may\r\n\r\ndescribe  them  as  such, to earn more  money  for  the\r\n\r\ndepartments.  May  I  suggest,  Sir,  that  the  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue Department follow this excellent advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good income tax collector may be worth his\r\n\r\nweight in gold to the Republic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I shall first deal with the\r\n\r\nquestion  of property tax as raised by the Members  for\r\n\r\nChangi and Serangoon Gardens. A study is being made  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry with a view to revising and rationalising,\r\n\r\nas  I said the other day, the annual values as well  as\r\n\r\nthe rates of property tax. At present, the Property Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  grossly  understaffed,  and  when   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  recruitment  is  done,  things  should   get\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as income tax is concerned, it is agreed that\r\n\r\nall  persons who earn sufficient money to be liable  to\r\n\r\nincome  tax  should  pay tax. Under  the  Ordinance,  a\r\n\r\nperson  liable  to income tax charges  is  required  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  a return of his income.

Even if he does not earn any  income,  he\r\n\r\nhas  got to make a nil return. And then, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  return, if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has\r\n\r\ninformation that he has, in fact, got income which  is\r\n\r\ntaxable,  he will be called on to pay the tax.  If  he\r\n\r\ntries to evade, he will be charged in court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I will not be able to dispute the\r\n\r\nfigures quoted by the Member for Katong. I do not know\r\n\r\nhow  he  arrived at the projection of 90,000  persons.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  he  should  look at the definition  of  these\r\n\r\nfigures.   It  could  be  that  they  mean  individual\r\n\r\nresidents, then people who are partners in  a  trading\r\n\r\nfirm  or  if  they are sole proprietors, perhaps  they\r\n\r\nwould  not be included. I am not quite sure because  I\r\n\r\nam  not  conversant with the figures. But I will  look\r\n\r\ninto them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the Member should bear in mind that our\r\n\r\ntax  rates  are such that unless a person, who  has  a\r\n\r\nwife  and two children, earns more than $500 a  month,\r\n\r\nhe  will not be liable to tax. If that is the case, he\r\n\r\nwill  not  be included in the figures the  Member  has\r\n\r\njust  quoted. In fact, it is quite dangerous  to  base\r\n\r\none's calculations simply on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  population figure and then refer to the report for\r\n\r\n1965  and make one's own projections.

It  is  not  a question of anybody  making  any\r\n\r\nprojection  at  all. I did say that  the  basis  of  my\r\n\r\narithmetic  may  have  certain  shortcomings.

So  the projection of  an  increase  of\r\n\r\n8,000  persons  a  year may not be  right  because  the\r\n\r\neconomy was buoyant for the years 1966, 1967 and  1968.\r\n\r\nSurely  we  are dealing with very technical matters.

As  I  said,\r\n\r\nSir, it is quite impossible for me at the moment to say\r\n\r\nwhether  his  figures are right or wrong.  I  can  only\r\n\r\nthrow  some  light on the basis of how the figures  are\r\n\r\narrived  at, and also to say that not every able-bodied\r\n\r\nperson  in Singapore has got to pay income tax even  if\r\n\r\nhe  is  employed.

The Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance told us just now  that  the  Gov\r\n\r\nernment  practises socialism, that is, the rich  people\r\n\r\nshould  pay  more  tax and the poor people  should  pay\r\n\r\nless  tax.  The  officials of the department  concerned\r\n\r\nshould understand this principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the rural areas have complained to me\r\n\r\nthat  the taxes they pay to the Government are far  too\r\n\r\nhigh.  Let me quote an example. A house with four rooms\r\n\r\nis assessed at $1,000 a year and 16 per cent of this is\r\n\r\n$160.  So  the owner has to pay more than $10  monthly.\r\n\r\nCompare  this rate of assessment with that of a  three-room Housing and Development Board flat, which is about\r\n\r\n$13  to  $14  per month. I think the officials  in  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  have not been very careful  when  assessing\r\n\r\nthe  values  of these houses in the rural  areas.  They\r\n\r\nmerely   make  arbitrary  assessments.  As  a   result,\r\n\r\ninconvenience is caused to the people who have  to  run\r\n\r\naround  looking  for  Members of  Parliament  to  write\r\n\r\nletters  for  them  requesting for a reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nassessment. Some of these requests were acceded to, but\r\n\r\nonly after repeated attempts had been made. I hope  the\r\n\r\nofficials in the department will understand\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of  taxation of our  Government.

But   after\r\n\r\nrenovation  these  houses were no  longer  treated  as\r\n\r\nattap  houses. The officials would treat them as plank\r\n\r\nor  wooden houses. This is not reasonable because when\r\n\r\na  house  is in a dilapidated condition it has  to  be\r\n\r\nrepaired. Without repairs how can people go on  living\r\n\r\nin dilapidated attap houses?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the annual\r\n\r\nvalue  of a property is based upon the rental that  it\r\n\r\ncan   let   out  for  a  year.  This  is  a  statutory\r\n\r\nrequirement. However, in the assessment of  properties\r\n\r\nin   the  rural  areas,  the  values  are,  in   fact,\r\n\r\nconsiderably  lower than those of the same  properties\r\n\r\nin  the  city area.

On this score, I do not think the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang can complain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of concessionary rates for attap\r\n\r\nhouses,   the   rate  of  $6  is  still  granted,   on\r\n\r\napplication,  to  owner-occupiers of  dwelling  houses\r\n\r\nmade  of wood and attap. If the roof of a house  needs\r\n\r\nreplacement  because  of wear  and  tear,  the  owner-occupier should bear in mind to replace it with  attap\r\n\r\ninstead of zinc. If he decides to renovate it and make\r\n\r\nextensions  to the house, as is normally done  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas, how can he complain when an official  of\r\n\r\nthe  Property  Tax Department reassesses the  property\r\n\r\nand   raises  the  annual  value?

Efforts have been carried out by every\r\n\r\ngovernment  to  track down tax-dodgers.  Our  Republic\r\n\r\ncannot be an exception in this respect. It is now  the\r\n\r\nopportune time for our Government to set up the  Anti-Evasion  Unit by tapping the knowledge of  U.S.A. tax\r\n\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this particular moment, when our country is facing\r\n\r\neconomic  problems of a magnitude  not  known  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of Singapore, we must endeavour to seek  ways\r\n\r\nand  means  not only to counter the economic recession\r\n\r\nas  a result of the British withdrawal from Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  also  to  encourage and promote greater  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth   in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the public sector, the Government  needs\r\n\r\nlarge  sums of money for public redevelopment as  well\r\n\r\nas for building up the defence capability. Hence it is\r\n\r\nonly  natural for our entrepreneurs, as loyal citizens\r\n\r\nof  our  country, to shoulder their burden by honestly\r\n\r\npaying  their  taxes which are due to the  Government,\r\n\r\nwhile  they enjoy prosperity and live in safety  here.\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind that we are not\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na recipient country of any financial aid from any donor\r\n\r\ncountry. We always stand on our own feet and our future\r\n\r\nwill  depend on our own efforts. Therefore,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  overlook  the  possibility  of  a  minority\r\n\r\nindulging  in  tax  evasion. I need not  emphasise  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  of setting up the Anti-Evasion  Unit  within\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Division to track down unscrupulous tax-dodgers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you may perhaps agree with me that\r\n\r\nduring  the  colonial and semi-colonial  periods,  many\r\n\r\npeople  indulged in illegal business transactions  such\r\n\r\nas  smuggling, perpetrating frauds, gambling and  other\r\n\r\nforms of commercial crime, and they became rich in such\r\n\r\nrackets. The profits arising there- from could hardly be\r\n\r\naccounted  for  by the Income Tax Department.  In  this\r\n\r\nmanner,  a  lot  of  money must have  been  accumulated\r\n\r\ninside  and  outside  our  Republic  by  these  people.\r\n\r\nNaturally, they do not dare come out with their  hidden\r\n\r\ncapital  for  investment for fear that action  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  against them, apart from queries from the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Department  as  to the sources of  their  invested\r\n\r\nincome.  This accumulation of hidden capital  must  run\r\n\r\nwell  into  hundreds of millions of  dollars.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  people may sincerely want to start  off  with  a\r\n\r\nclean  state and invest their money in honest business.\r\n\r\nEvery endeavour must be made to attract this idle money\r\n\r\nto come out from underground for useful investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it possible for the Government\r\n\r\nto  work out some solution whereby this enormous sum of\r\n\r\nunder\r\n\r\nground capital can come out into the open without  fear\r\n\r\nand  prejudice? If this is possible, I am sure it  will\r\n\r\ntremendously help the economic growth of the  Republic,\r\n\r\notherwise this hidden money will remain idle or it will\r\n\r\neven  be sneaked out from the Republic. The stolen hens\r\n\r\nmust  be  allowed to come out openly to lay eggs  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  shared between the Government and the  owners.\r\n\r\nThese  eggs  may,  in time to come, produce  more  hens\r\n\r\nwhich in turn will produce more eggs. In other words,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nif  the  hidden  capital can be  utilised  in  honest\r\n\r\ninvestments, the Government and the owners will enjoy\r\n\r\na  profitable  partnership. I am sure that  our  able\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, who is an eminent  economist,\r\n\r\nwill  be shrewd enough to work out a scheme to tackle\r\n\r\nthis  problem,  if  he  considers  that  now  is  the\r\n\r\nappropriate time to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, this is not the first\r\n\r\ntime that this subject has been raised in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Committee  of  Supply on  the  Estimates  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  in  this House last year,  the  Minister\r\n\r\npromised  to give consideration to this matter.  This\r\n\r\nHouse may be interested to hear his comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this year's\r\n\r\nBudget  under  the Income Tax Division,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nprovision of $500,000 to set up an Anti-Evasion Unit.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to know whether the Minister can  give\r\n\r\nany  indication of the amount of income tax  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing evaded annually. At a time when our Republic is\r\n\r\nin  need  of  every cent for defence expenditure  and\r\n\r\nsocial services, it is most appropriate that the Anti\r\n\r\n-Evasion  Unit be set up to collect every  source  of\r\n\r\nrevenue that is due to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that this sum of $500,000 would be more\r\n\r\nusefully spent on the employment of staff to  prevent\r\n\r\ntax  evasion and to streamline income tax  collection\r\n\r\nthan  to wait for persons to evade tax and then bring\r\n\r\nthem to book.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> As in other countries, it is felt\r\n\r\nthat  there  are members of the public who attempt  to\r\n\r\nevade   paying  income  tax  by  not  making  a   full\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of their sources of income.  It  is  felt,\r\n\r\nhowever, that every effort should be made to plug  the\r\n\r\nloopholes  in the law to prevent tax evasion  wherever\r\n\r\npossible  rather than to raise the tax rates in  order\r\n\r\nto  increase  the total revenue. Hence an Anti-Evasion\r\n\r\nUnit  with advanced methods of investigation to detect\r\n\r\ntax  evasion is being set up.

For the estimates of expenditure for the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1969 and the first quarter of 1970,  the\r\n\r\nsalaries for the five Ambassadors, Grade 111, have been\r\n\r\nlumped  together in one sum. Why must the salaries  for\r\n\r\nthese  Ambassadors be grouped together? Is it  to  hide\r\n\r\nany  disparity in the salary scheme for the Ambassadors\r\n\r\nwho   are  all  Grade  III?  Is  this  to  prevent  any\r\n\r\nembarrassment among the Grade III Ambassadors, as  this\r\n\r\nmust  have  been  done  when we see  the  estimates  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the financial year 1968? One Grade  III\r\n\r\nAmbassador  was stated to draw a salary of $27,240  per\r\n\r\nannum as compared to the rest of the Ambassadors, Grade\r\n\r\nIII,  who were drawing $20,040 per annum each.

Will the Minister for  Foreign  Affairs\r\n\r\nadopt  a similar attitude in the attempt to get  good\r\n\r\nmen  for our Missions abroad? For instance, we should\r\n\r\nget people who can perform the same type of duties as\r\n\r\nour  representative  in Indonesia.  His  performances\r\n\r\nwere  praised in this House yesterday. In the attempt\r\n\r\nto  attract  the  best brains into this  service,  we\r\n\r\nshould  increase the salary scales and allowances  of\r\n\r\nour Ambassadors and other representatives overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Joo Chiat regarding what  he\r\n\r\ntermed  a \"disparity\" in the salaries of Ambassadors,\r\n\r\nGrade  III, serving the Foreign Ministry is not quite\r\n\r\ncorrect.  For  technical  reasons,  all  Ambassadors,\r\n\r\nGrade 111, belong to the same category. But there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  thing, as you know, Mr Speaker, as salaries\r\n\r\nwhich are personal to the holders. For those reasons,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the  importance and  location  of  the\r\n\r\nmissions, the salaries of Ambassadors vary. In  order\r\n\r\nto attract suitable persons to become Ambassadors and\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioners from outside the career  service,\r\n\r\npersons  have  often to be paid  more  than  what  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in the Estimates. We  must  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  emoluments they were then receiving  on\r\n\r\nthe  day  of  their appointment. In the case  of  one\r\n\r\nAmbassador,  he  was  already drawing  a  substantive\r\n\r\nsalary of $2,000, and this is the basic salary  which\r\n\r\nhe  still  draws as Ambassador. This is  what  I  was\r\n\r\nreferring to when I say \"salary personal to  holder\",\r\n\r\neven  though  the  basic  salary  for  a  Grade   III\r\n\r\nAmbassador  as provided for in the Estimates  is,  in\r\n\r\nthe majority of cases, $1,670.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We do\r\n\r\nnot  have  natural resources, but we have  managed  to\r\n\r\nsurvive and live in peace and order as a result of the\r\n\r\ntalents  of  our people who have worked  towards  this\r\n\r\nend.  At the same time, we can be proud of our  secure\r\n\r\neconomic base and of the non-aligned foreign policy we\r\n\r\npursue.  As  a result of this policy, our country  has\r\n\r\nmanaged   to   escape  involvement  in   international\r\n\r\nconflicts. We can say that this is a very wise  policy\r\n\r\nof our Government. If we can continue with it, I think\r\n\r\nthe future of Singapore will be bright.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are certain problems which remain with\r\n\r\nus.  I wish to mention a few. One of them is that  the\r\n\r\ncountries surrounding Singapore are still in  a  state\r\n\r\nof  turbulence and restlessness. Singapore is a member\r\n\r\nof ASEAN. There is a problem in ASEAN which gives rise\r\n\r\nto  instability. I would like to ask the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState for Foreign Affairs what the present position of\r\n\r\nASEAN  is.  Does  he  think that  ASEAN  will  produce\r\n\r\nconcrete results? As a matter of ASEAN, what sort of a\r\n\r\nfuture do we have?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everybody knows, we are faced with the problem of\r\n\r\nincreased  expenditure  on  defence  and  this  is   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable sum. The economic problem facing us is  a\r\n\r\nbig  one.  As  a result of the Minister for  Finance's\r\n\r\nefforts,  we  have  managed to  escape  from  economic\r\n\r\ndepression. The expenditure on defence is not  limited\r\n\r\nto  what we are spending this year or next year.  What\r\n\r\nhappens  after  next year? We will  probably  have  to\r\n\r\nspend  much more on defence with the build-up  of  the\r\n\r\narmed  forces. In the circumstances, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow whether our foreign policy of non- alignment will\r\n\r\nbe affected by our commitments on defence.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is this. In the 1967 Budget we\r\n\r\napproved  the establishment of diplomatic  missions  in\r\n\r\nJohore Bahru and Rangoon. However, up to now, we  still\r\n\r\ndo  not  have any commercial representatives in  Johore\r\n\r\nBahru  and Rangoon. What are we going to do about  this\r\n\r\nnext year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other place is Cambodia. According to last year's\r\n\r\nBudget,  we  were to have an Ambassador  there  but  we\r\n\r\nstill  do  not  have one yet. Who is going  to  be  the\r\n\r\nAmbassador  in Cambodia? I would like the Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs to give me a reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is\r\n\r\ngenerally agreed that Southeast Asia is, and has always\r\n\r\nbeen, beset with trouble, confusion and conflicts. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  throe big powers are pushing ahead with  plans  to\r\n\r\nexert  their influence, if not domination in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia.  Japan, being the third world ranking  industrial\r\n\r\npower,  a position which it has not previously  enjoyed\r\n\r\nthroughout  her  history,  will  inevitably,  with  its\r\n\r\nachievements  during recent years, push ahead  too  and\r\n\r\nexert  her economic influence in this region also.  She\r\n\r\nmay  exert  her domination in the economic  field  over\r\n\r\nthose states which are in a helpless position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, Sir, in our own estimate, if the\r\n\r\nVietnam  war  should come to an end,  we  will  face  a\r\n\r\nnation which has a well-trained and battle-tested  army\r\n\r\nwith  the  best military equipment.

Faced with such  a\r\n\r\npossible situation, the logical conclusion obviously is\r\n\r\nan approach to regionalism. I am glad to say that Singa\r\n\r\npore  has  recognised this as an inevitable process  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the logic of regionalism cannot and should not\r\n\r\nbe doubted.

The  members of ASEAN should not  allow  the\r\n\r\nhistory of Europe -which took two centuries of  wars\r\n\r\nof  tragedies to make them realise the inevitability\r\n\r\nof  regionalism-to be repeated in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on which I seek clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is whether there  is\r\n\r\na better definition of what the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs has so repeatedly and unfailingly said about\r\n\r\nour  non-aligned foreign policy. Sir, can I have  an\r\n\r\nundertaking  that  this policy should  not  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance to any country or any power bloc  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  remain defiant to the inevitable changes  that\r\n\r\nare taking place in Asia? Rather, that it should  be\r\n\r\na  flexible and adaptable foreign policy  that  will\r\n\r\nnot  commit the generation that comes after us to  a\r\n\r\ndifficult\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that we have committed ourselves to\r\n\r\nthe  defence of democracy does not carry with it the\r\n\r\nright for us to jeopardise our succeeding generation\r\n\r\nto  tolerate  or  even to co-exist with  enemies  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  if  the  need arises.

Actually I have the answer  for\r\n\r\nthat one and, with your permission, Sir, may I complete\r\n\r\nit and satisfy the Member for Mountbatten?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, as a matter of fact, I do not\r\n\r\nlike to press further, but if the Minister of State for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  would like to give an  answer,  I  am\r\n\r\nhappy to hear it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Sir, in respect of the emoluments\r\n\r\nof  the  three posts of First Secretaries (Commercial),\r\n\r\nthey  are  actually for the Embassy in Washington,  not\r\n\r\nonly   in   Washington   as  earlier   stated-one   for\r\n\r\nWashington,  two for the High Commission  in  Canberra,\r\n\r\nAustralia, and the Embassy in Cairo. They are in  three\r\n\r\ndifferent places, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post in Washington has already been created this\r\n\r\nyear by an Establishment Warrant and a suitable officer\r\n\r\nfrom  a  commercial firm was appointed.  The  posts  in\r\n\r\nCanberra  and Cairo are new. The former is  to  promote\r\n\r\ntrade  with  Australia and the latter to promote  trade\r\n\r\nwith  the  Middle  East  and Africa.  The  question  of\r\n\r\nsuitable trade and commercial representation abroad  is\r\n\r\ncurrently   under   discussion   with   the    Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Division of the Ministry of Finance and the\r\n\r\nInternational Trading Corporation to achieve the widest\r\n\r\nand   most   apt  representation  without   unnecessary\r\n\r\nduplication and overlap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the comments made by\r\n\r\nthe  Members for Delta and Crawford. They have  touched\r\n\r\nupon  matters of policy pertaining to the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs.  The  Member  for  Delta  was  rather\r\n\r\nanxious to know about ASEAN. Perhaps she is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunderstandably worried about the dispute between  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  and Malaysia. I do not know  if  she  is\r\n\r\nworried that ASEAN will not work because of that  one\r\n\r\nlittle  dispute.  As  I said yesterday,  we  have  no\r\n\r\nillusions whatsoever about regionalism. We  have  com\r\n\r\nmitted  ourselves,  firstly, to  the  philosophy  and\r\n\r\npolicy of regionalism. We believe in it sincerely and\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ASEAN came about, we made a policy decision to\r\n\r\njoin it and we are in it. I also said that the little\r\n\r\ndifficulty  between the Philippines and  Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nnot  going  to  shake our belief in  regionalism  and\r\n\r\ninterdependence  between states  in  Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nASEAN is only one year old and it has not yet brought\r\n\r\ndirect  benefit  to its members. How  could  it?  The\r\n\r\nEuropean  Economic Community is almost 20  years  old\r\n\r\nand  yet it is having difficulties from certain  coun\r\n\r\ntries in Europe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
