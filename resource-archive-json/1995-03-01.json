Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) generally does not issue guidelines to banks with regard to their commercial banking practices as these should also be determined by the banks themselves. Allowing banks to determine their own charges and practices could help increase competition and benefit consumers. For example, in 1975, the cartel system of fixing deposit interest rates among banks was abolished. This benefited consumers as banks thereafter compete for deposits by offering more attractive interest rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to ensure that customers know the effective rate of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> interest charged by financial institutions, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and the Finance Houses Association of Singapore (FHAS) have, at the encouragement of MAS, provided for in their respective codes of conduct that their members should disclose the effective rather than the nominal rate of interest rate payable by customers wherever appropriate. The ABS and FHAS codes of conduct came into effect in June 1993 and May 1994, respectively. Banks and finance companies should therefore already be informing their customers of the effective rate of interest. Nevertheless, the Monetary Authority of Singapore will ask the associations to remind their members of the provision and to comply with it, and will monitor the situation closely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may also wish to know that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has recently issued a circular to all credit and charge card issuers in Singapore requiring them to print prominently on their billing statement the interest rates and charges which the card issuer would impose on cardholders for failing to pay their credit/charge card bills in full by due date and the manner in which such charges would be imposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CREDIT CARD COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Interest rate on roll over balances)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Finance on what basis the Monetary Authority of Singapore allows credit card companies to charge 24% interest rate per annum on the roll over balances of their clients when banks only charge an annual interest rate of 6-9% for overdrafts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are presently 12 credit and charge card issuers in Singapore of which 10 are banks. As Singapore is a free market economy, the Monetary Authority of Singapore does not regulate interest rates charged by financial institutions, as I have said earlier, including banks and credit and charge card companies, for the granting of credit facilities. These are commercial decisions made entirely by the financial institutions based on market competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that cardholders are not obliged to pay interest on their card spending. Interest is charged by card issuers only if full payment is not made by cardholders by due date. Credit and charge cardholders who do not wish to incur interest charges on their card spending should pay up their dues promptly to the card issuer by due date. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 24% interest rate charged by card issuers is stated in the terms and conditions of the credit/charge card and is therefore known to cardholders. Such rate of interest is also imposed on credit/charge card debts in many other countries. The relatively high rate of interest charged by credit and charge card issuers is to compensate them for the credit risk which they undertake and the relatively low annual fees which they impose for the convenience of making purchases via the use of credit/charge card. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to highlight to cardholders the interest charges which they will have to bear if they do not pay their credit/charge card debts promptly, MAS will be requiring card issuers to print more prominently on their billing statement the interest rates which the card issuers would charge cardholders for failing to pay their credit/charge card spending by due date and the manner in which such charges would be imposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister consider that it may be better for the consumer if the conditions for getting a credit card are tightened up so that credit card companies will have less bad debts and people who use credit cards will not be charged exorbitant rates for roll over balances? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The conditions for issuance of credit cards have already been tightened up and, in fact, it has begun to slow down the rate of card issuance. As I have explained, 24% may sound a lot but, in fact, the nominal charges which the bank levies are very low. If you do not want to pay the 24%, you can easily adjust it by paying up on due date. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that credit card companies are making money from the fees that they charge the companies which subscribe to them? And would the Minister agree that the ordinary consumers need some protection and they are looking to the MAS for that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes, of course, they are making profits, otherwise they would not be doing business. But the protection is already provided by MAS and I think consumers should not always rely on the regulatory authority to protect their interests. The best course is to restrain their expenditure wherever they can. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Why do we place so much faith in self-regulation by the Association of Banks in Singapore when their directive has blatantly been ignored in the last two years? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not aware of what directive has been ignored. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The directive that they should state the effective annual interest rate somewhere prominently so that consumers can see it at first glance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> They are now required to do so.

What is the question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The point is that you are implying there is no need for legislation in Singapore because we are a free market economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We have regulation here.

Many Singaporeans are house-owners and today banks are not charging effective interest rates, despite what the Minister has said.

Prof. Walter Woon</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in the light of the remarks by the trial judge in Criminal Case No. 90 of 1993 in regard to police investigation procedures, if he will say what steps, if any, have been taken to improve the procedures. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon is referring to Somporn Chinphakdee who was charged with the murder of his Thai room mate. The Member wants to know what steps, if any, have been taken to improve Police investigation procedures in the light of the trial judge's remarks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of the House, let me restate the main facts of the case. Somporn was charged with the murder of a fellow Thai worker in March 1993. During Police investigation, he complained to the doctor who examined him that he was assaulted by the Police on his chest and right foot. This allegation was immediately referred by CID to the Police Internal Investigation Section (IIS). The IIS investigation was completed before the murder trial. At the trial, Somporn further alleged that a police officer had assaulted him by inserting a needle into his left upper arm. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police's internal investigation found no evidence to support Somporn's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> complaint that he was assaulted on the chest and foot. However, at the murder trial, the manner of the IIS investigation was criticised by defence counsel. The trial judge in his judgment agreed that there were merits in the criticism by defence counsel. Somporn was subsequently acquitted of the murder charge without his defence being called. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police took the trial judge's remarks very seriously. They have examined the present guidelines and procedures used in Police investigations, including investigations by the IIS, and found no flaws or inadequacies in them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Somporn's trial, the defence counsel pointed out that the IIS investigator should have used a more qualified interpreter when he interviewed Somporn. Here we must understand how interpretation is carried out. If statements are recorded from accused persons, certificated interpreters are used. In this case, Somporn was the complainant, not the accused person. Therefore, the IIS investigator used a non-certificated, but nevertheless, proficient interpreter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence counsel also pointed out that the IIS investigator should have interviewed the doctor who examined Somporn so as to satisfy himself of the truth of Somporn's allegation. The doctor's report, which was subsequently tendered as evidence during the trial, reported a minor injury on Somporn's chest and another minor injury on his right foot. The IIS investigator considered this to be inconsistent with Somporn's allegation of repeated assault and Somporn's description of the nature of the assault. He was also influenced by Somporn's own admission that the injuries on his chest and foot could also have been sustained at the construction worksite where he worked illegally. On this basis, the investigator decided that there was no need to interview the doctor. With the benefit of hindsight, Police is of the view that the IIS investigator should nevertheless have interviewed the doctor to conclusively verify his investigative findings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on defence counsel's criticism that no ID parade was conducted, Police's practice is that an ID parade is not necessary if the investigating officer is satisfied that an accused has been accurately identified. In this case, Somporn had already precisely identified and named certain police officers as his targets of complaint. There was therefore no need for any ID parade. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the facts. I should add that it is not uncommon for accused persons to cast aspersions on the conduct of police officers who conduct investigations by alleging assault as a means to discredit the prosecution's case. This is precisely what happens in Somporn's case. His lawyer used his complaints to full advantage and the court gave Somporn the benefit of the doubt. Somporn's allegation that a needle was inserted into his left upper arm was subsequently found to be a lie. He was charged for fabricating evidence about the needle during his murder trial. He pleased guilty and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth of the matter is that this case has been blown out of proportion. It is not the first time an accused person has alleged police assault in order to impugn his own confessional statement. And I am sure it won't be the last time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference, however, in this case, is that for the first time, an accused person has alleged that Police inserted needles into him. But, this allegation has been convincingly debunked. If the accused could lie about the needles, might he not have also lied about his other allegations of police assault? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me reiterate what I said in this House last year: that my Ministry treats all allegations of abuse of powers seriously. All complaints will be thoroughly investigated and any officer found to have abused his powers will be taken to task. We should look at complaints in the right perspective. The number of accused persons who complained of abuse of powers is insignificant compared to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> number of accused persons arrested each year. For instance, in 1993, IIS investigated 94 complaints of police abuse on suspects. It represents only 0.5% of the 18,000 to 19,000 suspects arrested. Of these, only 16 cases were substantiated. The errant officers were dealt with departmentally or even prosecuted in court. There will always be complaints. We cannot avoid them. The important thing is how we deal with them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary was asked last year in this House whether or not the Ministry would consider introducing some sort of independent element in its internal investigation, in order to boost public faith in the system. Would the Ministry reconsider the suggestion made in this House that there should be some independent input into the internal investigation? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this question was raised last year. We gave a reply. The position remains the same. IIS is independent of the Divisions, or CID, which they are investigating. It comes ultimately under the Police Commissioner who is the Commander-in-chief. And as the Commander-in-chief of a uniform service, he takes command of his men. He must have overall charge. So the position still remains that if we trust the Commissioner of Police, as we must, and I think the track record of the Police speaks for itself, then it is better, all things considered, to have IIS remained as it is. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, could I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that we talked about the appearance of bruises and to have an examination 24 to 48 hours after the interrogation, and the Parliamentary Secretary said that he would look into it. Could I please ask what has been done about that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also asked Police to consider the suggestion made by Dr Soin. Police has done so and their considered view is that it is better to keep things as they are. If we examine the accused person later, I think other problems may arise. For example, who is to say that the injury, if any, might \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not have been inflicted by the accused himself, ie, self-inflicted after the investigation? Or for that matter, if there is a time lapse between the time of investigation and the time of medical examination, some people may argue that this time lapse would have allowed Police to threaten, to persuade, to cajole the accused person not to complain. So I think it is better to leave the position as it is. But, having said this, if the doctor finds that there is a need to re-examine the accused person, say, after one or two days, this will be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PUBLIC BUS SERVICES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Improvements)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Communications, in the light of the Prime Minister's 1995 New Year Message on the provision of the ``best possible transport system'', what improvements to the public bus services are being considered by his Ministry (i) to reduce waiting time by increased frequency and regularity of bus services; (ii) to provide more direct and less circuitous routes, e.g., feeder services to MRT stations; and (iii) to promote better driving on the part of some bus drivers and more courteous service from them, bearing in mind the need for bus companies to balance profitability with quality service to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, public bus services are provided by private operators, who agree to offer a good service at reasonable fares to commuters, in return for reasonable returns for their shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive set of bus service standards was drawn up by the Public Transport Council in November last year to serve as the basis for the Council, bus operators and commuters to agree on what constitutes a good service at current fare levels. These standards cover the key areas which are of concern to bus commuters, including the planning and design of bus routes, service efficiency, hours of operation and service information. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the standards on service headways. These standards require 85% of all trunk services to be operated at not more than 12 minutes during peak hours, and not more than 15 minutes during off-peak hours. The other 15% of services, which are usually the extremely low demand services to remote areas, are allowed to operate at longer headways, up to 20 or even 30 minutes. If commuters want a higher standard of service, for example, 100% of bus services to be operated at not more than 10 minutes headway, then they can mandate the Council to raise the standard accordingly. In return, they must be prepared to pay higher bus fares to support the higher operating costs incurred. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus service standards refer to \"headways\", which measure the intervals at which operators despatch buses from the terminals. Arrival times at bus stops are difficult to control, especially when roads are congested during peak hours or inclement weather or when accidents occur. To smoothen the way for buses on our roads, my Ministry is working with PWD to expand the network of bus lanes, and to introduce other bus priority measures, for example, priority for buses to turn at traffic junctions. Bus operators are also encouraged to look into other ways to improve control over bus schedules, to improve reliability of bus services and to provide better information to commuters waiting at bus stops, including information on the expected arrival times of buses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus service standards also address the issue of directness of bus routes. Long, circuitous bus routings are discouraged. Bus links to the MRT are encouraged. The standards also require that at least 95% of all point-to-point journeys do not require more than one transfer. This excludes feeder-to-trunk transfers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current bus service is largely in compliance with the bus service standards set by the Council. In those areas where they do not meet the standards, the bus operators have been given six months \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from November last year to comply. The PTC and ROV will conduct regular surveys and audits to monitor the service level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, good driving and courteous service are qualitative elements of a total bus service package which cannot be addressed by the bus service standards. Over the years, the bus operators have developed a comprehensive and extensive training, monitoring, and education programme, as well as disciplinary and incentive measures to promote good driving and courteous service. I will ask the PTC to ensure that they continue to accord top priority to these two important aspects of customer service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, while I agree with the Minister that much has been done to improve the quality of bus transport in Singapore, I was wondering whether the Minister would consider the following: first, that there will be more effective monitoring mechanisms; second, that these monitoring mechanisms actually be made public; third, that there will be some channels of feedback from the public to, for example, the Public Transport Council, so that if there are any areas, in terms of frequency, or waiting times, and of bus services, etc, the public could actually feed these back to the Public Transport Council, so that the public is aware that these measures are being listened to by the Public Transport Council and the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the question of a monitoring system goes part and parcel with the bus service standards that have been set up. I think the setting up of bus service standards is a very important first step to further improving the bus services. Because with these standards, operators now are put on notice that these are the standards that they have to adhere to. At the same time, commuters also know that if operators do not meet these standards, they have a way to seek redress. Therefore, it is very important for the PTC and ROV to be able to monitor whether bus services on the ground actually do meet these standards. So the monitoring \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> system will be set up. It will be made public. There will be regular reports on the state of bus services which will be reported on by the PTC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of feedback, yes, the complaints from commuters on bus services which do not meet these standards will be actively taken up by the PTC, ROV, and, of course, the bus operators themselves. Because, do not forget, it is most effective if commuters can communicate their unhappiness, if service standards are not met, directly with the operators. Because then you short-circuit the process and you do not have to go through the regulator. But, yes, there are sufficient channels and, if necessary, we will widen the channels of feedback in order for bus commuters to be able to seek redress on these standards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister that he is considering the possibility of a better feedback mechanism. Could I please suggest that, because of the fact that actually 35% of working people, according to the 1990 Census, use public bus only in Singapore, which means that public bus transport is very important, and that most of these are lower-income people who may not be very used to giving written feedback to public bus companies, there could be a hotline that could be established? For example, is it possible that CASE could be one avenue in which consumers - these are really consumers - could make available their complaints? Could there be a hotline, for example, established by the Public Transport Council? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I would ask the Public Transport Council to consider the Member's suggestion. But may I assure her that there is no shortage of feedback on the adequacy or otherwise of bus services through many, many channels, including Members of this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister mentioned just now about reasonable returns for bus companies. What is a reasonable return which the Minister thinks it should be for bus companies, bearing in mind that public bus transport is a public service? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there is no hard-and-fast rule to what constitutes a reasonable return on service. But let me put it this way. The bus companies must make sufficient money in order to cater for re-investment into their service to buy new buses, to invest in new equipment, and so on. They must also make sufficient money to pay their shareholders a reasonable rate of return. Up to now, I think it is public knowledge how much money they make and how much dividends they declare to their shareholders and I think the Member, if he checks, will find that dividends declared so far are not excessive compared to other companies and compared to bus companies in other countries as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>VEHICLE ENTRY PERMIT FEE FOR MALAYSIAN MOTORCYCLES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Review of increase)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Communications if he will review the increase in the vehicle entry permit fee for Malaysian motorcycles in view of the tight labour situation in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) Scheme was introduced in 1973 to ensure that Malaysian-registered cars and motorcycles pay roughly the same cost as Singapore-registered cars and motorcycles for using our roads. This is only fair because they also occupy road space and contribute to congestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VEP fees for cars and motorcycles were revised in October last year because the cost differential between using Malaysian-registered and Singapore-registered vehicles on our roads had widened, due to rising COE prices. The Government will review the VEP fees regularly to ensure that the objective is met, ie, all vehicles, whether local or foreign, are subject to the same costs when used on our roads. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that although the rationale for the increased VEP for motorcycles is perfectly valid from a land transport policy basis, it may not be valid from our labour shortage point of view because the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Malaysian workers who commute daily do not strain the social infrastructure of Singapore, like housing, etc? So would the Minister consider, for motorcyclists who commute daily to Singapore (and I think the figure is 10,000 to 16,000), whether it might be in the interest of Singapore not to look at it purely from a land transport policy point of view? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I have explained the rationale why we had the VEP Scheme. I think it would be very difficult for the Government to explain to Singaporean motorcyclists and car owners why they have to pay such high fees for using our roads when the Malaysian motorcyclists and car owners pay very much less. This is the first point. And, secondly, if we do not equalise it, I think there will be other side effects, particularly the temptation for Singaporean motorists to start using Malaysian vehicles. Land transport policy is a major consideration as far as our VEP regulations are concerned. The point that the Member has brought up about the labour situation has to be addressed in other ways and not via this route. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, I would like to remind the Minister that I was just referring to motor bikes and not cars. Would the Minister agree that, culturally, the best foreign workers we could have are Malaysians and that, even if we had to go out of our way to make them come and work daily, it would be in our interest? Would the Minister please reconsider the matter and maybe talk with the Minister for Labour and see what sort of compromise one could arrive at because I think this is an important matter for Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I would refer the Member's suggestion to the Minister for Labour. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PAYMENT OF MEDICAL BILLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Difficulties faced by patients)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

If the Member would like to ask about the use of legal debt collectors, I think he should file another question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, would the Minister of State clarify whether those who seek treatment at SGH and other restructured hospitals but do not have sufficient money with them at that stage would be accorded treatment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Yes, of course. We have repeatedly said so in this House many times. For A&amp;E cases especially, there is no question whether you need to have a Medisave account or deposit. But if you go in as an inpatient and it is an elective surgery situation, I think all these processes would have been done before the patient is admitted. This is actually to expedite the processing of admission. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister clarify what is the cut-off point for Medifund? For Singaporeans who may not qualify for Medifund, but yet may not have enough Medisave or MediShield to pay, what are the other means that can help Singaporeans pay their hospital bills? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> There is no cut-off point for Medifund as such. It depends on the circumstances of the case. If the patient's Medisave is not sufficient to cover the hospital bills and so on, he can actually seek and use the Medisave balance of his family members because this is the principle of family self-help. But if the family members together still cannot meet the bills, then the patient can apply for support from Medifund. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Education what is (i) the difference between autonomous and independent schools and (ii) the targeted number of autonomous schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> My Ministry has allowed eight secondary schools to be converted to independent schools so that they can have greater flexibility to try out innovative programmes to improve the quality of education. The Ministry will then apply the lessons learnt from the experience of the independent schools to other schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent schools follow the bilingual policy and offer the core curriculum like other schools. The boards of management of the independent schools have the power to appoint and dismiss their staff and decide on staff salaries. The independent schools have enhanced facilities for which they raise 20% of the cost. The Government gives the independent schools the same per capita subsidy as it gives other Government and Government-aided secondary schools. Additional costs per pupil of extra staff and programmes are charged to parents as increased school fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the experience gained from the independent schools, my Ministry has designated 12 secondary schools as autonomous schools. They function like independent schools in having more flexibility and resources to introduce innovative programmes. However, they remain as Government or Government-aided schools and follow the same norms in class size and staffing set for these schools. The Government gives the autonomous schools 10% to 15% more funding per pupil as compared to other secondary schools. Pupils in the autonomous schools pay slightly higher fees than those in other Government and Government-aided schools. With the establishment of the independent and autonomous schools, parents have a wider choice of schools for their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is planning to designate six more schools as autonomous schools in 1996, making a total of 18 autonomous schools. This is likely to be the maximum number. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Sir, would the Government consider converting more of the better schools, including \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the neighbourhood schools, into autonomous schools as we know that the feedback and response have been very good? The other question is: will the Government consider assisting schools which are going independent by helping them to purchase land as well as give them more capital grants? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, the answer to the first question is yes. In fact, an announcement will be made shortly of the names of the six schools which will be converted to independent schools and some of these will be neighbourhood schools. In fact, of the present lot of 12 schools, some are neighbourhood schools. They are decided based on their location and, of course, performance and other factors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question, we have eight independent schools and seven of them have already more or less completed their facilities based on the formula of 80% Government support and 20% raised by the school. So I hope when schools proceed to implement their projects they will be careful not to overspend because that is the best way to control the amount of money they have to raise. But if they face difficulties despite their best efforts, they can come back to the Ministry and we will see what can be done to help them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Is there any difference between the socio-economic circumstances of students in the independent schools, autonomous schools and ordinary Government schools? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I believe the schools attract a good spread of students from all the socio-economic groups.

The ranking is based on the average score of their pupils in the GCE `O' level examinations. The report also highlights the special characteristics and achievements of the schools in sports, cultural pursuits and other extra-curricular activities (ECA). Besides this, the report lists the top value-added schools. These are schools which have achieved better results than expected judging from the PSLE results of the pupils when they were admitted to the schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also provides every primary six pupil with information on all secondary schools in terms of their location, special characteristics, the range of PSLE scores of past pupil intakes, ECA provided, etc. The school profiles and the ST ranking enable parents and pupils to make informed choices of secondary schools to suit the pupils' ability and interests. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievement of schools is not measured solely by their performance in the examinations. Also important are the activities carried out by the school to nurture the physical, moral, aesthetic, social and emotional growth of their pupils. Programmes are conducted to develop talent, build character and foster leadership and team work. My Ministry frequently reminds schools of the importance of providing a balanced education and monitors school activities to ensure that the pursuit of academic excellence is not achieved at the expense of other educational objectives. I announced recently that participation in ECA will be recognised for admission to junior colleges and the polytechnics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principals and teachers work hard to help their pupils to develop to their fullest \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> potential. They are not merely engaged in competition with other schools. Whilst the ranking of schools has led to increased competition among schools, it is debatable whether such competition is healthy or unhealthy. To improve further, our schools need to know the quality of their pupil intake, how they have performed in terms of academic results and ECA, how they compare with other schools, what realistic targets to set and how to go about trying to achieve them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, will the Minister clarify what are the criteria set out in the ranking system, besides the examination results? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The ranking is mainly based on the performance in examinations. As I have mentioned, it is based, for example, on the average scores for all the subjects taken by all the pupils. There are also other information provided like the percentage of 5 'O' level passes and so on. But the report also highlights other activities, eg, whether they excel in particular sports or in cultural activities and so on. The problem is that parents and the public in general tend to focus only on the academic side without realising that the performance of schools depends very much on the quality of the pupil intake. They should really look at the value added. In other words, have the schools added value? Have they taken in, for example, average students and done well eventually? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has said that the ranking criterion is mainly based on examination results. Would the Minister consider having a set of criteria by taking into account other achievements of the schools, ie, the average score for the ranking rather than rank the schools based on examination results alone? There is no use in having the report and characteristics when parents do not really look into that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, it is a fact that most people tend to look at the academic results and the performance. And this is not wrong, I think. But it should not be just focused on that area. We should be looking at the total development of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pupils. Unfortunately, when you compare ECA, it is very difficult to say this particular activity should be given so many points and that activity should be given so many points. What we have done is to list out, for example, how many gold medals the school has achieved and in what fields. This is done in a qualitative manner. I think it is very difficult for us to assign marks or scores for the other areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Ministry conduct any survey in regard to pressure on teachers and students because of the ranking, in which the schools are most concerned with the results of the examinations and thus some teachers do put a lot of pressure on the students concerned? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, the Ministry has not done any formal survey to study the effects of the ranking in terms of pressure and so on. But we do get feedback, eg, on whether schools are over emphasising the examination results, getting pupils to focus on certain subjects and not taking others. When we come across such cases, we remind the schools that they should really look at the total development of their pupils. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Ministry have any information or statistics on the feedback which the Minister mentioned in regard to some schools over emphasising on academic results, resulting probably in an unbalanced education system? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> As I have mentioned, when we do come across such cases, we try to tell principals not to over emphasise the academic results and that they should really look at the total development of their pupils. So it is on a case by case basis. For example, there were reports of some schools which reportedly have told their pupils to leave the school because their performance was not up to the grade. We have told the schools that they should not do that. They are responsible for all the pupils. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how does the Ministry monitor the schools in regard to whether the schools are having a balanced kind of education for their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> students or having put too much pressure on the students, resulting in some unhealthy practices? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, this question of too much pressure is very difficult to measure. I think a certain amount of pressure is essential. There must be competition. Singapore has to compete. The schools have to compete in order to improve. But we do have inspectors, for example, who go round to different schools and we do have feedback from parents, pupils and teachers. So we are constantly monitoring the situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is there any formal kind of monitoring system? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I am not sure how it can be done. If the Member has some ideas, I will be happy to consider them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, in view of what the Minister has said that it is the overall development that is more important, would the Minister consider doing away with academic ranking and just have a qualitative report of the best 50 schools without ranking them academically, but ranking them as the best 50, including academic and other activities, but not giving them a rank as number one, two or three? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, whether you list it out in order or not, I think the parents will tend to go for the top schools. For example, even for the JCs, there are 14 JCs and they are not reported as first, second or third, in terms of academic performance. But the readers will tend to go in and say, \"This school is top and that school is not top.\" I think the ranking has certain pluses and minuses. On the plus side, the schools are more alert. They focus on the academic side which is, after all, an important element of schooling, ie, whether the students have mastered the areas which they are supposed to study. What we want to do is to try and avoid over emphasis on that and also focus on the other areas and, therefore, we should give a total picture including the other areas of activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EMPLOYMENT ACT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Revision of salary ceiling)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Mr John De Payva</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he considers it opportune now to revise the salary ceiling in the Employment Act to $1,600 per month. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the last revision of the salary ceiling in the Employment Act was in 1992.

What this means is that in a winding up process, when the assets of the company are sold, the proceeds from the sale would be distributed in accordance with the priority accorded in the Companies Act after the secured debt has been paid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, claim for wages ranks after the costs and expenses of winding up. However, priority claim for wages, together with the quantum of retrenchment benefits, is subjected to five months' salary or $7,500, whichever is the lesser. Any amount claimed in excess of this limit will not be accorded priority but will rank pari passu with other unsecured debts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon Central may also wish to know that retrenchment benefits, workmen's compensation, Central Provident Fund contributions and remuneration payable to workers in respect of vacation leave are also given priority under the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide adequate protection for workers made redundant as a result of their company being wound up, the Companies Act was amended in 1993 to specifically provide for retrenchment benefits to be paid to employees affected by the winding up. In the event that the quantum of retrenchment benefits is not spelt out in the contract of service or collective agreement, the amount of compensation could be decided by the Commissioner for Labour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should, however, be pointed out that notwithstanding the priority accorded to workers' claims, there would be situations where workers may get little or no payment at all from the proceeds of sale if the assets available for distribution are insufficient to meet the claims of secured creditors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law as it stands provides sufficient protection to workers who are affected by the winding up of their company. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FOOD PRICES IN MARKETS AND FOOD CENTRES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Increase)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Mr John De Payva</b> asked the Minister for the Environment whether food prices in the markets and food centres, where the stalls have been sold, have gone up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first phase of the Stall Ownership Scheme involved four centres.

This is the age for proper schooling in nearly all developed countries. The Government has decided to leave kindergarten education to the private sector.

The Fund would meet payments of pensions, gratuities, allowances and other retirement benefits (including medical benefits) of the President, political office-holders, Members of Parliament and public officers (both civilian and military) on their retirement, discharge or death. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Pension Fund is in line with Government's desire to recognise pensions as a future liability and to make explicit financial provisions for this. Such an arrangement should reassure pensioners and pensionable public officers that their pensions would continue to be paid. It would at the same time relieve future taxpayers of the burden of paying for the services rendered by current and past public officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For administrative expediency, the Fund would also meet some payments that are not strictly in the nature of retirement benefits but which are currently paid from the Pensions Head of Expenditure and which can, for the same reason, be paid from the Pension Fund. These are insignificant compared to pension payments and include compensation payments for injuries sustained in service, top-up CPF for officers converting from pensionable service to full CPF, service gratuities, top-up CPF under the Special Resignation Scheme, amongst others. The Bill does not include any payment that is not already currently being made from the Pensions Head. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for moneys to be appropriated from the Consolidated Fund and paid into the Pension Fund to enable it to meet its liabilities. These liabilities would be determined on an actuarial basis so that the Pension Fund can be self-sustaining. An examination of the liabilities and balances in the Fund will be carried out not less than once every five years. However, should the Government decide to improve pension terms or add new ones or include new groups of pensionable officers, the Bill requires an examination of the Fund to be carried out to determine the additional liabilities and corresponding funding requirements. At the end of such examination, a report of the Pension Fund status and balances would be submitted to Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 114 of the Constitution provides that pensions, gratuities and other like allowances granted for public service shall be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund. Such protection of pension payments under the Constitution shall continue to be preserved in the Bill. In the event that the Pension Fund has insufficient balances to meet its liabilities under written law, the Bill provides for payments of pensions, gratuities or allowances to be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund. A consequential amendment to Article 114 of the Constitution for this purpose is taken up in a separate Bill, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pension Fund Bill 1995 also seeks to make consequential amendments to the Civil Defence Act, the Civil List and Pension Act, the Parliamentary Pensions Act, the Pensions Act, the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act, the Singapore Armed Forces Act and the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Act to provide for the charging on the Pension Fund of pensions, gratuities, compensation and allowances payable under those Acts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains provisions for the accounting and audit of the Pension Fund on an annual basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pension Fund is to be established on 1st April 1995, to coincide with the new financial year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the service and medical liabilities of both pensioners and serving pensionable officers prior to 1st April 1995, a sum of $9.61 billion would be appropriated from the Consolidated Fund and paid into the Pension Fund. The provision for this transfer has been included in the FY95 Supply Bill which has just been tabled in Parliament this afternoon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, an annual contribution amounting to 17% of pensionable emoluments has to be made in recognition of the on-going service liabilities of serving pensionable officers from 1st April 1995 onwards. Beginning in the new financial year, this contribution, estimated at $125 million, would henceforth form part of the Expenditure on Manpower. Against this, Pensions expenditure will no longer appear as part of Operating Expenditure in the annual Government budget. These changes have been incorporated in the FY95 Supply Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Pension Fund Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, all payments for pensions or gratuities and allowances related to it are paid out of the Consolidated Fund, which is being approved yearly in Parliament. This Bill is to establish a Pension Fund separate from it. It is not mentioned so far what is the size value of this Pension Fund or the target set by the Government for it. At the same time, a provision is made in the Bill to allow all shortfalls in the yearly payments to be made out of the Consolidated Fund under clause 8(1). Also, under clause 9, the Minister may, by warrant, authorise the transfer to the Consolidated Fund any moneys in the Pension Fund which, in the opinion of the Minister, are not required to meet the liabilities of the Pension Fund. Perhaps the Minister can elaborate to the House the rationale for this. Has there been any study to work out the amount for the establishment value of the Pension Fund, considering the total amount of moneys to be paid out as allowances within a certain time frame? What is the target for this Fund in order for it to be meaningful as a fund body that public servants retiring or retired on pensionable service will feel assured of his pension amount? Is there any plan by the Government to build up the Pension Fund to a certain amount in order to meet the liabilities by a certain year? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also allows for accounts and financial statements of the Fund to be audited and examined. There is also a provision in clause 13(1) for periodic examination of the Pension Fund and for its report to be made to Parliament. However, as it is, there is no provision for the Pension Fund size to be reviewed and for its fund to be adjusted accordingly. Perhaps the Minister can clarify on this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that it may be a good idea to target some size value to the Pension Fund just as what the Government did for the Edusave Fund. That way may give a better assurance to retiring and retired public servants and make the institution of the Pension Fund a permanent value of their contribution. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the total liability - in fact, I mentioned this - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> stands at $9.61 billion, and it will be transferred from the Consolidated Fund in a single lump sum.

In 1984, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or SIMEX, was inaugurated to provide international investors with facilities to transact in financial futures. A tie-up with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, in the form of a mutual offset linkage was established. The linkage would enable the futures positions entered on one exchange to be transferred to the other. SIMEX was able to establish the mutual offset linkage with CME because of the confidence the CME and its regulator, the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission, had of Singapore's commitment to establish and enforce a sound legislative framework to regulate futures trading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past decade, the Futures Trading Act clearly served its purpose. The global stock market crash of October 1987 presented a major test. Prices of stock index futures fell sharply in tandem with the stock market, creating chaos in major futures exchanges, and led to the closure of a major futures exchange in Asia. SIMEX weathered the crisis unscathed, due in no small part to the presence of our futures trading legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a decade of operation, it has become necessary to review the Futures Trading Act to ensure its continued effectiveness. Global financial futures markets have grown very rapidly in the past 10 years. During the five years from 1990 to 1994, the volume of futures and options contracts traded on the top 10 exchanges in the world more than doubled from 450 million to 1.1 billion contracts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also timely to review the Futures Trading Act because of the growth of leveraged foreign exchange trading in Singapore. Leveraged foreign exchange trading is the buying and selling of foreign exchange on a margin basis and hence it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is similar to futures trading which is also conducted on a margin basis. The investor needs only put up a margin of 3% to 5% of the value of foreign exchange transacted. Such leverage means that the investor's potential for both profit and loss will be large relative to his initial investment. Leveraged foreign exchange trading is hence a risky business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, leveraged foreign exchange trading is not subject to any regulation. Any person can incorporate a company to offer such facilities to members of the public. The result has been a proliferation of such firms which use aggressive marketing and promises of high investment returns to entice unwary members of the public to trade in the foreign exchange market. MAS has received many complaints from customers on losses incurred in trading through such firms. One common complaint is that such firms do not explain the risks involved in foreign exchange trading or disclose that customers could not only lose their entire margins, but also be liable for further unspecified losses. Another complaint is that such firms had deliberately churned customers' accounts, by trading unnecessarily to generate commission income. Since leveraged foreign exchange trading and futures trading are similar in nature, leveraged foreign exchange trading can and should be regulated under the Futures Trading Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the foregoing in mind, I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill. The Bill may be broadly divided into six segments and I will now elaborate on each of these segments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extending the Scope of the Futures Trading Act to Regulate Leveraged Foreign Exchange Trading</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed amendments to this Bill, persons who offer to the public leveraged foreign exchange trading facilities, investment advice to customers for trading in foreign exchange, or manage customer's funds on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis for investment in foreign exchange markets, would need to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be licensed by the MAS. Upon licensing, persons offering such facilities would be subject to capital adequacy standards, business conduct rules and prudential requirements. It should be noted that the Bill only seeks to regulate the trading of foreign exchange on a margin or leveraged basis. It does not regulate outright foreign exchange transactions involving the exchange of one currency for another, which does not give rise to prudential concerns. Similar legislation has also been introduced by Hong Kong to stamp out trading malpractices in its leveraged foreign exchange trading industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the main purpose of regulating leveraged foreign exchange trading is to protect unsophisticated members of the public, the Bill will exempt the licensing requirements for persons who offer such facilities to certain classes of investors. These are as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person who engages in leveraged foreign exchange trading only with accredited investors. Accredited investors are individuals with personal net worth of at least $5 million and corporations with net assets of at least $10 million, or their equivalent in foreign currencies; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A person who engages in futures trading or leveraged foreign exchange trading with a related corporation or a related person, and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A dealer or investment adviser licensed under the Securities Industry Act or any person exempt from holding such licence who engages in futures trading or leveraged foreign exchange trading for the purpose of hedging a portfolio of securities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Establishment of Fidelity Fund by SIMEX</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of growing interest from retail investors to trade in SIMEX futures contracts, additional safeguards to protect their interests are needed. The Bill therefore requires SIMEX to establish a Fidelity Fund, similar in structure to the Stock Exchange of Singapore's fidelity fund, to compensate investors for losses \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> arising from defalcation by SIMEX members. The Fund will have the following main features: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the initial size of the Fund will be $5 million; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) SIMEX will contribute 10% of its annual profit to the Fund; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Fund will pay a maximum compensation of $100,000 or 75% of the actual loss to a retail investor; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the maximum payout on defalcation claims will be $500,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extending Scope of Futures Trading Act to Regulate Electronic Trading Systems</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Futures Trading Act was enacted in 1986, trading was mainly in exchanges which used an open outcry system. In recent years, electronic systems utilizing terminals to trade futures contracts have been developed. A number of international futures exchanges have expressed interest in cooperating with SIMEX to install electronic trading systems to trade their products in Singapore. SIMEX is also developing its own electronic trading system in order to extend its trading hours. Since electronic dealing systems would effectively establish markets for the trading of financial futures, the conduct of futures trading via such electronic means will need to be properly regulated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next group of amendments sets out the provisions for requiring institutions licensed under the Futures Trading Act to assist in the investigation of drug money laundering offences. The Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act allows the investigation, tracing, freezing and seizure of proceeds from drug trafficking and provides legal assistance to foreign enforcement agencies on fulfilment of certain conditions. To ensure that assistance is provided only for genuine drug trafficking investigations, a prima facie case of drug trafficking has to be established. Such assistance would be provided only if it is not contrary to our national interests. The amendment to the Futures \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Trading Act to facilitate drug trafficking investigations is similar to the recent amendments to the Banking Act and the Finance Companies Act for the same purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Fine-tuning of Licensing Requirements</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the scope of activities of futures brokers and futures trading advisers has expanded, licensing requirements have to be reviewed to ensure effective protection of the interests of customers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, directors, officers and employees of a futures broker are not required to be licensed as futures broker's representatives. As the coverage of the Act has been expanded to include regulation of leveraged foreign exchange trading, it is necessary to require such persons to be licensed as futures broker's representatives. This will ensure that only individuals with the requisite experience, qualification and integrity are permitted to participate in the financial futures industry. Furthermore, as the scope of activities of a futures trading adviser has also been expanded to include the management of customers' funds, futures trading adviser's licence will only be granted to corporations. Individuals will have to incorporate a company to conduct such business and not as a sole proprietor. Companies have to meet stricter prudential requirements on internal controls and external audit. Any person affected by the change in the licensing framework will have a grace period of six months to apply to the MAS for a licence upon the coming into force of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act currently allows MAS to refuse a licence if an applicant is found to have committed a criminal offence or is a bankrupt. To ensure high standards of professionalism and integrity, the Bill proposes to spell out other qualitative criteria required for licensing. This will include the applicant's character and integrity, as well as his experience and expertise in such activities. Licences can be refused in Australia and Hong Kong on similar grounds. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Liberalisation of Certain Provisions</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bill seeks to update prudential requirements to enhance the integrity of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the financial futures industry, it also proposes amendments to reduce the regulatory burden in areas which do not affect the soundness of the industry. In response to feedback from the industry, the MAS has hence proposed that certain provisions of the Futures Trading Act be liberalised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill will exempt banks and merchant banks from the licensing requirements for leveraged foreign exchange trading activities since they are already subject to such regulation under the Banking Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as the main purpose of regulating leveraged foreign exchange trading is to protect unsophisticated investors, the Bill will expressly exempt the licensing requirements for persons and their employees who offer leveraged foreign exchange trading facilities only to accredited investors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill will also exempt persons and their employees from the licensing requirement for trading in financial futures and leveraged foreign exchange for their related corporation or family members. There are no investor protection considerations in such transactions as the customer and the intermediary are related parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in order to allow greater flexibility for stockbroking companies and fund managers to use the futures market and the foreign exchange market to hedge their customers' portfolio of securities, the Bill will waive the licensing requirements for such persons provided that their trading in such instruments is for the purpose of hedging the investment risk of a portfolio of securities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, under the Act, a futures trading adviser is currently only allowed to advise customers and publish reports and analyses concerning futures trading and futures markets. However, in recent years, there has been growing interest by fund managers to invest customers' funds in financial futures contracts and foreign currencies in addition to equities and debt securities. To cater to this development, the Bill will extend the scope of activities of a futures trading adviser to include \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the management of customers' funds, whether on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, for investment in financial futures or foreign exchange transactions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Administrative Amendments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to put into legal effect certain administrative requirements to strengthen the regulation of the financial futures industry. These are as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Act currently requires futures brokers to meet minimum capital adequacy requirements. However, the Act does not require them to notify MAS of any failure to meet such statutory requirements or to rectify non-compliance. The Bill will require futures brokers to notify MAS of any failure to meet statutory financial obligations. This will allow MAS to impose prudential requirements to protect the interests of customers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A futures exchange is required to obtain approval from the Authority before listing any new futures contract. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Act currently requires auditors of futures brokers to report to MAS any findings of non-compliance of the provisions of the Act. The Bill proposes that MAS be granted powers to remove any external auditor who fails to carry out this duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Act currently requires futures brokers to place customer's funds in a trust account. This requirement to segregate customers' monies, however, only applies to monies received in connection with futures transactions. Since futures brokers may also receive customer funds for trading in other financial instruments, the Bill proposes to extend the segregation requirement to include such customer funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Currently, the Act does not stipulate any business conduct rules governing futures brokers dealings with their customers. To enhance protection of the interests of customers and in line with the requirement imposed by SIMEX on its members, the Bill proposes to introduce \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> business conduct rules such as giving priority to customers' transactions over the firm's own transactions, and obtaining customers' consent for transactions where there is potential for conflict of interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes a technical amendment to the Finance Companies Act which was last amended in 1994. Under the last set of amendments, the definition of \"director\" in the Finance Companies Act was extended to include the immediate family members of a director under the provision where the directors of a finance company are responsible for losses arising from unsecured loans granted by the finance company to any of its directors and firms and corporations in which any of the directors has an interest, and any related firms and corporations of the finance company. However, this extension also had the unintended effect of making the family members of a director of the finance company liable for any losses incurred by the finance company in respect of such unsecured loans. As it is not the intention to impose such a liability on the family members of a director, the Bill proposes to exempt family members of a director from any liability in respect of losses arising from such unsecured loans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposed amendments to the Futures Trading Act are house-keeping in nature, and pertain mainly to the definition of terms and the imposition of penalties for breaches of regulations. They do not warrant any special mention in addition to what has been stated in reference to them in the Explanatory Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Futures Trading (Amendment) Bill. Like the Banking (Amendment) Act and the Finance Companies (Amendment) Act, this Amendment Bill is another step to safeguard the integrity of our financial system. This Bill also seeks to protect the small or non-accredited investors. To \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> safeguard the integrity of our financial system, we must insist that operators in the financial sector have a high standard in terms of financial resources, track record, experience and qualified personnel. MAS' efforts in safeguarding the integrity of our financial system should be commended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regulation is only one side of the coin. The Act and the Amendment Bill only set out the ground rules to ensure fair play and an orderly market. The other side of the coin is that potential investors themselves must fully understand the nature of the market, the derivatives and the risks involved before entering these markets. This is particularly important in the futures trading as futures markets are highly volatile and trading in futures is done on a margin basis. Even experienced traders can get their fingers burnt. The latest financial crisis of Baring Futures is a lesson for investors and potential investors to learn. May I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to inform the House what is the current position of the Barings crisis and what is its impact on the local financial sector? What measures have been taken or will be taken to prevent such a crisis from happening again? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the major provisions in the Amendment Bill are the expansion of the scope of the Futures Trading Act to include the regulation of leveraged foreign exchange trading. This implies that these are firms which have engaged in leveraged Forex trading without being subjected to any regulation. The Minister was reported to have said that \"the recent proliferation of unregulated companies offering such services is an 'area of concern' and it was time to introduce measures to protect the public.\" [Business Times on 10th January 1995.] The Minister just now mentioned that MAS has received complaints. May I ask the Minister what is the estimated number of such unregulated operators of leveraged Forex firms in Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tightening the regulations, clause 10 seeks to widen the grounds for refusal of an application for a licence. These criteria spell out the type of quality required of the operators by MAS. I welcome the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> inclusion of criteria such as the education and qualification and experience of the applicant or his shareholders, directors and employees. However, some criteria appear to be subjective. May I ask the Minister whether MAS will give the reasons of rejection to an applicant so that he can make up for his shortcomings? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 seeks to amend section 24 of the principal Act to enable the MAS to prescribe minimum financial requirements for a futures adviser. However, clause 24 only stipulates that minimum financial requirements are to be prescribed by the MAS, and no specific sums are stipulated. If I heard the Minister correctly, he has already mentioned the sums. So I would not pursue this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other major provisions of the Amendment Bill are in clauses 20 and 26. Both clauses seek to protect the interests of investors. It is common practice for unregulated foreign exchange trading firms to take opposite positions against their customers. By taking the opposite side of the transactions without hedging their risks, the firms are effectively betting against their customers with respect to the movement of foreign currencies. Clause 20 prohibits such practices and other activities which run against the interest of the investors, such as front-running and cross-trading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 seeks to establish and maintain a fidelity fund for compensating small investors, or non-accredited investors, because of a defalcation committed by a member of the Exchange. One significant fact is that the fund, initially set at a minimum of $5 million, is paid by the Exchange itself. The fund will be increased by a sum equal to 10% or more of the net income of the Exchange per year. I would like to ask the Minister how is the $5 million arrived at, and whether the sum is too small in relation to the value and the volume of Forex and leveraged Forex trading by SIMEX members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed sections 49(I) and 49(J) also set two limits on the payments out of the fund: (i) the total amount to be paid by a member of the Exchange shall not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> exceed $500,000; and (ii) any claim shall be 75% of the actual loss subject to a maximum of $100,000. I wonder how these limits are set. I am amused by the name \"fidelity fund\" but I support and welcome the setting up of such a fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a final issue, in 1987, two officers of a commodities trading firm, Futurelink, were jailed for cheating more than 1,500 clients of $19 million over two years. In 1993, the Commercial Affairs Department was reported to have investigated a director of Credit Consultants Asia Pte Ltd, another commodities futures firm. May I ask the Minister whether he has plans to bring non-SIMEX firms that offer facilities in commodities futures under the regulation of the Futures Trading Act or any other statute? \n  <br>4.00 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Futures Trading (Amendment) Bill in the name of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill comprises a series of amendments to the 1985 Futures Trading Act. Over a period of 10 years, a decade of almost exploding dimension in terms of growth in the value of trade in futures and derivatives in commodities, currencies and exchanges epitomised in the financial markets global big banks, these amendments are needed to rein in on some of the many esoteric practices that are done in the world of the futures market. With the benefit of experience from other countries and our own, the time is appropriate, and I believe it is not too late, to draw the line for many people who trade in the futures market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with regulatory control in the futures trading is that these transactions take place by the hundreds of millions of dollars every minute of the day across many borders instantaneously in an electronically-generated environment. The market is truly one everywhere in the world. Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint which regulatory body is responsible for which aspect of the transaction. Any financial regulatory body has to balance between the stunting rigidity of too much \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> regulation and supervision within its borders and the market forces of globalised perfectly mobile short-term capital moving in search of higher values. However, one cannot afford not to be too careful in this area and if one should err in controlling too much, it is better to err on the side of caution. Thus, I welcome the Futures Trading (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this Bill, it excludes from the definition of foreign exchange trading and leveraged foreign exchange trading any contracts or arrangements by banks or merchant banks. The Minister has just explained the rationale for it. So I will not pursue this matter, because these institutions are covered by the Banking Act. This Amendment Bill should serve a signal to all those participants of the futures market, including the derivatives, that the authority is concerned with some of the practices so far and bucket shop operators should take heed of the operations and streamline their operations in accordance with the rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14 of the principal Act is amended to enable the authority to be satisfied over a host of conditions such as qualifications, experience and the overall general suitability of the officials in charge in applying for these licences. The amendments also prohibit practices such as front-running, trading against customers and cross-trading in futures contract. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also provide for a fidelity fund of not less than $5 million from the fund of the Futures Exchange to be established for compensating the investors in case of defalcations. I share the view of the Member who spoke just before me and I would like to ask for the rationale for this $5 million to be set and whether it is not too low. As in all regulatory control in this area, it is ultimately the directors and the management within the trading corporation that must exercise the internal control. It is hard to expect the central regulatory body to do more than setting the off-limit markers. The directors and management ultimately hold fiduciary responsibility over these funds. Participants in this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> globalised free market should be prepared to be disciplined by the market regulating itself. In the Amendment Bill, the failure to comply shall make one liable for conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. Does the Minister not consider the above penalties too lenient or the fine too small? After all, the cost of such non-compliance may involve hundreds of millions of dollars. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I support the Futures Trading (Amendment) Bill as far as it goes. My fear is that it does not go far enough. I have just one short point, if I may. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent problems with Barings reminds us forcefully of the great sums of money that are involved in this kind of trading. If there is fraud, the losses are numbered in tens and hundreds of millions of dollars and the profit of fraudsters is similarly mind-boggling. The problem is that the Futures Trading Act does not provide for adequate penalties in respect of multi-million dollar frauds. This is the failing that it shares with the Securities Industry Act. You look at the new sections 37A to 37D, for example. This kind of behaviour has now been criminalised. But what is the penalty for contravention? The penalty for contravention, you will find in section 40 of the existing Act, which reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any provisions of this Part shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $30,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these offences apply to futures brokers and futures brokers by definition are corporations, you cannot send a corporation to jail. It means the punishment for contravention is a $30,000 fine. If you look again at Part VII of the Act which prohibits other offences, like creating a false market, false trading, manipulation, the penalties are found in section 56 which provides a maximum fine of $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or both. Would Members of this House consider that justice is done if a fraudster having made, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> say, $10 million, is fined the maximum of $100,000? No doubt he could go to jail for seven years. But when he gets out, he can still spend his ill-gotten gains. No doubt the court can order him to pay prosecution cost, but prosecution cost would not come up to $10 million. Theoretically, the victims of the fraud should sue for compensation under section 57(1). This is similar to section 105 of the Securities Industry Act. In the 20 years that the Securities Industry Act has been in the statute books, I know of no case reported, or unreported, where compensation has ever been awarded. This Futures Trading Act is a shorter pedigree, but I think the situation is not much better. I wonder if the Minister knows of any case where compensation has in fact been ordered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that civil compensation is impracticable. Victims of fraud may be indisposed to sue. Their losses may individually be inconsequential although in aggregate may amount to a lot, and they may decide to write off the loss. One cannot depend on private enterprise to deprive a fraudster of his ill-gotten gains. May I suggest to the Minister that he look into the possibility of confiscating the benefits that a fraudster acquires through market fraud, not only for contravention of the Futures Trading Act but also for the Securities Industry Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not suggested detailed amendments to this Act because I do not think it should be looked at just from the point of view of futures trading. I think this is going to be a problem that affects all facets of white collar crime. Perhaps something on the lines of the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act could be enacted for white collar crimes. It would be a shame, I think, if after all the time and effort expended to bring white collar criminals to book, they could, after serving their jail sentence, merrily fly off to the Caribbean and live off their loot for the rest of their lives. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thank Members for their contributions. I will deal with the individual questions first before commenting on the Barings crisis at the end. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow Chin Hock has asked a number of questions. I will take them individually. He has asked how many unregulated forex traders have been in business. MAS estimates there are between 30 and 40 such firms in operation. He also asked, when licences are refused by the MAS, whether the person involved will have a hearing. He will. In fact, if he is dissatisfied with the rejection, he can apply for a hearing and he will be told what are the reasons for the rejection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow has also asked how the various sums on the fidelity fund are arrived at. They are basically proposed by SIMEX itself and they are initial sums which are subject to review. They look relatively small at this stage but, depending on actual market conditions, they could be increased in due course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he has asked whether the Futures Trading Act could be extended to cover the regulation of soft commodities. I would like to point out that there is in existence already a Commodities Futures Act which regulates rubber futures and it is proposed that coffee futures be covered by the same Act. So presumably all other soft commodities futures could be regulated by the same Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Prof. Walter Woon have commented on the relatively low penalties under the Futures Trading Act, particularly in the light of the Barings debacle. We agree that these penalties require review and we will actively look at them. I would like to thank Prof. Woon particularly for his suggestion that the ill-gotten gains in these cases might be subject to confiscation. We have already done it for drug trafficking and for other crimes, but we will also now consider whether this might not be extended to this type of crime. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to give the House a review of the Barings debacle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House would have heard that the Baring group, which is a long established financial institution in the United Kingdom, recently became bankrupt because of massive losses, reported to be in the region of o500 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> million, arising from derivatives transactions by one of its traders in Singapore. The trader concerned had accumulated a huge portfolio of futures and options contracts on SIMEX and various Japanese exchanges for its affiliated companies in Tokyo and London. As the Baring group was insolvent and cannot continue trading, it has applied for administration in the United Kingdom. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baring group has three major business operations in Singapore, namely, a merchant bank, Baring Brothers &amp; Company; a stockbroking company, Baring Securities (Singapore) Limited, which is an international member of the Stock Exchange of Singapore; and a futures broker, Baring Futures (Singapore) Pte Limited (BFS), which is a member of SIMEX. The merchant bank and the stockbroking company are financially solvent and have adequate financial resources to meet their obligations. The merchant bank has ceased entering into new business and will close down its operations. The stockbroking company is currently under the administration of the Stock Exchange of Singapore, which will oversee its operations to ensure the smooth winding down of its financial liabilities. BFS, which was one of the largest traders on SIMEX, has come under judicial management. The bankruptcy of the Baring group has had no impact on domestic financial institutions as they have no exposure to the Baring entities or companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although BFS has a large position in futures and options contracts on SIMEX, our futures exchange is not at risk as a result of the massive losses of the Baring group. This is because SIMEX, operating under the framework of the existing Futures Trading Act, has a comprehensive set of checks and controls to safeguard the financial integrity of the exchange and those of its futures broking members even if a major investor defaults on his transactions on the exchange. These safeguards are as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, any investor who transacts on SIMEX is required to place a margin deposit for every contract transacted. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> margin deposit serves as a cushion of safety which SIMEX can use to offset any losses arising from the fluctuations in futures prices which the investor is unable to honour. SIMEX sets its margin deposits at levels which vary with the assessment of the volatility of the underlying market. Up to Friday, 24th February, 1995 the margin set was at 8%. This was raised to 15% on Monday, 27th February, 1995 and is currently lowered back down to 10% because of lower volatility. As futures prices are highly volatile, SIMEX computes the margin deposit requirements on a daily basis based on the market price of the contract at the end of the day. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under the Futures Trading Act, SIMEX requires its futures broking members to increase their capital whenever they have increased volumes of customer transactions. This requirement also serves to protect SIMEX, as futures broking members become liable for their customers' obligations to the exchange should such customers default; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, under the Futures Trading Act, SIMEX requires its futures broking members to segregate monies belonging to customers from those belonging to the futures brokers. This serves as a safeguard against any abuse of customers' funds and thus ensures that customers' funds will be available to meet possible margin calls by SIMEX. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these safeguards, SIMEX has more than adequate margin deposits from Baring for its open positions, even allowing for fluctuations in the prices of the contracts which Baring has entered into. These margin deposits are more than sufficient to offset Baring's unrealised losses from its positions on SIMEX. SIMEX is therefore able to honour all contracts made and cleared with the exchange. All customers' margin deposits with the exchange will be used exclusively for margining such customers' positions, and will not be diverted to meet the exchange's own obligations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Baring companies which had traded on SIMEX had become insolvent, SIMEX had, in the last two days, worked \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to wind down most of the open positions of the Baring companies and will continue to wind down the remaining positions so as not to cause disruption in the market. If the Japanese market remains orderly, the balance of BFS' open positions are more than adequately supported by existing margins and there should not be any need for SIMEX to call upon any funds to close off BFS' positions. However, in order to ensure the confidence of participants, SIMEX has arranged for a letter of credit of US$300 million from local financial institutions, but it is not likely to need to call upon this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concern has been raised as to how BFS had managed to build up such a large position in futures and options contracts on SIMEX and on other exchanges. A full picture of BFS' trading operations which led to the crisis will not be known until investigations are completed. SIMEX did not deem it necessary to curb the increase in the open positions of the Baring entities trading on SIMEX since, until last Friday, BFS had not shown any signs of financial difficulty in its futures trading activities on SIMEX as margin calls were promptly made in full. Over the period from 1st to 24th February 1995, SIMEX made margin calls on BFS for 14 out of the 18 trading days, amounting to a net payment to SIMEX of US$128 million. BFS' speculative positions were also concealed as SIMEX was given to understand that BFS' open positions were undertaken for arbitrage trading purposes which involve less risks. The Baring group was also known as an internationally reputable and well established investment bank with a long track record in sophisticated financial activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An incident of this nature inevitably raises questions concerning the effectiveness of the existing regulatory system for the financial futures industry in Singapore. I would like to assure this House that the regulatory framework is fundamentally sound, and that SIMEX's financial condition is not at risk. I should point out that the principal objective of our regulation of the futures market is to ensure that the futures exchange is financially sound and is able to meet its financial obligations so that investors will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have confidence in participating in the market. No regulatory system can guarantee that there will not be any failure among investors who participate in the futures market nor can regulations protect investors from making losses. Investors, as profit making enterprises, are accountable to their shareholders and are responsible for ensuring that they conduct their operations prudently. Investors who trade in derivatives with the aim of making a profit are expected to exercise proper discipline in order to prevent possible losses from growing out of control. Sound regulation is necessary but not sufficient. There is also a need for proper internal controls and procedures on the part of the market participants to ensure that they conduct their futures trading activities prudently. Such internal controls should be adequate to detect any fraud or excessive risk taking by traders. This is because no law can be enacted to prevent fraud. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial futures regulation, which is modelled after that in the United States, is therefore aimed primarily at ensuring that the futures exchange will remain financially sound even if there is a failure of one or more of its participants. In this regard, the Futures Trading Act has proved to be effective in achieving its objective of protecting the integrity of the futures market in Singapore. This is so because although Baring had incurred large losses as a result of trading on SIMEX and other futures exchanges, SIMEX is not affected by the incident, and continues to be able to honour its obligations to futures brokers and investors. Furthermore, as BFS had placed adequate margin deposits for its positions on SIMEX as required under the Futures Trading Act and SIMEX's rules, the impact of the Barings crisis is isolated and will not result in other SIMEX futures brokers having to step in to meet BFS' obligations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIMEX has issued a press release yesterday to state that BFS has maintained sufficient margin funds with SIMEX to enable the exchange to manage its positions. Both MAS and SIMEX have also provided the assurance that margins deposited by other investors on the exchange would be used exclusively for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the purpose of their positions maintained with the exchange, and would not be used for any other obligations of the exchange. This assurance has helped to restore investor confidence in the Singapore financial market as reflected in the relatively steady volume of trading on SIMEX. The Singapore stock market has also rebounded yesterday by more than 32 points compared with the initial fall on Monday. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baring incident has however highlighted to SIMEX a number of areas which it could improve upon. I would like to inform Members that the following steps will be taken to further strengthen the financial soundness of the exchange: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) MAS and SIMEX will jointly review SIMEX's rules on business conduct to enhance the monitoring of the risk exposure of member firms with the view to protecting the integrity of the exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) SIMEX will appoint experts from the global futures industry to be members of an Advisory panel to review and advise the exchange on protecting the exchange against similar crisis in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) SIMEX will institute measures to require the head office of member firms to take more precautionary measures and strengthen their oversight over the internal controls of their futures subsidiaries in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) MAS will enhance cooperation with overseas futures regulators to provide for better coordination in the supervision of financial institutions participating in the futures markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) SIMEX will strengthen its supervision and compliance department to enhance floor supervision and compliance by SIMEX members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) SIMEX will require member firms to ensure that the head of the dealing section should not take charge of the settlement section and that proprietary traders should not handle customer business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals to tighten futures regulations contained in the Bill before the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> House will help to ensure that SIMEX will continue to remain financially sound in the event a future broking member should collapse like Baring. These proposals are as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Act currently exempts employees of futures brokers from the requirement to be licensed by MAS. The Bill will require employees of futures brokers to be licensed by MAS on an annual basis. This will allow for closer supervision of dealers who trade in futures contracts on behalf of customers. In licensing such employees, MAS will also be able to apply more stringent criteria as proposed in the Bill. The new criteria for licensing such employees will include the requirement that they have relevant experience, and that they are of good character and reputation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill will require SIMEX to seek MAS' approval for the listing of any new contract or the establishment of any subsidiary company, such as the setting up of a subsidiary company to handle the clearing functions of SIMEX. This will allow MAS to vet the introduction of any new contract, so as to ensure that such new contracts will not be susceptible to manipulation by market participants. MAS will also be able to assess that SIMEX has established a sound clearing system with adequate safeguards to ensure the financial soundness of the exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill will require SIMEX to establish a compensation fund for the purpose of compensating retail investors in the event of defalcation by a futures broking member of the exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Bill will allow MAS to remove any external auditor of a futures broker who is found to have failed to exercise its responsibility of vetting the adequacy of the futures broker's financial accounting and control system. This will encourage external auditors to invest greater resources in their audit of futures brokers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, SIMEX currently has a number of business conduct rules which its futures broking members have to comply with. These business conduct rules generally aim at protecting the interests of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> customers, such as requiring the futures broker to give priority to customers' transactions, and to obtain customers' consent if the futures broker acts as a principal to the customers' transaction. The Bill will provide legal backing for such business conduct rules by introducing them in the Futures Trading Act. This will allow MAS to take more effective action against futures brokers who do not comply with the business conduct rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (or \"COGSA\") was enacted in 1972 to comply with Singapore's international obligations under the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading 1924, as amended by the Brussels Protocol of 1968. This Convention contains what is popularly referred to in shipping circles as the \"Hague-Visby Rules\". The Hague-Visby Rules are the 1924 Hague Rules as amended by the Brussels Protocol of 1968. Singapore became a party to the Hague-Visby Rules in 1972 and in that same year COGSA was enacted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hague-Visby Rules apply to bills of lading and other similar documents of title. The Rules were designed, first, to define the basic obligations of the carrier; and, second, to prescribe the maximum protection he could derive from the insertion of exceptions and limitation clauses in the contract of carriage. From the practical point of view, the most important aspect of the Hague-Visby Rules is that they govern the limits of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> liability of carriers and restricts shipowners from contracting out of these limits. The limits may be increased by mutual agreement but not reduced or avoided altogether. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will reform and amend COGSA in order to, first, provide for greater certainty and predictability to traders engaged in international cargo shipments; second, clarify that the Hague-Visby Rules have the force of law in the sense of being an over-riding mandatory law; and, third, make it clear that COGSA gives full statutory effect to our international treaty obligations under the Convention. For example, that it applies to both out-bound as well as in-bound cargo. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the existing uncertainties in the current Act are due to a combination of factors. When COGSA was drafted in 1972, it was modelled after the previous 1927 COGSA which gave effect to the 1924 \"Hague Rules\". The provisions of the 1927 COGSA which were appropriate for the Hague Rules were not wholly appropriate for the Hague-Visby Rules. This drafting inadequacy was compounded by subsequent decisions of the UK courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, these uncertainties in COGSA did not cause practical difficulties mainly because the High Court in the Epar Case had pragmatically interpreted COGSA so as to resolve these uncertainties in a manner that gave full effect to our international obligations. But by so doing, the Singapore High Court disregarded the express wording of the Act. As a matter of legal analysis, both the Attorney-General and the Law Reform Committee agree that the reasoning in the Epar Case may be technically flawed. Moreover, a recent 1993 decision of the Singapore High Court has cast doubt on the correctness of the Epar decision. It is neither necessary nor desirable to wait for this divergence of judicial opinions to be resolved by the Court of Appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments proposed in this Bill have been recommended by the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law and is the work of its Sub-Committee on Commercial Law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> There have been wide consultations on the proposed amendments. They were considered and approved by the members of the Law Reform Committee comprising Supreme Court Judges, academics, practising lawyers and judicial and legal officers. In addition, the Committee consulted other Judges and practising lawyers who are specialists in shipping law. Representatives of the TDB who participated in the work also consulted the shipping interests on the impact of the proposed amendments. Sir, all persons consulted were in support of the proposed amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now briefly take Members through the provisions of the Bill. The amendments are modelled after the 1971 UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. Modifications have been made to one of the provisions to resolve uncertainties in its interpretation which have arisen in the UK. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 repeals and re-enacts section 3 of COGSA to remove any doubt that the Hague-Visby Rules have mandatory statutory force in Singapore. It will also remove the restriction that the Hague-Visby Rules apply only to outward bound cargo (that is, goods carried from a port in Singapore to another foreign port) but not to in-bound cargo (that is, goods carried from another foreign port to a Singapore port). This was a restriction which applied to the Hague Rules but which was subsequently removed by the Hague-Visby Rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 3(4) will also extend the application of the Hague-Visby Rules so that they will also have mandatory statutory force in relation to, first, any bill of lading if the contract contained in or evidenced by it expressly provides that the Rules shall govern the contract; and, second, any receipt which is a non-negotiable document marked as such if the contract contained in or evidenced by it expressly provides that the Rules are to govern the contract. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these new provisions is that the Hague-Visby Rules can be extended to apply to carriage of cargo outside the scope of the Rules on an \"opt-in\" basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 repeals section 5 of COGSA thereby removing the requirement that an outward bound bill of lading must contain an express statement incorporating the Hague-Visby Rules into the bill of lading. This express statement is known in shipping circles as a \"clause paramount\". This requirement is rendered unnecessary by the introduction of the new section 3(1) which declares that the Hague-Visby Rules have the force of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 also repeals section 6 of COGSA which covers carriage to Malaysian ports and carriage by sailing ships. Section 6 is a replica of the equivalent 1927 provision where Malaysia and Singapore were both colonies and territories of the UK. Section 6 is unnecessary and obsolete as the Hague-Visby Rules by their own terms do not apply to contracts of carriage not covered by a bill of lading or other similar document of title. For carriage to Malaysia, bills of lading are issued and the Hague-Visby Rules apply as a matter of practice. Although there are still sailing ships calling at Singapore from Indonesia carrying traditional goods such as timber, these goods are carried as unmanifested cargo. As no bill of lading is issued in such cases, the Hague-Visby Rules will not apply in any case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL LIBRARY BOARD BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its Report \"Library 2000: Investing in a Learning Nation\", released in March last year, the Library 2000 Review Committee recommended that the mission of our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> National Library should be to expand continuously our nation's capacity to learn. The Committee also recommended that we set up a new statutory board to achieve this mission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of setting up a statutory board, to be called the National Library Board (NLB), is to provide the National Library with the authority, latitude and resources to implement the recommendations of the Library 2000 Report. Our aim is to promote reading and learning among Singaporeans, for it is knowledge which will determine the wealth of nations in the next century. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological developments - CNN, Internet, CD-Roms, electronic online databases - are changing the way information is produced, packaged and distributed. It is a revolution taking place before our very eyes. The National Library must adapt to these developments if it is to remain a public source of updated information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology does not change this basic role of public libraries, but it changes the way they should be run. In the 70s and 80s, we adopted a policy of decentralising library services by building almost identical branch libraries in major residential areas and housing estates. Today, we need greater specialisation and hierarchy. Besides catering to the general reading needs of the population, our public libraries must also meet the more variegated needs of an increasingly sophisticated middle class society. We need libraries for children and we also need libraries for professionals, scholars, businessmen, artists and others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 10 to 20 years, the National Library Board will implement, in stages, concepts and ideas proposed in the Library 2000 Report. As we cannot be sure which new ideas will work and which will not, the NLB will experiment and test-bed them as we go along. The Board will also advise the Government on new needs and propose new policies. The Board will comprise a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and 10 to 20 other members. The Board will have a wide mix of members involved in business, education, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Government and the media and will be drawn from both the public and private sectors. In addition, the Board will assemble a board of international advisors to advise it on global trends in library development and services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB will have clearly defined statutory powers to establish and manage public libraries. One of the Board's tasks will be to create a network of borderless libraries in Singapore linked to overseas libraries and institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will also develop the national collection policy and coordinate the work of different libraries (including publicly-funded libraries not under the National Library) in collecting library materials on subjects of importance to Singapore. An example will be the coordination of in-depth collections on Asian countries to support the regionalisation of the Singapore economy. In this way, small and medium-sized enterprises which do not have their own libraries can turn to public libraries as an important source of information. I would like to thank Mr Peter Sung for floating this particular idea to MITA three years ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the plans are already being implemented or prototyped at the Tampines Regional Library. New services and facilities, such as home delivery, computerised audio-visual services, self-service terminals for borrowing and returning books and an IT Gallery are being tried out at the Tampines Regional Library. The Tampines Regional Library is also evolving a community character as it works with grassroots leaders and schools in the neighbourhood. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in five to six years' time, we will have a new National Library building at Victoria Street. The new library will probably incorporate a national reference library, an Arts Library and a Business Library. We can also expect to see more community and neighbourhood libraries built along the lines envisaged in the Library 2000 Report. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB will establish standards for the library profession. We will need to improve on our recruitment, selection and training of librarians to meet the challenges ahead of us. In effect, our librarians will have to become information specialists. There is currently a shortage of trained and experienced librarians in Singapore. We must make the librarian profession more attractive to able young men and women. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the NLB Act will also provide for the legal deposit of library materials published in Singapore for heritage, reference and research use. It will repeal the Printers and Publishers Act which has become outdated with developments in electronic publishing. The Act will require locally-produced print and non-print materials such as films, negatives, tapes, discs and other forms of electronic and audio visual publishing to be deposited with the Board. The inclusion of non-print materials is necessary. Libraries in other parts of the world are also updating their legislation to include non-print materials. We have to do the same. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB Act will require publishers to deliver two copies of every library material published in Singapore to the Board within four weeks of the date of publication. We will, through subsidiary legislation, exempt materials not required by the Board from the legal deposit requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB Act also seeks to promote cooperation among libraries. All publicly-funded libraries will contribute their bibliographic records to the Board to help it establish an up-to-date catalogue of all library materials in Singapore for the convenience of users. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will also work out an inter-library loan scheme to facilitate the sharing of resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will have autonomy in administrative, staffing and financial matters to give it flexibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to fund public libraries as there are limited opportunities for them to earn revenue. The National Library Board will be exempted from income tax and will have the status of an institution of public character. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Government's financial support, the National Library Board will be able to raise its own revenue. The Act provides for the setting up of an Endowment Fund to enable the Board to raise funds for special activities. As a statutory board, the library will also be able to form companies to undertake functions which are more effectively carried out on a commercial basis. It can also introduce new fee-based services such as information packaging and research on specific subjects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CIVIL LIST</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name under item No. 7 in the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> * That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule to that Act be varied by deleting the figures \"$1,190,400\", \"$55,000\", \"$2,175,700\", \"$561,600\" and \"$51,500\" in the second column and substituting the figures \"$1,341,300\", \"$62,000\", \"$2,908,900\", \"$737,300\" and \"$351,500\", respectively. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provisions for the privy purse and entertainment allowance to $1,341,300 and $62,000 respectively.

Growth was broad-based and all major sectors did well. The manufacturing sector grew by 12.9% with strong growth across a broad spectrum of industries. Growth in the financial and services sector was lower than in 1993 because of significantly lower stockmarket turnover. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commerce and transport &amp; communications sectors turned in creditable performances on the back of strong regional growth and stronger trade and investment linkages in the region. The construction sector saw double-digit growth due to the strong pipeline of contracts awarded in 1992 and 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation remained low, at 3.6%, as domestic cost pressures were contained by good productivity growth while imported inflation was mitigated by the strength of the Singapore dollar. The introduction of the 3% Goods and Services Tax had a smaller than expected impact on inflation due to keen competition in the retail sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two years of double-digit growth in 1993 and 1994 were underpinned by strong productivity growth which averaged 6.0% in the two years. As a result, the Unit Labour Cost index for the manufacturing sector declined in 1993 and 1994. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1995</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The external environment remains favourable, though some caution is called for. World capital markets have recently been volatile, due to concerns over US interest rates, the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the earthquake in Kobe. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialised countries as a group are likely to see stronger growth but lower inflation. The Asian economies are expected to continue to enjoy robust growth. The generally favourable external environment means continued strong demand for Singapore products and services. The latest survey of business expectations show that industrialists and businessmen in the services sector are optimistic about prospects up to June 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, following two years of strong growth, domestic costs are likely to rise. Increased cost pressures would have some negative impact on our growth prospects in 1995. In addition, the dominant electronics industry is highly volatile and growth could slow down significantly at short notice. Recent events in the international scene have also had some dampening effect on stockmarkets world-wide. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking into account these factors, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has revised its forecast for 1995 slightly downwards, from 8-9% to 7.5-8.5%. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR SUSTAINED GROWTH</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to a longer-term issue: how we can lay the foundations for sustained growth into the next century. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Combining Economic Growth With Social Progress</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has successfully combined rapid economic growth with equitable income distribution. Real economic growth averaged 8.4% per year between 1960 and 1994. Between 1980 and 1990, real household income for the bottom 20% of households rose by an average of 8.9% per year, faster than the 7.9% for the middle 60% of households and 6.4% for the top 20% of households. More up-to-date figures from the Household Expenditure Survey show that, for the period 1982/83 to 1992/93, real household income for the bottom 20% has also kept pace with those of the middle 60% and top 20%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the personal level, Singaporeans can see for themselves how their standard of living has improved. The ownership of telephones, TV sets and refrigerators is near universal, and more than three-quarters of households have washing machines or VCRs. One-third own air-conditioners, 31% have cars and 20% have personal computers. These ownership rates are high, by any international standards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's record of widespread social progress and equitable income distribution is partly the result of the development process. Economists have found that income distribution tends to improve as an economy develops because unemployment falls rapidly and the fruits of economic growth are shared among a larger group of citizens. This has been the experience of most East Asian economies, including Singapore, but it is not universal or automatic. Wrong-headed policies, like populist subsidies and restrictions on economic transactions, can worsen income distribution and impede growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government has played a key role in improving the standard of living of all Singaporeans through mass programmes in public housing, primary health and education. The effects of these on the well-being of Singaporeans are clear. For example, 86% of our population live in public housing, which is of a standard far higher than public housing projects in other countries. Newer HDB housing estates like Bishan and Pasir Ris are comparable to private housing in Singapore. Unlike other countries, the public housing programme in Singapore is a social leveller. Professionals and workers live in the same HDB estates and share amenities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public health programme and affluence have significantly reduced infant mortality in Singapore. We now have the lowest infant mortality rate in the world - 5 per 1,000 live births, as low as Japan and Sweden. Almost all our children attend school and more than half of them enter Polytechnic or universities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Challenges for the Future</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next stage of economic development, we will face different challenges. In the 1960s, the priority was to create jobs, provide housing and build new schools. In the 1990s and beyond, we will face new issues. I will outline two key ones, viz, the entry of new players into the international economy and the development of a middle class society in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the entry into the world trading and production system of large economies like China, India, Indonesia and rapidly growing ones like Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam will alter the world economic structure. It has been estimated that by the year 2020, 7 of the 10 largest economies in the world will be in Asia, viz, China, Japan, India, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and Taiwan (\"The Global Economy\", survey in The Economist, 1st October 1994.). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry of new players into the world economy will raise average income levels worldwide, but it will also change the distribution of income, both between countries and within individual countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more developed countries will increasingly be forced to specialise in higher value added activities, leading to greater demand for skilled workers who are in short supply worldwide. Demand for low-skilled workers will be met by less developed countries which concentrate in more labour-intensive activities. However, the supply of unskilled workers is far higher than the supply of skilled workers. As a result, in many countries incomes will rise faster for skilled workers than for unskilled workers. The reason goes back to the fundamental laws of demand and supply. Because the number of unskilled workers is so much larger, an increase in demand will first reduce unemployment or under-employment before it leads to rising wages. In contrast, as skilled workers are scarce, increased demand will lead to higher wages. Putting these two divergent trends together, it is not hard to imagine a world where income distribution could become more unequal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already happening in some developed countries. In the US and the UK, wage differentials between those with higher education and those without have widened in the last 10-15 years. Closer to home, Hong Kong has faced this problem since the mid-1980s. With keen competition from China in labour-intensive manufacturing, the Hong Kong manufacturing workforce has shrunk from about 1 million to only 600,000 whereas the workforce in Hong Kong-owned factories in southern China is estimated to be 3-4 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> million. Accompanying this massive shift has been a depression of wages in the Hong Kong manufacturing sector, particularly in lower-end industries, like textiles and toys. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not surprising that there is deep concern in the developed countries, especially Europe, that East Asia_s growth will be at the expense of their workers and their social stability. Some groups in the developed countries are advocating protectionism in various guises, including social and environmental protection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, as a small and open economy, cannot insulate itself from larger global trends. Without natural resources or a large hinterland or domestic rural sector to fall back on, we cannot afford to pay ourselves higher than world market rates or keep alive activities which are no longer viable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries better-endowed than ourselves have tried and failed to do this. What they have achieved is to transfer the problem from the labour market to the state treasury while delaying much-needed structural adjustments to their economies. The EU countries have run budget deficits to finance generous welfare states and unemployment benefits. The result is that public debt has mounted, unemployment is at a record high of 11% and labour costs are uncompetitive. Future generations of European workers and citizens will have to pay the cost of past fiscal deficits, either through a high debt servicing burden or through higher inflation if governments choose to inflate away their domestic debts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will need to address these issues head-on. I will elaborate on possible solutions later in my speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the second challenge, that of Singapore becoming a more middle-class society. Economic growth and improvements in education have enabled most Singaporeans to join the middle class. We are close to achieving our target of 60% of each cohort entering polytechnic or university. In \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> twenty years time, up to 30% of the workforce will have either polytechnic or university education compared with only 15% today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy must stay competitive to create jobs for these ambitious and well-trained people. We must regionalise successfully so that our best and brightest will have a bigger pie to compete for. To cap the supply of university and polytechnic graduates is an unworkable and self-defeating alternative. It will slow growth and depress earnings for all, including the graduates, who will have few job opportunities in a stagnant economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the larger number of better-educated people will increase demand for the traditional trappings of middle-class living like owning a car and a private house, thus hitting against a fixed supply of land. Aspirations could run ahead of our ability to meet them in the conventional way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Meeting the New Challenges</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trends I have outlined have implications for how we need to manage our economy to ensure many more years of economic prosperity and social stability. There are three key areas in which we need to devote attention. They are: preparing Singaporeans to meet the challenges of the global economy, providing maximum incentives to able Singaporeans to create wealth for the nation, and building a more cohesive society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Preparing Singaporeans for challenges of the global economy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new global economy, competition will get keener and the pace of change will become faster. No country can afford to sit back while the competition passes by. Technology is pushing the pace of restructuring. Companies and countries which cannot cope with the fast pace will be left behind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have taken steps to meet the demands of a modern economy \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by investing heavily in education, training and re-training. Over the years, we have increased the proportion of young people going into tertiary education. In 1980, 19% of our young people were admitted to university, polytechnic or the then Vocational and Industrial Training Board. In 1994, the proportion was 71%, with 19% going to university, 35% to polytechnic and 17% to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). We aim to raise the proportion of those with post-secondary training from the 71% in 1994 to 85%, broken down into 20% going to university, 40% to polytechnic and 25% to ITE. We will achieve these targets by the year 2000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have increased enrolments in institutions of higher learning without sacrificing quality. Each year, the \"O\" and \"A\" level results, which have international standing, have improved. Achievement in English and Mathematics is high and improving. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With up to 85% of each cohort receiving post-secondary training in the Institute of Technical Education, the polytechnic and the universities by the year 2000, nearly all Singaporeans will be equipped with the means to compete in the global economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But being well-educated only offers the worker a place at the starting line. Whether he completes the race and wins a prize depends on whether he can adapt to the changes in the economy. Experience from the developed countries shows that although unskilled blue-collar workers have borne the brunt of global competition in the developed countries, even white-collar and management staff are not immune to changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White-collar jobs in data-processing, insurance claims processing and accounting can be done offshore, in the Philippines, China, India or Ireland. The restructuring of the American corporate sector in recent years was accompanied by \"de-layering\" of corporate hierarchies and the loss of many middle management jobs. The rise of a new class of \"temporary professionals\" in the US is a sign that even professionals are not immune to fundamental changes in the global labour market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to keeping ourselves relevant to the rest of the world is flexibility. Workers need to be able to learn new skills and knowledge and to adapt to new processes, new machines and perhaps even new employers to retain life-long employability. This will mean a concerted effort by the workers themselves, unions, employers and the Government. Although recent retrenchment episodes by MNCs have raised some concern, it is reassuring that the retrenched workers easily found replacement jobs. Such restructuring of the manufacturing sector is a continuing necessity if we are to upgrade. So far, our economy has been able to adjust flexibly to new demands. We will need to maintain this flexibility even more as we enter the new global economic race. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Giving maximum incentive for wealth creation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we equip Singaporeans in general with the skills to compete effectively, we need to pay attention to those among them who are most able to create wealth for all. These able people command a premium in the world market, and they can easily work and live overseas. The Singapore economy needs them to manage our companies and lead our workers to win in the global economic race. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic competition is a team game like football, but each team needs its fair share of star strikers like Fandi Ahmad to score the goals and bring success to the team. It is essential to pay special attention to them, to nurture them so that they can give of their best and to reward them handsomely when they do well. The same applies to captains of industry, entrepreneurs and skilled professionals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent is scarce in Singapore. We should identify our best and brightest early, and invest in their education, for example, by setting up autonomous and independent schools, stretching them in the Gifted Education Programme or by giving them the best possible university education here or abroad. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the intense global competition, we must also be able to satisfy their aspirations for a better life in their many facets, ranging from the strictly material like owning a car to psychological and emotional factors like identifying Singapore as home and seeing a future for their children here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will refine and adjust economic incentives to maintain Singapore_s competitiveness. One major aspect will be our fiscal policy. Experience has shown us the considerable benefits of keeping the overall Government burden on the economy and the individual low. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of tax revenue like individual and corporate income tax, property tax and consumption tax, Singapore_s tax burden is lower than the major industrial countries. We are comparable to the other Asian Newly Industrialising Economies (NIEs) except Hong Kong, and the other ASEAN countries. This is shown in Table 1 (Cols. 115 - 116). However, Government revenue is boosted by the use of fiscal measures to allocate scarce resources, like the COE system and levy on foreign workers. Our overall level of Government tax and non-tax revenue is around 22%, slightly above other Asian countries who are at 20%. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19950301/19950301-HA-0640115.htm\">Table 1 - TAX AND NON-TAX REVENUE OF SELECTED COUNTRIES (Cols. 115 - 116)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is studying possible changes to its fiscal policies to make the economy more competitive, and to strengthen the incentive for businesses and individuals to venture, succeed, and enjoy the fruits of their enterprise. It will keep the overall burden of Government levies on successful Singaporeans as low as possible, taking into account both income taxes as well as other levies like the foreign maid levy and revenues from land transport policies, including COEs. Our strong fiscal position, built up through prudent management over many years, gives us some leeway to do this. As the Prime Minister said in his New Year message, taken as a whole, Singapore must offer its citizens a quality of life, abundant opportunities and a future for their children that will make them want to stay. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from adjusting fiscal policies, the Government has tried and will try to meet the aspirations of the talented in more creative ways. While we cannot promise everyone a piece of landed property, we will set aside enough land to develop different types of housing to cater to Singaporeans_ needs. We will also invest in public transport to make it a more attractive alternative to car ownership. We will continue to improve traffic management, introduce new measures to control car usage and make heavy investments in roads to help more Singaporeans own cars while controlling congestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever innovative solutions we can come up with to ameliorate the problems of being a small country, Singaporeans must realise that there is a physical limit to how far we can go. The quality of life in Singapore has to be taken as a package. Apart from material rewards, Singapore will offer a vibrant arts scene, a safe home for our children and highly efficient public amenities to make up for the high cost of owning cars and landed property. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Building a cohesive society</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we encourage our high achievers to do well, we need to instil in them a sense of social obligation to other Singaporeans who are less able to compete. They must feel that Singapore is not merely a place to make money but also a nation and a community within which we bring up our children and provide them with the means to build a better future for themselves. In this endeavour, all Singaporeans whether rich or poor must feel as one and contribute in every way he can. All will enjoy the fruits of economic growth but we must accept that some will do better than others. Just as in football, top players are paid more than those who are reserves and play in only a few matches. But if the star players pay no attention to the others, they will stop feeding him balls and he will no longer be able to score any goals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we cannot turn back the tide in global competition, we will continue to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> strengthen social stability in ways that do not undermine our economic vitality. We will continue to evolve new ways to meet the aspirations of all Singaporeans while balancing economic imperatives with social needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as we do not lose sight of the challenges ahead of us and put in place rational policies to deal with them, I am confident that Singapore will enter the 21st century as an economically dynamic and socially cohesive nation. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>PART II - THE FY95 BUDGET</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to the Budget for the next financial year. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our expenditure policy is designed to support our economic and social objectives. The FY95 budget's spending priorities are on education, infrastructure, affordable healthcare, quality public housing, and national security. To meet expectations for a better quality of life, and to develop a more robust, well-balanced and cohesive society, more funds will also be made available for the arts, sports, recreational facilities, community development and schemes to advance social cohesion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of Government will continue to be contained so as to provide the private sector with more resources, but care will be taken not to compromise the quality and level of public services. At the same time, we will seek new ways to improve our systems of financial and personnel management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our budgetary policy is to keep total expenditure within operating revenues. This policy, coupled with buoyant revenues linked to strong economic growth in recent years has enabled Government to keep the budget in surplus since FY88. We have been able to set aside substantial sums each year to reserves without dampening economic growth or foregoing productive investments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budgetary surpluses generated in the past have enabled us to start programmes like Edusave, Medifund and CPF-SOTUS. Better than expected economic growth has allowed the build-up of Edusave to its present level of $3 billion since its inauguration 3 years ago. This is much faster than the planned build-up rate of $1 billion initial capital and $500 million annually over 8 years. As a healthy budget surplus is also forecast for FY94, I am pleased to say that the FY94 contribution will be doubled to $1 billion. This earlier build-up of Edusave will allow students to participate in a larger variety of educational programmes to maximise their potential. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medifund balances presently stand at $300 million. Medifund is a scheme to help those who cannot afford basic medical care, even with the help of their relatives. Unlike Edusave, there is therefore no reason to accelerate its build-up unless income flows from the Medifund prove insufficient. As this has not been the case, I do not propose to accelerate the build-up of Medifund. A transfer of $100 million will therefore be made to Medifund in FY95 as planned. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme (SOTUS)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also continue to use budget surpluses to enhance the assets of Singaporeans through the CPF share ownership top-up scheme or SOTUS. As promised in last year's Budget Speech, we will implement a second CPF SOTUS this year as part of our aim to make Singaporeans a share owning society. Under SOTUS-II, Government will credit $300 into the CPF account of every Singapore citizen aged 21 and above provided he or his employer has credited at least $750 into his account between 1 March 1994 and 31 August 1995. Members who pay in less will get a prorated contribution from Government. There are still 6 months to go before the qualifying period expires. Government has set aside $380 million in FY95 to pay for the top-up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Pension Fund</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I informed the House that a Pension Fund would be set up to explicitly recognise Government's pension liabilities and to make provision for it as part of prudent financial management. Legislation to set up the Fund has already been passed. The Fund will accordingly be established on 1st April 1995 and all future pension obligations will be met from the Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pension liabilities have been estimated based on actuarial studies. To set up the Fund, a sum of $9.6 billion will be transferred from existing balances in the Consolidated Fund to the Pension Fund to meet past service and medical liabilities of pensioners and serving officers. This is so that current and future tax payers need not bear the burden of building up the Pension Fund in respect of these past service and medical liabilities. On-going service liabilities for serving pensionable officers will be funded by an annual budgetary contribution to the Pension Fund. This is currently estimated at 17% of pensionable emoluments. It will be reflected as part of Expenditure on Manpower or EOM in the Expenditure Estimates, to which I will now turn. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>THE FY95 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total operating and development expenditure in FY95 is expected to amount to $18.5 billion, which is 16.2% of GDP, up from 14.8% in FY94. The increase is due entirely to higher development expenditure, which rises from 4.4% of GDP in FY94 to 5.9% in FY95. Operating expenditure on the other hand will remain at 10.4% of GDP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total expenditure in FY95 is about 21% higher than in FY94. The largest share of the budget will continue to be allocated to social and community services, which will take up 38%. Education accounts for more than half of this share, with the rest going into healthcare services, subsidies on public housing, improvements to the environment, community development and promotion of the arts. The second largest share, at 36% of the budget, will be taken up by national security, including \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> defence. The third largest share, at nearly 16% of the budget, will go to economic and infrastructural development, including transportation, infrastructure, research &amp; development, promotion of the regionalisation effort and inward investments, and other infrastructural and civil engineering projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now elaborate on the FY95 expenditure proposals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Operating Expenditure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure encompasses expenditure on manpower and other operating expenditure of ministries, and grants-in-aid to Government-funded statutory boards and other organisations. In FY95, operating expenditure is expected to be $11.8 billion, a 10% increase over FY94. Defence spending will account for the largest share, at nearly 45% of the total. Education will take up the second largest share at 23% of the total. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on Manpower or EOM will go up by $291 million or 11% to $2.8 billion. The increase includes a $133 million contribution to the Pension Fund for on-going service liabilities mentioned earlier. The remaining increase is to cover normal salary increments and for filling vacancies. Increased workloads of Ministries will have to be accommodated through productivity improvements where this is possible without affecting the level of service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Operating Expenditure or OOE will increase by $1 billion or nearly 20% to $6.6 billion. In addition to higher workload and general cost increases, additional funds will be required for larger provisions for the armed forces. Part of the increase is also to pay for maintenance of new installations such as the flue gas cleaning system in incinerator plants, and more services being contracted out. Higher provisions are also made for teaching bursaries, scholarships, child care subsidies and the Small Families Improvement Scheme. Funds are also needed for the Malay tertiary tuition fee managed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by Mendaki, setting up new overseas missions and technical assistance to third world countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants-in-Aid to Government-funded statutory boards and other organisations including restructured hospitals will amount to $2.4 billion, up 7% from FY94. Schools and tertiary institutions will need larger operating grants to cater for a 11,000 increase in students and to pay for more teachers and administrative staff. Higher operating and rental subventions will also go to restructured hospitals and Voluntary Welfare Organisations for providing subsidised medical care. The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board will need additional subvention to compensate for a reduction in the cess rate from 4% to 1% with the introduction of GST. A new grant will be given to the Trade Development Board to cover its operating deficit as the revenues from its sale of various quotas are expected to decline. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Development Expenditure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development expenditure is projected to reach $6.7 billion in FY95, up by 46% from FY94. This is 36% of total expenditure, higher than the 30% spent in FY94. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development spending on education will continue to focus on building new schools and tertiary institutions or improving existing ones. Major on-going projects include the construction of Temasek Polytechnic, the upgrading of NUS campus and the construction of staff quarters at Kent Vale to house NUS lecturers. As computers have become increasingly important as educational tools, more money will be spent on upgrading computer equipment and facilities in schools and tertiary institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The near doubling of healthcare-related spending is mainly for the construction and fitting out of Eastern General Hospital, the new Kandang Kerbau Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Phase III of National University Hospital, and the combined Institute of Health and National Dental Centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to providing Singapore with an efficient and convenient public transport system \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and substantial funds are provided for transport-related expenditures, including the continued development and extension of the road network. The MRT extension to Woodlands is progressing well. Feasibility studies will be carried out on a new Northeast Sector MRT Line and an MRT extension to Changi Airport. Pilot studies will also be made to ascertain whether Light Rail Transit (LRT) feeder systems can be used to complement and extend the main MRT network. The development of an Electronic Road Pricing System to control road usage is on schedule. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital subsidy to public housing is expected to be $719 million, almost 67% higher than in FY94. The upgrading of HDB flats, including interim upgrading to improve the older estates, will take up the bulk of the allocation. Funds will also be needed for subsidising new flats and paying for the discount on the sale of HDB tenanted shops and rental flats. Provision will also be made for specific works and other improvements to existing HDB estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the measures to improve the environment, open sewage treatment works will be covered to control odour emission, an offshore sanitary landfill will be built at Pulau Semakau for dumping refuse, and the drainage infrastructure will be upgraded and extended. Land reclamation works are currently underway at Changi East, Tuas, Buran Darat, and the cluster of petrochemical islands in the south-west to form Jurong Island. Projects to promote community cohesion and sports include the building and renovation of community centres, upgrading of residents' committee centres, redevelopment of the Outward Bound School, and upgrading of the Singapore Sports Council facilities. Funds will also go towards providing welfare homes for the aged and facilities for disabled and low income families. Other infrastructural projects include the development of waterworks and the relocation of the Queenstown Gasholder. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) is critical for raising our industrial competitiveness and for attracting higher value added investments into Singapore. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will therefore raise Government-funded R&amp;D by nearly 30% to $368 million, which is slightly more than 0.3% of GDP. The focus of R&amp;D spending will continue to be on economically-relevant R&amp;D, which is driven by the National Science &amp; Technology Board (NSTB) through an allocation of $298 million. Another $50 million will be provided for the Academic Research Fund to enable academic research to be carried out by various institutions under the Ministry of Education. As a step towards keeping doctors abreast of medical advances and to develop more cost-effective methods of medical care, medical research will be stepped up under the supervision of the newly set-up National Medical Research Council. A sum of $20 million will be made available for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote our regionalisation drive, funds are allocated to the Economic Development Board (EDB) for venture capital funds to assist local SMEs to take advantage of regional opportunities. Funds will also be made available for EDB to make strategic investments and to assist local SMEs through various economic development schemes. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now update the House on what is being done by Government to achieve greater accountability and control over public expenditures. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Budgeting for Results</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I informed the House that we have embarked on a process of financial management reform called Budgeting for Results or BFR for short. Under BFR, funds are allocated and greater managerial autonomies granted to a Government organisation in exchange for clearly defined pre-specified outputs. By making public servants more focused on the outputs to be delivered and more customer-oriented through BFR, we hope to enhance the performance of the public sector. BFR will be an improvement over the existing budgeting system, which is largely input driven and puts little \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pressure on ministries to review their outputs or requirements or to reallocate resources between activities. There are also currently no clear performance targets nor incentives for staff to be more productive in the use of public funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamental to the BFR process is the identification of output and performance targets. Departments have already been asked to do this. Clearly defined outputs and performance targets should in turn lead to greater accountability and value for money from the organisation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several concepts are being worked out in connection with the implementation of BFR. They relate mainly to the financial, procurement, and personnel managerial flexibilities that can be devolved to departments under BFR. To foster entrepreneurial behaviour, we are also exploring the feasibility of allowing departments to fund their operations from receipts and to charge other departments for their services. Once we are ready with some workable arrangements, these would be implemented in selected ministries and departments. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>PART III - REVENUE AND TAX CHANGES</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me turn next to the fiscal position and the proposed tax changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A healthy budget surplus is forecast for FY94 as revenue collections were buoyant because of strong economic growth. The outlook for growth in 1995 remains strong at 7.5-8.5%, which is still above our medium term growth range of 6-7%. Revenue collection in FY95 is estimated at $24.3 billion. With operating and development expenditures budgeted at $18.5 billion, a surplus of $5.8 billion is anticipated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive GST of 3% was introduced in April last year as part of a major move to reform our tax structure. As the GST was not intended to increase overall tax collections, its introduction was accompanied by a package of tax cuts and rebates to offset GST revenues. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> GST revenue collection was originally estimated at $960 million and the value of the GST offset package at $1.2 billion. Due to the unexpectedly high economic growth, both the GST collection and GST offset package have since been revised upwards to $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion respectively. Hence, overall, the introduction of GST will remain revenue negative. I would like to reiterate that Government is committed to making GST revenue negative in the short run and revenue neutral in the long run. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 1994 was another successful year, there is scope for returning some of the budget surpluses to the economy. However, the route chosen will have to take into account the fact that the economy is entering a third year of very strong growth and some care is needed to avoid over heating. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On corporate tax, our medium term goal is to bring the rate down to 25%. However, there is no need to lower the tax rate again this year to further stimulate an already vibrant economy, so soon after the 3% cut which came into effect in Year of Assessment 1994. Instead, we will fine-tune our tax system to support regionalisation and high value-added economic activities. In line with Government's plan to promote fund management and investment banking activities, additional incentives to enhance their development will be introduced. We will also continue to review various taxes and duties, such as property tax and stamp duties, to lower business costs and improve business efficiency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal income taxes were substantially reduced in Year of Assessment 1994 to accompany the introduction of GST. As a result, 71% of individuals no longer pay income tax. There is hence no need to make significant changes to the personal income tax structure this year, so soon after the last revision. Instead, other routes will be used to reward individuals for their contributions towards a successful year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the tax changes for companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>5% Tax on Incremental Profits from High Value-Added Financial Activities</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid growth of economies in the Asia Pacific has opened up new business opportunities for the Singapore financial sector. In line with government's efforts to encourage Singapore financial institutions to undertake high value-added activities, various tax incentives have been put in place over the years. These incentives have been successful. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, our financial institutions need to continue to strengthen their capabilities in fund management and investment banking if Singapore is to position itself to play a key role in servicing the expanding financial needs of the East Asian economies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further boost fund management, risk management and capital market activities in Singapore, I have decided to grant a concessionary tax rate of 5% on the incremental profits of such activities. With effect from Year of Assessment 1996, the increase in taxable income over the preceding qualifying year from the following activities will be taxed at a concessionary rate of 5%: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) the managing of funds of at least S$5 billion from foreign investors by Asian Currency Units and Approved Fund Managers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) the underwriting, managing or placing of foreign securities by Asian Currency Units and Approved Securities Companies, if the taxable income from such activities exceeds S$10 million; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) the trading of foreign securities by Asian Currency Units and Approved Securities Companies, provided the taxable income from such activities exceeds S$10 million; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) the trading of new futures and options contracts on SIMEX by its members for a period of up to 5 years from the commencement of trading of the new contract on SIMEX. Only the top 20 most active firms will qualify for the 5% tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Further details of the scheme will be announced later. The scheme will be effective for 5 years in the first instance and may be reviewed after that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Taxation of Unit Trusts</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to introduce a tax incentive to foster the development of the domestic unit trust industry. For a unit trust granted this tax incentive, all income except Singapore dividends received will no longer be taxed at the level of the unit trust. For distributions made out of income that is not taxed at the trust level, the tax treatment will be as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) all distributions to non-resident unit holders will be tax exempt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) distributions paid out of gains from disposal of securities to residents other than individuals and partnerships will be taxed. In the case of individuals or partnerships, only 10% will be subject to tax. The remaining 90% will be tax exempt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) distributions of other income such as interest and foreign dividends to resident unit holders will be taxed. \n  <br>\n  <br>For distributions which are taxable, tax will be withheld by the unit trust at the prevailing corporate tax rate at the time of distribution. As with Singapore dividends, unit holders will be able to claim a credit for the tax withheld at the trust level. This incentive will take effect from Year of Assessment 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tax treatment will make it more attractive for individuals to invest in unit trusts. This will boost our domestic unit trust industry, which will in turn help generate greater demand for fund management services and build up fund management expertise in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Deduction for General Provisions made by Banks</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the special role which banks play in the economy, I have allowed general provisions made by banks and merchant banks to be tax deductible with effect from Year of Assessment 1992. Since then, banks and merchant banks \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have recorded strong profit growth. While the economic prospects for Singapore and the region are expected to remain good in the foreseeable future, no economy is immune to business cycles. During periods of healthy profit growth, banks and merchant banks should build up their financial reserves to see them through business downturns. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage banks to set aside a greater proportion of their profits as general provisions, I have decided to increase the maximum annual limit on the amount of general provisions eligible for tax deduction. Currently the general provision allowable is the lower of 25% of qualifying profit or 1/4% of qualifying assets. With effect from Year of Assessment 1996, the 1/4% will be increased to 1/2% of qualifying assets. The total amount of general provisions eligible for tax deduction will continue to be limited to 2% of qualifying assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Removing the Present Constraints for Onward Payment of Tax Exempt Dividends Out of Foreign Income</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had earlier introduced a package of incentives to encourage our companies to venture abroad. These incentives have worked well for most companies. At present, a Singapore company does not have to pay any Singapore tax on foreign income received if tax exemption has been granted or the foreign tax credit is equal to or exceeds the Singapore tax payable. Such income is also allowed to be distributed as tax exempt dividends. This is to enable foreign income to flow through to shareholders without double taxation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, the flow through of tax exempt dividends is limited to two levels of shareholding and subject to a 50% shareholding requirement. There are, however, companies which have found it necessary to form consortiums and set up more complex group corporate structures to venture overseas. In such instances, the current restrictions can result in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> foreign income being subject to double taxation when it is finally distributed to the ultimate shareholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome such constraints, I have decided to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) extend the follow-through of tax exempt dividends beyond the two levels of shareholders where the 50% shareholding requirement is satisfied. Holding companies at every tier of a group corporate structure will be allowed to onward pay exempt dividends received where the dividends originate from foreign income received in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) waive the requirement of a 50% shareholding in the dividend-paying company for onward payment of exempt dividends on a case-by-case basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>These changes will apply to dividends received on or after 1st March 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Waiver of the 25% Shareholding Requirement for Unilateral Tax Credit to be Given on the Underlying Tax of Foreign Dividends</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore company does not have to pay any Singapore tax on dividends derived from investments in countries where the tax rates are comparable to or higher than Singapore, if it holds at least 25% of the share capital of the dividend paying company. The tax credit for foreign dividends received by such company includes the underlying tax, that is, foreign tax on the profits out of which the dividends are paid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most investors, the 25% shareholding requirement to qualify for credit of the underlying tax poses no problem. However, there are cases where for valid reasons, the 25% shareholding cannot be achieved. I have therefore decided to waive the 25% shareholding requirement on a case-by-case basis. This will apply to dividends received on or after 1st March 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Double Tax Deduction for Approved Expenses Incurred in the Promotion of Master Franchising and Master Licensing</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further encourage companies to invest and expand into the region, the Double Tax Deduction scheme for the promotion of Singapore services overseas will be extended to include the promotion of master franchises and master licences overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved expenses incurred by companies to promote master franchising and master licensing overseas will be granted double tax deduction. The extension will take effect from 1 Apr 1995 and will be administered by the Trade Development Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Approved Aircraft Leasing Incentive</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth in the East Asian region will lead to increased demand for air transport services. Singapore's location at the centre of the region provides potential for its development into a regional aircraft leasing hub. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aircraft leasing companies wishing to operate from Singapore can already enjoy a 10% concessionary rate of tax on income derived from offshore aircraft leasing. I propose to introduce additional incentives to complement this concessionary tax treatment. Interest payments on foreign loans taken during the incentive period to finance the operating leases will be exempt from tax. Approved companies will also be allowed the flexibility to depreciate their aircraft bought during the incentive period over 20 years instead of the normal 5 years. The additional incentive may be granted for 5 years in the first instance, and may be extended thereafter. It will take effect from Year of Assessment 1996. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAX CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Income Tax Rebate</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the good performance of the economy in 1994, I propose to give an across-the-board one-off rebate of 10% on individual income tax for the Year of Assessment 1995. This is equivalent to a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 3 percentage proportional cut in tax rates. The revenue loss to the Government is estimated to be $234 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy and Rental Charges</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With GST-related personal income tax changes which took effect from Year of Assessment 1994, 71% of individuals no longer pay income tax. As they have also contributed to the growth of the economy, Government will pay, on behalf of citizen householders staying in rented and owner-occupied HDB flats, the following charges: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) \n  <i>One-Room Flats</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of two months' net rent and three months' net S&amp;C charges, after deduction of the GST offset rebates. The rental payments will be made on 1st April and 1st December, and the S&amp;C payments on 1st April, 1st August and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) \n  <i>Two-Room Flats</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of one month's net rent and three months' net S&amp;C charges, after deduction of the GST offset rebates. The rental payment will be made on 1st April and the S&amp;C payments on 1st April, 1st August and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) \n  <i>Three-Room Flats</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of two months' net S&amp;C charges after deduction of the GST offset rebate. The payments will take effect on 1st April and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) \n  <i>Four-Room Flats</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of one month's gross S&amp;C charges, to be made on 1st April this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) \n  <i>Five-Room Flats</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of one month's gross S&amp;C charges, to be made on 1st April this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>The estimated additional cost of these rental and S&amp;C rebates to the Government is $30 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CPF Top-Up Scheme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exceptional performance of the economy last year has allowed the Government to accumulate a substantial budget surplus. Although most of the surplus will be put into reserves as a bulwark for the future, a portion will be returned to Singapore citizens who have contributed to the growth of the economy. Government will therefore pay a sum of $200 into the ordinary CPF account of every Singapore citizen aged 21 and above. The payment will be made on 1st October 1995. The cost of this payment is estimated at $360 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Deduction for CPF Contributions by Self-Employed</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-employed persons who contribute to the CPF are allowed to deduct their contributions, inclusive of compulsory Medisave contributions, from their assessable income. The present limit for such deductions is 18.5%, subject to a maximum of $13,320. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st July 1994, the employer_s CPF contribution rate was increased to 20%. In line with this, the limit for the tax deduction will be raised to 20% of the assessable income from self-employment, subject to a maximum of $14,400. This will take effect from the Year of Assessment 1996. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>OTHER TAX CHANGES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Reduction in Property Tax</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I announced a reduction of the property tax rate for industrial, commercial and let out residential properties from 16% to 15%, with the aim of ultimately reducing it to 12% over 4-5 years. As a measure to further enhance the competitiveness of doing business in Singapore, I have decided to reduce the property tax rate by 2%, from 15% to 13%. The reduction will take effect from 1 July 95 and will involve a revenue loss of $214 million per annum for Government. The Government strongly encourages landlords to share this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reduction in property tax with their tenants. The 4% concessionary tax rate for owner-occupied residential properties will remain unchanged. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Withdrawal of Property Tax Exemption for Land Under Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, land under development are exempted from property tax for a period of up to 5 years. This tax exemption was introduced in 1987 to help entrepreneurs tide over the economic downturn in the 1986 to 1987 period. Given the current strength of the economy in general, and the property market in particular, this tax exemption is no longer necessary. I have thus decided to withdraw the property tax exemption for land under development with immediate effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withdrawal of this tax exemption will only affect new projects. On-going projects that have been granted property tax exemption will continue to enjoy the concession until the projects are completed. Property tax exemption for land under development will henceforth only be granted to certain approved building projects endorsed by the Economic Development Board. These building projects must fit in with Government's aim to build up capabilities in particular industry clusters as well as lead to substantial economic spinoffs and benefits for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Contract Note Stamp Duty on Trading of Stocks in Singapore</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock trading has become increasingly globalized as a result of technological advances and increased interest by investors in foreign stock investments. For example, Asian stocks are increasingly being listed or traded in the major stock markets outside their home exchanges due to the strong international investor interest in such stocks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance our competitiveness and to continue to attract international investors to trade in Singapore and regional stocks on our Exchange, the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) has recently reduced its minimum stockbroking commission rate from 0.5% to 0.3% for transactions of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore stocks exceeding $1.5 million. This is a commendable initiative on the SES's part to encourage more trading activity. In support of the SES's efforts to keep stock transactions costs in Singapore competitive, I have decided to halve the contract note stamp duty on stock transactions from 0.1% to 0.05% of the contract value. This change will take immediate effect. Revenue foregone from the halving of stamp duty on contract notes is estimated at $135 million for FY95. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Waiver of Stamp Duty on Loan Agreements for SES Listed Stocks</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the sophistication of the stock market and to cater to the needs of institutional investors, the SES plans to facilitate lending and borrowing of SES listed stocks. Stock borrowing is widely carried out in major financial markets. With the increased sophistication of stock market participants in Singapore, there is scope for the growth of stock lending and borrowing in SES stocks. To support the development of such activities and encourage the growth of stock options trading, I have decided to exempt loan agreements for lending and borrowing of Singapore stocks, for ASCs, ACUs and residents outside Singapore, from stamp duty with immediate effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Water Conservation Tax</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water conservation tax was last increased in 1992. This successfully brought down the increase in demand for water from 5.4% in 1992 to 4.9% in 1993. However, despite the continued efforts by the Public Utilities Board to encourage water conservation amongst households and industries, the increase in demand for water has since climbed back to 6.5% for 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is a scarce resource for Singapore as we import a large part of the water we consume. To restrain the growth in water consumption, Government has decided to increase the Water Conservation Tax on domestic customers who consume more than 20 cubic metres \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of water per month from 10% to 15%. The tax for non-domestic and shipping customers will also be increased from 15% to 20%. This tax change will take effect from 1st April 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Cigarettes and Tobacco</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imported cigarettes are currently subject to both import and excise duties, while locally manufactured cigarettes are subject to an excise duty on the leaf tobacco and an excise duty on the finished product. To equalize the tax treatment between locally manufactured and imported cigarettes, import duty on cigarettes will be eliminated and excise duty on cigarettes raised to $115 per kg with immediate effect. In addition, local cigarette manufacturers will be exempted from excise duty on tobacco leaves used in the production of local cigarettes. Details of the duty changes for the various types of cigarettes and tobacco are in Appendix A (Cols. 117 - 120). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19950301/19950301-HA-0640117.htm\">Appendix A - CHANGES IN CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO DUTIES (Cols. 117 - 120)</a>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONCLUSION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are facing a period of historic transformation of Asian economies. The region is taking off. Excellent opportunities abound. We, in Singapore, must seize the moment or risk being left behind. If our businesses explore the opportunities abroad, if they capitalise on our supportive and conducive fiscal environment; and if our people continue to be dynamic, daring and outward looking, we should be able to move forward in this sea of change. I am confident that with guts, gumption and enterprise, we will stay ahead and prosper.

It provides wider coverage, brings commuters closer to their workplaces, shortens journey times, and provides higher capacity with the deployment of more buses. Double-decker buses have also been introduced on those services to provide more seats for passengers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the MRT serves Jurong with three stations - Chinese Garden, Lakeside and Boon Lay. The MRTC will study the feasibility of further rail extensions in the Jurong area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The URA and PWD have also drawn up plans to improve the road network in Jurong. These changes will smoothen the flow of buses entering and leaving Boon Lay bus interchange, relieve current congestion spots, and improve circulation within the Jurong Regional Centre. Access to Jurong from other parts of Singapore will also be improved through the opening of the Kranji Expressway and the upgrading of certain roads within Jurong to expressways and semi-expressways. Additional road links with the PIE are also being examined to improve access to the area. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>GOVERNMENT ADVERTISEMENTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Finance, with regard to the money spent on advertisements over TV and in newspapers (a) what are the allocation guidelines for the various Ministries which his Ministry follows; (b) what is the amount of money spent from 1992 to 1994; and (c) how his Ministry assesses the cost-effectiveness of these advertisements. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Ministry of Finance does not use allocation guidelines to determine the funds to be provided to the various Ministries for use on advertisements in the TV and newspapers. Instead, each Ministry's request is submitted as part of its block budget, and Ministries are subsequently given some latitude in deciding how much they need to spend for this purpose, depending on their needs and priorities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The total amount of money spent by Ministries on advertisements during the last 3 years is as follows : \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n         FY 92                      $5,910,180\r\n\r\n         FY 93                      $7,150,220\r\n\r\n         FY 94                      $9,931,210 (estimated)\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a percentage of Other Operating Expenditure, these amounted to 0.13%, 0.15% and 0.18% respectively for FY92, FY93 and FY94. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Around two-thirds of the advertisement spending over the past 3 years was in conjunction with national campaigns. Some of these include MOH's campaign against smoking and AIDS and MITA's Courtesy, Speak Mandarin and Sing Singapore Campaigns. Since most campaigns are geared towards developing a more civic and healthy society, their success can only be assessed in the long term, if at all. Nevertheless, independent research organisations are periodically appointed to gauge the reach and effectiveness of campaigns and thereby assist Ministries to fine-tune and improve on them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining one-third of advertisement funds was spent on recruiting staff and the procurement of selected goods and services from the private sector. Such spending is necessary for the smooth running of Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STREET NAMES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) why are there multiple streets with the same names; (b) how did this happen; and (c) what plans his Ministry has to prevent any similar future occurrence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are a few roads bearing the same name. These are roads which existed for a long time and were split into sections by new developments striding across them. Some are traversed by new highways and expressways that link new towns and estates built over the last few years. The disjointed sections of these roads thus end up bearing the same name. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street names of these roads have not been changed so as not to inconvenience residents who may have lived on these roads for a long time. These residents would have to change their addresses if the street names were changed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Committee of Street Names is the body that proposes names for new roads. The Committee consults the Roads Division of PWD on future developments in any particular area before proposing a name for a new street. The Committee also ensures, as far as possible, that names proposed for new roads do not duplicate existing ones, nor cause any confusion to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many establishments in Singapore have massage as one of their services; (b) whether there has been an increase in the number of these establishments from 1992 to 1994, and if so, what is the reason for the increase; (c) how many of them have been reported for breach of rules and what penalty was meted out; and (d) what percentage of massage establishments had recurrent violations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 113 establishments in Singapore with massage as one of its services. Thirty two new establishments were licensed in the past 3 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massage establishments are governed by the Massage Establishments Act and its Rules. In addition, licensing conditions are imposed by Police to minimise crime and vice activities and to prevent syndicates from operating such establishments. For instance, no one with a record of being involved in vice activities is allowed to operate a massage establishment or be employed as a masseuse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police enforce the laws and conditions concerning massage establishments strictly. The numbers of breaches in the past 3 years are as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n                  1992              -        34\r\n\r\n                  1993              -        16\r\n\r\n                  1994              -        25\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties meted out depend on the seriousness of the offence. For minor offences, eg failure to wear identification card, a warning is given. For more serious offences, eg employing masseuses without approval from the licensing officer, licensees are prosecuted in court under the Massage Establishments Act.

A committee to vet advertisements is not necessary, as each Ministry already has its own procedures for vetting advertisements before they are released. On sensitive issues, many Ministries pre-test them on representative samples before launch. However, it is not possible to forestall all negative reactions particularly when the objective is to change social behaviour. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BEAUTY SALONS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) what penalties were meted out to the beauty salons concerned for the 10 complaints of complications pertaining to the use of lasers by these salons between 1992 and 1994 and (b) whether the penalty is a sufficient deterrent and, if not, what further plan he has. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary investigations by the Ministry of Health into the 10 complaints of complications pertaining to the alleged use of lasers did not reveal any unauthorised use of lasers by beauticians.
