For example, the workers must\r\n\r\nbe  properly seated and in a manner that would not cause them\r\n\r\nto  fall  off the vehicle.  For pick-up trucks, the  vehicles\r\n\r\nare  required to have proper side railings to further protect\r\n\r\nthe  passengers.  In addition, the drivers of  such  vehicles\r\n\r\nare  not  allowed to carry an excess number of passengers  or\r\n\r\ntravel  faster  than the stipulated vehicle speed  limit  for\r\n\r\ngoods vehicles, which is currently set at 50 km per hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties for the violation of safety rules and\r\n\r\nrequirements  are stringent.

Because many of  the  passengers  are\r\n\r\nperched in very dangerous positions, and if safety is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  basic  requirements, then other alternative arrangements\r\n\r\nwould  need  to be undertaken.  So I want to know what  plans\r\n\r\nthere  are for improving transportation conditions for  these\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> It is not just a message. We\r\n\r\nhave  stringent rules.  For instance, depending on the  floor\r\n\r\narea  of the vehicle, there is a formula that calculates  the\r\n\r\npermissible number of passengers.  The fines are  also  quite\r\n\r\nsteep.   And  we  are  also looking at  other  measures,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  hand straps or hand holds and, if practicable,  we\r\n\r\ncan get them installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State how many workers have been injured using this  mode\r\n\r\nof  transportation so far, and have any workers died  because\r\n\r\nof this mode of transportation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> According to Traffic Police\r\n\r\nstatistics,  they  have  monitored accident  rates  involving\r\n\r\ngoods  vehicles, but they have not divided them, eg,  whether\r\n\r\nthe  injured  are open back passengers or passengers  in  the\r\n\r\nvehicles.   But  even this figure shows that  the  number  is\r\n\r\nquite low compared to, for instance, motorcycles.  If you are\r\n\r\nconcerned, motorcycles are even more risky.  But, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe point is that if you observe safety rules, then there  is\r\n\r\nno  concern  about  safety.  The reason why motorcycles  have\r\n\r\nhigh  accident rates is that a lot of them speed and  do  not\r\n\r\nobserve  traffic  rules.  My point is  that  as  long  as  we\r\n\r\nobserve safety rules, there should not be any safety concern.\r\n\r\nAnd  if the Member is interested in the actual figures, I can\r\n\r\ngive  him  a  comparison.  For instance, number of passengers\r\n\r\nkilled  in  1999 for pick-ups and lorries, 2 (and we  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  they  are  the open  back  passengers  or  the\r\n\r\ndrivers);  number  of people killed for motor-cycles,  11  (5\r\n\r\ntimes).  So I do not see the concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Minister of State so far,\r\n\r\nhow  does the Ministry enforce the rule that the workers  are\r\n\r\nsafely  transported during the night, especially  during  the\r\n\r\nearly morning where construction works are going on along the\r\n\r\nroads?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I said, there are\r\n\r\ntraffic regulations, whether it is the proper lighting of the\r\n\r\nvehicles,  or  whether  it  is  our  road  conditions,   road\r\n\r\nlighting, and so on.

This\r\n\r\nrate  has  remained unchanged since 1974.   As  a  result  of\r\n\r\nincreasing costs over the years, the fees for renewal by cash\r\n\r\nand  cash  equivalents had to be increased to $105 for  three\r\n\r\nyears  to reflect the higher operational costs.  If, however,\r\n\r\nrenewals  are done by GIRO, the processing costs  are  lower.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  MOF  is able to pass on the cost savings  to  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  firms, and keep the renewal fees unchanged  at  $75\r\n\r\nfor three years, or at $25 per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, people are asking why there is\r\n\r\nsuch  a big differential rate.

So they  are\r\n\r\nasking:  as  far  as  the registration of business  firms  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  cash  payment does not have  the  same  value  as\r\n\r\npaying by GIRO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> By paying cash, you require\r\n\r\nsomeone,  a clerk, at the counter to receive and process  the\r\n\r\ncash.

Unlike  dogs, cats would not play  an  important\r\n\r\nrole  in the spread of rabies in the event of an outbreak  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Hence,  the licensing of cats  to  enable  quick\r\n\r\nlocation of the animals for disease control is not necessary.\r\n\r\nHowever, under the HDB Rules, lessees are not allowed to keep\r\n\r\ncats  in HDB flats because it is difficult to confine  a  cat\r\n\r\nwithin a flat. By nature, they tend to wander around and  can\r\n\r\nfind  ways  and means to get out of the flat thus creating  a\r\n\r\nnuisance to other residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agri-food and Veterinary Authority's (AVA) policy on\r\n\r\nthe  control  of  stray  cats is to promote  responsible  cat\r\n\r\nownership within the community through a voluntary Stray  Cat\r\n\r\nRehabilitation  Scheme implemented by various town  councils.\r\n\r\nThis scheme was successfully tried out as a pilot project  in\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar Town Council in 1998.  A survey of residents in\r\n\r\nthis area showed that more than 80% of them were agreeable to\r\n\r\nhaving   the  stray  cats  around,  provided  the  cats   are\r\n\r\nsterilised  and  managed so that they do not cause  problems.\r\n\r\nTo date, 39 areas under 12 town councils are registered under\r\n\r\nthe scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Stray Cat Rehabilitation Scheme, volunteers\r\n\r\nget  the  stray  cats  in their community  sterilised.   They\r\n\r\nassist town council officers to attend to complainants of cat\r\n\r\nproblems  and help to resolve them.  The volunteers feed  the\r\n\r\ncats  in an organised and hygienic way.  They clear away  the\r\n\r\nfood remnants after feeding the cats.

Hence, the effective  control  of  stray\r\n\r\ncats  requires cooperation of every member of the  public  to\r\n\r\ndispose  food waste properly and also not to feed the  strays\r\n\r\nindiscriminately.   Very  often, well-meaning  citizens  feed\r\n\r\nstrays  indiscriminately and leave food scraps lying  around.\r\n\r\nSuch  unhygienic practice not only increases  the  stray  cat\r\n\r\nproblem, it also exacerbates other animal nuisances, such  as\r\n\r\ncrows, pigeons and especially vermin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AVA is currently reviewing its policies and\r\n\r\npractices  with a view to control indiscriminate  feeding  of\r\n\r\nanimals as well as the abandonment of pets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Although cat is not my problem, I am\r\n\r\nasking on behalf of somebody else.

This has arisen due mainly to  the  many\r\n\r\ndifferent designs and configurations of HDB blocks,  and  the\r\n\r\ndiverse needs of our HDB residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, lift upgrading works. At present,\r\n\r\nHDB  provides lift upgrading only to HDB blocks that  meet  a\r\n\r\nset   of  criteria,  such  as  lift-to-flat  ratio  and   the\r\n\r\naccessibility rate.  These criteria are necessary  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  upgrading  works carried out  are  cost-effective.\r\n\r\nSome  HDB  blocks  are  unable to meet the  criteria,  mainly\r\n\r\nbecause  not  all  the flats are served by common  corridors.\r\n\r\nFor  these HDB blocks, it will be necessary to add extra lift\r\n\r\nshafts  and lifts in order to provide direct lift access  for\r\n\r\nall  the residents in the block.  The benefits of such  works\r\n\r\nare  obvious,  especially  for the  elderly  and  those  with\r\n\r\nmobility  problems.  Some Members of the House have fed  back\r\n\r\nto  my  Ministry  that lift upgrading  is  one  of  the  more\r\n\r\nappreciated items in the MUP.  However, these works can  cost\r\n\r\nanything  between  $10,000 and $30,000 per  flat.   There  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a  need  to  obtain  a  strong  endorsement   from\r\n\r\nresidents before we proceed with the works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to introduce a new class of upgrading\r\n\r\nworks,  known as special upgrading works, to cater for  block\r\n\r\nworks  of this nature.  The objective is to give HDB  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  do  more during the  MUP  to  bring  maximum\r\n\r\nbenefits to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlargest number of Singaporeans living in various types of HDB\r\n\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special upgrading works will proceed only if they\r\n\r\nare valued and endorsed by the residents.  To gauge the level\r\n\r\nof  support for such works, HDB will conduct a separate  poll\r\n\r\namong  flat  owners  who stand to benefit directly  from  the\r\n\r\nworks.   HDB  will implement these works only if the  minimum\r\n\r\n75%  \"yes\"  vote  is  obtained.  The Government  will  pay  a\r\n\r\nmajority share for such upgrading works. However, flat owners\r\n\r\nwho  stand  to  benefit  directly from  such  works  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired to co-pay part of the cost.  This is only fair.   It\r\n\r\nalso  helps to ensure that flat owners consider the need  for\r\n\r\nsuch upgrading works carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Use of HDB Flats As Home Offices</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the subject of allowing HDB residents\r\n\r\nto  use their flats as home offices.  Sir, in order to create\r\n\r\na   conducive  environment  for  technopreneurs  to  start  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  easily  and  at  low cost, the  Technopreneur  Home\r\n\r\nOffice  Scheme was set up.  This scheme allows technopreneurs\r\n\r\nto  operate their IT-related start-up businesses from HDB and\r\n\r\nprivate residential premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB flat leases issued prior to 1983 contain\r\n\r\ncovenants which impose on lessees the obligation to  use  the\r\n\r\npremises  solely  for residential purposes.  These  covenants\r\n\r\nare made between the lessee, HDB and all other lessees in the\r\n\r\nsame  building.   This means that consensus amongst  all  the\r\n\r\nlessees  living  in  the  same  building  is  required  if  a\r\n\r\nparticular  lessee  or  tenant wishes to  conduct  activities\r\n\r\nbeyond those of a residential nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill discharges HDB and the affected lessees from\r\n\r\nthis  obligation under the lease and allows all HDB flats  to\r\n\r\nbe  used  as  registered  offices of  companies.   This  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate the use of HDB flats as home offices under the THO\r\n\r\nscheme.   Nonetheless, NSTB and HDB will regulate the  scheme\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the residential character of public  housing\r\n\r\nestates  and the safety and comfort of surrounding  residents\r\n\r\nare not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Administrative Measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two main amendments that I have\r\n\r\nhighlighted,  the  Bill also introduces  some  administrative\r\n\r\nchanges   to  improve  the  enforcement  of  public   housing\r\n\r\nregulations and policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill allows HDB to prosecute any person who\r\n\r\nknowingly  makes any false statements to HDB in  relation  to\r\n\r\nthe  sale,  purchase, mortgage or transfer of  an  HDB  flat.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Bill confers on HDB the exclusive use of  HDB's\r\n\r\nlogo  and the acronym \"HDB\" by making it an offence for other\r\n\r\npersons  to use HDB's logo, the acronym \"HDB\" or one that  is\r\n\r\nso  similar  as  to cause any deception.  Thirdly,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nremoves the requirement to obtain the sanction of the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor  before HDB takes prosecution action for  offences\r\n\r\ncommitted under the Housing and Development Act or Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, most Members in\r\n\r\nthis House must have heard about this IQ question:  A man who\r\n\r\nstays  on the 12th storey of a flat always takes the lift  up\r\n\r\nto  the  9th storey and walks up three storeys to  his  flat.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when  he leaves for work every morning,  he  always\r\n\r\ntakes  the  lift on the floor where he stays,  ie,  the  12th\r\n\r\nstorey.  Why?  The answer is that the man is short, not  tall\r\n\r\nenough  to  press the upper button.  He can  only  press  the\r\n\r\nlower button so he can reach only the 9th storey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in many of our mature housing estates, many\r\n\r\nresidents  living on the upper floors are doing  exactly  the\r\n\r\nsame as the short man though they are not short. Why?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  our lifts do not reach the top floor.  Our lifts  do\r\n\r\nnot  stop  on every floor either.  Thus, residents living  on\r\n\r\nthe  upper  floors have to walk up or down a few  storeys  to\r\n\r\ntake the lift. This is especially so for residents of the  4-room  segmented  blocks.  Due to structural constraint,  some\r\n\r\nneed  to go a few storeys down to the common corridor  floor,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwalk past a few units to take the lift; as not all staircases\r\n\r\nare  equipped with a lift. As a standard, only two lifts  are\r\n\r\nprovided in a block where there are five pairs of staircases.\r\n\r\nThus,  residents  wish that a new lift can be  added  to  the\r\n\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, when we urge residents to vote \"yes\" for\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Upgrading  Programme, the  most  frequently  asked\r\n\r\nquestion  is,  \"Will the new lift stop on  every  floor?\"  or\r\n\r\n\"Will there be a new lift in our segment?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents also comment that in the lift that serves a 12-storey block, we normally can find only five buttons. The\r\n\r\nbuttons  numbered \"5\" and \"9\" are to enable you to reach  the\r\n\r\n5th  floor  and  the 9th floor.  And one more button  is  for\r\n\r\neveryone  to go down. The other two buttons do not bring  you\r\n\r\nup or down. It is just meant for the door to open or close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about emergency?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> For emergency, it is the green\r\n\r\nbutton.  Normally, we do not press this button.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB's existing lift upgrading criterion is that\r\n\r\neach  new  lift  landing must serve at  least  four  dwelling\r\n\r\nunits.  This  has  caused disappointment and  unhappiness  to\r\n\r\nresidents  of 4-room segmented blocks as there are  only  two\r\n\r\nunits in each of the segment on every floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents are of the view that they should benefit from\r\n\r\nthe  new  lift landings at every floor if there is already  a\r\n\r\nlift  and  should  not  be deprived of it  just  because  the\r\n\r\nproposed  lift  landings cannot comply  with  the  criterion.\r\n\r\nDuring  my meet-the-people sessions, there have been  several\r\n\r\nrequests  from senior citizens or families with aged  parents\r\n\r\nof  swapping their flats with those on the floor where  there\r\n\r\nis a lift landing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend Mr Mah for moving this amendment. As\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Inter-Ministerial Committee on  the  Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation,  he  is  in the best position to  understand  the\r\n\r\nfrustration and disappointment of residents who cannot enjoy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neasy access to the lift due to the existing regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we made these amendments to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds of an ageing population.  It will be too late if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  make  this  amendment in time as such  segmented  blocks\r\n\r\nconstitute 22% of all the high-rise blocks built by HDB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more of these blocks will undergo the Main\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme.  Though similar blocks in  the  earlier\r\n\r\nMUPs  were  not  given  the full lift  upgrading,  it  cannot\r\n\r\njustify  that all other segmented blocks should not be  given\r\n\r\nfull  lift  upgrading just because the earlier  blocks  could\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill empowers HDB to carry out selective polling and\r\n\r\npayment for special upgrading works.  I support this as  this\r\n\r\nwill give the affected HDB blocks a more realistic chance  of\r\n\r\nachieving the minimum 75% vote as only flat owners  who  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  directly from the works will vote and  pay  for  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  residents  are concerned  about  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nsharing  as it may be too high that they cannot afford.   The\r\n\r\nMinister did not mention the percentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Minister to set a lower\r\n\r\nratio  so  that  the owners need to pay,  say,  15%  to  20%,\r\n\r\ninstead of the normal 30% for the additional upgrading  item,\r\n\r\nespecially if they opt for a new lift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  Singapore is one of the  countries  with  the\r\n\r\nfastest  ageing population.  Sir, we have now  about  370,000\r\n\r\npeople  above  the  age  of 55, accounting  for  10%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation. Among our senior citizens, about 90% live in high-rise HDB buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier generation of HDB flats, lifts do not\r\n\r\nstop  on  every floor.  Because of the design, many residents\r\n\r\ndo  not have the lifts serving the floor on which they  live.\r\n\r\nJust  now, Mr Seng Han Thong had already mentioned this.  For\r\n\r\nthe younger population, walking up stairs does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npose a problem. But \"time and tide wait for no man\". With the\r\n\r\nageing  population, there are now more and more older  people\r\n\r\nin  our  population.  These senior citizens  are  finding  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to cope with the flights of steps to walk  up  and\r\n\r\ndown  every time they leave their flats as the lifts  do  not\r\n\r\nstop on their floors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget debate this year, I suggested to the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development that the Government  should\r\n\r\nmake  a  comprehensive study on how to improve  the  existing\r\n\r\nlifts  or install new lifts for the convenience of our senior\r\n\r\ncitizens.   I  am very happy to note that this suggestion  of\r\n\r\nmine has been taken up by the Minister.  I would like to take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to thank the Minister and the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board staff for introducing this Amendment  Bill\r\n\r\nso  speedily.  I would like to thank them sincerely from  the\r\n\r\nbottom  of  my heart for this effort to provide  better  lift\r\n\r\nservices to our older citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I support this Amendment Bill. But I would\r\n\r\nlike to comment on certain clauses of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, section 65A, as amended, defines \"special\r\n\r\nupgrading  works\"  as works to be carried  out  in  buildings\r\n\r\ncomprising 2 or more storeys.  That being the case,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister whether those four-storey HDB flats\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  provided  with  lifts  when  they  are  being\r\n\r\nupgraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the amendment to section 65C provides for a\r\n\r\npoll to be conducted in connection with any proposal to carry\r\n\r\nout special upgrading works, for which the support of 75%  or\r\n\r\nmore  of the occupants having direct benefit from the special\r\n\r\nupgrading  works   must  be secured for  the  project  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel the upgrading of lifts is the most important\r\n\r\nitem  in the entire Main Upgrading Programme.  It is a  basic\r\n\r\nitem  that should be regarded as a necessity.  It must be  an\r\n\r\nessential,  compulsory provision which requires  no  separate\r\n\r\nvoting  to  decide  whether new lifts  should  be  installed.\r\n\r\nLifts  are very essential for high-rise buildings. So to  add\r\n\r\nnew lifts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  old  buildings is to improve existing facilities  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  equal services for all residents.  It is not  a  new\r\n\r\nproject, so there is no need for a separate voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the amendment to section 65D, which\r\n\r\nstates  that the cost of upgrading works should be  co-shared\r\n\r\nby  the affected residents, is unfair. There are four reasons\r\n\r\nfor this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, flat allocation. In the early days, flats were\r\n\r\nallocated  to  applicants  by  ballots  conducted   by   HDB.\r\n\r\nApplicants themselves have no free choice to select their own\r\n\r\nflat.   If  you are lucky, you get a flat on the  floor  with\r\n\r\nlift landing.  If you are not, you may get a flat one or  two\r\n\r\nstoreys above or below the lift landing.  The only choice you\r\n\r\nhad was to accept it or reject it.  Once you accepted it, you\r\n\r\ncannot change your decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the sale price of the flat. During the earlier\r\n\r\ndays,  whether your flat was on a high floor or a low  floor,\r\n\r\nwith or without lift landing, you paid the same price for the\r\n\r\nflat. There was no different  pricing. As a result, those who\r\n\r\nhad bought flats on the floors with no lift landing will have\r\n\r\nto suffer a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, market price. In the open resale market, a\r\n\r\nflat  on the floor with lift landing commands a better  price\r\n\r\nthan  the other flats without a lift landing. Those who  live\r\n\r\nin   flats   without  lift  services  will   suffer   another\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, lifts as public facilities. In public\r\n\r\nhousing, the installation of lifts is  not restricted to only\r\n\r\ncertain residents. It is not their monopoly to use such  lift\r\n\r\nservices. Everybody is allowed to use the lift in a block  of\r\n\r\nHDB flats. It is part of common property.  It does not belong\r\n\r\nto any particular group of residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lifts in high-rise buildings are very important\r\n\r\nfacilities,  particularly to the senior citizens.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important item in the upgrading programme. So the  cost\r\n\r\nof   installation  of  the  lifts  should  be  borne  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the residents should not be required  to  co-share in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   cost.    The  Housing  and  Development  Board   should\r\n\r\ntherefore regard the lift installation as part of the overall\r\n\r\nupgrading  cost.  It should not be shared separately  by  the\r\n\r\nresidents  affected.  All residents should be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\n\"share  weal and woe\". We should promote the \"kampong spirit\"\r\n\r\nand  the community spirit. We should not discriminate against\r\n\r\none another. We must create a better living environment and a\r\n\r\nbetter home for everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister said that the residents would\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear  only  a small  part of the  total  cost.   My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Seng Han Thong, also mentioned  that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  bear 100% of the cost of  installing  new\r\n\r\nlifts  and the residents are asked to co-share in it, then  I\r\n\r\nthink the co-sharing should not exceed 20% of the total cost,\r\n\r\nand  it should be borne by all the residents and not just the\r\n\r\naffected residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if upgrading and installation of lifts is\r\n\r\nconsidered  only  in  conjunction  with  the  Main  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme, then the HDB should consider bringing forward  the\r\n\r\nage criterion of 20 years to 15 years, and the IUP should  be\r\n\r\ncoordinated  so  that  the  upgrading  programmes  could   be\r\n\r\naccelerated,   and  the financial and human resources  better\r\n\r\nutilised  to  provide  a  better  environment  for  all   the\r\n\r\nresidents, and  better homes for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  can  make  HDB  estates  more  luxurious  with  continued\r\n\r\nimprovements  and upgrading works.  But this  will  not  make\r\n\r\nthem as attractive as the private housing estates as long  as\r\n\r\nHDB  continues to maintain and enforce a standard set of very\r\n\r\nrigid,  restrictive and outdated covenants  and  rules  which\r\n\r\nstifle the creativity, resourcefulness and initiatives of its\r\n\r\nlessees and the tenants at home or work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this thought in mind, I am particularly pleased to\r\n\r\nnote  that  HDB  is now taking such a big and  bold  step  to\r\n\r\nremove  the  restrictive covenants in its  standard  list  of\r\n\r\ninstruments which will impede the reasonable use of HDB flats\r\n\r\nas a home office for any commercial purpose. This is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertainly  the most welcome move for both our young  and  old\r\n\r\nenterprising  HDB  flat dwellers who  aspire  to  have  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  start-ups established in their HDB  home  for  good\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well-known for its over-regulation because\r\n\r\ncivil  servants, like HDB officers, are good in making  rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations to ensure law and order, especially  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.  This might be important in our early days of nation-building  and  community development.   But  such  regulatory\r\n\r\napproach,  if carried out to the extreme in the  modern  day,\r\n\r\nwould  have  the  adverse effect of making life  increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult  and  stressful in Singapore.  This  is  definitely\r\n\r\ndetrimental to our current effort of attracting and nurturing\r\n\r\ntalents  for  the  new  economy.  To make  the  estates  more\r\n\r\nattractive, HDB has challenged its planners and architects to\r\n\r\ndesign  flats to rival those of condominiums.  But I want  to\r\n\r\npose  yet  another challenge to HDB.  Instead  of  trying  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more rules and regulations to plug loopholes  in  its\r\n\r\nadministration, can HDB officers use their creative minds  to\r\n\r\nactively  revise  and  relax  more  of  its  restrictive  and\r\n\r\noutdated  rules and regulations to make every  HDB  estate  a\r\n\r\nmore  conducive  and  attractive place  to  live  and  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness.  For example, can HDB revise its parking rules  and\r\n\r\ncharges to make visiting friends and relatives in HDB estates\r\n\r\nnot  always an inconvenient and costly affair?  Can HDB allow\r\n\r\nshopowners  or  tenants  to use or sublet  the  underutilised\r\n\r\ndwelling   units  in  their  shop  premises  for   commercial\r\n\r\npurposes?   Can  HDB allow its lessees and tenants  to  build\r\n\r\nproper  flower  boxes  or  install suitable  facilities  with\r\n\r\nsafety  features to grow plants at balconies or corridors  of\r\n\r\ntheir HDB flats?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nAct  will  also allow the Minister to approve such  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks as additional lifts, especially upgrading works for HDB\r\n\r\napartment blocks if more than 75% of the flat owners affected\r\n\r\nsupported the proposal.  Such special upgrading works may, in\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  give rise to the need for HDB  to  compulsorily\r\n\r\nacquire  certain  units  of flats for the  intended  purpose.\r\n\r\nWould the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  ensure  that in such a situation, the  flat  owners\r\n\r\naffected  would  be given adequate compensation  as  well  as\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation within the same block or  the  same\r\n\r\nestate before approving the upgrading works?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the House expressed a great deal of concern\r\n\r\nover  the killer litter problem in HDB estates, and suggested\r\n\r\nvarious  ways,  including  public education  and  enforcement\r\n\r\naction,  to  address  it.  I would also  like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to suggest that HDB and town councils  seriously\r\n\r\nlook  into the common aspirations and interests of  many  HDB\r\n\r\nflat dwellers who want to beautify their monotonous high-rise\r\n\r\nflats  with colourful plants and flowers.  Besides  education\r\n\r\nand  enforcement action, can HDB and town councils also  pool\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts  and resources together to  design  and  build\r\n\r\nproper  and  attractive flower boxes with safety features  to\r\n\r\nreplace all the existing movable or hanging flower pots which\r\n\r\ncan  be  potential killer litter in HDB estates?  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nsuch a special or general upgrading works are worth pursuing,\r\n\r\nas  we all share a common aspiration to make every HDB estate\r\n\r\na  safe,  clean and green living environment that also  makes\r\n\r\nSingapore a garden city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with my sincere hopes and appeals, I\r\n\r\nsupport the motion to pass this Bill in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the new sections 13A and 13B that\r\n\r\nconfer  exclusive rights to HDB to use its  name,  symbol  or\r\n\r\nrepresentation   will  provide  added   protection   to   HDB\r\n\r\nresidents.    This   will   also  prevent   unscrupulous   or\r\n\r\nunconscionable traders or individuals from abusing  the  name\r\n\r\nof  HDB  to  take  advantage of less informed HDB  residents.\r\n\r\nOver  the  years, there have been several cases  of  cheating\r\n\r\nwhen  traders, especially renovation or trade craftsmen,  who\r\n\r\nclaim  to  be  accredited  HDB contractors,  carry  out  poor\r\n\r\nquality  repair  works  for  HDB  residents  at  unreasonable\r\n\r\nprices.  Very often, it is difficult to trace these culprits,\r\n\r\nand not much redress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  made to the affected residents.  With the introduction of\r\n\r\nthese  powers,  I  hope  that  the  HDB  can  provide  better\r\n\r\nprotection  to its lessees.  To ensure that this  legislation\r\n\r\nis  effectively implemented, I would urge HDB to conduct more\r\n\r\npublic  education  programmes to keep  HDB  residents  better\r\n\r\ninformed  of the authentication procedures for HDB instructed\r\n\r\nworks  or  accredited  contractors.  This  will  ensure  that\r\n\r\nbetter  quality of services and products can be  rendered  to\r\n\r\nHDB   residents.   To  further  protect  HDB  residents,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  should  also make similar amendments  to  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the amendments to sections 65A, 65C and 65D\r\n\r\nregarding  the  introduction of special  upgrading  works,  I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  highlight  some  concerns.   Although   the\r\n\r\namendment  may  seem logical and acceptable to HDB  residents\r\n\r\nundertaking upgrading works, it has an undesirable impact  on\r\n\r\nthe  concept of communal living and the definition of \"common\r\n\r\nproperty\".   The concept of communal living in HDB  flats  is\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  that  of a private condominium  where  residents\r\n\r\nagree,  at  the time of purchase, to live together  within  a\r\n\r\nblock  or  precinct and share facilities that are defined  as\r\n\r\ncommon  property.   Common property includes  items  such  as\r\n\r\nroof,  building  structure elements, external  walls,  lifts,\r\n\r\nstack  pipes,  playground, swimming pool, etc,  that  benefit\r\n\r\nresidents within a block or a precinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a private condominium, the voting rights of the flat\r\n\r\nowners  are  specified in the Land Titles  Strata  Act  where\r\n\r\nowners  can exercise their voting rights according  to  share\r\n\r\nvalue.  In the HDB context, the voting rights of lessees  are\r\n\r\nnormally  only exercised during the Interim or Main Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes.   Each eligible flat owner has one  voting  right\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  the  size  of  the  flat.   The   cost   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining and upkeeping of all these buildings  is  usually\r\n\r\napportioned   according  to  share  value  or  voting   right\r\n\r\nrespectively.    By  segregating  special   upgrading   works\r\n\r\ncomprising  additional lifts or such  other  works  that  are\r\n\r\ndeclared by the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  introducing selective voting for such work items, we are\r\n\r\neroding the spirit of communal living and tampering with  the\r\n\r\nrights of HDB lessees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lift is a common property that benefits every\r\n\r\nresident in a high-rise block, irrespective of which floor he\r\n\r\nor she stays.  Therefore, all residents should share the cost\r\n\r\nof maintaining, upgrading or installing new lifts.  These are\r\n\r\nexisting  practices  of  both town  councils  and  management\r\n\r\ncorporations.   Sir, I do not believe that  selective  voting\r\n\r\nfor  special  upgrading works will work, and it is  also  not\r\n\r\nfair to the affected residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we were to start introducing selective voting\r\n\r\nfor common property, the result will be disastrous.  Many HDB\r\n\r\nresidents will question why should they pay for the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining   the  roof,  water  pumps,  lifts,   structures,\r\n\r\nplaygrounds, senior citizens' corners, etc, as some of  these\r\n\r\nfacilities do not benefit them directly.   This will lead  to\r\n\r\npotential conflicts among residents, thus weakening community\r\n\r\nbonding.   Therefore, I would urge the Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\neither removing the proposed amendments in sections 65A,  65C\r\n\r\nand  65D  or  make  it compulsory for such special  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks  to  be  included  in  the  IUP  or  MUP  works,  where\r\n\r\nnecessary.  These special upgrading works can be packaged  in\r\n\r\nthe list of essential works such as water proofing of toilets\r\n\r\nor  changing  of stack pipes which are presently included  as\r\n\r\ncompulsory works in the MUP standard package.  In addition, I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  HDB  to bear the cost of making  all  HDB  flats\r\n\r\nelderly and handicapped friendly, so as to meet the needs  of\r\n\r\na fast ageing population.  As a good landlord, HDB has a duty\r\n\r\nto  improve the accessibility and functionality of its flats,\r\n\r\nin  particular, the installation of lifts that stop on  every\r\n\r\nfloor.  The provision of lifts that stop on every floor is no\r\n\r\nlonger a privilege but a necessity in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  focus  my comments on what I deem to  be  the  main\r\n\r\naspect  of  this  Bill, ie, pertaining to  special  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks.  I believe this Bill is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworthy of support  because of three essential principles that\r\n\r\nunderpin it.  The first is the flexibility it endows the  HDB\r\n\r\nwith in the implementation of upgrading projects.  The second\r\n\r\nis  the  choice  it  will  give  Singaporeans  so  that  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can benefit from upgrading works.  And the third\r\n\r\nis  the  principle of equity, to ensure a certain  degree  of\r\n\r\nmatching  or congruence between those who benefit  and  those\r\n\r\nwho bear the cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MUP projects that we have seen so far\r\n\r\nimplemented  attempt to strike a balance between these  three\r\n\r\nprinciples  of flexibility, choice and equity, by adopting  a\r\n\r\nlayered approach.  In a typical MUP project, we have, at  the\r\n\r\nfirst   tier,  precinct  works  which,  it  could  be  argued\r\n\r\nreasonably,  are of benefit to all residents,  and  therefore\r\n\r\nall  should  bear the cost and all should have the  right  to\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the second tier, we have block works. They are\r\n\r\nspecific  to  the  block but of general benefit  to  all  the\r\n\r\nresidents in the block.  And in these instances, because  all\r\n\r\nblocks in the precincts are given the same form of privileges\r\n\r\nand benefits, it could also be argued that there is a general\r\n\r\nbenefit  that stems from them and therefore all  should  vote\r\n\r\nand all should pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then have a third tier of what are called space\r\n\r\nadding   items  which  give  specific  additional  space   to\r\n\r\nindividual  units, and here the voting is done separately  at\r\n\r\nthe  block  level and the residents of each block can  decide\r\n\r\nwhether they wish it, and if they meet a threshold, they  can\r\n\r\nhave that item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has been a very pragmatic and balanced\r\n\r\napproach to our upgrading projects, but the key limitation of\r\n\r\nthis really is when we want to consider a project at the sub-block level, ie, where we want a project which will benefit a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  but not necessarily all units in a  block.   The\r\n\r\nimplementation of such projects will be stymied and  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  a hypothetical exercise.  As my colleague,  Mr\r\n\r\nSeng  Han  Thong,  has pointed out, a case in  point  is  the\r\n\r\nprovision of lifts for segmented 4-room blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inclusion of such lift provisions in the main\r\n\r\nor general programme of HDB which everybody votes on has been\r\n\r\nsuggested by some of the Members, but I would like  to  point\r\n\r\nout  that, in practice, this is not going to work out for two\r\n\r\nreasons.   Firstly,  the cost of such projects  is  unusually\r\n\r\nhigh,  unlike risers or roof repair works, etc.  I have  been\r\n\r\ntold that each new lift well  -  and I speak with some degree\r\n\r\nof  experience,  although I am not a  man  of  the  industry,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  have been involved in some of these  projects   - can cost anything from $1/2-$1 million.  And if you have that\r\n\r\nthree-fold, that is a substantial cost.  And if  you  are  to\r\n\r\nargue  that  this  substantial cost of a  particular  block's\r\n\r\nbenefit  is  to  be borne by the whole, the argument  may  be\r\n\r\nuntenable  and  that may result in the entire  project  being\r\n\r\ndefeated unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also difficult, from what I can see, to conduct a\r\n\r\nvote for this special item like a lift upgrading at the block\r\n\r\nlevel in the way it is carried out for, say, the space adding\r\n\r\nitems.   Because even within a block, there are only specific\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries who directly derive benefit from it.  For those\r\n\r\nwho  know  the  topography of a 4-room segmented  block,  you\r\n\r\nwould  understand  what I am getting at.  Essentially,  if  I\r\n\r\ntake  a 100-unit block, there will be 30 or so units who  are\r\n\r\nalready  benefiting  from some form of  direct  lift  access,\r\n\r\neither  because  the lift stops on their floor  in  front  of\r\n\r\ntheir  doorstep or they are served by a common corridor.   It\r\n\r\nis  the remaining 70-odd units who need this facility but are\r\n\r\ndeprived  of it.  But if you put it to a vote and subject  it\r\n\r\nto  a  75%  test,  I think it is obvious that  the  odds  are\r\n\r\nstacked against this project being carried through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question really is this: how can such improvement\r\n\r\nworks  be  carried out?  The options are, first, as has  been\r\n\r\nsuggested by some Members, a generalised Government programme\r\n\r\nfor lift upgrading fully funded by Government.  That would be\r\n\r\nlike manna from heaven and nobody would object to that.   But\r\n\r\nin  the absence of such largesse, I think we have to look  at\r\n\r\nthe next most pragmatic option, and that really is the nub of\r\n\r\nthis  special  upgrading works that are being proposed.   The\r\n\r\nBill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenhances  flexibility.  It means that, when implementing  the\r\n\r\nproject,  we  can now look at some worthwhile projects  which\r\n\r\nmight  benefit a sub-set of a particular block but  we  still\r\n\r\ndeem it to be worthwhile to endeavour to deliver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it offers choice. The direct beneficiaries can\r\n\r\ndecide  for  themselves: is the price worth the  benefit  and\r\n\r\nthey  vote for it.  If they want it, and enough of them  vote\r\n\r\nfor  it, it will be delivered.  If not, it will not be  done.\r\n\r\nThat  really leads on to the point of equity, ie, only  those\r\n\r\nwho  benefit  will have to pay.  I think it is  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nproposal  and  it has the added advantage that such  projects\r\n\r\ncan  be  bundled into a larger scale MUP project  which  will\r\n\r\nachieve economies of scale and a lowering of cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do share some of the concerns about the implications\r\n\r\nfor  common property which my colleague, Dr Teo Ho  Pin,  has\r\n\r\nraised.   But  there is a spectrum of works involved  in  any\r\n\r\nupgrading,  from those at one end which are very  clearly  of\r\n\r\ngeneral  value  to all residents, to the other extreme  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  those which are of specific value  to  individual\r\n\r\nunits  or blocks.  This lies somewhere in between and I think\r\n\r\nwe have to make some pragmatic choices in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have one concern for the Minister to address, ie,\r\n\r\nhow  do  we safeguard against frivolous proposals with regard\r\n\r\nto these special upgrading works?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of lifts on every floor is a serious\r\n\r\nmatter.   With an ageing population, the need is obvious  and\r\n\r\nwe  ought to make our best effort to deliver this.   But  one\r\n\r\ncan imagine that there might be other less important and more\r\n\r\nfrivolous  requests coming from a sub-set of residents  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular  block.   How does the HDB  and  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development propose to deal with this?  Should there\r\n\r\nbe  some  form  of  criteria, at least  requiring  a  certain\r\n\r\nminimum  percentage or proportion of units in a block  to  be\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries of a project before it can be considered  under\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial provision, or should it be confined to certain  types\r\n\r\nof  works?   I know the Minister has considerable  discretion\r\n\r\nbased  on  the way the Bill is worded, but I would appreciate\r\n\r\nit if he could shed some light on how these safeguards can be\r\n\r\nput in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to commend the Minister for\r\n\r\nintroducing  the  Bill to amend the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nAct.   It  is  indeed very important that the HDB looks  very\r\n\r\nseriously  at the estates which have more elderly population.\r\n\r\nThose  would  be the estates that are going to  benefit  very\r\n\r\nmuch from the special upgrading works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister would appreciate, when residents\r\n\r\nfirst  moved  to these estates, they had very  little  choice\r\n\r\nbecause  the flats were balloted and many of these flats  are\r\n\r\nabout  30  years  old  which require  a  good  face-lift  and\r\n\r\nupgrading.   Many  of the old flats would be benefiting  from\r\n\r\nthe Main Upgrading Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the design issue, many of these\r\n\r\nresidents  have very little hand in the design  because  they\r\n\r\nare  designed  by architects.  When these flats   were  first\r\n\r\nconceived in the planning stage, they were thinking of a very\r\n\r\nvibrant  and  young population that never ages.   That  is  a\r\n\r\nserious problem and many of these places have aged today.   I\r\n\r\nam  glad that the Minister, being the Chairman of the  Inter-Ministerial Committee, has realised that there is a  need  to\r\n\r\nreally provide accessibility to the ageing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what will happen is the problem of affordability.\r\n\r\nIn  many of these old estates, there are the retirees and the\r\n\r\nelderly who are not fully employed and many of them have  low\r\n\r\nincome.   I feel that it is going to be a serious problem  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  unable to take advantage of the special  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks.  It will be a pity that we have a very good objective,\r\n\r\nbut  this objective remains on paper and may not be achieved.\r\n\r\nThat  is  my basic concern.  Knowing that more than  half  of\r\n\r\nthem are going to be retirees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  very  little  income, I would say that  with  the  very\r\n\r\nexorbitant  payment  for  lift upgrading,  it  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for the residents to take advantage of it.  It will\r\n\r\nbe  a  tremendous pity that many of them may have to struggle\r\n\r\nand manage to find access to their flat in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is important is to make it really affordable.\r\n\r\nThe question is: how affordable is affordable?  Many of these\r\n\r\nresidents are going to appreciate what the Minister  will  do\r\n\r\nbecause  each time they press the button, they will  remember\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for enabling them to get access.  If the prices\r\n\r\nare  expensive,  each time they press the  button,  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be very sorry.  They may press the wrong button  and\r\n\r\nit may never get to his notice.  They will be remembering him\r\n\r\nfor  life  too if they cannot really find access.   The  real\r\n\r\nquestion is the question of affordability.  The HDB is one of\r\n\r\nthe  prime movers in making estates accessible.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  a building code which I am sure HDB was one of the prime\r\n\r\nmovers   in   proposing  this  to  make  estates  accessible.\r\n\r\nBuilding codes ensure that buildings are accessible.  I think\r\n\r\nthe  onus  is  on  HDB  to  ensure  that  the  buildings  are\r\n\r\naccessible.  These are common user properties.  Being  common\r\n\r\nuser  properties, it is obviously the role of HDB  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  these  buildings are accessible to  residents,  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are disabled or elderly.  Realising that a large number\r\n\r\nof  them  are going to be the elderly population,  they  will\r\n\r\nthank   the   Minister  if  he  takes  their  interest   into\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest a very low co-payment that will make it\r\n\r\nreally  affordable, and there is no need for a second  ballot\r\n\r\nbecause many of these estates have already undergone the  MUP\r\n\r\nitself.  It is the public and social responsibility of HDB to\r\n\r\nensure  that many of these flats, particularly the  segmented\r\n\r\nblocks where there is a large number of growing elderly, will\r\n\r\nbenefit from the changes that are going to be introduced.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will ensure that the charges  are  really\r\n\r\nwithin the means of the elderly retirees who have very little\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I thank all the Members who have\r\n\r\nsupported this Bill.  I do not think anybody has objected  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  to the idea of having special upgrading  works  in\r\n\r\norder  to  give  the  HDB  more flexibility  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  package.  However, the Members have  made  several\r\n\r\nvery important points which I would like to address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the question of why selective polling and\r\n\r\nwhether  it will destroy the concept of community  living  or\r\n\r\ncollective responsibility, as Dr Teo Ho Pin and other Members\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now.  It is an important point  because  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  collective responsibility,  of  sharing  in  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and the cost of upgrading of common  properties,\r\n\r\nis an important pillar of communal living in HDB estates.  So\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  they  use  the  playground  or  the  Senior\r\n\r\nCitizens' Corner, or even the linkways,  they pay their share\r\n\r\nof  the  cost  of upgrading and of maintaining  these  common\r\n\r\nfacilities.   Indeed,  this  is the  case  for  the  standard\r\n\r\npackage of the Main Upgrading Programme.  It includes many of\r\n\r\nthe  items that were mentioned by the Members, booster pumps,\r\n\r\nSenior  Citizens' Corners, linkways, playgrounds,  etc.   But\r\n\r\nthat  is  the standard package.  Some of the items  that  are\r\n\r\ndesired  by  residents  may not be in the  standard  package.\r\n\r\nThey  are  outside the scope of the standard package  of  the\r\n\r\nMUP.  This  is the reason why the Ministry and  the  HDB,  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  many  of  these requests,  came  up  with  this\r\n\r\nparticular amendment to the Bill to introduce what is  called\r\n\r\n\"special  upgrading works\" in order to give the  HDB  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility to do more, in addition to what is being done  in\r\n\r\nthe standard package and in the space-adding items, ie, to do\r\n\r\nmore for residents during the Main Upgrading Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the common requests on the wish-list of Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament is lift upgrading for those blocks which do not\r\n\r\nmeet the HDB lift upgrading criteria.  Right now, such blocks\r\n\r\nwould not have their lifts upgraded.  The reason why this  is\r\n\r\nso,  we  have  discussed  in this  House  many  times.   Lift\r\n\r\nupgrading is an extremely expensive exercise.  As Mr  Iswaran\r\n\r\npointed  out  just now, to install a new lift shaft  and  new\r\n\r\nlifts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  cost  anything between $500,000 and $1 million or  more.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  are talking about lift upgrading for these  special\r\n\r\nblocks,  those Members who are familiar with the  issue,  who\r\n\r\nhave  such  blocks  in  their constituencies,  the  so-called\r\n\r\nsegmented blocks, would appreciate the exercise.  We are  not\r\n\r\ntalking of just installing one or two additional lift shafts.\r\n\r\nWe  can be talking about three or even more lift shafts.   If\r\n\r\nwe  are talking about three lift shafts, we are talking about\r\n\r\n$3   million  and  dividing  this  across,  say,  70  or  100\r\n\r\nresidents.  That is a lot of money.  We are not just  talking\r\n\r\nabout  one  or  two  blocks.  We are  really  talking  about,\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  whole of Singapore, something  like  900  to\r\n\r\n1,000  blocks. These are the blocks of flats which were built\r\n\r\nbefore  1990  and which were built with this special  design.\r\n\r\nThey  were  popular at that time because there was a  certain\r\n\r\ndegree  of privacy involved in these blocks and quite  a  few\r\n\r\nresidents actually opted for these blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, there are many of these blocks\r\n\r\naround.  They do not meet the lift upgrading criteria set  by\r\n\r\nHDB.   These criteria are put in place in order to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat in embarking on the lift upgrading exercise, there is  a\r\n\r\ncertain financial discipline involved.  As it is already, the\r\n\r\nHDB  has undertaken under the Main Upgrading Programme in the\r\n\r\nstandard  package to upgrade all those blocks which  do  meet\r\n\r\nthe  lift  upgrading criteria.  Here, we  are  talking  about\r\n\r\nsomething like 3,000 over blocks.  As we progress in the Main\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme,  the lifts will  be  upgraded  to  give\r\n\r\ndirect  lift  access to the residents in these 3,000  blocks.\r\n\r\nSo  we are coming back to the issue of what do we do with the\r\n\r\nsegmented  blocks.  We all know it is an extremely  expensive\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time we also realise that the issue of\r\n\r\nmobility  for  the aged is a real problem.  The  IMC  on  the\r\n\r\nAgeing  Population has made this recommendation, as  Mr  Seng\r\n\r\npointed out, that the HDB should retrofit its blocks in order\r\n\r\nto make sure that the aged can grow old graciously in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsitu,  in  other words, to remain where they are in the  flat\r\n\r\nand not have to move out.  HDB, in fact, has already embarked\r\n\r\non  such  an  exercise to retrofit most if  not  all  of  the\r\n\r\nblocks.   As I explained before, there is a certain financial\r\n\r\nconstraint  involved  in trying to upgrade  all  the  blocks.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a certain financial discipline that they  have  to\r\n\r\nobserve,  and  this  upgrading  programme  must  comply  with\r\n\r\ncertain criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the purpose of this particular Amendment Bill really\r\n\r\nis  to  give HDB that flexibility to do more, over and  above\r\n\r\nwhat  is  currently being done under the standard package  of\r\n\r\nthe  MUP.   It allows residents, in consultation  with  their\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament, if they really desire such additional\r\n\r\nworks,  to vote for these special works, like lift upgrading,\r\n\r\nand  by  so  doing,  to  signal  their  intention  and  their\r\n\r\nagreement to co-pay part of that cost.  In other words,  this\r\n\r\nis an additional option for them.  We are not taking anything\r\n\r\naway.  We are saying, \"Look, if you really feel that this  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  then  here is another choice  for  you,  here  is\r\n\r\nanother option.\"  And then once we get past that hurdle,  the\r\n\r\nnext thing we need to do is to work out the mechanics of  it,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  how  do we decide whether to proceed or  not,  what\r\n\r\nconstitutes  majority vote, how do we decide  that  there  is\r\n\r\nthis very strong endorsement, and so on and so forth.  So  we\r\n\r\nhave   for  want  of  a  better  percentage  taken  the  same\r\n\r\npercentage that we do for the other polling exercises that we\r\n\r\nconduct for upgrading programmes.  We use 75% yes vote as  an\r\n\r\nindication of strong support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked why should they pay in the first\r\n\r\nplace.   Mr Ang Mong Seng gave several reasons why it is  not\r\n\r\nfair  to  get  the residents to pay, that it  should  be  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that should be paying for it.  I  think,  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst place, the upgrading package under the MUP is already a\r\n\r\nvery  generous package.  There is a budget per flat for  MUP.\r\n\r\nThe  budget ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 per flat for  MUP,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  whether there is a space-adding item  or  not.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  budget  of $40,000 to $60,000 per  flat  allows  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of work to be done.  There is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  list of works that is required to be done under  the\r\n\r\nstandard package - precinct works, block works, and even some\r\n\r\nworks  within  the flat.  At the last Budget  debate,  I  had\r\n\r\nannounced  the  revised budget for MUP  which  involves  more\r\n\r\nworks  within the flat.  But the total budget is  a  generous\r\n\r\none,  and  the  co-payment by the residents is minimal.   The\r\n\r\nvalue that they get is very much more than what they pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Bill is not about increasing the MUP budget. It\r\n\r\nis  about giving the residents more options during their MUP.\r\n\r\nIt  is  in  a  way  a bonus for those residents  who  benefit\r\n\r\ndirectly  from  the  works.  If we  are  talking  about  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading for segmented flats, as Mr Iswaran will be able  to\r\n\r\ntell  you,  not every resident is going to benefit  from  it.\r\n\r\nThe  lifts  are already there.  They do stop at some  of  the\r\n\r\nfloors.  If we were to ask the residents who already  have  a\r\n\r\nlift  that stops on their floor, whether they would  like  to\r\n\r\nvote  yes for the lift upgrading, I think the answer is quite\r\n\r\nobvious.   So really it is a bonus for residents who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  this benefit today but who will be benefiting  directly\r\n\r\nfrom such works.  Therefore, on the basis of fairness, on the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of equity, it is the residents who are  benefiting\r\n\r\ndirectly  who  should  be  co-sharing  this  cost  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, as I have explained earlier, these works\r\n\r\ndo not come cheap.  They are expensive.  And I think it is  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  test  of whether you really need  such  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks  to be carried out if you are also required to  co-pay.\r\n\r\nIf  we  were to go around and say, \"Look, this is free, would\r\n\r\nyou  like to have it, I do not think we would be here in this\r\n\r\nHouse  debating  this issue today.\"  And I think  such  manna\r\n\r\nfrom  heaven, as the Member has suggested just now, does  not\r\n\r\ncome  very  often.  The fact remains that this is a necessity\r\n\r\nfor  many  residents.   I think we all recognise  that,  many\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament also recognise that.  So,  how  do  we\r\n\r\nwithin  the existing budget, within the amount of  the  money\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  allocated for upgrading, try to  accommodate\r\n\r\nsuch  requests?  In the first place, should we have  such  an\r\n\r\nadditional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noption?  The answer is yes, I think we should.  In the second\r\n\r\nplace, how do we work it, how do we make it happen in such  a\r\n\r\nway  that there is equity?  This is where we have a selective\r\n\r\npolling  and  the requirement for those who benefit  directly\r\n\r\nand who vote yes, pay for it.  And the Government on its part\r\n\r\nwill also allocate part of its MUP budget for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nembarking on these selective upgrading works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong, and I think Dr Vasoo also, asked\r\n\r\nwhether the cost of sharing will be affordable.  Will  it  be\r\n\r\ntoo  high,  therefore making it an academic exercise,  as  it\r\n\r\nwere?   I  mean, what is the point if they cannot afford?   I\r\n\r\nhave two points to make here in response to the Members.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  point is that we will have a fair co-payment  formula.\r\n\r\nWhat  that co-payment formula will be must vary from  project\r\n\r\nto  project, and it depends on the type of work that is going\r\n\r\nto be undertaken.  So I cannot at this point in time tell the\r\n\r\nMembers what that particular percentage will be.  But we will\r\n\r\nmake  it  a point that it will be a fair percentage  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  share will be the majority share.   What  about\r\n\r\nthose who cannot afford to pay?  I think what the Members can\r\n\r\ndo  is  to inform these residents who are either not working,\r\n\r\nwho  are retired, or who are low-income families, that  there\r\n\r\nare  schemes  available in the upgrading package  which  will\r\n\r\nallow them either to defer their payment for up to a year  or\r\n\r\neven  longer  to stretch their repayments, or even  to  avail\r\n\r\nthemselves of schemes whereby they do not have to pay upfront\r\n\r\nat  all, if they can demonstrate that it is not within  their\r\n\r\ncapacity  to pay, but to pay only at the end when  they  sell\r\n\r\noff their flats, if they were to sell off their flats.  So it\r\n\r\nis  really  a deferred payment scheme.  But, of course,  such\r\n\r\nschemes  are  not  available  to  all,  only  for  those  who\r\n\r\ndemonstrate that they cannot afford.  So we will  make  it  a\r\n\r\npoint to make sure that those who cannot afford will be given\r\n\r\nassistance  and  in such a way that they will  not  lose  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to benefit from this scheme.  And we  will  make\r\n\r\nsure that it is not an academic exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also asked about frivolous proposals, what\r\n\r\nhappens  if some residents were to come up and say that  they\r\n\r\nwant something to be done, which he would consider frivolous.\r\n\r\nI think I would entrust this responsibility to the Members of\r\n\r\nParliament.   If  they  feel  that  the  proposal  is   worth\r\n\r\nconsidering and they bring it up to my Ministry, I would take\r\n\r\nit that it has passed the test of the Members of Parliament's\r\n\r\nscrutiny and therefore it cannot be frivolous.  Anything that\r\n\r\ncomes  up  to the Ministry is not frivolous.  But  if  it  is\r\n\r\nfrivolous, then I do not expect it to come up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to address is Mr Tay Beng\r\n\r\nChuan's  point about the home office.  I think  he  may  have\r\n\r\nbeen  mistaken because the amendments do not allow HDB  flats\r\n\r\nto   be   used  for  any  commercial  purpose.    Under   the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneur Home Office scheme, it requires the business to\r\n\r\nregister  with NSTB to meet certain criteria in order  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to register their office in an HDB flat.   This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is different from using the HDB flat for businesses.\r\n\r\nI  think  we  know that many people use their  HDB  flats  to\r\n\r\nconduct  small  businesses.  Some do sewing;  some  do  other\r\n\r\nwork, like making boxes and so on.  There are also others who\r\n\r\nuse  their flats for drafting, like some architects  who  use\r\n\r\ntheir flats for doing their work at home, and many people, of\r\n\r\ncourse, who telecommute, work from home.  So that is quite in\r\n\r\norder.  So long as they do it without creating a nuisance  to\r\n\r\ntheir  neighbours,  HDB does not have any rules  against  it.\r\n\r\nBut   what  the  THO  scheme  does  is  that  it  allows  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur to register his office address as his HDB  flat.\r\n\r\nThat  is the special requirement or special dispensation that\r\n\r\nis   being  given  to  these  start-up  companies.   So  this\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill does not actually open up the scheme  to  all\r\n\r\ncommercial  enterprises but only to those registered  by  the\r\n\r\nNSTB  under the THO scheme.  But having said that, of course,\r\n\r\nwe  will continue to monitor the scheme on an on-going basis,\r\n\r\nand  if  it does not create any disamenities, I see no reason\r\n\r\nwhy we cannot extend the scheme later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also made several other points. I think the\r\n\r\ngeneral point he made was that HDB should actively revise and\r\n\r\nrelax  out-dated rules and regulations.  I do  not  think  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  fair  statement to say  that  HDB's  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  are  so  stringent as to  stifle  creativity  or\r\n\r\ninnovation.   In  fact, I wonder whether the rules  that  are\r\n\r\nenacted  by,  say,  the  management corporations  of  private\r\n\r\nestates, are not as rigorous, if not more so.  For example, I\r\n\r\nknow  that there are many management corporations who do  not\r\n\r\nallow  the flat owners within their estate to renovate  their\r\n\r\nflats, to change their windows or to do other things of  that\r\n\r\nnature,  because  it  may mar the general  outlook  of  those\r\n\r\nparticular  blocks.   I  think it would  be  too  sweeping  a\r\n\r\nstatement  to say that HDB's rules and regulations are  over-stifling.   Take  the three examples that he  mentioned,  for\r\n\r\nexample, parking rules.  Why are there parking rules, why can\r\n\r\nHDB  not  encourage friends and relatives to visit  by,  say,\r\n\r\nwaiving  fees?  This, indeed, is being done.   I  think  most\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament who have made a request on  behalf  of\r\n\r\ntheir   residents  will  find  that  HDB   has   been   quite\r\n\r\naccommodating in this respect.  But there is a certain limit.\r\n\r\nThere are certain times and certain areas where the answer is\r\n\r\nno,  and  the  answer  is  no simply  because  the  residents\r\n\r\nthemselves object.  Why?  Because if it so happens that their\r\n\r\nblock  is next to a neighbourhood centre, on Sunday, all  the\r\n\r\ncustomers  of the shops would come and park their cars  there\r\n\r\nand  shop, and instead of having friends and relatives coming\r\n\r\nto  visit  them,  it would actually be free parking  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the shops in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Members of Parliament put this proposal up, they\r\n\r\nknow   that,  on  the  ground,  there  are  certain  problems\r\n\r\nassociated with just opening it up completely.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason why in some areas there is free parking and some other\r\n\r\nareas, there is not.  So HDB has been accommodating and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  accommodating in such instances.   But  for\r\n\r\nevery   rule   that  they  change,  while  that  benefit   is\r\n\r\nappreciated  by  one group, at the same time,  another  group\r\n\r\nwould be quite against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On flower boxes and other safety features, HDB informed\r\n\r\nme,  when I was looking at the killer litter issue, that they\r\n\r\nin  fact  did  incorporate flower troughs in  the  design  of\r\n\r\nseveral  blocks  of  flats in Pasir Ris  and  Queenstown.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that was about five years ago.  It was  one  of  the\r\n\r\ndesign  innovations that HDB embarks upon on a regular basis,\r\n\r\narising again out of requests by some residents who say  that\r\n\r\nthey  would like to plant flowers.  But five years  down  the\r\n\r\nroad,  they have gone back to revisit the situation and  they\r\n\r\nfind  that, lo and behold, instead of flowers in the troughs,\r\n\r\nyou  have all sorts of other stuff in the troughs.  So it  is\r\n\r\nbeing  used for rubbish disposal, for storage, for  anything,\r\n\r\nbut  putting  flowers.  So another well-meaning gesture  goes\r\n\r\ndown  the drain.  I do not think we should go and start  this\r\n\r\nprocess  all  over again.  But what really worried  me  about\r\n\r\nthat  particular design innovation was not so much  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they were using it to put rubbish, but that it could  be\r\n\r\na receptacle for breeding mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of dengue fever and breeding of Aedes\r\n\r\nmosquitoes is still a big problem for high rise estates,  and\r\n\r\nit  has  not  disappeared.  It is still  there.   People  are\r\n\r\ncareless,  people are either ignorant or they just could  not\r\n\r\ncare  less.   But the Environment Ministry still  has  to  go\r\n\r\naround  putting  pressure on town councils  to  keep  chasing\r\n\r\nresidents  to  make  sure that they do not breed  mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nAnd dengue fever is not a laughing matter.  Every year, there\r\n\r\nare  people  who  die from dengue fever and  there  are  many\r\n\r\nothers who suffer from dengue fever and get very ill.   So  I\r\n\r\nhave  told HDB that if they solve the problem, make sure that\r\n\r\nthey do not create other problems.  When people suggest these\r\n\r\nthings,  it may appear reasonable at first glance, but  there\r\n\r\nare  many other implications involved, which I think need  to\r\n\r\nbe thought through carefully before we implement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there was one last point he made about whether,\r\n\r\nin  the  special upgrading works, we are going to  compensate\r\n\r\nthem if an acquisition is involved.  The answer categorically\r\n\r\nis no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  special  upgrading works do not involve any acquisition.\r\n\r\nIt is just a matter of lift upgrading or other types of works\r\n\r\nwhich  would require selective groups of residents  to  vote.\r\n\r\nThere is no question about Government acquiring the flats for\r\n\r\nany purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think I have answered all the questions\r\n\r\nthat  have  been raised.  I thank the Members once again  for\r\n\r\ntheir support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to clarify two\r\n\r\npoints  with the Minister?  What is the rationale for  making\r\n\r\nthe town councils pay for the special upgrading works?  Under\r\n\r\nthe  statutory duties of the Town Councils, we are only asked\r\n\r\nto  maintain  the common property.  Sir, in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nopposition  town councils, we do not receive  any  CIPC  fund\r\n\r\nand,  if  we  are made to pay more contributions through  all\r\n\r\nthese  upgrading works, we will be at a disadvantage compared\r\n\r\nto the PAP-controlled town councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I would like to raise with the\r\n\r\nMinister is that, at first, I was quite elated that they  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  allow HDB flats to be used for business  purposes.\r\n\r\nBut  now,  as  it  is,  it is only confined  to  IT  start-up\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Sir,  I  am wondering whether  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nwilling  to expand this usage of HDB flats to other  business\r\n\r\nactivities  as  long as they do not create a nuisance.   Sir,\r\n\r\n80%  or more of Singaporeans are living in HDB flats.  At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  all  these  flats are only for residential  purposes\r\n\r\nand,  as  such, they are only used for consumption.   If  you\r\n\r\nallow them to be used for other business purposes, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  converted  to productive use.  Our national income  would\r\n\r\nincrease  significantly if these flats  were  allowed  to  be\r\n\r\nconverted  for business use as long as they do not  create  a\r\n\r\nnuisance.  Like in Hong Kong and other places, they have been\r\n\r\nused  for  making  artificial flowers,  assembling  of  wrist\r\n\r\nwatches and taking parts from the government factories to  do\r\n\r\nthem at home.  There are so many uses which are being carried\r\n\r\nout.  It will be beneficial to Singapore economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Let me take the easy one first. Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  is under the wrong impression that town councils  have\r\n\r\nto pay for the special upgrading works.  No, they do not have\r\n\r\nto  pay.  The special upgrading works are special works which\r\n\r\nare  over and above the existing standard package of the MUP.\r\n\r\nTown councils are not involved in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the THO scheme is concerned, whether it should\r\n\r\nbe expanded to other activities, in my answer just now, I did\r\n\r\nallude  to  the  fact that this is already being  done.   HDB\r\n\r\nallows  for  other activities, like allowing people  to  work\r\n\r\nfrom  home  if  they are using their phone,  fax  and  modem,\r\n\r\nwhether  they are architects or whether they are draughtsmen,\r\n\r\nthat  is  perfectly all right.  And indeed,  there  are  many\r\n\r\nother activities that are carried out in the HDB flats which,\r\n\r\nso  long  as  they do not cause nuisance to their neighbours,\r\n\r\nare not disallowed.  If you go around your block visits, from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time, you will come across homes where  they  bring\r\n\r\nback work to do, whether it is sewing, or other small cottage\r\n\r\ntype industries to assembly at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhome.  That is already practised and HDB does not say  no  to\r\n\r\nthat.   The only distinction that they make is that when  you\r\n\r\nindulge in such activities, you do not cause nuisance to your\r\n\r\nneighbours.  If your neighbours find that you are operating a\r\n\r\nfactory  in your flat, no matter how productive they are,  we\r\n\r\nwill come down on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. \"\r\n\r\n- [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eleven Minutes past Two o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
