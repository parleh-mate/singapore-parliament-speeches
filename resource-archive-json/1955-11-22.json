M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to substitute a new\r\n\r\nscale of estate duty for the scale contained in the\r\n\r\nSecond  Schedule  to  the  Estate  Duty  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nChapter  227,  as  amended  by  the  Estate  Duties\r\n\r\n(Increase of Rates) Ordinance, 1946.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained the reasons why it is\r\n\r\nconsidered  desirable to introduce this new  scale,\r\n\r\nand I do not think that I need say anything further\r\n\r\nin this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main points about the new scale\r\n\r\nto  which I invite attention. It exempts estates of\r\n\r\nunder  $10,000 from duty. It makes  use  of  a  new\r\n\r\nmethod  of  calculating duty,  and  of  course,  it\r\n\r\nincreases  the  rate  of duty on  estates  of  over\r\n\r\n$10,000. Hitherto, only estates of under $1,000 have\r\n\r\nbeen  exempted from payment of duty. This level  of\r\n\r\nexemption is low. A considerable number of  estates\r\n\r\nfall  within  the  limits  of  $1,000  to  $10,000,\r\n\r\nperhaps  rather  more than a third of  all  estates\r\n\r\nassessed  for duty in a normal year. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  amount  of  duty collected  from  these\r\n\r\nestates  is small, and in no way commensurate  with\r\n\r\nthe  time and labour involved in collecting it. For\r\n\r\nexample, the 400 estates within these limits, which\r\n\r\nwere   assessed  in  1954  yielded  no  more  than\r\n\r\n$23,000. The staff of the Estate Duty Office is not\r\n\r\nlarge,  and  clearly the time and labour  spent  on\r\n\r\nassessing  these  small estates  could,  with  much\r\n\r\ngreater advantage, be devoted to larger estates. In\r\n\r\nthe circumstances, it has been decided to raise the\r\n\r\nlevel of exemption to $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same form of graduated scale as is used in\r\n\r\nincome  tax has been adopted. This gives  a  smooth\r\n\r\ncurve  in  the  progression in the  graduations  of\r\n\r\nduty,  avoids  steps  and  obviates  the  need  for\r\n\r\nspecial  provisions for marginal relief. The  first\r\n\r\ntwo   characteristics  will   be   seen   from   an\r\n\r\nexamination  of the comparative table  attached  to\r\n\r\nthe   Bill.  Examples  will  illustrate  the  third\r\n\r\ncharacteristic. The existing rate  of  duty  on  an\r\n\r\nestate  of  exactly $1 million is 23 per cent.  The\r\n\r\nrate of duty on an estate exceeding $1 million  but\r\n\r\nless than $1.2 million is 25 per cent. Duty on  an\r\n\r\nestate  of exactly $1 million is $230,000. Duty  on\r\n\r\nan  estate of $1,000,001 is $250,000.25.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, one dollar makes a difference of $20,000  in\r\n\r\nduty. Therefore, in this particular section of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  scale, it is well worthwhile to surrender\r\n\r\nestate  up to about $26,000 in order to retain  the\r\n\r\nlower  rate  of duty. For example, the duty  on  an\r\n\r\nestate of $1,025,000 at 25 per cent is $256,250. If\r\n\r\nthe  executor decides to surrender estate,  he  can\r\n\r\npay  23  per cent on $1 million, which is $230,000,\r\n\r\nsurrender $25,000 and still be better off by  about\r\n\r\n$1,000  than he would have been if he had  accepted\r\n\r\ntaxation at 25 per cent. On the other hand, if  the\r\n\r\nestate is $1,030,000, it pays to pay tax at 25  per\r\n\r\ncent.  The  new form of graduated scale avoids  all\r\n\r\nthese  anomalies.  The rate of tax  rises  smoothly\r\n\r\nwithout sudden jumps. For example, the duty  on  an\r\n\r\nestate  of $1 million is $328,250. The duty  on  an\r\n\r\nestate of $1,000,001 is $328,250.50 and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates of duty proposed are generally higher\r\n\r\nthan   the  existing  rates.  In  this  connection,\r\n\r\nattention is invited not to the Schedule but to the\r\n\r\ncomparative table attached for information  to  the\r\n\r\nBill.  This  table shows the effective rates  under\r\n\r\nthe  new  scale  by  comparison with  the  existing\r\n\r\nrates.  The  effective rate is  the  rate  obtained\r\n\r\nafter  allowing for exemption on the first $10,000.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  on  an estate of $25,000  the  first\r\n\r\n$10,000  would  be  exempt from tax  and  the  next\r\n\r\n$15,000  would be taxed at 5 per cent.  This  would\r\n\r\nyield  $750.  The effect in rate  of  tax  on  this\r\n\r\nestate is therefore $750 over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n$25,000  multiplied by 100 equals 3  per  cent.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  seen that the effective rate of  the  new\r\n\r\nscale diverges increasingly from the existing scale\r\n\r\nuntil, on estates of $5 millions, there is\r\n\r\na difference of about 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the second paragraph of the\r\n\r\nexplanatory note it is stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In effect under the proposed new scale the\r\n\r\ngraduations  rise on a large number of small  steps\r\n\r\nin  place of a smaller number of large steps  under\r\n\r\nthe old scale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have here the Estate Duties (Increase\r\n\r\nof   Rates)  Ordinance,  1946,  which  includes   a\r\n\r\nschedule  of rates effective from the  4th  day  of\r\n\r\nJuly,  1941.  The scale of duty rises in  27  steps,\r\n\r\ncovering one per cent on $5,000 to 40 per  cent  on\r\n\r\n$5  millions. In the new Bill the scale  starts  on\r\n\r\nestates at $10,000 and ends at 60 per cent on  that\r\n\r\npart  of  an  estate exceeding $4  millions  in  14\r\n\r\nstages.  It  would seem, therefore, that  the  last\r\n\r\nsentence  of paragraph two of the explanatory  note\r\n\r\nshould read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In effect under the proposed new scale the\r\n\r\ngraduations  rise  on a smaller  number  of  larger\r\n\r\nsteps  in place of a larger number of smaller steps\r\n\r\nunder the old scale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to exempt estates of less than\r\n\r\n$10,000   appears  to  be  a  step  in  the   right\r\n\r\ndirection,  but hon. Members may be  interested  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  in the United Kingdom exemption  limits\r\n\r\nsince the war have been steadily increased until in\r\n\r\nthe  last  Budget the figure was raised to  \u00a33,000,\r\n\r\nthat   is  approximately  $26,000.  Moreover,   the\r\n\r\neffective  rate of duty on estates of $130,000  and\r\n\r\nunder  will now be higher than the rate of duty  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom. That is just as  a  point  of\r\n\r\ninterest. But then there is a slight anomaly, to my\r\n\r\nmind, with regard to the new Schedule. For example,\r\n\r\nunder  the old scale an estate of $1,000 paid  duty\r\n\r\nat one cent. Now supposing it were $1,001, the duty\r\n\r\npaid would be $10.01.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will take it a step further. Under the new\r\n\r\nscale an estate of $10,001 will be liable for  duty\r\n\r\nat five per cent on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  dollar  only,  because the  first  $10,000  is\r\n\r\nexempt  from  duty. Well, assuming that  the  basic\r\n\r\ncost   of   a   collection,  for  example,   in   a\r\n\r\nstraightforward  estate is  perhaps  $30 - I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow, but just call it $30 - it would seem economical\r\n\r\nto  exempt estates not exceeding, say, $10,599 with\r\n\r\nthe  proviso  that for estates in  excess  of  this\r\n\r\nfigure  the  duty shall be exigible on any  sum  in\r\n\r\nexcess  of $10,000, so that, in fact, the  proposed\r\n\r\nscale still operates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  here again the Labour Front is on very  solid\r\n\r\nground. Even the hon. Mr Sutherland feels that the\r\n\r\nmove to increase estate duty is a move in the right\r\n\r\ndirection,  although  he  feels  that  estate  duty\r\n\r\nshould   be   exempted  up  to   the   amount   the\r\n\r\nConservative  Government of  Britain  allowed  last\r\n\r\nyear.  On  estates not exceeding \u00a33,000, no  estate\r\n\r\nduty  is paid. But then Mr Sutherland did not tell\r\n\r\nthe  House that in England duty on estates of about\r\n\r\n\u00a31  million  goes  up  to 80 per  cent,  of  three-\r\n\r\nquarters  to  \u00a31  million 75 per cent,  of  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  to  three-quarter million  pounds  70  per\r\n\r\ncent, and so it tapers down to one per cent between\r\n\r\n\u00a33,000 and \u00a34,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hesitate to give the Hon. the Minister for\r\n\r\nTransport   a  lecture  on  egalitarian   societies\r\n\r\nbecause obviously he believes such ideas to be old-\r\n\r\nfashioned. He believes that we should all be  equal\r\n\r\nin  a  Socialist  democracy but  that  some  people\r\n\r\nshould  be more equal than others. Perhaps that  is\r\n\r\nthe way it ought to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even he will agree with us that estate duty\r\n\r\nis  one  of those forms of taxation which  can  be\r\n\r\nused  deliberately  to counter-balance  the  unjust\r\n\r\ndistribution    of   wealth   and    prevent    its\r\n\r\nperpetuation.  The primary purpose of  a  Socialist\r\n\r\ntaxation  policy is to bring about a redistribution\r\n\r\nof  wealth. You take the money from the \"haves\" and\r\n\r\nthen you spend it on your education, on your public\r\n\r\nservices,  and on your social welfare, and  thereby\r\n\r\ngive  it  to  the  have-nots. You have  this  added\r\n\r\nadvantage  in  that you really do not hurt  anybody\r\n\r\nbecause  you have really taken it from no one.  All\r\n\r\nyou have taken away from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sons and heirs and successors is not money, but\r\n\r\njust  the hope of a succeeding to money. That might\r\n\r\nbe  painful  for a week or two after the  will  has\r\n\r\nbeen  read  and duties have to be paid, but  it  is\r\n\r\ncertainly less painful than if we were to impose  a\r\n\r\ncapital  levy  while  the  man  who  has  made  his\r\n\r\nmillions is still alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we commend the increase which the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front Government has imposed, a step  taken\r\n\r\nindependently of the Federation, and while  we  are\r\n\r\nconfident  that  the Federation will  be  following\r\n\r\nsuit  in  the  very near future, we feel  that  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front Government should compare these tables\r\n\r\nwith   those   obtaining  in   other   Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries.    These   places   have    Conservative\r\n\r\ngovernments,   not  dedicated  to   the   Socialist\r\n\r\nprinciple, but dedicated to the principle  of  what\r\n\r\nthey now call a property-owning democracy: in other\r\n\r\nwords, we will each have a bit of property, but  if\r\n\r\nmy father has a lot of property, than I will have a\r\n\r\nlot more than you have. If a comparative table were\r\n\r\nmade  of  estate  duties in  all  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries,    where    there    are    Conservative\r\n\r\ngovernments,  I  think the Labour Front  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  their increases are modest and moderate.

The purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  motion  is  to  confirm  these  increases  by\r\n\r\nresolution  under  section 3  (1)  of  the  Liquors\r\n\r\nRevenue Ordinance within the 14 days prescribed  in\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained on a previous occasion\r\n\r\nwhy   these   increases  in  customs   duties   are\r\n\r\nnecessary,  and I do not think I need say  anything\r\n\r\nfurther  on this point. The main increases  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full duty on bottled whisky and brandy has\r\n\r\nbeen  increased by $12 per gallon, that  is,  to  a\r\n\r\nfigure  of $4 a gallon above the present Federation\r\n\r\nlevel.  This  will increase the  duty  on  a  quart\r\n\r\nbottle  by  $2.  The preferential duty  on  bottled\r\n\r\nbrandy   has  been  increased  by  a  corresponding\r\n\r\namount. It is considered that these two commodities\r\n\r\ncan  take  these substantial increases without  any\r\n\r\nmarked or lasting effect on consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import duty on samsu was raised by $4 per\r\n\r\ngallon to $31 per gallon. The excise duty has  been\r\n\r\nraised  by  $3 per gallon. Here again,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nthought that these increases in duty will have  any\r\n\r\nmarked or prolonged effect on consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferential duty on still wines has been\r\n\r\nraised  to  Federation levels, and  the  full  duty\r\n\r\nraised   in   such   a   way  that   the   existing\r\n\r\ndifferentials are maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full, preferential and excise duties on beer,\r\n\r\nale  and stout, etc., have been increased by  $1.20\r\n\r\nper gallon to the Federation level. These increases\r\n\r\nwill increase the duty on a pint and a quart bottle\r\n\r\nby  10  cents  and  20  cents respectively.

One does not need to have much wealth to  be\r\n\r\nable  to afford it. I think the time will come very\r\n\r\nsoon  when  we should rescue the less strong-willed\r\n\r\nmembers  of  our  population from such  an  unhappy\r\n\r\nstate by taking excessive smoking and drinking  out\r\n\r\nof  their  reach. We shall support  the  Government\r\n\r\nevery  time  it comes with a proposal  to  step  up\r\n\r\ntaxation  on  these commodities. It is an  accepted\r\n\r\nmethod of taxation in all civilised countries where\r\n\r\nthey  govern a country, not just hold the ring  for\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise, where they govern the  country\r\n\r\nand  not  just keep law and order. These  are  the\r\n\r\naccepted techniques of taxation, and the Government\r\n\r\nshould not have the slightest doubt that they would\r\n\r\nget full support from the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

There should be a further  proviso.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  intention that we  all  have  is  quite\r\n\r\nclear. The workman shall be entitled, if he is  ill\r\n\r\nand  if he gets a medical certificate for it, to  a\r\n\r\nminimum of 28 days. The maximum may be whatever  is\r\n\r\nagreed between him and his employer. If he is  sick\r\n\r\nfor  28 days, no trouble arises. If he is sick  for\r\n\r\n29  days, he will get at least 28 days, but he will\r\n\r\nget 29 days if his agreement with his employer says\r\n\r\n30 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D.

But if there is a contract between\r\n\r\nan employer and the union to give six weeks, then it\r\n\r\nis not affected by the provisions of this section. I\r\n\r\ndo not know if that is what the hon.

Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will remember that at the Assembly sitting\r\n\r\non  the 29th of June, a question was asked of  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Health. (Mr A. J. Braga) as\r\n\r\nto  what  Government's policy was  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nfamily planning. He replied that Government had no\r\n\r\npolicy in regard to family planning. He also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  that  as the matter was a controversial  one\r\n\r\nand  affected the conscience and religious beliefs\r\n\r\nof  individual Members, it would be open  to  each\r\n\r\nand every one to vote according to his conscience.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I think this is the appropriate time  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, my grand-parents were Roman\r\n\r\nCatholics. My parents were Roman Catholics. I am a\r\n\r\nRoman  Catholic. So is everyone at home,  and  in\r\n\r\nthis  case  I think I am qualified  to  say  that\r\n\r\nRoman   Catholics  are  strongly  against   family\r\n\r\nplanning and also against the use of public funds,\r\n\r\nto  which they are contributors as tax-payers,  for\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  and birth control.  The  use  of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives or any method of birth  control  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  religious  ethics  of  Muslims.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there will be a small minority who  think\r\n\r\nthat  it is not sinful, but I firmly believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  the Muslims  are  against  such\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

I\r\n\r\nthink it would be wrong of Government to do such a\r\n\r\nthing. We should also remember that we should  not\r\n\r\ndisregard the wishes of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, Sir, I had hoped that I would  not  have\r\n\r\nto  intervene in this debate except to say that on\r\n\r\nthe  Government side there will be no question  of\r\n\r\nthe  Whip  being used. The matter is going  to  be\r\n\r\nleft, in so far as we are concerned, entirely to a\r\n\r\nfree  vote,  according  to the  feelings  and  the\r\n\r\nconscience of the individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do feel very strongly about the few remarks\r\n\r\nmade by the Member for Bukit Panjang, and I deeply\r\n\r\nregret  it  and I am more than a little distressed\r\n\r\nthat in this Assembly, composed of re-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresentatives  of people of many creeds  and  many\r\n\r\nraces,  the  question  of religion  and  religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs  should  be  made  to  impinge  upon   our\r\n\r\ndeliberations, and that there should be an  effort\r\n\r\nand  a suggestion that any one creed should impose\r\n\r\nits  will upon the country as a whole. That  is  a\r\n\r\nterrifying  thought, Sir. I  had  hoped  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Panjang would have recognised and\r\n\r\nappreciated  the  religious  tolerance   in   this\r\n\r\ncountry,  exemplified particularly  by  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to follow the lines indicated by the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Bukit  Panjang,  my  Ministry,   for\r\n\r\nexample, would have to cease to give assistance to\r\n\r\nfarmers in breeding better pork for the market. We\r\n\r\nwould,  in  fact, have to prohibit  pigs  entirely\r\n\r\nfrom  the  island in order to support  the  theory\r\n\r\nthat  public money should not be spent in  respect\r\n\r\nof   an  item  which  offends  a  section  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity; and certainly the existence of pigs and\r\n\r\nthe eating of pork offend the Muslim community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would, Sir, have to refrain from spending\r\n\r\nmoney on the veterinary service which looks after\r\n\r\nthe canine population of this territory. Maybe  we\r\n\r\nshould  have to go further and put an end  to  the\r\n\r\nexistence of dogs on this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay community have shown a tolerance and an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the position, which is an example\r\n\r\nto all other communities. They have shown courtesy\r\n\r\ntowards   others'  views  and  they   have   shown\r\n\r\nconsideration for others' customs; and one can but\r\n\r\nask  that a community, that is supposed to be  far\r\n\r\nmore  highly developed, should at least  show  the\r\n\r\nsame courtesy and the same consideration for other\r\n\r\nsections of the community. It is a very frightening\r\n\r\nthing,  Sir, that we should in this Assembly  have\r\n\r\nreligious  intolerance  and  religious  domination\r\n\r\nintroduced.  I  have  very  many  Roman   Catholic\r\n\r\nfriends.  I  have the highest regard for  them.  I\r\n\r\nhave  in  the  Council  of Ministers,  Sir,  Roman\r\n\r\nCatholics and we have discussed this matter not on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of religious feelings but on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  individual views and individual conscience. It\r\n\r\nhas been fully recognised that there can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  question  of  any single religion  seeking  to\r\n\r\ndominate  the  country  with  its  own  particular\r\n\r\ntheology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this: I have the deepest\r\n\r\nregard   for  religion  as  the  first  and   most\r\n\r\nimportant  civilising factor  in  the  history  of\r\n\r\nhumanity - warm religion that understands the  human\r\n\r\nbeing's needs and seeks to guide a human being  to\r\n\r\na  better  way of life. I cede to no one,  however\r\n\r\nreligious  he  may  be,  in  my  respect  for  the\r\n\r\ncivilising  influence of religion, but  I  do  ask\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  to  recognise the fact  that  often\r\n\r\nreligions  in  certain  aspects  degenerate   into\r\n\r\nnothing but sterile theology whose baneful  edicts\r\n\r\ncan but do harm to human relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Government is giving an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  debate  what many consider to be a  very  real\r\n\r\nneed.  People of all religions, Sir, not excluding\r\n\r\nthe  religions, which the Member for Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nhas mentioned, have been to the eleven clinics  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Family Planning Association.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  are  wealthy do not have to go to the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Association. They go to their own medical\r\n\r\nadvisers. The rich do not need the Family Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation. They have got their own doctors. What\r\n\r\nGovernment seeks to do, in giving $85,000 out of a\r\n\r\ntotal  Budget  of about $150,000  to  this  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association, is to assist the very  poor\r\n\r\namongst us who may wish guidance in planning their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  There  is  no  question  of  compelling\r\n\r\nanybody.  There  is  no  question  of  seeking  to\r\n\r\nattract anybody to a particular doctrine. There is\r\n\r\nno  question  in our minds of seeking to  diminish\r\n\r\nthe  increase of population. We have faith in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  and  we  do  not  fear  the  increase  of\r\n\r\npopulation;  but we do say that where the  wealthy\r\n\r\nhave an opportunity to get this advice and to  get\r\n\r\nthis  assistance,  it  is  our  duty  to  give  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to the poor to have the same advice if\r\n\r\nthey should so wish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intervene early in this debate to express the\r\n\r\nsincere hope, the intense desire, the anxiety that\r\n\r\nthere  should no more during the remaining  stages\r\n\r\nof this debate on this particular question ever be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmentioned  the religious aspect, and that  Members\r\n\r\nshould  bear  in  mind the question  of  religious\r\n\r\ntolerance to their fellow human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to support the amendment moved by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Panjang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand that we are living it a world\r\n\r\ndominated  by  certain economic  factors  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, it is a custom nowadays largely to adopt a\r\n\r\nmaterialistic attitude towards life. The real  and\r\n\r\nthe  selfish idea of family planning is  that,  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  fewer people around the  table,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be much to eat. Of course, it will be argued\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore cannot support a larger population\r\n\r\nthan  it  does at present. So also, it might  have\r\n\r\nbeen  argued in other capitals of the world,  but,\r\n\r\nas  their  population grows, those  capitals  have\r\n\r\nadapted  themselves and have tried  to  set  their\r\n\r\neconomic house in order. So also will we  be  able\r\n\r\nto  do  this when we come face to face  with  such\r\n\r\nproblems.  Nothing  could be, in  my  opinion,  so\r\n\r\nshort-sighted  as  the  Government  provision  for\r\n\r\nfamily planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that those who advocate family planning\r\n\r\nknow, in their heart of hearts, that this is not a\r\n\r\nsolution  to the problem. It is only running  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the problem, and those Assemblymen  who  are\r\n\r\ngoing to support family planning are supporting an\r\n\r\nissue  equivalent to the slow slaying of a  rising\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H.

It seeks,  for  one\r\n\r\nthing,  to prevent coming into this world children\r\n\r\nwho  might not be properly looked after,  properly\r\n\r\nfed,  and properly brought up. For another  thing,\r\n\r\nit seeks to space the coming of children into this\r\n\r\nworld  according  to the financial  means  of  the\r\n\r\nparents.  It  therefore benefits both the  parents\r\n\r\nand the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its work being of a negative nature, it is not\r\n\r\neasy  for this Association to prove to you how many\r\n\r\nunwanted  children have been prevented from  coming\r\n\r\ninto  this world. It would require much longer time\r\n\r\nto be able to judge their success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Association offers its assistance\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  to all those who need such assistance.\r\n\r\nIt  compels  no woman or her husband  to  seek  the\r\n\r\nassistance it is willing to give. Many  of  us  who\r\n\r\nare  not  mental  cases have not  objected  to  the\r\n\r\namount  of  money that has been spent and  will  be\r\n\r\nspent   every   year  on  Woodbridge  Hospital.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore do not see why public revenue should  not\r\n\r\nbe  spent  on  the  work  of  the  Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation even by those who object to the use  of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives and other forms of prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the record supplied to me by this\r\n\r\nAssociation, it seems that in 1954 it had  assisted\r\n\r\n9,000  women, and assuming that that number remains\r\n\r\nthe  same, $85,000 a year would mean spending  less\r\n\r\nthan $10 per person to help such a person either to\r\n\r\nprevent  or to space the period of children  coming\r\n\r\ninto  this world to their happiness and to the good\r\n\r\nof Singapore as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it\r\n\r\nmight  be  thought  that, as the  oldest  unmarried\r\n\r\nMember  of  the House, my interest in this  subject\r\n\r\nwould  be  academic but I find  that  I  cannot  be\r\n\r\nneutral  as  I  have  quite decided  views  on  the\r\n\r\nmatter. I may claim, however, to put forward what I\r\n\r\nthink to be a truly objective opinion because of my\r\n\r\nsingle - some people call it - blessed state, and also,\r\n\r\nSir,  because I do not belong to any religious sect\r\n\r\nwhich expressly forbids family planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received, as I presume all hon.\r\n\r\nMembers have, a memorandum from a certain group  of\r\n\r\npeople enclosing their views on family planning. It\r\n\r\nis a document containing many interesting, if to my\r\n\r\nmind  specious, arguments, but the  main  theme  is\r\n\r\nthat  birth  control is unnatural.  The  memorandum\r\n\r\nthen reminds us that the word \"nature\" has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseveral meanings, but in this case is used  in  the\r\n\r\nethical  sense. \"Birth control\", it says,  \"is  the\r\n\r\ndeliberate  frustration of a function which  nature\r\n\r\nclearly intended for an important specific end.\"  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  I  cannot accept the argument.  Man  is\r\n\r\nalways  interfering with nature, taming nature  and\r\n\r\nbending  nature to his will, and if we did  nothing\r\n\r\ncontrary  to nature, we would presumably  allow  no\r\n\r\nsurgeon  to  use a knife, and shaving,  of  course,\r\n\r\nwould be quite out of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would emphasise that we should\r\n\r\nall  respect  the opinions of those who  object  to\r\n\r\nfamily planning on religious grounds, just as we do\r\n\r\nthe  opinions of those Indian races whose hair  has\r\n\r\nnever  known a scissors nor face a razor. For those\r\n\r\npeople  who object to family planning on  religious\r\n\r\ngrounds  or  on any grounds at all - incidentally,  I\r\n\r\nmay   say   that  the  memorandum  lists   a   most\r\n\r\nfrightening  number  of diseases  which  can  arise\r\n\r\nthrough the use of contraceptives - all they have  to\r\n\r\ndo is to have nothing to do with it. But the reason\r\n\r\nfor  this  debate  is surely the  dog-in-the-manger\r\n\r\nattitude of these very people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memorandum to which I have just referred\r\n\r\nurges the Members of this Assembly not to force the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  their organisations to contribute  tax\r\n\r\nmoney   against  their  conscience  to  the  F.P.A.\r\n\r\nprogramme and thus jeopardise the respect of  their\r\n\r\nelectors.  Well, Sir, I have not in any  case  been\r\n\r\nelected,  and  so  I  can speak quite  freely;  but\r\n\r\nsomebody's conscience must always be worried by the\r\n\r\nway  Government money is spent and  I  cannot  take\r\n\r\nthis plea too seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the organisation to which I have referred\r\n\r\nmakes  light  of  the fact that in 20  years'  time\r\n\r\nSingapore may have a population of two million. \"So\r\n\r\nwhat!\" they say, \"many other cities have more  than\r\n\r\nthis,  and do not think so badly of it.\" Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nmay I, with your permission, read to the Assembly a\r\n\r\nfew   sentences  from  an  extract  of  the   Joint\r\n\r\nCommittee  appointed  by  the  two  Houses  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislature  to  examine  the  question  of   over-population in Barbados and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  make  recommendations for  dealing  with  this problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The population at the end of 1961 has been\r\n\r\nestimated  at  255,600, or 1,540 per square  mile,\r\n\r\none  of the densest in the world. The actual  rate\r\n\r\nof increase has so far worked out in excess of the\r\n\r\nestimate. The Committee takes a most serious  view\r\n\r\nof  these staggering figures and urges that  steps\r\n\r\nbe   taken  with  the  least  possible  delay   to\r\n\r\nalleviate  the situation. It points  out  that  if\r\n\r\nearly  action is not taken, the result must be  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly   lower  standard  of   living   with\r\n\r\nconsequent   misery   for  everyone.   Among   the\r\n\r\nimplications of over-population is the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  services,  such  as  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital,  the water supply and schools,  are  all\r\n\r\ninadequate  and  are  being or  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nenlarged  at  a  tremendous  first  cost  and   an\r\n\r\nincreasing  recurrent  cost  that  is  beyond  the\r\n\r\neconomic  resources of the island. Another  effect\r\n\r\nis  unemployment and under-employment. There is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of both of these evils at the  present\r\n\r\ntime, and they will become progressively worse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then finally, the Address of His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe  Governor  at  the  opening  of  the  Barbados\r\n\r\nLegislative session, 1954/55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My Government believes that the overpopulation\r\n\r\nproblem  must be approached not only  through  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of local resources but  also  through\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  of  planned parenthood  among  the\r\n\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, there is something of an analogy\r\n\r\nhere  for  Singapore  in that  our  population  is\r\n\r\nincreasing at the rate of three per cent per annum\r\n\r\ncumulatively,   and  with  each  succeeding   year\r\n\r\nGovernment's task in providing education, medical,\r\n\r\nhousing, social and other services becomes one  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  magnitude. Even the World  Bank,  that\r\n\r\naugust  body which visited Malaya recently,  urged\r\n\r\nGovernment  support for public and private  bodies\r\n\r\nto adopt family planning in the long run interests\r\n\r\nof the Malayan people and their welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it must be obvious to anyone with an\r\n\r\nelementary    knowledge   of   mathematics    that\r\n\r\npopulation   increases   in   some   sort   of   a\r\n\r\nprogression,  and  that with higher  standards  of\r\n\r\nliving  and the technique of preventive  medicine,\r\n\r\nthe rate of infant mortality, for instance, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlikely  to be reduced, and so on. Where will  that\r\n\r\nlead  us in 50 years', 30 years' or even 20 years'\r\n\r\ntime?  Well,  it may be that man's fecundity  will\r\n\r\ndiminish, but I should not bank on that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there cannot be a soul in this House who\r\n\r\ndoes not shrink in horror from the thought of  war\r\n\r\ninvolving  nuclear  weapons; but,  of  course,  if\r\n\r\nthese  weapons  were  used, they  would  certainly\r\n\r\ndestroy the destroyers as well as the victims, and\r\n\r\nthe  chances are that they will never be so  used.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, they may be even turned to man's use.  A\r\n\r\nfar  greater problem, in my humble opinion, is the\r\n\r\nuncontrolled  growth of population, especially  in\r\n\r\nthose Asian countries whose economies are, in  any\r\n\r\ncase,  non-viable. Can anyone  deny  that  in  the\r\n\r\nlower   income  groups  the  children  of  smaller\r\n\r\nfamilies  have a better chance in life than  those\r\n\r\nof  larger  families?  They have  better  feeding,\r\n\r\nbetter attention and healthier living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to pose as a feminist - in\r\n\r\nfact, I usually take the opposite role - but I think\r\n\r\nit is a great pity that there are no women Members\r\n\r\nin this Assembly so that we could hear their point\r\n\r\nof  view.  Among those who oppose family planning,\r\n\r\nit is usually the arrogant male of the species who\r\n\r\nshouts  the  loudest! He forgets, of course,  that\r\n\r\nthe  part  he plays in bringing children into  the\r\n\r\nworld  is a comparatively minor one, and  that  he\r\n\r\nplays  an even smaller part in looking after  them\r\n\r\nwhen  they  have  made  their  appearance  on  the\r\n\r\nplanet!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like to suggest that we rid our\r\n\r\nminds  of  cant. There are people who, because  of\r\n\r\ntheir beliefs, will always oppose family planning.\r\n\r\nSo be it. But there are vast numbers of women  in\r\n\r\nthis  city weary of the burden of incessant child-bearing  to  whom  family  planning  would   bring relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would say that the members\r\n\r\nof  the  Family  Planning Association  are  decent\r\n\r\npeople   who  are  seeking  to  bring  relief   to\r\n\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey   are  working  neither  for  gain  nor   for\r\n\r\nnotoriety.

I  received  several  memoranda\r\n\r\nsigned  by  72  members and one  telegram  from  a\r\n\r\nperson  unknown to me. I will first  mention  that\r\n\r\nthese  72  members opposed the grant  proposed  by\r\n\r\nGovernment. The other memorandum that  I  received\r\n\r\nwas  from the Family Planning Association. In view\r\n\r\nof  these  representations, I went  and  consulted\r\n\r\nmany  members of my constituency, the  electorate,\r\n\r\nand  to my surprise, a large majority are for  the\r\n\r\nFamily Planning Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in advising on family planning, the work is\r\n\r\ntwo-fold.  It  shows couples how  to  space  their\r\n\r\nchildren  so  as to allow time for the  mother  to\r\n\r\nrecover her strength fully between births and also\r\n\r\nto   protect  her  own  health  and  that  of  her\r\n\r\nchildren.  Secondly, how to have as many  children\r\n\r\nas  the  parents want and can afford to  have,  to\r\n\r\nfeed,  house, clothe and educate them. In  drawing\r\n\r\nattention to the word \"educate\", which happens  to\r\n\r\nbe  my Ministry, hon.

The  question  is  to  space   the\r\n\r\nchildren  and  to  have as many  children  as  the\r\n\r\nparents  can afford to feed and house them.  There\r\n\r\nis always the clamour against Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it is not doing enough to feed the people, to\r\n\r\ngive  social  services to the poor,  and  to  give\r\n\r\neducation to all that need education. If we do not\r\n\r\nhave  family planning in a country like Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  population is increasing by  55,000  a\r\n\r\nyear,  we will soon have a state in which it  will\r\n\r\nbe  almost impossible for any government to do its\r\n\r\nshare  in providing all the facilities that  human\r\n\r\nbeings are entitled to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to stress that the Family Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation is not trying to limit any  couple  to\r\n\r\nthe  number  of children they want, but  they  are\r\n\r\nonly  doing  it  in an advisory capacity,  telling\r\n\r\nthem  how  to  space  their children,  ensure  the\r\n\r\nmother's  health, and to have as many children  as\r\n\r\nthey  want and can afford. There is no compulsion,\r\n\r\nand  I  therefore do not see any objection to  the\r\n\r\nprovision  by  Government of this  most  admirable\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, although I have walked across the floor, I am\r\n\r\nin full agreement with the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\non  one  issue,  and that issue is  that  religion\r\n\r\nshould not come into the debates of this Assembly.\r\n\r\nHowever controversial the subject may be, religion\r\n\r\nis entirely out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not opposed to family planning myself, but\r\n\r\nwhat  I  am opposed to is that vote being allotted\r\n\r\nto  this Association under the Head: Contributions\r\n\r\nand  Charitable Allowances. If this vote had  come\r\n\r\nunder  the  Head:  Social Welfare,  I  would  have\r\n\r\ngladly  supported the vote, but  for  it  to  come\r\n\r\nunder \"Contributions and Charitable Allowances\", I\r\n\r\nam afraid, Sir, that many other associations would\r\n\r\napply  to the Government for contributions.  Where\r\n\r\nare  we  to  end  then?  We have  listed  so  many\r\n\r\nassociations and if we are going to vote money for\r\n\r\nassociations,  we are using public funds  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  associations.  The  subject   is   so\r\n\r\ncontroversial and delicate that I am not  prepared\r\n\r\nto discuss the merits or demerits of this question\r\n\r\nand I think I am going to remain neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I had\r\n\r\ndecided  at  the beginning not to  speak  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject, but I have changed my mind after  hearing\r\n\r\nthe  arguments put forward by both sides. For  the\r\n\r\narguments  that have been put forward  for  family\r\n\r\nplanning,  I think, are not valid. I am supporting\r\n\r\nthe  motion for deleting this provision  from  the\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested by those who support\r\n\r\nfamily  planning that limitation of population  is\r\n\r\ngood  for  Singapore because it is  getting  over-populated. Sir, what is good and what is bad is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of opinion with each human being and  that\r\n\r\nopinion  varies with the times. At the moment,  we\r\n\r\nare  in  times  of peace and we  do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nincrease  our  population. But there  are  nations\r\n\r\nwhich  when  they go to war require cannon  fodder\r\n\r\nand then they give bonuses to families who produce\r\n\r\nmore and more children. So, I think, Sir, that  the\r\n\r\nopinion as to what is good or bad varies with  the\r\n\r\ntimes  and, therefore, man must fall back  on  the\r\n\r\nfundamental teachings of religion to find a stable\r\n\r\nrock on which to lean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the Family Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation  does not force anyone  to  perpetrate\r\n\r\nits teachings. That is true. It has also been said\r\n\r\nthat  the  F.P.A. is seeking this way of  limiting\r\n\r\nbirths  to  those poorer sections of the community\r\n\r\nwho,  everyone  will  realise,  are  not  educated\r\n\r\nenough. Sir, there is always the fear that if  you\r\n\r\nteach something which may become dangerous, it  is\r\n\r\nbetter not to take it to those sections who do not\r\n\r\nknow  how to handle it. For instance, in the  case\r\n\r\nof a radio-active substance, you will take care to\r\n\r\ngive  it to a person who understands how to handle\r\n\r\nit,  how  to  control  it,  and  how  to  keep  it\r\n\r\nsecurely.  You will not give it to  a  person  who\r\n\r\ndoes not know how to handle it lest he may destroy\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

Sir, I think that is a negative attitude.\r\n\r\nIf  you are afraid of over-populated nations, then\r\n\r\nthrow  open  those areas of the  world  which  are\r\n\r\nunder-populated. Give the human race a  chance  to\r\n\r\nexpand. Why limit it? This is a negative attitude.\r\n\r\nIt  has  also been said that the poor man has  not\r\n\r\ngot  enough educational facilities and so on. That\r\n\r\nagain  is  a negative attitude. The answer  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide more for the people.

It was a surprise to me to find  that  many\r\n\r\nwealthy ladies are members of this Association,  and\r\n\r\nI  think  if  all  the  volunteer  workers  in  this\r\n\r\nAssociation think that this is the right  thing  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  do,  then simply not go to the Government,\r\n\r\nnot  go  to  the taxpayer but ask their husbands  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the sum of money that  is  required.\r\n\r\nBesides there is a lot of other social welfare  work\r\n\r\nfor  these  ladies to do.

We have to think of the whole thing\r\n\r\nobjectively: whether or not the expenditure of  this\r\n\r\n$85,000 is to be beneficial or harmful to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went through the Budget yesterday and we are\r\n\r\nquite  convinced  that expenditure  will  mount  and\r\n\r\nmount and keep mounting as the years go by.

It is  a  battle\r\n\r\nwhich  has been fought through the ages. We  might\r\n\r\ngo  back  about a hundred years, I think,  to  the\r\n\r\ninvention   of  chloroform.  You  will  recollect,\r\n\r\nperhaps, that there was a lot of opposition to the\r\n\r\nuse of chloroform for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen  in child-birth.

They  must  bear  their\r\n\r\nchildren  in  pain and suffering.\"  And  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  advocates of chloroform pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  at the very beginning of the Bible, you have\r\n\r\nthe  story of how the first man gave birth to  the\r\n\r\nfirst woman. Adam was put into a deep sleep by the\r\n\r\nLord and the woman was taken out of his side.  And\r\n\r\nso   the   Bible  apparently  contradicted  itself\r\n\r\nbecause, whereas the prophets said this, God, had,\r\n\r\nin  fact, done the other thing; God had put a  man\r\n\r\ninto  a  deep sleep in order that he might produce\r\n\r\nanother human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is an eternal battle and we are\r\n\r\ngradually   winning   it.

I do not want to go on about  the\r\n\r\nreligious  point of view because  this  is  not  a\r\n\r\nplace  for  that sort of argument, but  we  had  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  skirmish in this eternal  battle  in  the\r\n\r\nvery  early  days  of  the  old  Labour  Party  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It was then, I think, we had the  first\r\n\r\nvote for family planning - a very small sum, $10,000\r\n\r\nor  $15,000,  I  cannot remember the  figures - but,\r\n\r\nanyhow,  it  was bitterly opposed  by  people  who\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Well, this is a very wrong thing  to  help\r\n\r\nany  woman  to  avoid child bearing.\"  The  Labour\r\n\r\nParty  had a lot of internal discussions about  it\r\n\r\nand  they came out with a statement condemning the\r\n\r\nvote.  Perhaps  I might read you a little  bit  of\r\n\r\nthis because it puts the case rather well:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As a non-sectarian political Party, Labour does\r\n\r\nnot  seek  to  form  policy on religious  grounds.\r\n\r\nBirth  control  is to be left to the  individual's\r\n\r\nfree  will and conscience. From the practical side\r\n\r\nof  the  question,  Labour is not  convinced  that\r\n\r\nbirth control teaching and family planning clinics\r\n\r\nwill  make  any real contribution to  solving  the\r\n\r\nproblem of a large birth rate tending towards over-population.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  personally  agree with this. I am reluctant  to\r\n\r\nshoot  down anybody who is fighting on my side  in\r\n\r\nthis skirmish, but I do not think myself that  you\r\n\r\nwill get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  significant reduction in your  population  by\r\n\r\nencouraging  the  use  of contraceptives,  because\r\n\r\nthere  are no contraceptives at present  which  do\r\n\r\nnot  demand  certain  habits  of  punctuality  and\r\n\r\nregularity, and certain sanitary conveniences  and\r\n\r\nso on, which are, in fact, not available. Even the\r\n\r\nlong-promised pill (which I do not think has  even\r\n\r\nappeared  in a practical form yet), - even  that  is\r\n\r\ngoing to mean that people have got to take a  pill\r\n\r\nand  they  have to remember to take it, and  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  they  will forget or they  will  lose  the\r\n\r\npill.  In  any case, I do not think it will  work.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is a point of view. I would not  say\r\n\r\nI am right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal opinion is that it is not going to\r\n\r\nhave  a  significant effect on  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation whether you have it or not,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nreluctant  to disappoint my very good  friend  and\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Hon. the Assistant  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry (Mr J. M.  Jumabhoy)  who\r\n\r\napparently  envisaged  Singapore  building  up  an\r\n\r\nenormous  army and embarking on some  campaign  of\r\n\r\nimperialist  aggression to bring SouthEast  Asia\r\n\r\nunder our control, supported, if I understood  him\r\n\r\nrightly,  by the Member for Changi (Mr  Lim  Cher\r\n\r\nKheng),  who also demanded more manpower.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nhe  envisaged  an  attack on  the  Federation  and\r\n\r\ntaking over their lands; I am not sure. Anyhow, he\r\n\r\nseems  to  think  in those terms,  but  I  do  not\r\n\r\npersonally think that it is a religious  point  of\r\n\r\nview   to   suggest  that,  in  order   to   avoid\r\n\r\ncontraception, we should embark on war. That is my\r\n\r\nreligion, but it may not be the same as others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I might continue to refer to this\r\n\r\noriginal  draft memorandum put out by  the  Labour\r\n\r\nParty of Singapore. We drew attention to the  fact\r\n\r\nthat   in   Great  Britain  in  this   connection,\r\n\r\naccording   to  Eva  Hubbard  who  is  a   reputed\r\n\r\nauthority  on the subject - she is on the Population\r\n\r\nand  Investigation Committee - more than 50 per cent\r\n\r\nof  the mothers in Great Britain say, after birth,\r\n\r\nthat  their  child was unplanned and  unwanted.  I\r\n\r\nremember also that the British Medical Association\r\n\r\nat about the same time quoted figures to say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  were 60,000 illegal abortions taking  place\r\n\r\nin  Britain, amounting to about 10 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal  conceptions. If you take those two  figures\r\n\r\ntogether,  you  get  about  55  per  cent  of  all\r\n\r\nconceptions  which are unwanted and  unplanned  in\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, a country with a much more advanced\r\n\r\nstandard of education than we have here and which,\r\n\r\nof  course, has had birth control well  known  for\r\n\r\nabout  a  hundred  years, since the  time  of  the\r\n\r\nBradlaugh-Besant trial. On those grounds, it seems\r\n\r\nto  me  unlikely  that you are going  to  get  any\r\n\r\nsignificant   reduction  in   birth   control   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  that is not an argument  which  I\r\n\r\npersonally  accept  as  justifying  this  vote  of\r\n\r\n$85,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring this discussion back to\r\n\r\nthe plane on which it should have been kept. There\r\n\r\nhas  been,  to  my  mind, far  too  much  laughter\r\n\r\namongst  a group of men who are dealing with  what\r\n\r\nis  in  the long run a woman's problem. I am going\r\n\r\nto  give one particular instance which I know  and\r\n\r\nwhere  I  have  been concerned  in  trying  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething  to  help. There is a poor woman  living\r\n\r\nquite  close to my house. We try and keep in touch\r\n\r\nwith  the  people around us. We try and give  them\r\n\r\nhelp  and,  in  the case of this  woman,  she  had\r\n\r\ntwelve children and was very hard up. She found it\r\n\r\nvery hard to feed her children. We got her a part-time  job washing clothes. She could come out  for\r\n\r\nan  hour  or two in the morning to do the  washing\r\n\r\nand  then  get  back and look after  the  children\r\n\r\nagain. By this means she could bring in some more\r\n\r\nmoney  for the family. Well, she worked very  well\r\n\r\nand  happily. She was extremely grateful  but,  in\r\n\r\ndue course, she had to give up the work because  a\r\n\r\nthirteenth  child was on the way. It is  extremely\r\n\r\nwrong that anybody should laugh at this. It is not\r\n\r\na  comic  story.  It  is a  story  of  the  tragic\r\n\r\nsuffering of a poor woman in a mud-floor hut  down\r\n\r\nin the Serangoon end of Potong Pasir. We went down\r\n\r\nto  see  her.  We gave her some little  help,  but\r\n\r\nthere  she  was, with the children  all  over  the\r\n\r\nfloor.  One of them was in a high state of  fever,\r\n\r\nbut she herself was too weak and languid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  able to look after it. Another had  fallen\r\n\r\ninto the drain and scratched all the skin off  his\r\n\r\nleg,  and there was nobody to look after  him,  to\r\n\r\nget  him to a clinic to have a bit of anti-tetanus\r\n\r\nserum. We had to look after that. The whole family\r\n\r\nwas  in  a  state  of  great poverty  and  misery,\r\n\r\nalthough   the  woman  herself  was  an  admirable\r\n\r\nperson,  being  extremely hard-working,  cheerful,\r\n\r\nwilling and doing the very best she could to carry\r\n\r\nthis  family burden. I do not want to seem  to  be\r\n\r\ncoarse,  but I think I should continue with  this:\r\n\r\nthat  her  husband insisted on having  intercourse\r\n\r\nwith  her  up to within 24 hours of the time  that\r\n\r\nher  thirteenth baby was born. That baby  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  born and is paralysed all down the left side\r\n\r\nand  will  live  and die a helpless  cripple.  The\r\n\r\nmother  is so reduced in strength that she  cannot\r\n\r\ngo back to work at present and she has got another\r\n\r\nmouth  to  feed  on  an  insufficient  salary  and\r\n\r\nwithout  the  strength  even  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\nchildren,  quite apart from feeding them.  She  is\r\n\r\nstill  there trying to get off her bed, trying  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  her children and without help.  Well,\r\n\r\nthat   is  a  typical  case,  to  my  mind,  which\r\n\r\njustifies  this  grant and any  Member  who  votes\r\n\r\nagainst this $85,000 is voting for women all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  go  on  under those  conditions - for\r\n\r\nchildren  to  be born paralysed, for  children  to\r\n\r\ngrow  up  in  over-crowded families  uncared  for,\r\n\r\nunloved,  doomed for their whole lives to  be  bad\r\n\r\ncitizens, to be a burden on the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is one more point. The Member for\r\n\r\nChangi  said,  in his final peroration,  I  think,\r\n\r\n\"For  God's  sake  or  for heaven's  sake  do  not\r\n\r\nintroduce birth control into Singapore.\" Now, I am\r\n\r\nafraid he is very far behind the times. There  has\r\n\r\nbeen the practice of birth control in this part of\r\n\r\nthe world long before the West ever came here -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Only for a -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That has  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on here from time immemorial, as it has  in\r\n\r\nevery part of the world, because women have always\r\n\r\nsuffered  this  burden of excessive  childbearing.\r\n\r\nTheir  husbands have imposed it on them, and  they\r\n\r\nhave had to carry it and they have therefore tried\r\n\r\nto  avoid it in one way or another. You can hardly\r\n\r\ntalk  to  a  family  in this city  without  coming\r\n\r\nacross a case of some woman who has tried to bring\r\n\r\nabout  an  abortion  and  has  killed  herself  or\r\n\r\npermanently damaged her health in the process, and\r\n\r\nthat  is going to happen as long as you have these\r\n\r\nunwanted  conceptions and you are  going  to  have\r\n\r\npeople  seeking  to produce abortion.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nfacing  the facts at all to say, \"Do not introduce\r\n\r\nfamily  planning. Do not introduce  birth  control\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.\" You have already got it here. You\r\n\r\nmay  say,  \"Let us have it as dirty, as unhealthy,\r\n\r\nas  magical, as wrong, as harmful, or as expensive\r\n\r\nas  possible,  by all means. Let  us  do  all  the\r\n\r\ndamage  we  can with it, because women will  still\r\n\r\ndemand  it.\"  But  you wish to  deny  them  having\r\n\r\nsomething  which is clean, scientific, reasonable\r\n\r\nand secure. I hope Members will remember that this\r\n\r\nis  not  a  subject for humorous remarks  although\r\n\r\nthey  are very easy and tempting to make,  but  at\r\n\r\nthe  back of it all does lie an enormous  mass  of\r\n\r\nhuman  suffering  which we ought to  relieve,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can  relieve,  through  this  voluntary\r\n\r\nAssociation  which  is doing this  remarkable  and\r\n\r\nexpanding job of taking away some of the burden of\r\n\r\nignorance  and  suffering which  men  impose  upon\r\n\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Minister for Communications and Works\r\n\r\nis mistaken about birth control when he says\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  been  practised quite  long  ago  in\r\n\r\nMalaya.

Sir,\r\n\r\nthis body is a voluntary Association the objects of\r\n\r\nwhich are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(i) to educate the people in healthy family\r\n\r\nplanning   and   to  provide  facilities   for\r\n\r\nscientific   contraception  so  that   married\r\n\r\npeople  may space or limit their families  and\r\n\r\nthus  promote their happiness in married  life\r\n\r\nand mitigate the evils of ill-health and over-crowding;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to advocate and promote the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of family planning  centres  at\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  addition to advice  on  scientific\r\n\r\ncontraception,  women can get advice  on,  and\r\n\r\nwhen   necessary  for,  any  or  all  of   the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n      (a) involuntary sterility;\r\n\r\n      (b) minor gynaecological ailments; and\r\n\r\n      (c) difficulties connected with the marriage relationship;\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to encourage the production of healthy\r\n\r\nchildren  who  are  an  asset  to  the  nation\r\n\r\nprovided  that the parents have the  help  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  give  them a reasonable  chance  in\r\n\r\nlife; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to examine such other steps as are relevant\r\n\r\nto  the  above and to take such action as  may\r\n\r\nbe considered as advisable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Association has been functioning in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for the past seven years. It  is  widely\r\n\r\nknown  for  its good work to both the educated  and\r\n\r\nthe  uneducated people of Singapore. The  attention\r\n\r\nof  many  people,  who have the interests  and  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people of Singapore at heart,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  drawn  to the activities of this Association,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  increased considerably.  Consequently,\r\n\r\nthis Association has to its credit the services  of\r\n\r\nabout   102  volunteer  workers  acting  as  office\r\n\r\nbearers,  Committee  members, a  senior  staff  and\r\n\r\nvoluntary workers, a fact which, of course, only  a\r\n\r\nvery  few voluntary organisations in Singapore have\r\n\r\nthe  good  fortune  to point to  with  pride.  This\r\n\r\nincludes,  Sir, the broad-minded, enthusiastic  and\r\n\r\npublic-spirited  wives  of  the  Members   of   the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment before the House, Sir, is in itself\r\n\r\na  compliment  to the work of this Association  and\r\n\r\nample  testimony  of  the wide  interest  taken  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  Assembly  in  regard  to  family\r\n\r\nplanning.  Whichever  way  you  look  at  it,   the\r\n\r\nAssociation has been doing very useful work for the\r\n\r\ncommunity  generally, and it was not a surprise  at\r\n\r\nall   to  me  when  the  Government  repeated   the\r\n\r\nprovision   of   financial   assistance   to   this\r\n\r\norganisation to promote its aims and objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grant of $60,000 as contribution was\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the 1955 Budget for the  first  time,\r\n\r\nthis attracted considerable public attention. Since\r\n\r\nthen, the subject of family planning and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   contribution  has  met   with   severe\r\n\r\ncriticism  by members of a certain section  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  especially the Roman Catholic denomination\r\n\r\nof  the Christian religion, so much so that certain\r\n\r\ncandidates to the last Assembly election chose this\r\n\r\nsubject  as  one  of  their election  platforms.  A\r\n\r\nreflection  of that promise made at these  election\r\n\r\ncampaigns  can  be seen in the form  in  which  the\r\n\r\namendment  has  been introduced this  morning.  The\r\n\r\namendment  seeks to delete in toto the  contribution\r\n\r\nof  $85,000  to this organisation. Sir,  I,  on  my\r\n\r\nbehalf,   and  on  behalf  of  my  electorate,   am\r\n\r\ndispassionately  against the  amendment.  First  of\r\n\r\nall, let me pay my sincere tribute to those who are\r\n\r\nagainst  this expenditure for the courage of  their\r\n\r\nconvictions. I think honest criticisms can clear up\r\n\r\nall misunderstandings underlying the opposition  to\r\n\r\nthis provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore is increasing\r\n\r\nsteadily  year by year. In 1954, there were  56,931\r\n\r\nbirths  and  10,790 deaths. The rate of births  was\r\n\r\n5.26  times  over  deaths. This  works  out  at  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  1,090  babies  in  one  week.  It   is\r\n\r\nestimated - I am quoting the Singapore Annual  Report\r\n\r\nfor the year 1954 - that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The number of children in the primary age group\r\n\r\nof  7-12 years was 144,800 in 1954, but this figure\r\n\r\nwill  rise  to  239,500 by 1959 the increase  being\r\n\r\nnearly  20,000 a year in 1955, increasing to 23,000\r\n\r\na   year   in   1958.  To  provide   extra   school\r\n\r\naccommodation  necessary in  these  critical  years\r\n\r\nthere is a need for 20 new schools a year, and  for\r\n\r\n600 teachers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Increased needs will also arise year by year as the\r\n\r\npopulation increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social services, like housing and public\r\n\r\nassistance, also tend to increase very  heavily  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  There has been a very sharp  increase\r\n\r\nyear by year. In 1953, $2,423,503 was paid to 6,835\r\n\r\nfamilies and in 1954 nearly $3.6 millions to  9,943\r\n\r\nfamilies.  The estimated expenditure  in  1955  was\r\n\r\nshown   as   $5  millions.  Most  of  the  families\r\n\r\nreceiving  public assistance usually complain  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  make both ends meet, because  of  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  education,  medical attention,  etc. for\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast increase in population, accompanied by\r\n\r\nthe existing high per-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncentage  of illiteracy, low earnings of the people,\r\n\r\nand  the  large number of children and  dependants,\r\n\r\nshould serve as an eye-opener to all right-thinking\r\n\r\nmen  or  women and cause them to devise new methods\r\n\r\nof   improving  the  economic  standards   of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity. It can safely be said that the provision\r\n\r\nof  social security is not the only solution. There\r\n\r\nis  also room for the concept of the prevention  of\r\n\r\nnew  life on the grounds of duty to care for  those\r\n\r\nalready  living.  Certain  improvements  cannot  be\r\n\r\neffected by measures taken by Government only,  but\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisations also can help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Planning Association, Sir, I submit,\r\n\r\nis  such an organisation aimed at improving  family\r\n\r\nlife.  Sir,  my main interest in the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning Association is in  so  far  as  it\r\n\r\nserves  the  poor  families of the  community.  The\r\n\r\nAssociation's record of activities lists  also  the\r\n\r\nfollowing.  I  am  now reading,  Sir,  extracts  of\r\n\r\nfigures that I have been able to get on the  income\r\n\r\ngroups: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  \"Those  who receive  less  than        \r\n\r\n  $100  per  month or unemployed, etc.       768 persons - 26.83 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Those from $101 to $200 per    \r\n\r\n   month                                   1,284 persons - 44.85 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Those from $201 to $300 per\r\n\r\n   month                                     374 persons - 13.06 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Those from $301 to $400 per\r\n\r\n   month                                     146 persons - 5.10 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Those from $401 to $500 per\r\n\r\n   month                                      46 persons - 1.06 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Those from $501 and above per\r\n\r\n   month                                     244 persons - 8.05 per cent\".\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I maintain that a contribution from\r\n\r\nGovernment  funds to such a voluntary  organisation\r\n\r\nis  fully  justified. Having said this, let  me  now\r\n\r\nturn  to  what  governments in other parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  are  doing  to  assist the  Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation in their respective countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently in Tokyo there was a conference of\r\n\r\ndelegates  representing  organisations  on   family\r\n\r\nplanning.  Fifteen  countries were  represented  at\r\n\r\nthat conference, and it is very important to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnote  that  three  of these countries  do  receive\r\n\r\ndirect  government aid. They are India, Japan  and\r\n\r\nEgypt.  Although countries like the United States,\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom,  Sweden,  Denmark,  Holland,\r\n\r\nPakistan, Ceylon, Germany and South Africa do  not\r\n\r\nget   direct  financial  aid,  the  majority  give\r\n\r\nsubsidies and assistance to local family  planning\r\n\r\norganisations   in  the  form  of  equipment   and\r\n\r\npremises.  In those countries where  there  is  no\r\n\r\ngovernment   subsidy,  facilities   are   provided\r\n\r\notherwise;  for  instance,  for  T.B. and  mental\r\n\r\npatients.  The  State  provides  family   planning\r\n\r\nfacilities,  or  else it pays the family  planning\r\n\r\nclinics.  Sir, in the case of countries  like  the\r\n\r\nUnited States and the United Kingdom, there  is  a\r\n\r\nbasic  difference in the wages that they  receive.\r\n\r\nIn   Singapore  and  other  parts  of  the   Asian\r\n\r\ncountries, the basic wage is far lower  than  that\r\n\r\nin the countries of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our position, as compared to India, Japan,\r\n\r\nEgypt and other Asian countries, is that we have a\r\n\r\nvery high percentage of illiteracy and our earning\r\n\r\ncapacity is very low and we have more than 50  per\r\n\r\ncent  who  are  under 21. Sir,  in  Hongkong,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   provides  premises  for  the   Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association. In 1955,  the  organisation\r\n\r\nreceived a token grant from the Government, a site\r\n\r\nin  the  city for their new headquarters,  passage\r\n\r\nexpenses  for  their two delegates  to  the  Tokyo\r\n\r\nconference.  In addition to this, the Jockey  Club\r\n\r\nof  Hongkong  gives large donations  yearly.  This\r\n\r\nyear,  I  understand, a sum of (Hongkong) $125,000\r\n\r\nhas been contributed to their new building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Japan recognises her obligation to the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning  Association. She  has  tried  to\r\n\r\nprevent  large families by abortion. This means  a\r\n\r\ndanger  to mental health, maternal health  and  it\r\n\r\nalso   threatens   family  happiness   and   moral\r\n\r\ncharacter.  I  will  not, for a moment,  recommend\r\n\r\nthat we take such a step. But Japan is also giving\r\n\r\nassistance to the Family Planning Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered some of the\r\n\r\ncountries, which do give subsidies to their Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay  I  also, Sir, draw attention to a few remarks\r\n\r\nmade by a very eminent social worker in India  who\r\n\r\nis  also  very actively connected with the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association there? This  eminent  social\r\n\r\nworker  is Mrs. Allabhai B. Wardhya, and she  says\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  three necessary  conditions  for\r\n\r\nplanned parenthood in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In each country where it is sought to be\r\n\r\nintroduced,  it must meet the current  and  future\r\n\r\nneeds  and  fit in with the national  and  ethical\r\n\r\naims.  As far as religious scruples are concerned,\r\n\r\nno rigid dogma seeks to rule out knowledge or what\r\n\r\nthe practice of fertility can solve. All the great\r\n\r\nAsian   religions  forbid  killing   and   enjoins\r\n\r\ncompassion. A rational application of  this  could\r\n\r\nfind  ethical the concepts of the prevention of  a\r\n\r\nnew  life on the grounds of duty to care for those\r\n\r\nalready living.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to prolong my speech, Sir, with all\r\n\r\nthose  quotations, but I think what I have already\r\n\r\ngiven will suffice for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main objection to the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  contribution to the Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation  seems to me to come  from  the  Roman\r\n\r\nCatholics.  As far as I can gather, they  too  are\r\n\r\nnot  opposed  to family planning in  the  broadest\r\n\r\nsense. They differ only in the method employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a Hindu by religion. My ancestors were\r\n\r\nvery orthodox Hindus. Our religion forbids killing\r\n\r\nin  all  forms. We are forbidden to kill chickens,\r\n\r\ngoats  and  even  ants. There are many  Hindus  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   to-day,  and  if  the  contention   is\r\n\r\nadvanced  that  the tax collected from  the  Roman\r\n\r\nCatholics  should  not  be  used  for  the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Association, I think the Hindus have just\r\n\r\nas  right a claim to say that their religion  does\r\n\r\nnot  permit  the collection of their rates  to  be\r\n\r\nutilised   for   the  construction,   maintenance,\r\n\r\nstaffing and equipment of slaughter houses. I also\r\n\r\nthink, Sir, that the Malays would also object  very\r\n\r\nstrongly   to   those  houses   where   pigs   are\r\n\r\nslaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is only one religion in this world,\r\n\r\nor   if  Singapore  is  a  religious  state,  then\r\n\r\nprobably we will be able to impose such conditions\r\n\r\nas  the Roman Catholics want us to do, but  may  I\r\n\r\nask  the  Roman  Catholics  of  Singapore  to   be\r\n\r\ntolerant in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe matter? The world at this critical stage cannot\r\n\r\nexist   without  individual  members   or   various\r\n\r\nreligious  organisations exercising  tolerance  and\r\n\r\npatience in their beliefs and activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me tell this Assembly\r\n\r\nthis: if you delete this provision from the Budget,\r\n\r\nyou will be taking away the basic right of the poor\r\n\r\nwoman  to  receive a knowledge of contraception,  a\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  is  available  to  her   and   her\r\n\r\nuneducated  sister  through  the  Family   Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation; or, alternatively, the Government will\r\n\r\nbe forced to set up family planning centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir, I am confident that  all  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this  House  are  quite  aware  of  my\r\n\r\nattitude towards the question of whether Government\r\n\r\nshould  use  the  taxpayers' money in  contributing\r\n\r\nfunds   to  the  Family  Planning  Association   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. On the 29th of June, I was asked by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  the  Southern Islands  (Inche  Mohamed\r\n\r\nSidik  Bin  Haji Abdul Hamid) who,  I  believe,  is\r\n\r\nagainst  family planning, what Government's  policy\r\n\r\nwas  towards the Family Planning Association and  I\r\n\r\nreplied  that Government had no set policy.  I  did\r\n\r\nsay,  on  behalf  of the Government,  that  as  the\r\n\r\nmatter  was  highly  controversial  the  Government\r\n\r\nquite rightly decided that it should, at the proper\r\n\r\ntime,  be  freely debated in this House  where  one\r\n\r\ncould vote according to one's religious beliefs and\r\n\r\nconscience;  and the Hon. the Financial  Secretary,\r\n\r\nwhen  introducing the Budget, informed hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat  the  $85,000 under Head 3: Contributions  and\r\n\r\nCharitable Allowances would form the subject  of  a\r\n\r\nfree  vote. Government has taken away the Whip  and\r\n\r\neveryone  is  entitled to say what he thinks  about\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only issue before this House is whether\r\n\r\nGovernment should finance with taxpayers' money the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning Association of Singapore. All  the\r\n\r\nMembers who have spoken have advocated or, shall  I\r\n\r\nsay,  preached  the gospel of family  planning  and\r\n\r\nhave completely lost sight of the issue before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  Even  the Hon. the Chief Minister,  in  his\r\n\r\naddress to the House, has taken up the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrong  angle.  We  are not asked  to  vote  for  or\r\n\r\nagainst  family planning. I respect  the  views  of\r\n\r\neveryone  in  this House, whether  they  be  for  or\r\n\r\nagainst.  I appreciate, however, that the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister was perhaps answering  things  that\r\n\r\nmight  have  been  said  by the  Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang (Mr Goh Tong Liang) who was talking  about\r\n\r\nhis Catholic ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr R. C. H. Lim, in his address, also attacked\r\n\r\nthe  subject from the same angle. He was attempting\r\n\r\nto  preach the gospel of family planning to us.  It\r\n\r\nwas   the  same  with  our  bachelor  Member   (Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland) - I cannot understand how such a good-looking gentleman is still a bachelor. He said that\r\n\r\nfamily   planning  would  bring  relief  to  women.\r\n\r\nBachelors are usually reminded that they should get\r\n\r\nmarried and do their duty to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)\r\n\r\nasked  us  not to pay attention to the  appeals  of\r\n\r\nmembers of the public who asked elected Members  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard their interests. I say to him that  every\r\n\r\nMember  should  lend  a  sympathetic  ear  to   his\r\n\r\nelectorate and then use his sound judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Communications and\r\n\r\nWorks (Mr Thomas) made a rather pathetic appeal to\r\n\r\nus.  He asked everyone to remain silent and serious\r\n\r\nwhile he related a pathetic story in order to  play\r\n\r\nupon our emotions. If he is such an ardent advocate\r\n\r\nof  birth control and knows that the husband of the\r\n\r\nlady he was talking about was insatiable, surely he\r\n\r\ncould have given the poor lady the necessary advice\r\n\r\nor  brought  her  himself to  the  Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation? This lady's case, as are similar cases\r\n\r\nin all parts of the world, is used as an example to\r\n\r\nadvocate  birth control. The answer to his  picture\r\n\r\nof a poor home with poor uneducated children around\r\n\r\nis  better housing and better education, a  matter,\r\n\r\nwhich  I will touch on a little later. But  as  you\r\n\r\nwill see, all those who preach the gospel of family\r\n\r\nplanning  have strayed from the very  issue  before\r\n\r\nthe  House, and that is whether the sum of  $85,000\r\n\r\nbe deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore - the voters who have\r\n\r\nplaced  the  elected  Members  in  power  in   this\r\n\r\nHouse - comprise  of a number of races  of  different\r\n\r\ncreeds. Amongst them, of course, are Catholics,  to\r\n\r\nwhich religion different races belong, embracing  a\r\n\r\nlarge   number  of  Chinese,  Europeans,   Indians,\r\n\r\nEurasians and Tamils, who are certainly opposed  to\r\n\r\nGovernment's grant. There is also a large number of\r\n\r\npeople  belonging to other Christian denominations.\r\n\r\nThere  are the Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and  Jews\r\n\r\nwho   consider  birth  control  and  the   use   of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives highly objectionable and resent that\r\n\r\npart  of  their contribution towards  public  funds\r\n\r\nshould  be used for a purpose repugnant to them.  I\r\n\r\nmention  this  not for the purpose of  raising  any\r\n\r\nreligious  views,  as  I and  every  right-thinking\r\n\r\nperson respect the views of others. There are forty\r\n\r\nto  fifty thousand Catholics in Singapore of  whom,\r\n\r\ntaking  a  rough  estimate, thirty  to  thirty-five\r\n\r\nthousand are eligible voters spread throughout  the\r\n\r\nvarious  constituencies. I make no threat.  Amongst\r\n\r\nthe other bodies that I have mentioned, I know that\r\n\r\nthere  are  minority  groups  who  consider  family\r\n\r\nplanning not sinful. I have not been able to get an\r\n\r\nestimate of the number of those who are anti-family\r\n\r\nplanning,  but  I  am satisfied that  there  are  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number from these different creeds who\r\n\r\nobject  to  taxpayers' money  being  used  for  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning  Association. In mentioning  these\r\n\r\ngroups, I do not wish, and I repeat once again,  to\r\n\r\nraise any religious issues at all nor to impose the\r\n\r\nwill  of  any  religion  upon  the  Government.  My\r\n\r\npurpose  in mentioning this is purely to  show  you\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  necessary for the  Government  to  be\r\n\r\ncautious and not to ride roughshod over the  wishes\r\n\r\nand conscience of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are debating today is not purely a matter\r\n\r\nof dollars and cents but one that goes much deeper.\r\n\r\nWe  must  be  concerned with the  feelings  of  our\r\n\r\nelectorate  and whether or not we are safeguarding,\r\n\r\nwith  care,  consideration and  understanding,  the\r\n\r\nmost cherished views even of the minorities- I have\r\n\r\nreceived, and I believe Members of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse have also received, petitions from persons of\r\n\r\ndifferent  religions  on the matter.  I  have  also\r\n\r\nreceived  a  memorandum  from  an  association   of\r\n\r\nUniversity  students who have expressed their  deep\r\n\r\nconcern  in this matter. These youths belong  to  a\r\n\r\ncross-section of our community, both  in  terms  of\r\n\r\neconomics and race, and yet they have expressed one\r\n\r\nsingle  united  view against Government's  proposed\r\n\r\ngrant.  They possess a high sense of responsibility\r\n\r\nand  they are the voters of tomorrow and we  cannot\r\n\r\ndisregard them. I have also received telegrams,  as\r\n\r\nhave some of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not asking hon. Members to vote against\r\n\r\nfamily  planning - to some of you it may  be  a  good\r\n\r\nthing - but  I  suggest  that  the  Family   Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore could and should carry  on\r\n\r\nwithout  any  contributions from public  funds,  as\r\n\r\nassociations in other parts of the world are doing.\r\n\r\nLet  us  suppose that Government tomorrow says:  We\r\n\r\nwish to conserve land in Singapore and therefore  a\r\n\r\npublic  crematorium must be built  and  all  people\r\n\r\ndying  in Singapore should be cremated there. Would\r\n\r\nnot  the  Muslims, the Catholics and  others  whose\r\n\r\nvery  religious tenets forbid cremation  create  an\r\n\r\nuproar  and  call  upon Government  to  change  its\r\n\r\npolicy?  I  am certain that we in this  House  will\r\n\r\nagree that their wishes should be respected. I have\r\n\r\nheard  the  argument,  and I have  heard  it  again\r\n\r\ntoday,  that  the  Catholics  and  other  objecting\r\n\r\nbodies should be more tolerant because the abattoir\r\n\r\nwas   built   with  public  funds  and   pigs   are\r\n\r\nslaughtered there. I wish to say to the person  who\r\n\r\nadvanced that argument that he is ignorant  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that a special abattoir has been built solely\r\n\r\nfor the slaughter of cattle and sheep according  to\r\n\r\nMuslim  rites, so that the Muslims and  Jews  whose\r\n\r\nreligious  laws proclaim pigs to be  unclean  have,\r\n\r\nfrom  part  of their funds, contributed to  special\r\n\r\nabattoirs   built  for  them  where   animals   are\r\n\r\nslaughtered   without  offending  their   religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs. There is a special abattoir solely for the\r\n\r\nslaughter of pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

You can speak\r\n\r\nafterwards, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Since my learned Friend has mentioned\r\n\r\nthis,  let  me  clarify  the situation.  Government\r\n\r\ndecided  to send two representatives to  Tokyo  for\r\n\r\nthis conference and it was felt by my Ministry that\r\n\r\nit  would  be  a  good thing for me  to  go  as  an\r\n\r\nobserver.  I  felt  that it  might  be  politically\r\n\r\nunwise  for  me to do so and I referred the  matter\r\n\r\nnot  only to my electorate but also to the Catholic\r\n\r\nSocial  Guild  and  I  had their  written  approval\r\n\r\nbefore I decided to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that international conference, there were\r\n\r\nsixteen  countries represented. I do not know  from\r\n\r\nwhere my hon. Friend the Member for Seletar got his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation  about  Egypt, because  Egypt  was  not\r\n\r\nrepresented.  The  countries that were  represented\r\n\r\nwere  Australia,  Bermuda, Ceylon,  Great  Britain,\r\n\r\nHawaii,    Hongkong,   India,   Israel,   Pakistan,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  Thailand,  the\r\n\r\nUnited States and an observer from Canada. Now, all\r\n\r\nthe   family   planning   associations   in   these\r\n\r\ncountries,  with the exception of India and  Japan,\r\n\r\nare  run on voluntary contributions. Those in India\r\n\r\nand  Japan  are Government financed.  The  Hongkong\r\n\r\nGovernment  gave their family planning  association\r\n\r\nthis  year a token vote of (Hongkong) $5,000, which\r\n\r\nis equivalent to about $2,000 odd of our money. The\r\n\r\nGovernment is now asking us to give $85,000 to  the\r\n\r\nAssociation. If the Jockey Club of Hongkong were to\r\n\r\ncontribute money to the Family Planning Association\r\n\r\nhere, I would have no objection at all, but my hon.\r\n\r\nFriend the Member for Seletar commenced his address\r\n\r\nby saying, when he was boosting the Family Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Singapore, that it is  a  voluntary\r\n\r\nAssociation.  If  that were so,  I  would  have  no\r\n\r\nobjections whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, for the first time in history, the\r\n\r\nmajority of the Members are elected representatives\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  It is the duty  of  a  democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment  to give the people what they  want  and\r\n\r\nnot  merely,  what is thought good  for  them.  The\r\n\r\nWorld  Health Organisation brought up the  question\r\n\r\nof  family  planning  in the House  of  Commons  in\r\n\r\nAugust  1952, and I wish to quote the reply  which\r\n\r\nwas  given  by the Minister of Health on behalf  of\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The British Government has no intention of\r\n\r\nimposing  birth  control on any  native  territory\r\n\r\nunder its jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Speaking at the end of the debate on birth control,\r\n\r\nMiss  Patricia  Hornsby- Smith,  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Ministry of Health, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have also great responsibilities of our own\r\n\r\ntowards  native populations under our jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nHer   Majesty's  Government  have  set   themselves\r\n\r\nagainst  imposing anything of this  nature  on  any\r\n\r\nterritory under our control. Hon.

Hon. Members must be\r\n\r\nwell  aware  of the dynamite which such  a  policy\r\n\r\nwould  carry.  Her  Majesty's  Government  do   not\r\n\r\nconsider the World Health Organisation competent to\r\n\r\ndiscuss or express views on the social, economic or\r\n\r\nethical aspects of birth control.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Churchill, when he was Chancellor of the\r\n\r\nExchequer, referred to the use of contraceptives as\r\n\r\none of the most pernicious innovations of our time,\r\n\r\nand  George  Bernard Shaw, who was a  non-Catholic,\r\n\r\ncalled    the   use   of   contraceptives    mutual\r\n\r\nmasturbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, like my hon. Friend, say that the matter is\r\n\r\nnot a laughing matter. It is serious. The maternity\r\n\r\nand  child welfare centres and clinics run  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Health  in  England  have   received\r\n\r\nspecific directives on the subject. These  are  the\r\n\r\ndirectives given:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister of Health has authorised a statement\r\n\r\nthat   Government   has  under  consideration   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the  use  of institutions  which  are\r\n\r\ncontrolled by local authorities for the purpose  of\r\n\r\ngiving advice to women on contraceptive methods. So\r\n\r\nfar  as  maternity  and child welfare  centres  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  these  centres can properly  deal  only\r\n\r\nwith  expectant mothers, nursing mothers and  young\r\n\r\nchildren, and it is the view of the Government that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  the  function of the centres  to  give\r\n\r\nadvice  in  regard to birth control and that  their\r\n\r\nuse  for  such a purpose would be likely to  damage\r\n\r\nthe  proper working of these centres. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  the Government considers that in cases where\r\n\r\nthere  are  medical grounds for  giving  advice  on\r\n\r\ncontraceptive   methods   to   married   women   in\r\n\r\nattendance at the centres, it may be given but that\r\n\r\nsuch  advice  should  be  limited  to  cases  where\r\n\r\nfurther pregnancy would be detrimental to health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the acute division of public\r\n\r\nopinion  on  the  subject  of  birth  control,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   decided  that  no   departmental\r\n\r\nsanction,   which   may   be   necessary   to   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  such clinics for  expectant  and\r\n\r\nnursing mothers, shall be given except on condition\r\n\r\nthat  contraceptive advice would be given  only  in\r\n\r\ncases  where further pregnancy would be detrimental\r\n\r\nto health.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It winds up:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Authority will be aware that the Departmental\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Maternal Mortality and Morbidity  in\r\n\r\ntheir final Report published in 1932 called special\r\n\r\nattention  to  the importance of the  avoidance  of\r\n\r\npregnancy by women suffering from organic  disease,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  tuberculosis,  heart  disease,  diabetes,\r\n\r\nchronic nephritis, etc. What is or is not medically\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  health  must  be  decided  by  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  judgment  of the  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner in charge of the clinics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions for and against the passing of this\r\n\r\nvote  to  the  Family Planning Association  take  a\r\n\r\nmultiple character. There is the economic view, the\r\n\r\nreligious  view, the political view and  the  anti-colonial view. Those who support the vote appear to\r\n\r\nme to put the cart before the horse, by saying that\r\n\r\nthe encouragement of so-called family planning will\r\n\r\nlessen squalor and poverty. I would suggest  to  my\r\n\r\nhon.   Friends   that  squalor  and   poverty   can\r\n\r\nunfortunately be found, but they are aspects of the\r\n\r\nsocial, economic and political problems, which were\r\n\r\nhanded over by our predecessors. Let me quote  from\r\n\r\na  booklet  entitled:  \"Is the  World  heading  for\r\n\r\nStarvation?\"  by  A.  G.  Doniforn,  M.A.,  Oxford,\r\n\r\nLecturer  in Political Economy, University  College\r\n\r\nof  London. He cites the proceedings of the  United\r\n\r\nNations  Scientific Conference on the  conservation\r\n\r\nand utilisation of resources as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In general, expert after expert concluded that it\r\n\r\nwas possible for the less wasteful use of resources\r\n\r\nto  fuller  application of existing techniques  and\r\n\r\nthe exploitation of new scientific developments  to\r\n\r\nsupport a far greater population than exists  today\r\n\r\nat a much higher level of living.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Again,  the  United Nations Food  and  Agricultural\r\n\r\nOrganisation Survey stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Many people who have given serious study to the\r\n\r\npopulation  problem prophesied  doom  for  much  of\r\n\r\nmankind unless the rate of population growth can be\r\n\r\ndrastically  checked. It is worth reiterating  that\r\n\r\nthe  fundamental  solution of the problem  lies  in\r\n\r\nincreasing  the productivity of the  individual  by\r\n\r\nputting at his disposal modern scientific knowledge\r\n\r\nand  the tools of modern technology. To the  extent\r\n\r\nthat  this is done, every individual can  become  a\r\n\r\nsource  of  new wealth to his country  and  to  the\r\n\r\nworld. To the extent that this is not done, he is a\r\n\r\npotential  liability,  unable  to  supply  his  own\r\n\r\nneeds,  let  alone helping to supply those  of  his\r\n\r\nfellow-beings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the conditions of the working\r\n\r\nclass are not improved by restricting the family to\r\n\r\nits  size  but  in providing it with the  needs  it\r\n\r\nrequires.  The question of a minimum  wage  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  considered as a matter of great urgency.  In\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, those who wish to cloak the  evils  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism and capitalism will support this grant.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  great mal-distribution of  wealth  in\r\n\r\nsociety, and families\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  asked  to restrict their size by objectionable\r\n\r\nmethods  with a subsidy from public funds. I  quote\r\n\r\nfrom  an  editorial from a Chinese daily,  the  Sin\r\n\r\nChew Jit Pao of the 21st July, 1954, when discussing\r\n\r\nthe  question  of the population of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nbirth  control.  The  article wound  up  with  this\r\n\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The main solution to the problem of population\r\n\r\nlies in scientific progress and improvement of  our\r\n\r\nsocial and economic system. If men can be united in\r\n\r\npeace  and help one another according to the  moral\r\n\r\nlaw of justice and mercy, the world will experience\r\n\r\nno  trouble in feeding a population ten times  more\r\n\r\nnumerous than the present one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems ironical that while, on the one hand, we\r\n\r\nare  told of squalor and poverty, on the other,  we\r\n\r\nare  also  told  of the wealth that this  beautiful\r\n\r\nisland  has produced and is producing. We admit  we\r\n\r\nhave  this wealth, yet we must also admit  we  have\r\n\r\nthis  poverty and this squalor. Yes,  we  have  the\r\n\r\ncubicles  of Chinatown and the Indian lines  around\r\n\r\nKeppel  Harbour.  We have the  attap  huts  of  our\r\n\r\nsquatters and the thousands of human beings huddled\r\n\r\nbehind  Havelock Road and the persons  of  whom  my\r\n\r\nhon.  Friend  spoke. In these areas people  suffer\r\n\r\nsqualor and poverty but, please note, not because as\r\n\r\nnormal human beings, they desire children, and once\r\n\r\nthey  have  them they can only support  them  with\r\n\r\ndifficulty. The reason is because, before our time,\r\n\r\nno  attempt  was made to see that the  people  were\r\n\r\nproperly housed and paid proper wages, and  because\r\n\r\ncolonial   economy   did  not  allow   for   normal\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. This is the problem now. This is\r\n\r\nour  heritage from the period fortunately now over,\r\n\r\nwhen  nominated and official individuals played  at\r\n\r\npolitics and thought that so-called family planning\r\n\r\ncould  be disguised as a radical social reform.  We\r\n\r\nare  now  asked to spend $85,000 of the  taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney  on  a  scheme which nowhere  has  given  any\r\n\r\nconclusive  proof that it can diminish squalor  and\r\n\r\npoverty  and which incorporates obnoxious practices\r\n\r\nwelcomed  only by a few and rejected  by  the  more\r\n\r\nnormal masses. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been said that no harm is done in the  use  of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives. Let me quote from a book  on  birth\r\n\r\ncontrol by Halliday Sutherland, M.D. - I am sorry  he\r\n\r\nis   not  a  relation  of  yours,  Mr  Sutherland!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- \"Medical Objections to Contraception\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All contraceptive methods of birth control are,\r\n\r\nin  the first place, unphysiological because, apart\r\n\r\naltogether  from preventing conception, they  either\r\n\r\nhinder or prevent the absorption of hormones  which\r\n\r\nmay   have  some  part  in  promoting  health   and\r\n\r\ncompatibility in marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Professor McIlroy of the London School of  Medicine\r\n\r\nfor  Women  considered it to be more  widely  known\r\n\r\nthat neuroses are largely the result of the use  of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives and also that in women the  maternal\r\n\r\npassion  is  even  stronger, for it  might  develop\r\n\r\nlater  than  sexual  passion and  would  ultimately\r\n\r\ndemand satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dame Mary Scharliet - this is from the British\r\n\r\nMedical Journal - said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An experience of well over forty years convinces\r\n\r\nme  that  the artificial limitation of  the  family\r\n\r\ncauses  damage  to  a woman's nervous  system.  The\r\n\r\ndamage  done is likely to show itself in  inability\r\n\r\nto  conceive when the restriction voluntarily  used\r\n\r\nis  abandoned because a couple desire  offspring ...\r\n\r\nSometimes  such  a  woman is not only  sterile  but\r\n\r\nnervous  and generally in poor health but the  more\r\n\r\ncommon  occurrence is that she remains fairly  well\r\n\r\nuntil  the  time  of the change of  life  when  she\r\n\r\nfrequently  suffers more on the nervous  side  than\r\n\r\ndoes a woman who has lived a natural married life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. James Young, D.S.O., M.D., F.R.C.S., said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Passing to the consideration of contraceptives,\r\n\r\nwe  have to note that harm to the genital canal can\r\n\r\nbe  produced  by  such methods  and  we  have  seen\r\n\r\ninfective lesions in which there was clear evidence\r\n\r\nof  such a casual agent. On this subject there  is\r\n\r\nurgent  room  for  further study  before  we  could\r\n\r\npretend to speak with authority. Indeed we are in a\r\n\r\nposition  of  having  allowed a gigantic  unhealthy\r\n\r\nsystem  possessing much of danger to  the  national\r\n\r\nhealth  to  go  up before our eyes almost  entirely\r\n\r\nunhealed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things that are preached by the\r\n\r\nFamily Planning Association is the taking advantage\r\n\r\nof  the sterile period of a woman, usually known as\r\n\r\nthe  \"safety period\". Amongst the religious  bodies\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  cited, there are  no  objections  to\r\n\r\nanything that does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontravene  the laws of nature. The  Catholics,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  feel much stronger about it and  say  that\r\n\r\nthat can only be used when necessary for the health\r\n\r\nof the mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the earnest desire and intention of this\r\n\r\nGovernment to give more medical, health and  social\r\n\r\nservices to the people. With this $85,000 much more\r\n\r\ngood can be done. I could probably build two first-class  maternity and child welfare clinics, or  the\r\n\r\nmoney  could  be utilised for much more  beneficial\r\n\r\nsocial  services than family planning. The  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  people's money for a purpose repugnant to them\r\n\r\nis bitterly resented by quite a large number of our\r\n\r\nconstituents.  What right have I or any  Member  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  vote for public assistance  to  an\r\n\r\nassociation  that strikes at the deepest  and  most\r\n\r\nsincere convictions of a large number of those  who\r\n\r\nelected   them?  If  we  in  this  House   consider\r\n\r\nourselves justified in riding roughshod over  their\r\n\r\nprofound beliefs and ignoring their earnest appeals\r\n\r\nto you, can we expect them to have any faith in the\r\n\r\ndemocracy which we are trying to uphold? As I have\r\n\r\nsaid  before, I respect everybody's views and I  am\r\n\r\nnot asking them to vote against family planning but\r\n\r\nagainst the use of the taxpayers' money and  I  ask\r\n\r\nyou  once again, hon. Members, no matter what  your\r\n\r\nviews  may  be,  which I respect, to  be  extremely\r\n\r\ncautious  before making your decision  and  not  to\r\n\r\nride  roughshod over the wishes of your voters  who\r\n\r\nput you into power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that international conference in Tokyo, the\r\n\r\nreports of the various family planning associations\r\n\r\nwere  brought up. I would just like to read to  you\r\n\r\nthe   American  report.  It  is  from  the  Planned\r\n\r\nParenthood    Federation    of    America,    which\r\n\r\nincorporates all its 49 States:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Both this Federation and its affiliates are\r\n\r\nsupported by voluntary contributions and fees  from\r\n\r\npersons  receiving service at the  centres.

The  total\r\n\r\nincludes more than a million dollars in income from\r\n\r\ncontributions.  Thus,  for  every  dollar  paid  by\r\n\r\npersons  served  in local family planning  centres,\r\n\r\nmore  than  three other dollars were  collected  in\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nways  to  operate the total programme.

It  is\r\n\r\nalso  a delicate question which, unless delicately\r\n\r\nhandled, could border on the burlesque.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to dispose of what I\r\n\r\nthink  is  the  principal  cause  of  this  lengthy\r\n\r\ndebate,  namely, the Catholic objection.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nproper  objection  for those who subscribe  to  the\r\n\r\nCatholic  faith. We have been told that  three  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the population in Singapore are Catholics.\r\n\r\nThey  have every right to voice their views and  to\r\n\r\nhave their representatives come to this Assembly to\r\n\r\npropagate  their point of view. We have to  respect\r\n\r\ntheir  point of view - as we should always do  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to remain a happy and tolerant society. But  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  fundamental question we must decide  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  are  a religious state  or  a  secular\r\n\r\nstate.  If we are a religious state, a state  based\r\n\r\non a particular God, whether a Roman Catholic, non-Roman  Catholic  or  Islamic God,  then  the  whole\r\n\r\nquestion  changes complexion. A state  based  on  a\r\n\r\nparticular  God  accepts  certain  axioms,  certain\r\n\r\nmiracles, and certain dogmas. But we hope to  build\r\n\r\nout of a multi-religious society a secular state in\r\n\r\nwhich  all  traditional  religions,  beliefs,   and\r\n\r\nphilosophies are allowed to go their own way and co-exist.  That is the only way out for us  in  Malaya\r\n\r\nand,  for  that  reason, we shall  start  with  the\r\n\r\nassumption  that we wish to found a secular  state.\r\n\r\nIf  we  wish  to found a state based on  Islam,  as\r\n\r\nPakistan has done, then the whole question takes on\r\n\r\na  different complexion altogether. Having  decided\r\n\r\nthat this is to be a secular state, we then put the\r\n\r\nRoman Catholic objection - quite a proper objection - into perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposition advanced is that you cannot\r\n\r\nspend  the  taxpayers' money to support  a  scheme,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  abhorrent  to  three  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation. That is one point of view. The Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health has explained how it is  that,\r\n\r\nin   spite  of  that  major  proposition,  one  his\r\n\r\nabattoirs  built with Government funds for  killing\r\n\r\npigs in a multi-religious society such as ours. His\r\n\r\nexplanation is that the majority of the people here\r\n\r\nare Chinese and, therefore, the small percentage of\r\n\r\nMuslims   (more  than  three  per   cent   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation)  do  not object to it because,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, they build their own abattoir where they\r\n\r\nslaughter  animals according to their  rites.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  I  may  pursue this  particular  line  of\r\n\r\nargument, I would say that if the Hon. the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health came to this Assembly with a proposal to\r\n\r\nset  up  some kind of institution for the Catholics\r\n\r\nwhich  he  feels  would  counterbalance  government\r\n\r\nexpenditure on family planning, I am sure it  would\r\n\r\nreceive a most sympathetic hearing in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another aspect of the problem which\r\n\r\nhe may have some difficulty in rationalising. There\r\n\r\nare  lots of conscientious objectors and I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  any  of them has ever raised the proposition\r\n\r\nthat  his  money  or  any of the  taxpayers'  money\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  spent on armament  because  it  is\r\n\r\nabhorrent to his particular belief. It has not been\r\n\r\nsuggested in Singapore yet, but we may yet have  an\r\n\r\nassociation  of conscientious objectors  who  might\r\n\r\nfind supporters in this Assembly, and then we would\r\n\r\nbe in a very difficult position when we come to the\r\n\r\nDefence Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even before we reach that fantastic\r\n\r\nsituation,  may I remind the Hon. the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  that  the Roman Catholics, as I  understand\r\n\r\ntheir tenets, object vehemently, and quite rightly,\r\n\r\nto  divorce,  because they hold  the  view  that  a\r\n\r\nmarriage  is  for life. Sir, I have not  heard  any\r\n\r\nchallenge on that portion of the Budget  which  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  spent on the divorce  courts.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of fact, Mr Chairman, Sir, quite a  number\r\n\r\nof Roman Catholic lawyers practise in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  divorce  courts. One has got  to  be  rational\r\n\r\nabout  these things, and these lawyers are. A Roman\r\n\r\nCatholic  lawyer, if he is asked to  appear  for  a\r\n\r\npetitioner  to  bring  about  the  wrecking  of   a\r\n\r\nmarriage,  will object. He will not appear.  It  is\r\n\r\nagainst  his  religious beliefs and, quite  rightly\r\n\r\nand properly, he refuses such a brief. No court has\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  compel him to prosecute  a  divorce\r\n\r\nbecause  the court respects his religious  beliefs.\r\n\r\nBut  he does appear on behalf of those against whom\r\n\r\na  divorce is sought, sometimes for good, sometimes\r\n\r\nfor  bad, reasons. What I wish to point out is that\r\n\r\nthe  whole  process is being financed by the  State\r\n\r\nout of State funds, which include the taxes paid by\r\n\r\nthe  three per cent Catholics, and that fundamental\r\n\r\npoint has not been challenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe very strongly in complete\r\n\r\nreligious  freedom. I believe that it is not  right\r\n\r\nthat  a  minority point of view - and it is  still  a\r\n\r\nminority  point  of  view - should  prevent  us  from\r\n\r\ngiving  support to what we consider right. Once  we\r\n\r\ndecide on that, this question of whether we can  or\r\n\r\ncannot  spend public money should be set  aside - and\r\n\r\nit  should be set aside the moment we have  decided\r\n\r\nthat  we are a non-religious and secular state,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  will of the majority as represented  by\r\n\r\nits   elected   representatives  is  the   deciding\r\n\r\nfactor - we  can then decide whether family  planning\r\n\r\nis  good  or  bad. If it is bad on the  merits,  we\r\n\r\nshall  not  give the money. If it is  good  on  the\r\n\r\nmerits, we shall give the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Health has been\r\n\r\ntroubled by a lot of arguments one way or the other\r\n\r\non  the  merits of family planning. There  are  two\r\n\r\ncontending  points of view. The one put forward  by\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Minister for Health is that you should\r\n\r\nleave nature alone and not tamper with it. You  can\r\n\r\nproduce  and reproduce and all you need  to  do  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  needs  of the increasing  population  is\r\n\r\nhigher productivity, harder work, putting right the\r\n\r\nsocial evils and, somehow or the other, things will\r\n\r\ncome  out  right. Man will triumph over nature  and\r\n\r\neverybody will flourish. The other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint  of  view most vehemently advocated  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck) is  that\r\n\r\nit  is  a  wicked  thing, this  procreation,  this\r\n\r\nprofligate  fecundity, and we will wind  up  in  a\r\n\r\nmass of slums if it is not checked. It has got  to\r\n\r\nbe  checked somehow, and the way to do  it  is  to\r\n\r\ngive  them  all  the proper preventives  so  that,\r\n\r\nwhilst  they  may  not be able  to  control  their\r\n\r\nnatural  instincts, they can at  least  avoid  the\r\n\r\nunpleasant consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think both points of view do not really\r\n\r\npose  the problem which the world faces. It is  a\r\n\r\nworld  problem,  and it is in that  world  context\r\n\r\nthat  each  individual  country  should  view  its\r\n\r\nproblem.  I think it is agreed that if  the  world\r\n\r\nkeeps  on  multiplying and you have limited  land,\r\n\r\nthere  must  mathematically speaking come  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  all the land is completely occupied,  either\r\n\r\nagriculturally, industrially or domestically.  One\r\n\r\nthen  begins  to  build upwards.  You  can  go  on\r\n\r\nbuilding upwards until you reach that point in the\r\n\r\nhemisphere  where human life could  no  longer  be\r\n\r\nmaintained. But whether it is an advantage to  any\r\n\r\nparticular  community, nation or race  to  restrict\r\n\r\nits  population, or  maintain  it  or  expand  it\r\n\r\ndepends  on  relative  factors.  It  depends  upon\r\n\r\ncertain  circumstances obtaining at any particular\r\n\r\nmoment. The circumstances are not absolute.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  subscribe to the view that one  can  multiply\r\n\r\noneself  ad infinitum and everything will  be  all\r\n\r\nright somehow or the other. Nor do I subscribe  to\r\n\r\nthe  opposing point of view that, unless one stops\r\n\r\nthis unfortunate multiplication of human lives, an\r\n\r\nunhappy  situation will arise and  there  will  be\r\n\r\nmore  slums in Paya Lebar for the Member for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar to worry about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if we approached this problem in a more\r\n\r\nacademic frame of mind, we would see that  whether\r\n\r\na  particular  nation  or  race  has  expanded  or\r\n\r\ncontracted  depends on many factors. When  Germany\r\n\r\nwas   expanding   her  territorial   claims,   her\r\n\r\nGovernment was confident that the right thing  was\r\n\r\nto  multiply. They believed that the  more  people\r\n\r\nthey  had  fighting on their side and holding  the\r\n\r\nsame beliefs, the greater were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir   chances  of  overwhelming  their  enemies.\r\n\r\nHitler,  quite rightly, gave prizes all  round  to\r\n\r\nmothers  who  were  able to  help  him  build  his\r\n\r\nmagnificent  Reich  which  was  going  to  last  a\r\n\r\nthousand  years. So did Mussolini in Italy.  There\r\n\r\nare  also  other  countries,  without  these  evil\r\n\r\nintentions,  like  Australia,  who  also  want  to\r\n\r\nincrease  their population. Given their particular\r\n\r\nconditions - a  large  land mass  with  ten   million\r\n\r\nEuropeans, and 600 million Chinese and nearly  100\r\n\r\nmillion  Japanese  to  the  North - it  is  in   the\r\n\r\ninterests of Australia militarily, politically and\r\n\r\nindustrially, too, to expand its population. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think the Australian Government will  support\r\n\r\nany  family  planning when it is  importing  large\r\n\r\nsections of population from Britain, and even from\r\n\r\nItaly.   Each   country   faces   its   particular\r\n\r\npopulation problem in a world context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you view birth control from the point of view\r\n\r\nof  the  individual, there are many factors coming\r\n\r\ninto  play - his religious beliefs, his approach  to\r\n\r\nlife,  his  general philosophy of life. If  people\r\n\r\nfind  a particular state of bliss in bachelorhood,\r\n\r\nthen  a very serious situation will arise for  the\r\n\r\ncountry   as  a  whole  if  everybody  becomes   a\r\n\r\nbachelor,  and  the Government  will  have  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething to remedy that. But for the time  being,\r\n\r\nI  do not think Mr Sutherland is really a problem\r\n\r\neither to the British Empire, to his Government or\r\n\r\neven to the Colony of Singapore -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> That is very generous of you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But there are countries where,\r\n\r\nas a result of industrialisation and a breeding of\r\n\r\na particular attitude and approach to life, either\r\n\r\nby  reduction of fertility rates or excessive  use\r\n\r\nof  contraceptives, the population has,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nbeen   decreasing   and  it  is   worrying   their\r\n\r\ngovernments considerably. The French Government is\r\n\r\nextremely  alarmed  at the tapering  down  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  pyramid.  Health  measures  are  good.\r\n\r\nPeople live longer. Less and less young people are\r\n\r\nbeing born to support more and more old people.  A\r\n\r\nvery  serious population problem arises where  you\r\n\r\nhave the inverted population pyramid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem must be viewed from a particular\r\n\r\nterritory's point of view, its particular economic,\r\n\r\nsocial  and geographical conditions. For  instance,\r\n\r\nif  we  want  to overwhelm the island  of  Sumatra,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  occupied by 200,000 people, and  we  say\r\n\r\nthere is gold, rubber and tin there and all we need\r\n\r\nis  a  strong  strapping  army  which  believes  in\r\n\r\nconquest,  then  the  proper  thing  to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nmultiply  our  population at the  fastest  possible\r\n\r\nspeed.  Train  up youth corps, put  them  in  brown\r\n\r\nshirts  or blue shirts, march them up and down,  and\r\n\r\naway  they  go  across to Sumatra to  found  a  new\r\n\r\nEmpire.  But  we are a small nation and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink   our  future  lies  in  military  conquests.\r\n\r\nNeither does our future lie in becoming a weak  and\r\n\r\nunbalanced society by having the population pyramid\r\n\r\ntapering  down and inverted. In fact, if  there  is\r\n\r\nany danger of that, the People's Action Party might\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  free vote on it. As a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nParty  I would very strenuously object to any birth\r\n\r\ncontrol if the population were going to taper  down\r\n\r\nin that way. Because I have very strong views about\r\n\r\nhaving  enough young people to do the work  when  I\r\n\r\nreach  that age when I stop working and want social\r\n\r\nsecurity benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, the population base is\r\n\r\nspreading  right out in Singapore.  It  is  one  of\r\n\r\nthose things that go by geometrical progression and\r\n\r\ngoing   at   a   terrific  speed.   The   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  have already  thrown  in  their\r\n\r\nhand. They say that it is a hopeless job. The  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health has not said that it is  a\r\n\r\nhopeless  job. He will cope with anything - with  two\r\n\r\ndistrict cottage hospitals at $85,000 - and he  says\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  not the slightest  danger  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation becoming too large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no need for us to expand it. All we\r\n\r\nneed  do  is  to  keep it steady - with  regular  age\r\n\r\ngroups  going  right up to the top.  For  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing,  I see no danger whatsoever of this  $85,000\r\n\r\nfor  the Family Planning Association upsetting  the\r\n\r\npopulation balance or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupsetting the economy or trade of the country.  All\r\n\r\nI  see in this $85,000 is a feeble attempt to bring\r\n\r\nthe  benefits of birth control methods to those who\r\n\r\nwish  to  have them - those who have six or seven  or\r\n\r\neight children and do not wish to have more but  do\r\n\r\nnot know how to prevent it. This $85,000 is a small\r\n\r\ndrop  in  the ocean. When the propagation of  birth\r\n\r\ncontrol  knowledge and methods becomes a social  or\r\n\r\nan economic problem by upsetting the population one\r\n\r\nway or the other, then we will have to come back to\r\n\r\nthis  House and review it. The whole problem  must\r\n\r\nbe viewed in the context of a particular society at\r\n\r\na  particular  time. The object  of  any  organised\r\n\r\nsociety  is  the pursuit of the happiness  and  the\r\n\r\nwell-being of all its peoples. My opinion is that,\r\n\r\nin  our  pursuit of this happiness,  we  should  do\r\n\r\nsomething to alleviate the sufferings and hardships\r\n\r\nof those who wish to avoid unduly large families by\r\n\r\nhaving the assistance of family planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France and even Great Britain have reached the\r\n\r\npoint  where they have childless couples throughout\r\n\r\nall  strata  of  society - people whose  attitude  to\r\n\r\nlife,  as  a  result  of their  civilisation,  have\r\n\r\nbecome  so personal and so introvert that  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to assume any responsibility. They  just\r\n\r\nlike  to  live  their own lives. But when  a  whole\r\n\r\nclass  of  people in a nation begins to adopt  that\r\n\r\nattitude,  as  they  have  in  France,   then   the\r\n\r\nGovernment becomes most concerned because it upsets\r\n\r\nthe whole population structure. We have not reached\r\n\r\nthat point yet. For the time being, with very great\r\n\r\nrespect  for the Catholics, I say there is no  harm\r\n\r\nin this subsidy to the Family Planning Association.\r\n\r\nIf there is any harm, we can review it. It is not a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  brushing aside a  Catholic  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  or  imposing  the view of  a  majority.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  is whether we, as Members of an  Assembly\r\n\r\nwhich  wants to establish a secular state, consider\r\n\r\nthis  in the best interests of the country for  the\r\n\r\ntime  being, not for all time. For the time  being,\r\n\r\nthere is no harm in it and we support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMuslims  say  religion  and politics  go  together.\r\n\r\nMahatma  Gandhi once said, \"I will do anything  and\r\n\r\neverything  at  the dictate of my  inner  voice  or\r\n\r\nreligion.\"  Now they are inseparable. There  is  no\r\n\r\nreason  why hon. Members cannot debate this subject\r\n\r\nbased  even  on  religion. Take, for  example,  the\r\n\r\nMuslims.  According  to their  religion,  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed to marry four wives -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> How many have you got?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

On the\r\n\r\nother hand, it is very difficult to have more  than\r\n\r\none wife if the religion is properly followed. Now,\r\n\r\nSir, according to that religion, it is not wise  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  births  unless it is for  health  reasons.\r\n\r\nMuslim  religion  is most rational  and  women  can\r\n\r\nalways  go to their doctors for advice where  their\r\n\r\nhealth is concerned. Because of this I support  the\r\n\r\nmotion that we should not contribute anything  from\r\n\r\nthe   taxpayers'  money  to  this  Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation. There will be many who will be willing\r\n\r\nto  give  voluntary support, as is being  done,  so\r\n\r\nsome hon. Members say, in India, Hongkong, and many\r\n\r\nother  countries.

If it is not doing a\r\n\r\nservice, then we should not spend a cent on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking on this subject not because I am a\r\n\r\nCatholic or because I am not a Catholic. I  am  not\r\n\r\ntackling  it from the point of view of religion.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to say that I will tackle it from a few other\r\n\r\nangles,  say  morals. Years ago, people  were  more\r\n\r\ncareful  about morals. We did not see much of  what\r\n\r\nwe  see today and people were happy. But today,  if\r\n\r\nwe  look  at  the younger generation, I  think  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  such  as  that  spread  by  the   Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Association, although it is meant for  the\r\n\r\ngrown-ups, very soon gets to the people who  should\r\n\r\nnot  get  that. That is where, I think, it  is  not\r\n\r\ndoing  a  service  to the people.  Morals  must  be\r\n\r\nwatched  and watched at all times. If a  nation  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be one that can lift its head up and  look\r\n\r\nforward towards progress, then morals is about  one\r\n\r\nof the most important things that we must watch out\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second point that I am going to raise\r\n\r\nwill be somewhat similar to the point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong  Pagar.  It  is  this.  Is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  now  to  teach birth  control?  Have  we\r\n\r\nreached   saturation  point  in   the   matter   of\r\n\r\npopulation?  Let us take ourselves back  to  a  few\r\n\r\ndecades from now, say, to the time between 1890 and\r\n\r\n1900.  At  that time Singapore was a  much  smaller\r\n\r\nplace -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not geographically, was it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> No, but from the economic\r\n\r\npoint  of view, and at that time, too, I think  the\r\n\r\nnational income was less.

Now,  if  national\r\n\r\nincome can increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  an increase in population, what does it point\r\n\r\nto?  Does it point to the fact that population  and\r\n\r\nincome are in inverse ratio to each other? It seems\r\n\r\nto  me  that they go parallel with each other until\r\n\r\nprobably  they reach the optimum. Have  we  reached\r\n\r\nthat optimum? I certainly feel that, although there\r\n\r\nis  an  imaginary  line drawn across  the  causeway\r\n\r\nsaying  that  this is Singapore  and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, I certainly do  not  believe\r\n\r\nthere are two separate territories. To you, to  me,\r\n\r\nand  to everybody living in this peninsula,  it  is\r\n\r\none   territory.  We  are  free  to  get  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  the people of the  Federation  are\r\n\r\nfree to come into Singapore. In the Federation  you\r\n\r\nwill  find  there  are large  tracts  of  land  not\r\n\r\ndeveloped. Their potentialities have not been fully\r\n\r\nexploited   and  if  they  have  not   been   fully\r\n\r\nexploited,  do  we  want  to  import  people   from\r\n\r\nelsewhere to help us exploit that land and  extract\r\n\r\nthe  riches  from underneath it, or is it  not  our\r\n\r\nduty  at the present moment to bring the population\r\n\r\nup  so that, in a short time to come, we will  have\r\n\r\nsons of the soil tilling the land and making use of\r\n\r\nit?  I  certainly feel that that point of  view  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be very important and any attempt to  stop\r\n\r\nthat   happening  would  not  be  in  the  national\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there has been an outcry from the very\r\n\r\nlearned   Member   the  Hon. the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works who said that we have  all\r\n\r\nthe  ills of the world in Singapore. We have  slums\r\n\r\nright behind this Assembly House and in front of it\r\n\r\nand all over Singapore, and we have families having\r\n\r\nchildren  ranging  from ten to fifteen  probably - he\r\n\r\nquoted  an  instance  of one family  with  thirteen\r\n\r\nchildren.  Yes,  it  was indeed  a  very  miserable\r\n\r\npicture,  but  I think that argument in  favour  of\r\n\r\nfamily  planning will not hold water. We  must  say\r\n\r\nthat  all this misery has been due to budgets being\r\n\r\nwrongly  framed thirty to forty years ago,  whereby\r\n\r\nthe  people did not get a fair deal. If the budgets\r\n\r\nhad  been  correctly framed, then we would probably\r\n\r\nnot  have  so much of the misery we see  today.  If\r\n\r\nhousing had been planned in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  year 1900, probably we would today all have  a\r\n\r\nhouse  at  a rental of, say, $20 a month. If  there\r\n\r\nhad  been  planning  for  schools,  then  we  would\r\n\r\nprobably have no problem of school children  coming\r\n\r\nto  us asking, \"Where can I get a place?\" Now,  all\r\n\r\nthese  ills are not due to the fault of the present\r\n\r\ngeneration  but due to previous administrations.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  can  still remedy such  ills  and,  by\r\n\r\nsetting  up an accelerated rate of social services,\r\n\r\nwe can catch up. We definitely can catch up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of a big family of\r\n\r\nthirteen,  it  strikes me that if we ever  talk  of\r\n\r\nsuch conditions, we must be there to witness it.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe  that a family of  thirteen  could\r\n\r\nconsist  of one, say, two months old, the next  one\r\n\r\neight months old, the next twelve months old and so\r\n\r\non! Even if you step up the ages and say they range\r\n\r\nfrom one year to two years, three, four, etc. until\r\n\r\nthirteen,   it   would  be  an  almost   impossible\r\n\r\nsituation.  I have been going round the  rural  and\r\n\r\nslum  areas, and have looked at families large  and\r\n\r\nsmall,  and  I have always seen that if  there  are\r\n\r\neight members in the family where the youngest  one\r\n\r\nis,  say,  a  year old, then the oldest  one  would\r\n\r\nprobably be at an age where he is able to earn  his\r\n\r\nor her own living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point of view is this. I do not like the\r\n\r\nidea  of families that have only one child  or  two\r\n\r\nchildren.  Do you know of cases where there  is  an\r\n\r\nonly  child in the family? It is most pampered  and\r\n\r\nselfish  and feels that it must have its  own  way.\r\n\r\nBut  if I look at a large family, I see that  there\r\n\r\nis  more  give  and  take. There  is  more  sharing\r\n\r\nbetween them. It is indeed developing a spirit that\r\n\r\nis   definitely  good  for  the  community  and   I\r\n\r\ncertainly  feel that we should not discourage  them\r\n\r\nbut  we  should assist them - not by giving  them  an\r\n\r\nIron  Cross or a Silver Cross - but assist them  with\r\n\r\nmore social services -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> What is there to stop them from\r\n\r\nworking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> This is a very serious matter.\r\n\r\nYou  all say that it is a very serious matter,  and\r\n\r\nyou are all laughing about it -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
