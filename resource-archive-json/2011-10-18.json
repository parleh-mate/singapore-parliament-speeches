Moral\r\neducation is the basics of education. Our education system has all\r\nalong emphasised academic performance, with students' future employment\r\nas the target. Some employers said that their staff's examination\r\nresults and EQ are not in line, and they also noticed that some\r\nyoung people and students lack compassion, are self-centred and\r\ninconsiderate. I am not sure if our education system has neglected\r\nthis aspect, or it is inevitable that every city or country is bound\r\nto have this kind of citizens. Nonetheless, I support MOE's new\r\ndirection to emphasise character and values. Of course, to create\r\nthe environment to promote a holistic education, besides the school, parents\r\nmust also play an important role. If parents' behaviour contradicts\r\nthe values that are taught in school, teachings by the school will\r\nhave limited effect.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4facb1b2-3430-4782-b38d-bfb9604ffd4b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-4facb1b2-3430-4782-b38d-bfb9604ffd4b\"><!--a--></a>I believe most people agree\r\nwith MOE's new direction of placing emphasis on character and values\r\neducation.

This shows that divorce rate in China is fast catching\r\nup with that in the Western countries. In Taiwan, the birth rate\r\nis even lower than Singapore, with a total fertility rate (TFR)\r\nof less than 1 in 2010. According to a <em class=\"ph i\">Straits Times'</em> report\r\non 10 October 2011, there was a reversal of this trend only after\r\nthe Taiwanese Government offered financial incentives to encourage\r\ncouples to have children.

I am pleased that the Ministry of Education announced last\r\nmonth that they would re-emphasise the importance of values and character\r\nbuilding in schools. Thus, parents, schools, clan associations and\r\nreligious organisations must also play a more active role in preserving\r\nand advocating our time-tested traditional values by working closely\r\nwith community organisations.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fc807ce5-739b-4905-8a2e-04cb96b81761\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-fc807ce5-739b-4905-8a2e-04cb96b81761\"><!--a--></a>\tMr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\nlike to proceed to the next topic on housing policies. We have done\r\nwell by providing affordable housing for our citizens. Home ownership\r\nis the pillar of our country's success. Many countries and the United\r\nNations have sent representatives to study our public housing. During\r\nmy weekly house visits, many older blue-collar workers, such as\r\nfactory workers and taxi drivers, lamented that they used to be\r\nable to pay their 5-room HDB housing loan in less than 20 years\r\nbut now, their graduate children could hardly afford a 4-room flat.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-555ed4c9-7f26-44ad-bae3-31379a3eada0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-555ed4c9-7f26-44ad-bae3-31379a3eada0\"><!--a--></a>Currently, prices of new\r\nHDB flats are largely influenced by that of resale flats in the open\r\nmarket. In recent years, resale flat prices have risen sharply,\r\nperhaps due to the increasing housing demand of new immigrants.\r\nTo ensure that more young couples and first-time flat buyers can\r\nafford their new flats, the Government could consider lowering the\r\nprice of new 3- and 4-room flats or provide more subsidies. Those\r\nwho want to buy flats with higher subsidies will have to meet more\r\nstringent criteria, such as longer minimum occupation period of,\r\nsay, 15 years as compared to the current five years. Otherwise,\r\nbuyers of such flats will have to return the additional subsidies\r\nif they sell their flats between five to 15 years of occupation.\r\nSuch scheme could help to stabilise the prices of new 3-4 room HDB\r\nflats.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-078b04b5-bb41-4e62-be19-7deba4c4b6fe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-078b04b5-bb41-4e62-be19-7deba4c4b6fe\"><!--a--></a>Many Singaporeans merely\r\nconsider their HDB flat to serve as a roof over their head rather\r\nthan use it as a means to encash and earn quick profit. At the same\r\ntime, they also do not want to become a slave to their house and\r\nspend their entire working life paying off the housing loan. This\r\ntype of highly subsidised flats with more stringent requirements\r\ncan then serve their needs. Those who prefer to encash their flats\r\nafter five years will have to pay the current price and accept the\r\nexisting requirements. Our housing policy is the jewel of Government's\r\npolicies.

In contrast,\r\nthe current policy direction is to \"let a hundred flowers bloom\"\r\nand thus, different management boards of SPED schools tend to have\r\ndiffering visions and expectations of their students.

The bus driver was probably also equally\r\nhappy as he did not have to carry many passengers and risk passengers' complaints.\r\nThe bus company was also probably happy if it was paid the same\r\nfor the trips operated regardless of the number of passengers on\r\nboard the bus like the bus operators in London. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-456fd670-cd56-4310-b722-7a46fdcab661\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-456fd670-cd56-4310-b722-7a46fdcab661\"><!--a--></a>However, the local government\r\nsubsidising the bus company would unlikely be happy as it was not\r\nthe best use of resources.

We should give them\r\nthat dignity and that support.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5a01c9c1-4a8c-48b0-ba17-062112e394e6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-5a01c9c1-4a8c-48b0-ba17-062112e394e6\"><!--a--></a>We support families through\r\nour ComCare network which provides a very strong foundation to assist\r\nfamilies who are in need.

For example, we had recently enhanced the Public Assistance\r\nScheme and ComCare Financial Assistance schemes for childcare and\r\nkindergarten. But needs are never constant. New challenges and circumstances\r\ndevelop and we need to ensure that our outreach and assistance schemes\r\nare relevant and useful in meeting these new needs. We need to look\r\nat three areas.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3346fe79-8d6c-4422-a9ce-bea2c13a699b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-3346fe79-8d6c-4422-a9ce-bea2c13a699b\"><!--a--></a>First, like many MPs, I,\r\ntoo, feel that it is important for us to ensure that those who need\r\nhelp receive them. We also cannot ignore the needs of emerging groups\r\nand those at the margins. Greater flexibility in providing assistance,\r\nincluding supporting initiatives at the local level, which can be\r\nmore easily tailored and customised to local needs, are some of\r\nthe ways to address these needs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-64284df7-be90-4129-af87-c9214609fab3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-64284df7-be90-4129-af87-c9214609fab3\"><!--a--></a>Second, in providing assistance\r\nfor the needy, we should also strive for a no-wrong-door policy,\r\nmeaning that those in need will get the help regardless of which\r\ndoor they go through. We recognise that our needy sometimes do not\r\nknow where to turn to for help, and it is often frustrating to be\r\nreferred to multiple agencies, or worse, to fall through the cracks.\r\nWe need better coordination among the various touchpoint agencies that\r\nare serving our needy. The focus is to better integrate the service\r\ndelivery, placing the needy at the heart of our policy design and\r\nservice delivery. To do this, we will continue to leverage on existing\r\nplatforms, such as the ComCare Local Network. Such networks encourage\r\nsocial service agencies to deliver complementary services and share\r\nideas and experiences to serve the needy more holistically and effectively.\r\nWe will better synchronise our assistance to the needy through closer\r\npartnership with key touchpoints agencies, such as the CDCs, FSCs,\r\nCCCs, as well as the larger community. Our grassroots leaders and\r\nvolunteers play a critical role in this regard, through their knowledge\r\nof and ties with their residents. Together, those efforts will help\r\nus move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to one which is more\r\nfamily-centric and flexible, to better serve the needs of at-risk\r\nfamilies.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 169</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f64a4c35-98d7-4a49-8c7a-5ce79c98f78f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-f64a4c35-98d7-4a49-8c7a-5ce79c98f78f\"><!--a--></a>Sir, third, we need to look\r\nat how better to measure our outcomes beyond just the numbers, so\r\nthat we have a more comprehensive indication of how we have helped families.\r\nWe should also start measuring how families have managed to stand\r\non their own two feet as indicators.

I agree with\r\nthem that our families are and should always remain a core pillar\r\nof support. But I have also seen how families struggle to take care\r\nof their frail elderly or disabled members. With an ageing population\r\nand smaller families, the pressures on caregivers will escalate\r\nand the Government should provide more support to families, otherwise we\r\nwill need more hospitals and nursing homes or we will see more neglected\r\nelderly. I also agree with other hon.

One critical area that we need to look at is how\r\nto provide more accessible home-care and community-based services\r\nfor the elderly. This is one sector that is under-developed and\r\nunder-resourced. We need a seamless continuum of health and social\r\nhome and community support services to help our elderly age in place. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-26851177-00f9-45e3-8aa6-1e1f957a6e99\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-26851177-00f9-45e3-8aa6-1e1f957a6e99\"><!--a--></a>Let me just come to the\r\nnext point. Well, Sir, to do so, it would be useful for us to look at\r\nthe subsidies for home-based care, something that I have also spoken\r\non in previous sessions of Parliament. The way our health care subsidies\r\nare structured today encourages families to put their frail elderly\r\nin institutions, as they get a higher level of subsidy. Therefore,\r\nit is important that we take a closer look at this and explore providing more\r\nsubsidies for home-based care, if we truly want to ensure ageing\r\nin place for our elderly. We also need more accessible and affordable\r\nmedical, nursing and physiotherapy services at home.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 170</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3081f921-b55b-4ddb-a19c-0652716a1451\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-3081f921-b55b-4ddb-a19c-0652716a1451\"><!--a--></a>Another important area that\r\nis not well-provided for today is respite care for caregivers, which\r\nseeks to relieve the stresses of caregiving and support their well-being.\r\nOften we focus so much on the frail elderly that we forgot about\r\nthe needs and well-being of those taking care of them. Increasingly,\r\nthese caregivers are also ageing and are in need of medical care\r\nthemselves. I am glad to say, Sir, that this is one area in MCYS\r\nthat I am working on, in partnership with the Ministry of Health\r\nand we are exploring a range of solutions to support care at home\r\nand in the community. This includes assistive technology and home\r\nmodification.

The Government feels that it\r\nis doing a lot and indeed it is doing so much more than other governments\r\nin taking care of its people, a positive feedback which I get all\r\nthe time when I meet people at the International Labour Organization\r\n(ILO). Yet, Singaporeans feel that we are not doing enough or do not\r\ncare enough. This gap has arisen not only because of the social\r\nmedia. It has been building up for some time and I feel that one\r\nof the problems could be because of the way we are communicating\r\nwith the people. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-423b7dc4-c8a8-4aaa-917e-55078f53a4b7\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-423b7dc4-c8a8-4aaa-917e-55078f53a4b7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1f05ef58-aa94-4515-be5c-26fd759277b1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-1f05ef58-aa94-4515-be5c-26fd759277b1\"><!--a--></a>The Government knows very\r\nwell why certain options cannot work because it has thought through\r\nthe issues thoroughly and this Government does not believe in making promises\r\nthat it cannot fulfil.

The step\r\ntaken by the Ministry of Manpower recently in sharing some labour-related\r\ninformation that was not previously released is a step in the right\r\ndirection. Previously, when such information is not revealed, for\r\nexample, the unemployment rate of citizens, it led to all kinds\r\nof bizarre speculations, which over time people began to believe\r\nis the truth. I feel that we need to find a better way to communicate,\r\nand be prepared to share more information so that in this way we\r\ncould also help people to understand issues better, and to debate\r\nin a rational, informed and balanced manner.

Many parents\r\nare now putting emphasis on their children's education and make\r\nthe necessary provisions to meet their children's education needs.\r\nIn addition, the number of Malay families who send their elderly parents\r\nto nursing homes is small. This is because they believe that the\r\nresponsibility of taking care of parents will bring blessings to\r\nthe family.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 171</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-958ddae3-8b12-4d38-9c86-f90a6cee13f6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-958ddae3-8b12-4d38-9c86-f90a6cee13f6\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Malay families\r\nare also increasingly aware of the initiatives being done by Malay/Muslim\r\nbodies through the Community Leaders' Forum.

It also denotes a model of economic growth\r\nthat favours the creation of equal opportunities for employment\r\nrather than just a system of wealth redistribution. This is achieved\r\nby the provision of an adequate framework of enablers such as quality education,\r\nhousing, healthcare that is accessible to each and every one of\r\nus. Wealth redistribution alone will ultimately fail to equalise\r\nincomes and reduce inequality. The Government in its wisdom has\r\nbeen pursuing such a policy for many years and our people have benefited\r\nfrom this vision of economic development, a vision which some less\r\nthan enlightened governments are now beginning to embrace. However,\r\nin a rapidly changing and growing economy like ours, despite our\r\nbest efforts to equalise the playing field, the more nimble amongst\r\nus will sprint ahead and some of us may be left breathless.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8bee2e48-63a6-47fb-897c-e83847698f27\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-8bee2e48-63a6-47fb-897c-e83847698f27\"><!--a--></a> Do we then slow the pace\r\nof the race so that everyone can keep up?

The villain of the piece it seems to me is not economic\r\ngrowth in itself but rather how it reaches different segments of\r\nour society. I welcome the recent remarks by my Parliamentary and\r\nGRC colleague Mr Chan Chun Sing who spoke on wide-ranging measures\r\nthat his Ministry intends to introduce to strengthen our social\r\nsafety net and, in particular, the renewed focus on families who are\r\nat risk and the efforts to champion the family man. I was further\r\nheartened by Dr Amy Khor's remarks yesterday about the need to beef\r\nup welfare assistance. However, we are all well aware of this. There\r\nare still many families who continued to struggle financially in\r\nspite of the many helping hands that are available to them.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-255db832-9b10-47ca-8571-d15c253d638f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-255db832-9b10-47ca-8571-d15c253d638f\"><!--a--></a> For my work with financially\r\ntroubled families, both within my constituency of Queenstown and\r\nelsewhere, I sense that in our country many families fall into economic difficulties\r\nnot because the system has denied them the opportunity to provide\r\nfor themselves but often because of a specific catastrophic and\r\noften unexpected trigger such as business failure, indebtedness\r\nof various causes, debilitating illnesses, incarceration or divorce.\r\nVarious assistance schemes, whether governmental or voluntary, mainly\r\nhelp to keep the families or the heads of these families above water rather\r\nthan to propel them gently towards the shore. The risk with this\r\nmainly supportive approach is that many families may, in fact, become\r\nentangled in a poverty trap that may slowly spiral into a cycle\r\nof poverty which succeeding generations will find themselves difficult\r\nto extricate themselves from.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 173</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-256da30f-a004-4be8-bae5-3259a8901145\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-256da30f-a004-4be8-bae5-3259a8901145\"><!--a--></a> Medical professionals have\r\nlong recognised that for most illnesses early and aggressive intervention\r\nis often the best way to effect a complete cure, reduce complications\r\nor the very least facilitate good long-term control of the condition.\r\nI think that some military strategists and business leaders will\r\nalso expound a similar philosophy.

How big\r\nor how small should Government be. Meaning to what extent should\r\nthe State directly intervene and provide for its citizens. The arguments\r\nfor and against big government are well known to us. Big government\r\nprovides greater security for its citizens from all manner of traps,\r\nbe it economic or social. But they come at a high cost, not only\r\nphysically but also in regard to a perceived diminution in active\r\ncitizenship. Many governments that have advocated smaller governments\r\nin the past have often ended with the contrary, due to political\r\npressures and they are now finding it increasingly difficult to\r\nafford such largesse as we are now witnessing in the physical tribulations\r\nof many Western economies.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3a65ba37-eeec-4fc8-a155-11b28946303f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-3a65ba37-eeec-4fc8-a155-11b28946303f\"><!--a--></a> In Singapore, we encourage\r\na partnership between the Government and citizens to address a whole\r\nspectrum of social challenges. We, as a country, have always been mindful\r\nof the trap of welfare but in an increasing globalised world with\r\never more capricious economic cycles, perhaps this Government will\r\nhave to be big wherever and whenever it needs to be. For those stricken\r\nfamilies I spoke about earlier, a more direct, perhaps more comprehensive,\r\nand a more generous aid package should be offered as early as possible\r\nand continue until they are out of harm's way. But the Government need\r\nnot be alone in this and neither does assistance always have to\r\nbe in the form of a handout. In fact, many of these families have\r\nindicated to me that they were willing to and able to pay back the\r\nsum of money that they needed to get back on their feet, only that\r\nthere was nowhere to turn to for this sort of financial aid. Just\r\nto give some examples, one elderly couple whose son has just gone\r\nto prison was trying to save their son's flat. The husband was still\r\nworking but needed a short-term loan to pay off some debts and arrears,\r\na loan that they needed and could well pay back given time but which they\r\ncould not get. Another young woman has just delivered a beautiful\r\nbaby girl when her husband suddenly left and despite maximum assistance\r\nfrom the various agencies, she was still unable to provide optimally\r\nfor herself and her children. She would have appreciated a small\r\nloan to get herself and her family back more quickly on their feet\r\nand she intended to go back to work as soon as her baby was a little\r\nbit older.

Many Singaporeans,\r\nespecially the poor, worry greatly about falling ill. They are concerned\r\nnot just about the painful treatment they will have to go through\r\nbut more often about the high costs involved, and the financial\r\nburden that may place on their already struggling children. In Singapore, Government\r\nsubsidies make up only a quarter of total health expenditure. Out-of-pocket expenses,\r\nemployer benefits and private insurance make up most of the remainder.\r\nThe much-vaunted \"3Ms\" of Medisave, MediShield and Medifund pay\r\nfor less than 10% of total healthcare expenses, the lion's share\r\nof which comes from Medisave, which is really patients' own savings.\r\nMediShield is a self-funding insurance scheme, which members pay\r\npremiums to join. These premiums rise as they grow older. They also have\r\nto fork out large deductibles and co-insurance before receiving\r\npay-outs, and the coverage ends at age 85. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 176</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-79996604-73f8-4720-8dfd-06f0af745f34\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-79996604-73f8-4720-8dfd-06f0af745f34\"><!--a--></a>The Government will say\r\nthat we have Medifund.

In the past 10 years, the HDB had grossly\r\nunder-supplied new housing units to the market. According to figures\r\nfrom the HDB, between 2001 and 2009, an average of just 7,700 new\r\nflats was built each year. This was far short of the average annual\r\nresident household growth figure of 24,280 since 2005. Even when the\r\npopulation surged from 2007 onwards, because of the liberalisation\r\nof our immigration policies, the Government failed to react by building\r\nmore flats for our people. Instead, they permitted more cash-rich\r\nforeigners to purchase almost any types of private property, which\r\nincreased their prices and pulled up the HDB flat prices, since the\r\ntwo are linked. This combination of low supply and high demand resulted\r\nin a severe housing shortage, causing a sharp and sustained rise\r\nin property prices. HDB resale flat prices are now 92% higher than\r\nthey were 10 years ago. This has not only caused much distress for\r\nmany Singaporean families but has also created potential asset bubble which\r\ncould severely damage Singapore's economy in a downturn. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-2e63791e-eff7-4d79-9c4f-fd41f444ea98\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-2e63791e-eff7-4d79-9c4f-fd41f444ea98\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-71481743-2e35-4232-b386-afcb363941f4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-71481743-2e35-4232-b386-afcb363941f4\"><!--a--></a>The Government finally woke\r\nfrom its slumber this year and ramped up the supply of Build-to-Order\r\n(BTO) flats to an expected 25,000 this year and another 25,000 next year.\r\nThis is a move in the right direction. However, BTO flats do not\r\nsolve the immediate housing problem, because it takes up to two\r\nto three years before the new flat owners get their keys.

In March this year, just before the General Election\r\nwas announced, SMRT and SBS Transit said they would add 590 additional\r\nMRT train trips. This was expected to ease the squeeze on trains.\r\nHowever, many regular commuters will testify that the trains now\r\nseem even more crowded than ever. The recently-opened Circle Line\r\nmay improve the situation nearer the city, but for those commuting\r\nfrom the suburbs like Sembawang and Simei, finding room to board\r\nthe trains will still be a challenge. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 178</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d12286ed-fa00-45b6-ad80-2ee3ab42aef2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-d12286ed-fa00-45b6-ad80-2ee3ab42aef2\"><!--a--></a>One key factor that affects\r\nthe train loads is the waiting time. I understand that the current\r\nsignalling systems on the ageing North-South and East-West lines\r\nallow for maximum train arrival intervals of about two minutes without\r\ncompromising commuter safety. But if the trains really arrive once\r\nevery two minutes, the overcrowding problem would not be so severe.\r\nUnfortunately, this is seldom the case. Outside of the narrow window\r\nof about half an hour on weekday mornings and evenings, the frequency\r\ndrops to three to five minutes, or even more. This results in trains\r\narriving packed with passengers, making it impossible for many of\r\nthose on the platform to board. As a daily commuter myself, I often\r\nhave to wait two, sometimes three, trains to pass by before I can\r\nboard, during the morning and evening rush hours. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-25efce55-266a-4ebe-9157-70095b7a06e0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-25efce55-266a-4ebe-9157-70095b7a06e0\"><!--a--></a>Sir, if the Government is\r\nserious about encouraging our people to drive less and use more\r\npublic transport, it must give priority to tackling the overcrowding\r\nproblem on trains. The solution lies not only in building more lines\r\nbut making better use of existing lines by increasing train frequency\r\nand maintaining that frequency for longer periods, especially during\r\npeak periods. Why can the MRT operators not maintain a train interval of\r\ntwo minutes from, let us say, 7.00 am to 9.00 am, and from 5.00\r\npm to 8.00 pm? Is it because of technical constraints, or is it\r\nbecause it would increase their costs and reduce their profits? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c0dad39e-0cf9-434a-9aca-65fe99dfe99d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c0dad39e-0cf9-434a-9aca-65fe99dfe99d\"><!--a--></a>Under the current profit-maximising\r\nmodel, operators are incentivised to cut costs and service levels\r\njust to maintain their high margins.

I believe there is still a gap that we should try\r\nto close and maybe we can do more.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 181</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ffda7bdb-3645-4b9e-a506-0b0a004879cd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-ffda7bdb-3645-4b9e-a506-0b0a004879cd\"><!--a--></a>If I may clarify, Mr Speaker,\r\nSir, there are many reasons for this. But I would like to focus\r\non two key points in my speech today, on how we can chart our route\r\nforward. First, we need to take a fresh new look at our current\r\napproach while taking into this recent backdrop of new expectations\r\nfrom a changing electorate; and, second, Singaporeans need to reflect\r\nabout coming forward and taking the best of what has been created\r\nfor them.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-03e61f82-9528-45f4-90f3-24f2e7ab846a\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-03e61f82-9528-45f4-90f3-24f2e7ab846a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-acd02013-7bcd-4834-85b8-8092374e280e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-acd02013-7bcd-4834-85b8-8092374e280e\"><!--a--></a>Since the 2009 financial\r\ncrisis, socio-economic changes have drastically changed the way\r\ncompanies conduct their business. Take employment practices, for\r\nexample, many now prefer to hire on contract and short-term basis.\r\nEven in the area of entrepreneurship, a growing trend is social\r\nand green entrepreneurship which was unheard of 10 years ago, has\r\nnow become something of a buzz and in-thing. We need to be mindful\r\nthat such socio-economic changes are taking place, and we should\r\nalso reconsider our current practices and focus. Entrepreneurship\r\nitself is not age biased. In fact, increasingly we read media reports\r\nabout Singaporeans leaving corporate jobs to strike out on their\r\nown. Neither are entrepreneurs one hit wonders and many may fold and\r\ncome back, rising again. There is great potential in tapping this\r\nwisdom of this growing segment of Singaporeans who are now seeking,\r\npossibly, a second career in their lives and for those who were\r\nburnt during the crisis, it may be a second chance for them to start\r\nup again.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4cb3ac6d-9185-42cc-9cf8-44270686f8a3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-4cb3ac6d-9185-42cc-9cf8-44270686f8a3\"><!--a--></a>A rising segment of Singaporeans\r\nare becoming entrepreneurs also later in their age; some maybe late\r\nbloomers, some in their late 30s, 40s or even older. And we hear famous\r\nstories like McDonalds' founder, Ray Kroc, started McDonalds in\r\nhis 50s. So some may be trying to rise from a business failure and\r\ndecided to start up a new business to ride the upturn, say, post-2009\r\nafter the crisis. Our present entrepreneur environment may have\r\ncovered a lot of the key bases but there are many who still fall through\r\nthe cracks. I believe the systems still need some tweaking and refinement.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5f0ead5d-d7f1-431c-8e9f-38914fcf40e9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-5f0ead5d-d7f1-431c-8e9f-38914fcf40e9\"><!--a--></a>Let me share a story that\r\nillustrates my point. Just recently, I got to know this two-man\r\nweb design company that has been in operation for six years. Business\r\nwas not that great but they made enough for the two to get by. It\r\nhelped that they have some good clients, notable list of clients\r\n\u2013 some Government-linked and some MNCs. What happened was one of\r\nthe business owners decided to have a second child and the revenue\r\nhe was earning from his set-up was no longer sufficient. Times were\r\nbad and the family struggled to make ends meet. And the business\r\nowner could no longer get any access to loans because his company\r\nwas, in a way, a sole-proprietorship. He could not get grants either\r\nbecause in order to make any claim under the scheme, they have to\r\nspend first and then get reimbursed later. That is tough on the\r\ncash-flow. As his business was not a new invention, he could not\r\nget any start-up funds nor were any VCs interested. The point is\r\nthat he did not want to give up his dreams of being a business owner.\r\nBut he had to. And the funny thing was that he was also not allowed\r\nto renew his sole-proprietor licence because he could not top-up\r\nhis Medisave. Neither his client list nor track record helped. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 182</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6aa142ef-b00b-4951-8858-278da3443acf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-6aa142ef-b00b-4951-8858-278da3443acf\"><!--a--></a>But just to clarify that\r\nfor start-up grants, they cannot be seen as a welfare fund. That is\r\nan important point for entrepreneurs or aspiring ones to note. Grants\r\nshould not be the top priority to decide if they will start a business.\r\nAs long as their business can be differentiated from their competitors\r\nand to be able to differentiate themselves within the industry,\r\nthere is a possibility that it can be supported, and should be supported. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-24dac74e-4e23-403e-9f48-b90cb74dc60b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-24dac74e-4e23-403e-9f48-b90cb74dc60b\"><!--a--></a>Now, I know that this would\r\nnot have been the first hard luck story my fellow colleagues in\r\nthis House would have heard of. Many of you may have heard of other similar\r\nstories. The point I would like to make is that the social stigma\r\nof a business failure in Singapore can sometimes be as bad as that\r\nof a HIV carrier's or an ex-convict's. So, more can and should be\r\ndone to change these societal attitudes and reverse this risk-averse\r\nculture. But it is going to take time. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8de53c21-f249-4a7f-92e0-e22b4336c3f3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-8de53c21-f249-4a7f-92e0-e22b4336c3f3\"><!--a--></a>This attitudinal change\r\nshould also start with some of our Government agencies. Someone\r\nrecently related to me the story of a start-up trying to secure\r\na major project in a developing country. The company went to one\r\nof our Government agencies for advice, but only to be frowned upon\r\nand asked to answer why an \"unheard of\" company like them was trying\r\nto secure such a large project. The company, incidentally, was a newbie\r\nin the new eco-business with in-house R&amp;D specialists and employees\r\nwith the right experience. But it was just that it was a start-up,\r\nso with very little track record. Needless to say, nothing came\r\nout of that conversation.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8141004c-f9ab-4993-ae5d-7faffae9de1a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-8141004c-f9ab-4993-ae5d-7faffae9de1a\"><!--a--></a>But then there are good\r\nagencies. And for this same company, another Government agency took\r\na completely different approach, and introduced them to other relevant Government\r\nagencies and let them showcase their credentials. This, in turn,\r\nled the company to the right contacts. And in just a few months,\r\nthe company managed to secure a test pilot project technology here\r\nand overseas too. Currently, the company still does not qualify\r\nfor any R&amp;D grants because it is still too new. And the fact\r\nis that we want to bet on companies that have a clear track record,\r\nand it will always be difficult. So we have to broaden the outreach\r\nto identify companies and not just bet on winners because in business\r\nthere is no sure winner anyway. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a2fb0ca6-ffcf-4378-af77-c73fa6b47d06\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a2fb0ca6-ffcf-4378-af77-c73fa6b47d06\"><!--a--></a>This episode highlights\r\nthe importance of a two-way relationship, the trust and the confidence\r\nbetween private and public sectors. We can do more than just infrastructure and\r\nfunding support. Similarly, the private sector must also be ready\r\nto step forward and work with the Government. It is all about a\r\nchange of mindset on both sides towards supporting each other. It\r\ncannot be more true between the Government and the people itself.\r\nAs the President has said in his Address, \"The Government will reach\r\nout to all Singaporeans to help them get good jobs, own their homes,\r\nand see their children gain confidence and blossom. But the Government\r\ncannot, and should not, try to do everything by itself.

We must constantly\r\nreview feedback and work hand-in-hand with the private sector to\r\nimprove the administration of funding, grants and loans to SMEs\r\nor even early business start-ups. We did not over-engineer and we\r\nmay not need huge stacks of forms for the application. In fact,\r\nthis complexity of grant application has also created a new consultancy\r\nindustry. So, that helps create jobs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 183</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2c8156fa-acd3-4510-947d-0452a3e6c605\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-2c8156fa-acd3-4510-947d-0452a3e6c605\"><!--a--></a>So, we have done and will\r\ncontinue to do more to inspire this entrepreneurship culture in\r\nSingapore.

And I know there is no lack\r\nof ideas out there, young or old, those in career \u2212 we just need\r\nto inspire and encourage them to take that step forward as long\r\nas they can show that their business can differentiate, not just\r\ninnovate, but can differentiate their business, I think they deserve\r\nsupport.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5acfb009-b7bf-4fdc-b1eb-565fbba7b2f0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-5acfb009-b7bf-4fdc-b1eb-565fbba7b2f0\"><!--a--></a>More proactive steps need\r\nto be taken by both parties \u2212 the Government and the private sector.\r\nAnd this will involve taking new risks to narrow the gap, but a\r\nmeeting of minds will certainly help to close ranks and ensure we\r\nreach that summit.

For\r\nexample, it granted only 29,625 Permanent Resident (PR) passes last\r\nyear, which is fewer than half of about 60,000 passes given out the\r\nyear before.

Current measures by the Government to improve the public\r\ntransport infrastructure are significant and very welcomed. Some\r\nof these include expanding the bus bays, providing accurate timetables\r\nfor buses and extending the MRT network.

In the\r\nsame vein, the government of the day is accountable to the people\r\nof Singapore and, therefore, that is a cornerstone, a hallmark of\r\nour democratic process. On his point about throwing the baby out\r\nwith the bath water: it is not throwing out the baby out of the\r\nbath water. There were tacit remarks about how the PAP Government\r\nhad failed the people, especially in the last few years where housing is\r\nconcerned, because the supply of housing had not met with the demand\r\nwhich the Member attributes to the high number of foreigners and\r\nthe left hand not talking to the right hand \u2013 MOT not talking to\r\nMOM, MOM not talking to ICA, and so on. While we can agree that\r\nthese policies need finetuning, what I cannot agree with the Member\r\nis that the foundations of the policy are incorrect because however\r\nyou skin the cat, however you look at it, 80% of Singaporeans live\r\nin public housing and 80% of Singaporeans own their own homes. So,\r\nI beg to differ.

The per capita GDP has increased and has given\r\nus a strong position in the league of First World nations. In response\r\nto healthcare in our city of Singapore, as a practitioner for the\r\nlast 21 years practising medicine full time and having visited and\r\nworked in places such as the USA, United Kingdom, Scotland, and\r\nbeing an international consultant to India, and also having visited\r\nmany Third World nations' healthcare systems, I have to say the following:\r\nwe have a good healthcare system in place. We have strong fundamentals and\r\nwe have a strong brand name. Of course, we continue to do this,\r\nbut we do not always have things right but we will have to review,\r\nwe will have to enhance, we will have to finetune. This is exactly\r\nwhat all systems in the world do. Many First World nations, many\r\nFirst World healthcare institutions, are grappling with the same\r\nproblems that we face today. So it is not unique, it is not new.\r\nIt is something that we have to be very dynamic and mobile about\r\nand make all the necessary changes, as we move on into the future.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d6891cb1-ca28-422b-b316-5e058e7419ec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-d6891cb1-ca28-422b-b316-5e058e7419ec\"><!--a--></a>However, we still have a\r\nvery low doctor-to-patient ratio. We have a 1.7 per 1,000 patient\r\ncompared to a range of 2.14 to 4.49 per 1,000 in North America and\r\nEurope. It is estimated that we need another 2,000 doctors by 2015.\r\nTo ameliorate this problem, we have alternatives which include more\r\nmedical schools to train doctors, recruiting more foreign trained\r\ndoctors and also a few other possibilities which have been discussed\r\nby Ministry of Health. However, we need to get our sums right in\r\ndoing this. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 194</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-37dac9ef-b6d0-42bd-8219-cde454b8614d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-37dac9ef-b6d0-42bd-8219-cde454b8614d\"><!--a--></a>Fifty-five percent of the\r\nregistered doctors serve in the public sector, which provides the\r\nbulk of healthcare, which is about 80%; whilst 45% are in the private\r\nsector, providing about 20% of care.

Gross National Happiness index cannot\r\nbe literally and bluntly taken for what it is. Happiness can indeed\r\nbe very personal and subjective. It is very much tied to expectations,\r\ncharacter and personality. It also very much depends on one's taste\r\nwhich is acquired from one's environment and social context. Social\r\nscientists have found that happiness is affected by both material\r\nand non-material factors. There are seven factors which have been\r\nshown to have strong correlation to happiness: (1) income; (2) work\r\nand employment; (3) private and family life; (4) your community;\r\n(5) healthcare; (6) freedom; and finally, having a philosophy and\r\nmeaning in life. I think these are important factors but we are\r\nalready doing some of these things and we are going to continue\r\nto do it. It represents indirect measures and as evidenced by the\r\nsocial scientists' studies, it certainly contributes towards overall happiness.\r\nTherefore, Sir, this goes to show we are already mainstreaming initiatives which\r\ncontribute towards happiness and must continue to do so, and they\r\nmay not be directly happiness-generating policies. But then what\r\nmakes me happy may not make you happy and we will never be able\r\nto satisfy everyone and make everybody happy all the time.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c1dba539-fd62-4583-85ca-70eb933045f4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c1dba539-fd62-4583-85ca-70eb933045f4\"><!--a--></a>With reference to the MP\r\nfor Aljunied GRC, Mr Muhamad Faisal, who claimed, and I quote, \"that\r\nfault lines were created in this House\".

We took full advantage of\r\nthese opportunities. This meant more foreign workers. It meant bringing\r\nin more investments. But, ultimately, it meant creating more jobs\r\nfor our people. In doing so, it is true that we ran into some infrastructural\r\nbottlenecks \u2013 in transport, in hospitals, in housing. We could have decided\r\nnot to seize the opportunities and to leave things be. But these\r\nopportunities come in cycles. If we had failed to seize the opportunities\r\nthen, our people, Singaporeans, would be worse off today. But because\r\nwe did what we did at that time, Singaporeans benefited. And if\r\nyou look at the second half of the decade, median incomes rose in\r\nreal terms by 11%, from flat in the first half to 11% in the second\r\nhalf. At the 20th percentile, real incomes rose even more sharply\r\nby 13%, from a drop of 11% in the first half to an increase of 13%\r\nin the second half. Overall, our economic growth for the whole decade\r\nwas 5.6% \u2212 hardly the outcome of a grow-at-all-cost policy. It was\r\nthe Government steering the economy through economic storms, that\r\nenabled us to achieve decent growth. And by doing so, we created\r\njobs, we raised incomes and we did good for the people.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 206</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-dc8edc8a-ff13-43f7-9dee-52d617edd20a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-dc8edc8a-ff13-43f7-9dee-52d617edd20a\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\ntaken some time to go through the details of what happened to the\r\nlast decade because, listening to some of the points that were made\r\nearlier by Members, I do not think a full picture was given to Members\r\nand to Singaporeans. Earlier, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Chen Show Mao\r\nspoke about the value of diversity, about different views and about\r\nconstructive debate in the House, and not scoring political points.\r\nI fully agree with them and I share these views. I hope therefore\r\nthat Members of the Workers' Party will look at the data and the\r\nfacts of what happened over the past decade, to appreciate the hard\r\ntrade-offs that we faced and to understand the basis of the decisions\r\nthat were made. Perhaps if Mr Giam does that, then I hope he will be\r\npersuaded that what happened in the last 10 years was not the PAP's\r\nbiggest policy failure, as he put it, but the PAP's success in steering\r\nSingapore through difficult times and doing good for our people. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c7e70db3-17a3-4ddc-825c-4fa40d931408\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c7e70db3-17a3-4ddc-825c-4fa40d931408\"><!--a--></a>The facts, if you look at\r\nwhat happened in the last decade, are that very few other countries\r\nhave emerged from that period of global turmoil to achieve the kind\r\nof positive result that Singapore did.

And this\r\nis the way to build a fair, just and inclusive Singapore and, indeed,\r\nto stay true to our founding ideals and achieve happiness, prosperity\r\nand progress for our nation. We want to be a nation where every\r\ncitizen has a place, where every contribution is valued, where all\r\ncan live in dignity and harmony. We also want to be a gracious,\r\ncaring and compassionate society, for the strength of any society\r\nis measured by how well it treats its weakest members. As Singapore\r\nprogresses, we must ensure that our vulnerable members are not left behind.\r\nThese are high and aspirational goals, but I am confident we can\r\nachieve them because of our people and our spirit. While we should\r\nnever rest on our laurels, how we have overcome past challenges\r\nas a nation provides inspiration and strength for how we should\r\nface the future together. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 207</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b0d6d889-2748-40b3-89c4-c53922b356ca\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b0d6d889-2748-40b3-89c4-c53922b356ca\"><!--a--></a>Singapore has many strengths,\r\nbut our biggest strength is our people.

The numbers of such parents are not huge, but despite\r\nthe policy positions taken in this House on occasions in the past,\r\nthe incidence of single parenthood is not decreasing, and the issue\r\ncontinues to affect us in several areas of social work.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2a0cd2b3-2595-49c6-8dab-07964e1efeb7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-2a0cd2b3-2595-49c6-8dab-07964e1efeb7\"><!--a--></a>Raising a child can be challenging\r\nenough for a married couple even with the help of an extended family.\r\nMore so if a young parent is doing it herself.

However, maternity\r\nleave also serves a very specific purpose for the well-being and health\r\nof the child. The time allows an increased level of care when the\r\ninfant is most at-risk, and also allows the establishment of breastfeeding\r\nwhich has a measurable, objective impact on the health and development\r\nof the child. Women who have adequate maternity leave are far more\r\nlikely to fully breastfeed for the recommended time. While there\r\nare provisions for mothers to claim more maternity benefits if they subsequently\r\nmarry, this is a narrow view and only addresses the concept of reward\r\nand not what is in the best interest of the child.

From\r\nwhat I know of the waiting time for hospital beds now in Singapore's\r\npublic hospitals: in 2010, the median waiting time is 1.4 hours.\r\nThe 95th percentile waiting time is 4.8 hours. This is a significant\r\nimprovement from 2007 when the median was 1.5 hours and the 95th percentile\r\nwas 6.7 hours. Compared to Western advanced countries with First\r\nWorld parliaments such as Canada, the median time is 1.7 hours and\r\nthe 95th percentile is 15 hours. So, we are actually doing way much\r\nbetter compared to the West despite our doctors ratio not being\r\nas high and our expenditure not being as high as theirs.

Every system\r\nthat we have created, built and developed has always been in response\r\nto the needs of the people of Singapore at that point in time. Take,\r\nfor example, HDB. Homeownership is the key mission. The HDB came\r\ninto being as a response to a severe housing shortage at a time\r\nwhen people lived in squatter settlements and squalid conditions.\r\nThe original intention was homeownership for the people. I firmly\r\nbelieve it should remain so. The low-cost housing was priced likewise\r\nand everyone was contented to have a roof over his head that he\r\ncould call \"home\". </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 216</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cededfe1-61dc-4120-a397-a8eb2e17a0a7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-cededfe1-61dc-4120-a397-a8eb2e17a0a7\"><!--a--></a>In the 1960s, a 3-room HDB\r\nflat cost $6,200. In the 1980s, a 4-room flat cost $85,000. Prices\r\nmoved up due to various reasons as we progressed. In fact, the value\r\nof HDB flats continued to be supported by the Government's Asset\r\nEnhancement programmes such as MUP, IUP, and later the LUP and the\r\nHIP. These massive programmes are costly but the Government undertook\r\nthem as a means of wealth transfer to HDB dwellers and to the general\r\npublic. The policy to regard HDB flats as an asset rather than just homeownership\r\ncould be right at that point in time but, in my opinion, it may\r\nhave gone a bit overboard. Although HDB flats are 99-year leasehold\r\nproperties, they behave like freehold properties as there is hardly\r\nany reduction in price as the flats age. A 30-year old 3-room flat\r\nin Ang Mo Kio costs more than a brand new three-room flat in a non-mature\r\nestate.

But now, HDB flat owners\r\nwho have completed their minimum occupancy period are allowed to\r\nretain their HDB flats when they upgrade to private properties. They\r\nare allowed to rent out the whole unit to gain recurrent rental\r\nincome from their subsidised HDB flats. The large influx of foreigners\r\nduring the last few years has driven up the demand and hence the\r\nrental rate of HDB flats. Allowing PRs to purchase HDB flats has\r\nalso added pressure to the already high demand. The resale market\r\nis driven sky high by people who cannot wait for a Built-to-Order\r\nflat or are afraid that prices may increase if they wait further\r\nor they are afraid that their salary may go up by the next salary\r\nincrement and they will miss out the chance to buy an HDB flat.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-56ca7f29-939b-4c55-b1c2-83bab19d23b3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-56ca7f29-939b-4c55-b1c2-83bab19d23b3\"><!--a--></a>Today, we hear of a $860,000\r\n5-room flat in the resale market.

Personally, I do not think\r\nthat over-investment in property is good in general for our country.\r\nIn the 1990s, Japan was also done in by high property prices domestically\r\nand likewise in the US in 2007. There are signs that China may be\r\nheading for the same direction.
