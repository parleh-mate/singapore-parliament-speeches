The Registry\r\n\r\nof  Persons  has been besieged with inquiries as  regards\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship status of persons holding unnamed  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government wishes to make it clear that this\r\n\r\nprovision in the Act is designed to debar people who were\r\n\r\nactually  not born in Singapore but who claim birth  here\r\n\r\nby  using  unnamed  birth certificates not  belonging  to\r\n\r\nthem. The Government appreciates the fact that there  are\r\n\r\nmany  people  who were born in Singapore but whose  names\r\n\r\nhad  not been entered on their birth certificates  either\r\n\r\nthrough  the  ignorance of their parents or  through  the\r\n\r\ntardiness  of  the colonial registration authorities.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as  those  who were, in fact, born in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nholding  unnamed birth certificates are concerned,  there\r\n\r\nneed be no worry over this provision in the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to announce the Government's policy which\r\n\r\nis  that  a person who holds an unnamed birth certificate\r\n\r\nand  has  a  Singapore identity card issued  in  1949  or\r\n\r\nearlier, stating that his place of birth is Singapore, is\r\n\r\npresumed  to be a Singapore citizen by birth.  There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, no cause for anxiety by persons whose identity\r\n\r\ncards  issued  in 1949 or earlier stated that  they  were\r\n\r\nborn  in Singapore. They need not rush to the Citizenship\r\n\r\nRegistry to have their citizenship status verified.  They\r\n\r\ncan  apply  for the new plastic laminated identity  cards\r\n\r\nwhen their turn comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those of 12 years of age in 1949 must have taken\r\n\r\nidentity  cards  as required by the law  then.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, all those now over 28 years, i.e. 12 years at 1949\r\n\r\nplus  16 years, that is 16 years since 1949 to 1965, have\r\n\r\ntheir  proof  in their identity cards. There are  persons\r\n\r\nborn  in Singapore who attained the age of 12 after 1949.\r\n\r\nIn  such cases their birth certificates, whether named or\r\n\r\nunnamed,  have an endorsement on them by the Registry  of\r\n\r\nPersons  when  they obtained their identity  cards.  This\r\n\r\nendorsement  shows  their present identity  card  number.\r\n\r\nWhen   such  persons  produce  their  birth  certificates\r\n\r\ntogether  with  their  present  identity  cards  for  \r\n\r\nre-registration, they will be accepted as Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nby  birth  and will be given a Singapore citizen  plastic\r\n\r\nlaminated identity card. Further, any person who holds an\r\n\r\nunnamed  birth  certificate  together  with  a  statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration  made by one of his parents can always  prove\r\n\r\nhis  Singapore  citizenship by birth by other  supporting\r\n\r\ndocuments such as:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) birth certificates of his brothers and sisters, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) birth certificates of his children, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) school leaving certificate, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) vaccination notice or certificate, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) baptismal certificate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which my Ministry will accept as sufficient evidence to\r\n\r\nestablish status as a Singapore citizen by birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A citizen plastic laminated identity card in future will,\r\n\r\nbe  a very important document for a person to possess. In\r\n\r\nfact,  the Government has taken measures to see that  the\r\n\r\nnew  plastic  laminated identity card  is  forgery-proof,\r\n\r\ntamper-proof  and  water-proof. With a  citizen  identity\r\n\r\ncard,  a  holder will have all the rights and  privileges\r\n\r\nconferred  on  a  citizen of Singapore. It  will  be  his\r\n\r\npassport  to  social  amenities like education,  housing,\r\n\r\nhealth, employment, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement should clarify the position and allay\r\n\r\nthe doubts of those who were born in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

When  Singapore became part of Malaysia  and  the\r\n\r\npowers  transferred  to the Malaysian  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nMinister, the workers' representative did not sit on  the\r\n\r\nBoard.  I  would  like  to know  from  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  whether workers' representatives  or  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard employees will now be allowed to be members of  the\r\n\r\nTelephone Board in order to look after the welfare of the\r\n\r\nworkers and to --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order; whether as an employee of the\r\n\r\nBoard,  or  a member of the Board. If the latter  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion,  he  is  in  order; but if  he  is  talking  of\r\n\r\nsomething else, then he is not in order on this  Bill  on\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

In fact, in the past it was my  practice\r\n\r\nto see that there was a member from one of the unions, or\r\n\r\nat  least somebody who was a worker who was also a member\r\n\r\nof  the  Board.

I then mentioned  the\r\n\r\nadditional need to have a part-time fighting force  which\r\n\r\nwould be an essential part of our Armed Forces. This Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  establishment and  maintenance  of  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  force  to  be known as the  \"People's  Defence\r\n\r\nForce\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a small nation and our financial resources\r\n\r\nare  limited.

The  training they receive will not only  prepare\r\n\r\nthem  for the part that they will take beside our regular\r\n\r\nArmy but also provide them with the necessary disciplines\r\n\r\nand skills required in the task of nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come now to the specific provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill. Part II provides for the raising and maintenance of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Defence Force. The Force will  be  divided\r\n\r\ninto   corps,   regiments,  services   and   departments.\r\n\r\nProvision   is   also   made  for  the   disbandment   or\r\n\r\namalgamation  of one or more such units.  The  enlistment\r\n\r\ninto  the Force is open to Singapore citizens of 18 years\r\n\r\nof  age and above who are medically fit. Boys between the\r\n\r\nages  of 14 and 17 years may be enlisted as drummer  boys\r\n\r\nand  band  boys in the Force. With regard to  discipline,\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of Parts IV, VII and VIII of the Army Act\r\n\r\nwill  apply  to  members of the People's  Defence  Force.\r\n\r\nProvision  is also made in Part II of this Bill  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident to commission officers of the Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III deals with Colour Training Service of members\r\n\r\nof the Force. No member of the Force shall be required to\r\n\r\nattend  at  weekly parades for a total of  more  than  20\r\n\r\nhours  in  one month or at continuous training  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  16 days in any one year. Every member of the  Force\r\n\r\nshall be required to perform Colour Training for a period\r\n\r\nof  three  years.  The Bill also includes  provision  for\r\n\r\nmembers of the Force performing Colour Training and their\r\n\r\ndependants  to  be  entitled  to  receive  pensions   and\r\n\r\ngratuities  in respect of injury or death resulting  from\r\n\r\nsuch  Colour  Training Service. A  member  of  the  Force\r\n\r\nperforming  Colour Training Service may be released  from\r\n\r\nthe  Force  on  his giving three months'  notice  of  his\r\n\r\ndesire  to  do so. Certain offences are provided  for  in\r\n\r\nclause 25 to which a member of the Force is subject  when\r\n\r\nhe  is  not  attached to any unit of the Singapore  Armed\r\n\r\nForces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill provides for a Reserve composed of\r\n\r\nVolunteers  and  National Servicemen.  The  President  is\r\n\r\nempowered  to recall by Proclamation all or any  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Reserve  to  Colour Training Service  at  any  time.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Reserve  may  also  be  called  up  for\r\n\r\nmobilised  service.  Service  in  the  Reserve  shall  be\r\n\r\nlimited to a minimum period of seven years after which  a\r\n\r\nperson can resign on giving three months' notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part V, the President is empowered to call out\r\n\r\nall  or  any  part  of  the Force for mobilised  service.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Force who are called up  for  mobilised\r\n\r\nservice  and  their dependants are eligible for  pensions\r\n\r\nand  gratuities for injury or death resulting  from  such\r\n\r\nservice.  Members of the Force, when mobilised,  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject to the provisions of the Army Act with regard  to\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  During  a state of war,  the  President  may\r\n\r\ndirect  that members of the Force may be attached to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed  Forces  or  the  armed  forces  of  any\r\n\r\nCommonwealth country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill provides for a University Training\r\n\r\nCorps and a Cadet Corps, and any such Corps may, with the\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of  the  President,  be  attached   to   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed  Forces. The President is  empowered  to\r\n\r\ncommission members of the University Training  Corps  and\r\n\r\nof   the   Cadet  Corps.  Clause  60  provides  for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of the \"People's Defence Force  Benevolent\r\n\r\nFund\"  which,  as the name implies, will be  administered\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit  of members of the Force  by  a  person\r\n\r\nappointed by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADMINISTRATION OF MUSLIM LAW BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been under consideration for a long time\r\n\r\nand  its provisions have been considered in detail by the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Advisory Board and copies of the Bill  have  been\r\n\r\nsent  to  a  number  of Muslim bodies in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\ncomments which have been received on its provisions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  considered  by the Muslim Advisory  Board  and  the\r\n\r\npresent  draft  incorporates the suggestions  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen considered reasonable and in keeping with the scheme\r\n\r\nand purpose of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in the main follows the legislation in the\r\n\r\nStates  of Malaya, which have tended to follow the  model\r\n\r\nset  by  the  Administration of Muslim Law  Enactment  of\r\n\r\nSelangor  in  1952. The Bill, however,  incorporates  the\r\n\r\nprovisions which were designed to control the exercise of\r\n\r\nthe right of divorce and the permission of polygamy which\r\n\r\nwere first introduced in Singapore, and which have, I  am\r\n\r\nhappy to say, been followed in recent legislation in  the\r\n\r\nStates of Malaya, notably in Selangor, Negri Sembilan and\r\n\r\nPerlis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill constitutes a Majlis Ugama Islam or\r\n\r\na  Council of Muslim Religion to advise the President  in\r\n\r\nmatters  relating  to  the Muslim religion.  The  Majlis,\r\n\r\nunlike  the  present  Muslim Advisory  Board,  will  have\r\n\r\ncertain executive powers in issuing rulings on Muslim law\r\n\r\nand the administration of Muslim Charities and will be  a\r\n\r\ncorporation, with power to hold property and to  sue  and\r\n\r\nbe sued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill in the main reenacts the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Muslims Ordinance, 1957. It  is  sought\r\n\r\nto  give  power to the Shariah Court to deal  with  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the parties were married under the Muslim law  but\r\n\r\nwhere  one  or  both  of the parties have  ceased  to  be\r\n\r\nMuslims (clause 35). At present there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  no  provision whereby a party to such a marriage  can\r\n\r\nobtain  a divorce, for example, as the Shariah Court  has\r\n\r\nonly  jurisdiction  in cases where all  the  parties  are\r\n\r\nMuslims  and  the High Court has no jurisdiction  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Muslim marriages. It is expressly provided,  to\r\n\r\nremove all doubts, that the Shariah Court will apply  the\r\n\r\nMuslim law, as varied by Malay custom, that is, clause 35\r\n\r\n(2) .  Provision is made for representation by  authorised\r\n\r\nagents  (clause  38) and for reciprocal arrangements  for\r\n\r\nthe  service  of  summonses in  the  States  of  Malaysia\r\n\r\n(clause 41). Clauses 47 to 49 of the Bill clarify the law\r\n\r\nrelating to applications for divorce by a married  woman,\r\n\r\nand  clause  49 sets out the grounds on which  a  married\r\n\r\nwoman  can  apply  to the Court for judicial  divorce  on\r\n\r\nfasakh.  The  provisions relating to the appointments  of\r\n\r\narbitrators in marriage disputes has been strengthened by\r\n\r\ngiving  power to the Shariah Court, where the arbitrators\r\n\r\noriginally  appointed are unable to reach  agreement,  to\r\n\r\nappoint   other  arbitrators  or  hakam  with  power   in\r\n\r\nappropriate cases to effect a divorce (clause 50).  Power\r\n\r\nis  given  to  the  Shariah Court  to  order  payment  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance beyond the period of eddah, if the  Court  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that it is fit and proper to do so. That is  in\r\n\r\nclause 52.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with the financial powers of\r\n\r\nthe  Council  of  Muslim Religion and  in  particular  it\r\n\r\nestablishes a General Endowment Fund. Hitherto there  was\r\n\r\nno  such  fund  in Singapore and there was  therefore  no\r\n\r\ncentral   organisation  which  could  deal  with   Muslim\r\n\r\ncharitable trusts. Some Muslim endowments are at  present\r\n\r\nadministered by the Muslim and Hindu Endowments Board but\r\n\r\nthe   majority  are  administered  by  private  trustees.\r\n\r\nProvision  is made in the Bill for the vesting of  Muslim\r\n\r\nreligious  trusts in the Majlis and the manner  in  which\r\n\r\nthe  incomes  of Muslim religious endowments  are  to  be\r\n\r\napplied.  The Majlis is also empowered, with the approval\r\n\r\nof the President, to collect zakat and fitrah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill deals with mosques of which the\r\n\r\nMajlis  is to be the sole trustee with powers to  control\r\n\r\nthe erection of new mosques and with duties to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkeep existing mosques in good order and repair. Power  is\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the Majlis to appoint committees of management\r\n\r\nfor mosques and also to appoint officials. It is the hope\r\n\r\nof  the  Government that in this way the Imams and  other\r\n\r\nofficials  of the mosques will have a better  status  and\r\n\r\nposition in society and that the mosques will be able  to\r\n\r\nbe   the  focus  of  Muslim  activities  in  the  various\r\n\r\ndistricts and parts of Singapore. Provision is also  made\r\n\r\nfor  the registration and supervision of Muslim religious\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI deals with matters relating to marriages and\r\n\r\ndivorces and re-enacts with amendments the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims  Ordinance, 1957. It is  proposed  that  the\r\n\r\npowers  at present exercisable by the Chief Kathi  should\r\n\r\nbe exercised by the Kathis attached to the Shariah Court.\r\n\r\nProvision is made for the appointment of Naib Kathis  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  mainly  concerned with  the  solemnisation  and\r\n\r\nregistration  of  marriages, to which  the  guardians  or\r\n\r\nwalis  have  consented. Where the woman has  no  wali  or\r\n\r\nguardian,  or  where  the wali or  guardian  refuses  his\r\n\r\nconsent  to  the marriage, the marriage may be solemnised\r\n\r\nand  registered  by the Kathis attached  to  the  Shariah\r\n\r\nCourt.  All divorces will similarly be dealt with by  the\r\n\r\nKathis  in  the Shariah Court. There are at  present  two\r\n\r\nKathis  attached to the Shariah Court, and  if  the  need\r\n\r\narises,  additional  Kathis  will  be  appointed.  It  is\r\n\r\nproposed that the imams of mosques in Singapore should be\r\n\r\nappointed Naib Kathis. The Bill seeks to lay down the age\r\n\r\nof  15  years as the minimum age of marriage for Muslims,\r\n\r\nbut power is given to the Kathi to approve a marriage  in\r\n\r\nspecial  cases, where the girl has attained  puberty.  In\r\n\r\nview  of  the hardship that can be caused in cases  where\r\n\r\nthe man divorces the woman by three talak, it is proposed\r\n\r\nthat  such cases should be referred to the Shariah Court,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  Shariah Court can be  satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of all parties are adequately safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII deals with property and in the main re-enacts\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Muslims Ordinance. 1957. One major\r\n\r\nchange  is the provision that the Muslim law shall  apply\r\n\r\nto  dispositions by will by Muslims. The effect  will  be\r\n\r\nthat a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuslim  can  only  freely dispose  of  one-third  of  his\r\n\r\nproperty by will; the balance must be distributed to  the\r\n\r\npersons entitled to take an intestacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII of the Bill deals with conversion. Power is\r\n\r\ngiven  to  make  rules to provide for the  procedure  for\r\n\r\nconversion  and  the  Majlis is required  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nregister of converts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX deals with offences relating to marriage and\r\n\r\ndivorce.  It  does  not  go to the  extent  of  punishing\r\n\r\noffences against the Muslim religion, as in the States of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  but  clause 130 provides for the  punishment  of\r\n\r\npersons  who cohabit and live with another person outside\r\n\r\nmarriage.  The  Bill  also provides for  the  control  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  religious  lectures so as  to  ensure  that  such\r\n\r\nlectures   are  not  used  for  political   or   communal\r\n\r\npropaganda  or  to advocate teachings or doctrines  which\r\n\r\nare repugnant to the teachings of Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X deals with miscellaneous matters and gives power\r\n\r\nto make rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Comparative Table attached to the Bill shows that\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  provisions  of  the  Bill  follow  similar\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the corresponding enactments in  Selangor,\r\n\r\nPahang  and  Penang which are, however, merely  cited  as\r\n\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as this Bill\r\n\r\nis,  in  your opinion, a hybrid Bill, in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of paragraph (1) of Standing Order 64,  I\r\n\r\nbeg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting  of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven  Members\r\n\r\nto be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting  of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven  Members\r\n\r\nto be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROPERTY TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before Parliament envisages two major\r\n\r\nchanges  of  substance  to  the  existing  Property   Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Section  2 of the Ordinance  defines  \"annual\r\n\r\nvalue\"  and  gives  the  Chief  Assessor  the  option  of\r\n\r\nadopting as an annual value a sum equal to five per  cent\r\n\r\nof   the   capital  value  of  the  property  in  certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances.

Under the existing  law,  the  option\r\n\r\napplies  where  buildings are erected on  land  and  also\r\n\r\nwhere  the  land is vacant.

The amendment  will  make  it\r\n\r\nclear  beyond doubt that the Chief Assessor may adopt  an\r\n\r\nannual value of five per cent of the capital value of any\r\n\r\nproperty whether vacant land, land with buildings erected\r\n\r\nthereon, or land with buildings being erected thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also clarifies the power of the Chief Assessor\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  land appurtenant to any house  or  other\r\n\r\nbuilding  in  excess  of  the  quantity  fixed   by   the\r\n\r\nController so that five per cent of the capital value may\r\n\r\nbe adopted as the annual value of such excess land. There\r\n\r\nis  no  definition of \"building\" in the Ordinance at  the\r\n\r\npresent time, and one of the amendments made by clause  2\r\n\r\nis  the  inclusion of a definition. This, apart from  its\r\n\r\nusefulness   in   regard  to  buildings  and   structures\r\n\r\ngenerally,  specifically provides for  the  inclusion  of\r\n\r\nitems  like  underground  and overground  tanks  and  oil\r\n\r\nrefineries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 16 of the existing Ordinance does not require\r\n\r\nproperty-owners to give notice to the Chief Assessor when\r\n\r\nrentals are increased. The amendment Bill will place  the\r\n\r\nonus  on  the  owner  to  inform the  Chief  Assessor  of\r\n\r\ninstances where rentals are increased. Such notice will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso be required when renting vacant land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to section 17 is to empower the\r\n\r\nChief Assessor to increase the annual value of properties\r\n\r\ntaking  account  of the increases in land  value  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  years, especially in those cases where the annual\r\n\r\nvalue bears little relationship to the price at which the\r\n\r\nproperty changes hands. As the Ordinance now stands,  the\r\n\r\nChief Assessor may amend the annual valuation list during\r\n\r\nthe  year  in  which it is operative where  there  is  an\r\n\r\ninaccuracy   in  a  material  particular.  However,   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  does not define what constitutes an inaccuracy\r\n\r\nin  a material particular. An amendment will clarify  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  under which the Chief Assessor  may  amend\r\n\r\nthe  existing valuation list and spell out in detail  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances in which the annual valuation list  may  be\r\n\r\namended. As any vendor or transferer of property  remains\r\n\r\nliable  to tax until notice is given, provision is  being\r\n\r\nmade  under  section  16 that he should  give  notice  of\r\n\r\ntransfer  instead  of the purchaser as  provided  for  at\r\n\r\npresent. Under the existing Ordinance, the maximum  limit\r\n\r\nfor  fines imposed for failure to give notice of transfer\r\n\r\nof  property  is raised from $500 to $5,000. The  present\r\n\r\nlimit  is  considered inadequate to cover certain  cases;\r\n\r\nfor  example where the transfer of property  with  a  low\r\n\r\nannual  value  is not notified over a long period  and  a\r\n\r\npermanent  savings from additional tax  may  well  exceed\r\n\r\n$500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other amendments are either consequential, necessitated\r\n\r\nby  separation  from Malaysia, and they take  account  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's position as a sovereign independent Republic,\r\n\r\nor are matters of terminology or procedure to improve the\r\n\r\nadministration of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is to make certain amendments\r\n\r\nto the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance was enacted five years ago as one of the  chief\r\n\r\nmeasures  in the promotion of the Government's policy  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace  with justice.  Ever  since  then,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has kept a careful watch on its operation  to\r\n\r\nsee  whether it could be improved. Accordingly, a  number\r\n\r\nof amendments were made to it in 1962, the most important\r\n\r\nof  which  was  the  setting up of the Second  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court. However, in the light  of  experience\r\n\r\ngained  since  then,  it  has become  apparent  that  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance could be improved further in order to make it a\r\n\r\nmore   efficient   instrument  in  the   prevention   and\r\n\r\nsettlement of industrial disputes, that is to say, in the\r\n\r\npreservation of industrial peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments which are embodied in this Bill have,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  been  made  with  this  end  in  view.  These\r\n\r\namendments are the results of several months'  hard  work\r\n\r\nof the President of the Industrial Arbitration Court, the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the N.T.U.C., the representatives from\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Employers' Federation, and officials in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  and  I would like to take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\nthank them for their contributions to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the House to\r\n\r\nthe principal changes. Clause 5 reduces the period of the\r\n\r\nappointment  of a panel member from three  years  to  one\r\n\r\nyear.  Although there are ten members on each of the  two\r\n\r\npanels, in practice the burden of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituting the Court has fallen on only a few of  them,\r\n\r\nas  employers  and  trade unions  of  employees  who  are\r\n\r\nparties  to  trade  disputes have  invariably  restricted\r\n\r\ntheir  choice to these few. The proposed amendments  will\r\n\r\nhelp to remove this tendency by enabling the Minister  to\r\n\r\nreplace  any  panel  members who are seldom  selected  to\r\n\r\nconstitute the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 23 introduce new provisions on union\r\n\r\nrecognition, because it has been found that  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmajor  causes  of  a  trade dispute has  been  over  this\r\n\r\nmatter. Experience has shown that the existing provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance are inadequate for dealing  with  this\r\n\r\narea  of  dispute between employers and trade  unions  of\r\n\r\nemployees. The purpose of the amendment is to remedy this\r\n\r\nsituation.  It is provided inter alia, as  a  basic  \r\n\r\npre-condition   for   opening  negotiations  for   collective\r\n\r\nagreements, that a trade union of employees must first be\r\n\r\nrecognised by the employer in the prescribed manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 deals with the certification of collective\r\n\r\nagreements by the Court. At present, if the parties to  a\r\n\r\ncollective agreement do not agree to alter or  amend  the\r\n\r\nagreement  in  accordance with  the  suggestions  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt,  the  Court  has no power to alter  or  amend  the\r\n\r\nagreement  and  certifies it. This state  of  affairs  is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory in that until the parties agree  to  amend\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  as  directed by the Court,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nbinding  agreement. Therefore, this clause  empowers  the\r\n\r\nCourt  to amend and certify a collective agreement  where\r\n\r\nthe  parties  refuse  to do so on the  direction  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 and 16 expressly stipulate inter alia that a\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement  or  an award  is  binding  on  the\r\n\r\nsuccessor  to  a  trade  union. Under  the  Ordinance  at\r\n\r\npresent, a collective agreement or an award is binding on\r\n\r\nthe  successor to the business of an employer but not  on\r\n\r\nthe  successor  to a trade union. The proposed  amendment\r\n\r\nremedies this anomaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 seeks to remove the conflict between section\r\n\r\n16 and section 35 (4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance. At present, when  a  union  serves  a\r\n\r\nnotice  under  section  16  for  negotiations  on  a  new\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement on the expiry of the old  one,  the\r\n\r\nemployer  is  at  liberty to apply  to  the  Court  under\r\n\r\nsection  35 (4) for an order extending the old collective\r\n\r\nagreement. The Court in dealing with such application  of\r\n\r\nan employer has no power to take cognisance of the notice\r\n\r\nserved  under section 16. The proposed amendment empowers\r\n\r\nthe Court to take cognisance of and to deal with both the\r\n\r\nproposers  for a collective agreement and the application\r\n\r\nfor  extension of an award under section 35  (4)  if  the\r\n\r\nparties  do  not reach agreement on their  own  within  a\r\n\r\nspecific period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove any ambiguity that may exist with regard to\r\n\r\nthe  power of the Court to order the reinstatement  of  a\r\n\r\ndismissed  employee, it is expressly provided in  clauses\r\n\r\n17 and 21 that in making an award, the Court is empowered\r\n\r\nto  take  into  consideration  matters  relating  to  the\r\n\r\ndismissal  or reinstatement of an employee  or  class  of\r\n\r\nemployees  and to order the reinstatement of a  dismissed\r\n\r\nemployee  or grant any suitable relief as it may consider\r\n\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 provides that the Commissioner for Labour may\r\n\r\nauthorise a public officer to carry out investigations of\r\n\r\ncomplaints in respect of offences under the Ordinance and\r\n\r\nit  sets  out the powers of such officer. This  has  been\r\n\r\ndone to ensure that speedy action is taken to investigate\r\n\r\nevery  complaint  and to prosecute any  offender  if  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation shows that the complaint is well founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

It is a hangar\r\n\r\nwhich  has got a history, and if it were by any chance  a\r\n\r\nhuman  being  and member of the civil service,  it  could\r\n\r\ncredit  itself with reasonably long service, for  it  was\r\n\r\ndismantled and transferred from the old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKallang  Airport in 1957 to its present site. Ever  since\r\n\r\nthen, officials in the Department of Civil Aviation  have\r\n\r\nnot made up their minds as to what is to be housed in it.\r\n\r\nThey  have  been very fortunate in having a  building  up\r\n\r\ntheir  sleeve  to  produce whenever  someone  wants  some\r\n\r\nhangar  space  at  the  Airport.  I  think  we  have  had\r\n\r\nbadminton  played in the hangar and parties held  in  it.\r\n\r\nThere  used  to  be cars parked in it;  and  the  Airport\r\n\r\nManager  stole  a  march  on  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment by charging each car owner $10 per month  for\r\n\r\nthe use of the parking space. Today the hangar is used as\r\n\r\na  garage by one airline and for varying reasons by other\r\n\r\nairlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the Department of Civil Aviation\r\n\r\nis now waking up to the fact that this hangar can be used\r\n\r\nfor  something  worth while. What I cannot understand  is\r\n\r\nwhy  it has taken so long for them to realise this.  What\r\n\r\nwas  done  during the two years when we were in Malaysia?\r\n\r\nDid  the  D.C.A. at  that time attempt  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nfacilities at the Airport for storage of cargo? Or did he\r\n\r\nthink that, as there was a $50 million Airport at Subang,\r\n\r\nthere  was  sufficient cargo space and that,  as  far  as\r\n\r\nSingapore Airport was concerned, it could develop into  a\r\n\r\nsecond-class Airport?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nof bringing to the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nthe   short-sightedness   in  respect   of   the   future\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the Airport. The Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  has  said  that more people  come  to  and  pass\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore  by air than by  any  other  means  of\r\n\r\ntransportation. Statistics also show that the  volume  of\r\n\r\nair cargo has increased year by year. I would ask him  to\r\n\r\nlook  carefully  into  the question  of  converting  this\r\n\r\nhangar into a cargo complex which, in my opinion, will be\r\n\r\ntotally inadequate in a very short space of time.  If  we\r\n\r\nare planning for the future, then we should look into the\r\n\r\nquestion of building a cargo terminal instead of spending\r\n\r\nmoney  on  a  project which would only  serve  our  needs\r\n\r\ntemporarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a matter of interest, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime  Minister how many  airlines  will  be\r\n\r\ntaking up space in this new cargo complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  add a few words to this  item.  I  think\r\n\r\nconsideration  should be given as  to  whether  there  is\r\n\r\njustification in spending $100,000 now, and possibly at a\r\n\r\nlater  stage the House would be asked to approve  another\r\n\r\n$100,000 for the plan cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that at the present moment the hangar is\r\n\r\nbeing  occupied  by certain airlines as a cargo  complex.\r\n\r\nEven  if a conversion is made, it is not going to satisfy\r\n\r\npresent  and  future needs as a cargo complex.  With  the\r\n\r\npresent  trend in air cargo, as I understand  it,  larger\r\n\r\nplanes  with  palletised loading  are  due  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nAirport  early next year. And definitely with this  trend\r\n\r\nin  cargo movement, there is no justification in spending\r\n\r\nthis money because it will be totally inadequate for  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the airline operators. Therefore, I think,  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of long-term planning, a new cargo terminal\r\n\r\nwould best be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I am surprised to learn\r\n\r\nthat Hangar No. 4 has a very varied history - that it has\r\n\r\nbeen  used in the past as a badminton stadium,  an  arena\r\n\r\nfor parties and get-togethers, and last but not least, as\r\n\r\na  car park! Nevertheless, I think we would like to leave\r\n\r\nthe history of Hangar No. 4 in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House, however, that the\r\n\r\nreason  why it is intended to convert this hangar into  a\r\n\r\ncargo  complex is simply that it has been found that  the\r\n\r\npresent  facilities for storing air cargo  elsewhere  are\r\n\r\nnot  adequate. However, the demand for cargo space at the\r\n\r\nAirport  is  not  as  great as the Member  for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens or the Member for River Valley would suggest.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  am told that in the first year of operation  of\r\n\r\nthe Airport at Paya Lebar, which was opened\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1955,  a total of 5 million kilograms of air  freight\r\n\r\nwas  handled.  Barely  nine years later,  in  1964,  this\r\n\r\nfigure  had increased to only 6 million kilograms.  Well,\r\n\r\nan increase of one million kilograms in the space of nine\r\n\r\nyears is pretty slow. So we would not anticipate that  in\r\n\r\nthe next five years the volume of cargo would increase so\r\n\r\nrapidly  that  a  completely new cargo  handling  complex\r\n\r\nwould  be needed. Nevertheless, it would be necessary  at\r\n\r\nthis stage to put Hangar No. 4 to better use than it  was\r\n\r\nin the past; hence this request that a sum of $100,000 be\r\n\r\nallocated  to  convert this hangar into a cargo  complex.\r\n\r\nThis  will be quite adequate for the cargo that would  be\r\n\r\nenvisaged for probably the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no knowledge how many airlines have applied for\r\n\r\ncargo  space  in  the  proposed new  cargo  complex,  but\r\n\r\npresumably  airline  operators  will  put  forward  their\r\n\r\nrequest  to  the Department of Civil Aviation  when  they\r\n\r\nfeel that there is a necessity to increase the space  for\r\n\r\nair cargo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

However, in  order\r\n\r\nthat  it could acquire this reputation, there has  to  be\r\n\r\nefficiency at the Airport. And the one place where  there\r\n\r\nhas  to  be efficiency is in the ticketing area. It  does\r\n\r\nnot  do us any good to have people say that they have had\r\n\r\nto  wait  for hours before getting their baggage  cleared\r\n\r\nand   tickets   checked.

Sir,  it looks as if the question  of  future\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   the  Airport  Terminal  was   completely\r\n\r\nforgotten  when  the  Airport was  planned,  as  was  the\r\n\r\nrequirement for other facilities at the Airport.  Why  is\r\n\r\nit that we have to knock down V.I.P. car parks to provide\r\n\r\nroom  for  extra office space, not that V.I.P. car  parks\r\n\r\nare  absolutely necessary? The next thing  that  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  do  without would probably be the  V.I.P. room\r\n\r\nitself. This House recently approved a sum of $42,500  to\r\n\r\nprovide for additional office space. What we will have to\r\n\r\nspend  next  is  a  question no one  can  answer,  except\r\n\r\nprobably  the  architect who made  such  a  mess  at  the\r\n\r\nAirport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as more and more people use the Airport every\r\n\r\nyear,  there  will come a time when the present  terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding  will be considered inadequate. It is  therefore\r\n\r\nvery  important  that the Department  of  Civil  Aviation\r\n\r\nshould  look  carefully into the  question  and  plan  an\r\n\r\nexpansion programme that will see us through for the next\r\n\r\n15 years instead of the next 15 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Deputy Prime Minister could also investigate\r\n\r\nto  assure himself that the Department of Civil  Aviation\r\n\r\nis  capable of drawing up a programme that will serve our\r\n\r\nneeds for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I  must  inform  the  House   that   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates for Civil Aviation were worked  out\r\n\r\nwhen  the department was under the charge of the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Malaysia, Kuala  Lumpur,  and  they  were\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the Treasury at the beginning of this  year.\r\n\r\nSo  when  we  became  independent in August,  these  were\r\n\r\nautomatically  included in the Development Estimates  for\r\n\r\nnext year. I have not had the opportunity to study all of\r\n\r\nthem  in detail. However, it would appear to me that  the\r\n\r\nintention  is the same, that is, to extend the  Ticketing\r\n\r\nOffices  into the area now occupied by the V.I.P. garage.\r\n\r\nAs  to why there are two separate sums asked for, I would\r\n\r\nnot  know,  unless  the sum of money  asked  for  in  the\r\n\r\nSupplementary Estimates is to be spent on  work  that  is\r\n\r\nalready  in progress or has been completed and  that  the\r\n\r\nsum  of money in the Development Estimates is to be spent\r\n\r\nnext  year.  Nevertheless, I promise the  Member  that  I\r\n\r\nshall  look into this matter. I will only say  that  when\r\n\r\nthe  new  Airport  Terminal Building  was  designed,  all\r\n\r\ncommercial  airline  operators were  consulted  on  their\r\n\r\nrequirements and, in fact, a long series of meetings were\r\n\r\nheld  with  them in order to draw up a plan  which  would\r\n\r\nsatisfy  their  needs. In fact, if  there  has  been  any\r\n\r\nshortsightedness at all on the planning of the  ticketing\r\n\r\narea,  then it must also be partly the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  airline operators themselves. In fact, I  would  say\r\n\r\nthe  worst  offender is Malaysian Airways. When  I  urged\r\n\r\nthem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto apply for space in the present airline ticketing area,\r\n\r\ntheir  reply  to  me was that it was not necessary,  they\r\n\r\nwere  not going to do so, they were going to use the town\r\n\r\noffice  which  was  quite adequate, and furthermore  they\r\n\r\nwere not going to use the new passenger terminal building\r\n\r\nand  they  were  going to disembark their passengers  and\r\n\r\noperate from the old terminal building in Paya Lebar.  It\r\n\r\nwas only after all available space had been allocated  to\r\n\r\nother airline operators and the new terminal building was\r\n\r\nproving  to be a hive of activity that Malaysian  Airways\r\n\r\nfinally   regretted  its  shortsightedness  and   hastily\r\n\r\napplied  for  space  in  the  ticketing  area  and   also\r\n\r\nelsewhere in the new terminal building. Frankly, if there\r\n\r\nare  any complaints which any airline operator wishes  to\r\n\r\nraise  on  this  matter, then I must say that  they  have\r\n\r\nhardly any cause to do so, because they cannot deny  that\r\n\r\nthey were consulted on this matter. In fact, sometimes  I\r\n\r\nregret  indeed  that Malaysian Airways  is  our  national\r\n\r\ncarrier.  If it were a foreign carrier and it  does  this\r\n\r\nsort  of thing to the Civil Aviation Department, I  would\r\n\r\nhave just put it out. But preferential treatment has been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  Malaysian Airways. We have bent  backwards  in\r\n\r\norder to meet their needs. And I think they are sometimes\r\n\r\nunappreciative  of  these  efforts.  And  if  there   are\r\n\r\npassengers who complain that they have to wait for a long\r\n\r\ntime  to  get  their  tickets checked and  collect  their\r\n\r\nbaggage,  then I will again point my finger  squarely  at\r\n\r\nthose   members  of  the  staff  of  commercial   airline\r\n\r\ncompanies which have been slow in doing their job.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see how the Civil Aviation Department officials come\r\n\r\ninto  the  picture at all. And if there is a fuss  to  be\r\n\r\nkicked up by the public, I would say that it be aimed  at\r\n\r\nthe airline company on whose tickets they are travelling.\r\n\r\nCertainly,   I   would  advise  all  airline   operators,\r\n\r\nincluding  Malaysian Airways, that they  should  pull  up\r\n\r\ntheir socks and see that their staff get down to work  in\r\n\r\na prim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand proper way so that they will maintain a good image\r\n\r\nand their passengers will be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

If  there  is  provision  for   a\r\n\r\nworkers' holiday camp, it should be administered  by  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. which can look into the question of applications\r\n\r\nfor  the use of the holiday camp by national workers  who\r\n\r\nhave  dedicated  themselves in the  past,  and  who  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  do so, in order to strengthen the  workers'\r\n\r\norganisation,   to  the  task  of  nation-building   with\r\n\r\ndisciplined  workers.

Since its inception  in  April  1960,  the\r\n\r\nAdult  Education Board has developed itself  to  such  an\r\n\r\nextent  that  it  has been regarded as  an  indispensable\r\n\r\nquasi-government body that provides an invaluable service\r\n\r\nto the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last five years, the Adult Education Board has\r\n\r\ndeveloped  a system of adult education that is impressive\r\n\r\nby  Asian standards. This programme includes literacy and\r\n\r\nlanguage  classes,  a  primary and secondary  educational\r\n\r\nsystem   up  to  and  including  pre-university  classes,\r\n\r\ncommercial education, classes to assist adults  preparing\r\n\r\nfor  overseas  Professional Examinations, public  forums,\r\n\r\nand  a  wide range of recreational and vocational courses\r\n\r\narranged on an ad hoc basis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording to public demand. This year, the total  student\r\n\r\nenrolment is above 50,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board has managed to cope with this\r\n\r\nexpansion  with  the assistance and co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. The Board has no facilities of its\r\n\r\nown  except the Cultural Centre and a bungalow, known  as\r\n\r\nthe  Annexe, situated at No. 9, Fort Canning Road. It has\r\n\r\nrelied  mainly on Government and Government-aided  school\r\n\r\nbuildings  for  implementing its programme.  However,  on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions it has to make use of other premises like\r\n\r\nthe  community  centres, Government  Social  Welfare  and\r\n\r\nInstitutional  Homes, and whatever accommodation  it  can\r\n\r\nlay its hands on. The use of these facilities means great\r\n\r\nsavings  in  expenditure, for it involves an  intensified\r\n\r\nuse  of  overhead social capital. For example, the school\r\n\r\nbuildings  are  used  three  times  a  day,  for  morning\r\n\r\nschools,  for afternoon schools, and, finally  for  night\r\n\r\nclasses.  However, the use of these buildings unavoidably\r\n\r\nimposes  certain  limitations  on  the  scope  of   adult\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with the use of school buildings, the fact\r\n\r\nthat  these  are  used for teaching in  day-time,  as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be, means that the adult classes are only run  at\r\n\r\nnight. In fact, most of these classes are run after  6.30\r\n\r\np.m. But there is a demand for classes in the day-time as\r\n\r\nwell.  In fact, the Board has been conducting with  great\r\n\r\nsuccess language classes for office workers between  7.30\r\n\r\nand  9.00 a.m, and between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the\r\n\r\nevening. Classes for housewives, and other categories  of\r\n\r\nworkers  whose working hours are confined either only  to\r\n\r\nthe  morning, afternoon, or at night, cannot be organised\r\n\r\nbecause of the lack of facilities. The size of this adult\r\n\r\npopulation with leisure in the day-time can be gauged  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  the cinemas in Singapore have  found  it\r\n\r\nworth while to run shows at 11.00 a.m., 1.30 p.m., and  4\r\n\r\np.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of day-schools has also imposed a limitation on\r\n\r\nthe kind of classes the Board can run.

This speech  could\r\n\r\nhave  been more usefully made on the Main Estimates. Will\r\n\r\nthe  Member  please  get on with this particular \r\n\r\nitem - \"Adult  Education Centre\", the building of it and whether\r\n\r\nthere is a necessity for building it, wholly next year or\r\n\r\npartially next year? That is the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I will need\r\n\r\nabout another five minutes to finish what I want to  say.\r\n\r\nWould I have my five minutes, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> They have been designed to cater for\r\n\r\nthe  needs of an academic and literary type of education.\r\n\r\nBut  they  cannot be used for other types of classes  for\r\n\r\nwhich there is a popular demand, e.g, taxidermy, pottery,\r\n\r\nsilkscreen  painting, basket weaving  and  so  on.  These\r\n\r\nclasses are of a vocational and craft character. Some  of\r\n\r\nthese   require  special  equipment,  e.g. workbenches,\r\n\r\neasels, potter's wheels, baking kilns, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of school buildings has also resulted in the\r\n\r\ndifficult  problem of divided responsibility.  The  Board\r\n\r\nhas hardly any teaching equipment at all. For example, in\r\n\r\nthe  case of science classes, for which there is a  great\r\n\r\ndemand, especially at the pre-university level, the Board\r\n\r\nhas  to  make use of the school facilities and equipment.\r\n\r\nIn the day-schools, the Principal or a member of the \r\n\r\nfull-time staff is given the responsibility of taking care  of\r\n\r\nthem.  In  the  night classes, it is harder  to  delegate\r\n\r\nresponsibility. However, the problem has  been  partially\r\n\r\nsolved by employing the Principals or the members of  the\r\n\r\nfull  time staff as the supervisors of the adult  classes\r\n\r\nfunctioning in their schools. But it has not always  been\r\n\r\nfound possible to employ the Principals or the members of\r\n\r\nstaff responsible for the equipment in the day-schools to\r\n\r\nbe the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupervisors  in the night classes. In any case,  all  the\r\n\r\nstaff  engaged by the Board in its classes are  part-time\r\n\r\nand time-rated, and, for this reason, it is difficult  to\r\n\r\ndelegate  responsibility for the care of  the  equipment.\r\n\r\nThe Board has experienced great difficulty in getting the\r\n\r\nequipment  available for use for its night  classes.  The\r\n\r\ninadequacy of it inevitably has affected the teaching  in\r\n\r\nthe night classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has also employed the community centres for\r\n\r\nits classes. All community centres have provision for  at\r\n\r\nleast  one or two classrooms with furniture suitable  for\r\n\r\nteaching purposes. These facilities have at various times\r\n\r\nbeen  used for adult education, but the use of  them  has\r\n\r\nbeen  limited by a number of factors. First of  all,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  has  a  prior  claim   on   these\r\n\r\nfacilities  and this has posed a great deal of difficulty\r\n\r\nfor the Board because of the wide range of activities  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association.  Furthermore,  the  classroom\r\n\r\nfacilities are not always suited for the conduct of \r\n\r\nnight-classes.   The  community  centres  have  many out-door\r\n\r\nactivities   which  are  unavoidably  noise-making,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore,  are  distracting and  not  conducive  to  the\r\n\r\nlearning processes. In recent years, the installation  of\r\n\r\ntelevision  sets has increased the volume of distraction.\r\n\r\nFinally, the use of the community centres also raises the\r\n\r\nproblems of divided authority and responsibility for  the\r\n\r\nfacilities and equipment as encountered in certain  cases\r\n\r\nin the use of the school premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only premises over which the Board has direct\r\n\r\ncontrol are the Cultural Centre and the Annexe, which was\r\n\r\npreviously  a  government bungalow, now on lease  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard, on a year-to-year basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cultural Centre was built in 1955. Its construction\r\n\r\nwas  completed in 1957. It was never designed to  be  the\r\n\r\nHeadquarters of Adult Education, as it has since  become.\r\n\r\nIt  was  designed for what its name has clearly \r\n\r\nstated - namely,  a  centre  for  cultural  activities.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason,  the greater part of the building is  a  330-seat\r\n\r\ntheatre  and a foyer which can be used for art and  other\r\n\r\nexhibitions. As originally planned, adult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation facilities were limited to two classrooms  with\r\n\r\na  collapsible dividing partition for converting the  two\r\n\r\nclassrooms  into  a  lecture hall, if  necessary.  Office\r\n\r\naccommodation was planned for a small staff of about  ten\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the present Adult Education Board was formed,\r\n\r\nadult  education was the responsibility of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil for Adult Education. The latter was essentially a\r\n\r\nco-ordinating  body,  and  its scope  of  activities  was\r\n\r\nlimited. It was accommodated in the Cultural Centre. Even\r\n\r\nthen, the Singapore Council for Adult Education had found\r\n\r\nthe Cultural Centre inadequate, especially from the point\r\n\r\nof  view  of  office accommodation. It had to  convert  a\r\n\r\ngarage into needed office accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board, unlike the Council, is a\r\n\r\nplanning,  organising,  and employing  body.  The  latest\r\n\r\nfigures  I  secure from the Board show that, during  this\r\n\r\nyear, an average of about 57,000 students attend all  the\r\n\r\nBoard's classes and courses in any one month. This  large\r\n\r\nstudent  population requires a far larger  administration\r\n\r\nthan  before.  In the Cultural Centre, the  office  space\r\n\r\navailable has exceeded the saturation point. Any one  who\r\n\r\ntakes  the  trouble to visit the Cultural  Centre  during\r\n\r\noffice hours will notice this immediately. One of the two\r\n\r\nlecture rooms has already been converted for use  as  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Office,  resulting in a  reduction  of  urgently\r\n\r\nrequired   centrally   located   classrooms   for   adult\r\n\r\neducation.  In fact, the General Office faces  the  foyer\r\n\r\nwhere  the  canteen is also located. It is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ndaily experience that the staff is constantly assailed by\r\n\r\nthe  aroma of coffee and the smell of cooking in addition\r\n\r\nto  being  disturbed  by the chatter  of  people  in  the\r\n\r\ncanteen. Senior staff are crammed in the same room.  They\r\n\r\nhave  no  privacy  and do not enjoy the other  conditions\r\n\r\nnecessary  for sustained work and planning. There  is  no\r\n\r\nspecial  room available for Board and Committee meetings.\r\n\r\nIn  brief, there is no further room for the expansion  of\r\n\r\noffice space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the problem of accommodation has been\r\n\r\ntemporarily  overcome by the acquisition of  the  Annexe.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  building has been designed for residential purposes\r\n\r\nand not for an educational institution. Nevertheless, the\r\n\r\nBoard  has been forced to make use of it for some of  the\r\n\r\nclasses that cannot be held in the school buildings, e.g.\r\n\r\nChinese typewriting, and dress-making classes. The  Board\r\n\r\nhas   been  forced  even  to  make  use  of  garages  for\r\n\r\nconducting its classes. Thus, the photography classes are\r\n\r\nbeing run in a converted garage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly\r\n\r\nurge that the Government should give greater priority  to\r\n\r\nthe  construction of the Adult Education Centre  and  all\r\n\r\nhaste  should be exercised to complete it in the shortest\r\n\r\npossible time. Furthermore, our Government should be more\r\n\r\ngenerous  in its allocation for the construction  of  the\r\n\r\nCentre.  The Adult Education Board has done a great  deal\r\n\r\nof  good work in the past, and everything should be  done\r\n\r\nto  encourage  it to serve the society in a  constructive\r\n\r\nand useful way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol   for  presenting  a  very  good  case  for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a permanent Adult Education  Centre  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But I would preface my remarks by saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  case he put forward would make it appear to be  that\r\n\r\nhe  wanted an Adult Education Centre where all the varied\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the  Adult Education  Board  were  to  be\r\n\r\nconcentrated in that one centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, that is not the intention. The intention is\r\n\r\nto retain the decentralised feature of adult education in\r\n\r\nSingapore for various reasons, one of which is transport.\r\n\r\nIncidentally  the  people who  take  part  in  our  adult\r\n\r\neducation  classes are adults who want to  improve  their\r\n\r\nknowledge  in  various fields. Many of  them  are  people\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  the lower income group whose salaries  are\r\n\r\nsmall and, as such, they need to spend less on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransport  by  attending  these classes.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nAdult  Education Centre which Government intends to build\r\n\r\nin  the  near future is more of a nerve-centre for  adult\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore, and soon I will explain  briefly\r\n\r\nthe  various  divisions of that Centre. As  I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  it  is  not  meant to be  a  centre  where  all\r\n\r\nactivities,  classes, lectures, and so on, of  the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board are held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board - the Lembaga Gerakan\r\n\r\nPelajaran  Dewasa  - will  have its  new  headquarters  at\r\n\r\nArmenian  Street.  It will be a l3-storey  building,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, with a floor area of 81,800 sq, ft.  This\r\n\r\nbuilding  will  provide  an  administration  office,   30\r\n\r\nlecture rooms, 5 science laboratories, 2 domestic science\r\n\r\nrooms,  a  language laboratory - this is a new innovation\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  -  a  lecture hall, a film  and  reference\r\n\r\nlibrary,  and  special  rooms for extra-mural  activities\r\n\r\nlike  photography, art, and so on. Workshops of woodwork,\r\n\r\nradio   and  television,  electrical  and  motor   repair\r\n\r\nfacilities,  will  also be erected  but  at  a  different\r\n\r\nplace.  That  will be at the old sewerage site  in  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru - minus the smell, of course!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vote provides $50,000 to enable work on the\r\n\r\nproposed  headquarters and workshop  of  the  Lembaga  to\r\n\r\ncommence in 1966. The plan cost for the whole project  is\r\n\r\n$1.5  million, which is estimated to cover  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuildings  as  well  as  furniture  and  equipment.   The\r\n\r\noriginal  proposal  for the Lembaga was  for  a  building\r\n\r\nhaving a floor area of 91,000 square feet, costing  $3.15\r\n\r\nmillion.  But  the  Economic Planning Unit,  taking  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the real needs of the Lembaga's activities,\r\n\r\nthe  relative priorities in educational development,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  availability  of financial  resources  of  the\r\n\r\nState,  pruned  it down to a floor area of 81,000  square\r\n\r\nfeet,  costing $1.5 million. In other words,  the  frills\r\n\r\nand  finery  have  been made subordinate  to  utilitarian\r\n\r\nneeds in the interests of the economy of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lembaga has appealed for an upward revision of the\r\n\r\nplan  cost, but the considered view, I am told,  is  that\r\n\r\nthis sum is adequate for the proposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding  consisting of 81,800 square  feet.  But  if  it\r\n\r\nshould  prove inadequate, then a request for revision  of\r\n\r\nthe  plan  cost  can always be considered.  And  being  a\r\n\r\nGovernment which is very education-conscious, we are sure\r\n\r\nthat this request will be met when the time comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Education for having painted a very\r\n\r\nclear  picture of what the Adult Education  Centre  would\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr Ng\r\n\r\nKah Ting and Inche Mahmud Awang --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 03 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of item 001 of subhead 012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 03 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of item 001 of subhead 012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, does this provision in the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  include  provision for  a  primary  school  in\r\n\r\nHindoo  Road, which could not be built by December  1965,\r\n\r\nas  contained  in  a letter of the Urban  Rural  Services\r\n\r\nCommittee dated 10th August, 1964?

In Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\nthe number of children attending school has increased and\r\n\r\nnew  buildings  for  primary and  secondary  schools  are\r\n\r\nlimited. Children staying around Kaki Bukit are  sent  to\r\n\r\nOpera Estate and those staying in Jalan Eunos are sent to\r\n\r\nKaki  Bukit because of lack of classrooms. Likewise,  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  secondary schools where there is  only  one\r\n\r\nsecondary school in Kampong Kembangan Constituency; that,\r\n\r\ntoo,  is  an  integrated school. Thus, a good  number  of\r\n\r\nchildren  whose  ages are above 13  years  and  who  have\r\n\r\npassed  primary  school  and  who  should  be  going   to\r\n\r\nsecondary  school, are sent to as far as Punggol,  Changi\r\n\r\nand  other places.

The answer, of course, is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Hindoo Road School is actually in the 1965 programme\r\n\r\nbut it is to be built in 1966 under subhead 012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a special school as the area is limited and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   the  standard  type  of  primary   education\r\n\r\nbuilding cannot be sited on it.

There are several  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  schools  cannot be concentrated  in  any  particular\r\n\r\nconstituency.  It  is almost unavoidable  for  pupils  in\r\n\r\ncertain  localities  not to be given  places  in  schools\r\n\r\nnearest  their  homes. This is actually a  minor  problem\r\n\r\nprobably  not  affecting  even  five  per  cent  of   the\r\n\r\npopulation. Very rarely do we get a pupil, say, like  the\r\n\r\none  mentioned  by the Member for Kampong Kembangan,  who\r\n\r\nlives  in Kampong Kembangan and has been sent to a school\r\n\r\nin  Jurong.  As  I have said, during the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary Estimates, every case will be considered, and  I\r\n\r\npersonally shall be very happy to take up this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Kampong Kembangan, three schools have been built\r\n\r\nsince  1959.  The  one  at Kaki Bukit  is  an  integrated\r\n\r\nprimary  school  built in 1961. The  second  school,  the\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan Integrated Primary School, was built in\r\n\r\n1963. Then the third, the Kaki Bukit Secondary School, is\r\n\r\none of the few secondary schools built in the rural areas\r\n\r\nin  1964. As a matter of fact, the Minister for Education\r\n\r\ncomes  from Telok Ayer Constituency and in the  whole  of\r\n\r\nhis  constituency, there is not a single school. In other\r\n\r\nwords,    all    the   children   in   his   constituency\r\n\r\n[Interruption] no secondary school, Mr Speaker, Sir, In\r\n\r\nother  words,  all  the primary school  children  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency have to go to schools far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not go further, Mr Speaker, Sir, than to say\r\n\r\nthat  plans  are  coming not only  for  the  building  of\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools but, if I may mention for the  record,\r\n\r\nthe  schools which are to be built in 1966 actually  come\r\n\r\nunder  the same subhead, and I think it would be relevant\r\n\r\nfor me to mention something about them. In 1961, we built\r\n\r\na primary school in Wallich Street, a multi-storeyed one;\r\n\r\nin  1963,  a  primary school in Bedok  Road;  in  1965  a\r\n\r\nprimary school in Broadrick Road. Primary schools in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh,   Tiong  Bahru,  Hindoo  Road  (the  one  I   just\r\n\r\nmentioned) are for 1965 which will actually spill-over in\r\n\r\n1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary schools - MacPherson South Secondary School\r\n\r\nnow  under construction; there are Parry Avenue Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool,  Bukit  Timah Village Secondary  School,  Rangoon\r\n\r\nRoad  Secondary  School on the same site as  the  present\r\n\r\none,   Changi   10  m.s.

Then there are Crescent Road  and  Dunearn\r\n\r\nSecondary  Schools,  Holland  Village  Secondary  School,\r\n\r\nChestnut  Drive  Secondary School, Sennet Road  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool  in  Siglap Constituency. Then there  are  Lowland\r\n\r\nSecondary School, Toa Payoh Secondary School, Bukit Merah\r\n\r\nSecondary  School, Whitley Road Secondary School,  Linden\r\n\r\nDrive,  a  junior  college coming under the  category  of\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, all being planned for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure an even distribution of work and expenditure,\r\n\r\nthe  projects under the second Five-Year Plan  have  been\r\n\r\nphased so that there is no undue overloading for any  one\r\n\r\nyear.  The large number of schools to be built next  year\r\n\r\nunder  the  spill-over project has therefore necessitated\r\n\r\nthe  deferment of the building of new schools  under  the\r\n\r\nsecond Five-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may summarise, there are 8 primary schools\r\n\r\nshown  in  the  Estimates to be built  and  39  secondary\r\n\r\nschools shown under the same Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

As explained in the\r\n\r\nprevious debate on public cleansing, we have had to  face\r\n\r\na  situation  in  which  even if we  had  purchased  more\r\n\r\nvehicles for disposal of refuse, owing to the practice of\r\n\r\nabsenteeism  among  the  workers  and  sometimes  of  the\r\n\r\ndrivers,  there would have been more vehicles than  there\r\n\r\nwere  drivers.

Jurong Neighbourhood 1, a medium-sized market  with\r\n\r\n120  stalls  costing around $167,000; and  a  large-sized\r\n\r\nmarket with 150 stalls in the Bukit Ho Swee Neighbourhood\r\n\r\n4  area  estimated at $240,000; a very small-sized market\r\n\r\nwith  60 stalls in Tuas off Jurong which may come  up  to\r\n\r\n$123,000;  and  MacPherson  South  Estate  off   Pesiaran\r\n\r\nKeliling;  and the fifth one is likely to be at  the  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  New  Town Neighbourhood 3 or the Redhill extension\r\n\r\narea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  has not yet been decided. The first three  markets\r\n\r\nhave  already  been approved by the Development  Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member's second question about the proposed\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the new Hawkers' Code  which  will  be\r\n\r\nannounced  sometime  in February  and  the  licensing  of\r\n\r\nhawkers  from  1st  of March, I have indicated  that  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  of  hawkers will take a number  of  months  to\r\n\r\nconclude,  and  that  it is the first  step  towards  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of hawkers in Singapore. As indicated, the  five\r\n\r\nnew  markets  that will be built next year will  probably\r\n\r\nonly provide something like 500 stalls for hawkers. So it\r\n\r\nis  impossible  to give an answer that the  licensing  of\r\n\r\n40,000  to  50,000  hawkers can therefore  be  solved  by\r\n\r\nbuilding five markets next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is intended in the long-term plan for hawkers is\r\n\r\nto  get  them  into permanent premises to  conduct  their\r\n\r\nbusiness,  that  is  to say, either  in  Government-built\r\n\r\nmarkets or private markets or inside shop-houses. It will\r\n\r\ntake  some years before it can become effective, but  the\r\n\r\nnew  Hawkers' Code will provide a temporary  solution  to\r\n\r\nget  hawkers off the main streets. In fact, hawkers  will\r\n\r\nbe  prohibited from plying their trade along bus  routes.\r\n\r\nAt  the  present moment, we see too many hawkers crowding\r\n\r\nthemselves  around bus stops, and even at  pasar  malams,\r\n\r\nwith  their  wares  displayed inside  bus-stop  shelters,\r\n\r\nwhich is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by providing some accommodation for hawkers as a\r\n\r\ntemporary solution, we will try to get them away from the\r\n\r\nmain roads and bus routes and allocate places for them in\r\n\r\nside  streets. Gradually we will be able to persuade them\r\n\r\nthat  they can do better business if they find places  in\r\n\r\npermanent premises like markets, shop-houses and  so  on.\r\n\r\nWe  think that during the course of a few years we may be\r\n\r\nable to reach that ideal stage where hawkers, except  for\r\n\r\nthe  itinerant ones, will no longer be seen  doing  their\r\n\r\nbusiness in the open streets, as what is existing today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> In view of the explanation, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,814,930 for Head D 04 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 05 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

This is a source of danger to the people.\r\n\r\nThere are also sawmills in the vicinity of wooden houses.\r\n\r\nThat  also  is  a source of danger to the people  because\r\n\r\nlorries  carrying  heavy logs pass through  these  areas.\r\n\r\nThey  are thus damaging the roads and causing the  drains\r\n\r\nto be choked.

But we all know that\r\n\r\ntown  planning  is something new.

If we are to resettle them in  one  area,  so\r\n\r\nthat the transportation of the logs and planks would  not\r\n\r\ninterfere with the traffic or break up the roads, then we\r\n\r\nwill require an area of 400 acres or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, to answer the question put by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan.

The\r\n\r\nresettlement  of people ordinarily is quite  a  difficult\r\n\r\nproblem,  and the resettlement of trade and  industry  is\r\n\r\nmore difficult than that of resettling people. Anyway, we\r\n\r\nhave  already marked out an area and it is our  objective\r\n\r\nto  see  that as far as possible all offensive trades  or\r\n\r\ntrades  which  add to our traffic problem  would  be  set\r\n\r\naside in a different area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

The  Videotape\r\n\r\nRecording  technology is one of the  most  difficult  and\r\n\r\nmost  complicated aspects of television. But it  has  its\r\n\r\nadvantages. For example, this Videotape Recorder is  able\r\n\r\nto  record events on sight, and, secondly, it can do away\r\n\r\nwith  the  process  of developing,  as  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nconventional  films  by  tele-recorder  and  sound  tape.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  in  view  of  the  advantage  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to process the film, the playback or  telecast\r\n\r\ncould almost be immediately done after recording. Another\r\n\r\nadvantage is the fact that the films of the Videotape are\r\n\r\nclearer  than the conventional films. Finally,  from  the\r\n\r\neconomic  aspect, the Videotape can be  erased  and  used\r\n\r\nover  and over again, as we see in the conventional  tape\r\n\r\nrecorder.  So  from the economical aspect, the  Videotape\r\n\r\nRecorder  does, to a considerable extent,  cut  down  the\r\n\r\nexpenses of the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has touched slightly on the\r\n\r\nprogrammes.

The  average\r\n\r\ncost for the hiring of a film, say, of half an hour's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduration will cost the Ministry of Culture about $120  to\r\n\r\n$170.  The  average  cost is about $150.  If  we  are  to\r\n\r\nproduce  our  own  films locally, with local  talent  and\r\n\r\nlocal  material, it will cost us anything  from  $850  to\r\n\r\n$3,500. This gives us an average cost of $2,000. This  is\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  amount of expenses that any  film  producer\r\n\r\nmust  incur  in  producing  a  film  of  half  an  hour's\r\n\r\nduration. The reason for the high cost is that we have no\r\n\r\nmarkets for us to sell or to rent out these films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is no avenue for us to rent out our\r\n\r\nfilms to other parts of the world so as to defray part of\r\n\r\nthe  expenses incurred in the production of these  films.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we cannot forever depend on films from  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries;  and  particularly on the  Chinese  programmes\r\n\r\nside  we  are,  in fact, running short of  supplies.  The\r\n\r\nsource  of  supply  is  Hong Kong  and  the  quality  and\r\n\r\ncontents of some of these films from Hong Kong are not up\r\n\r\nto  expectations and standard for television. In view  of\r\n\r\nthe  concern  expressed  by Members  yesterday  afternoon\r\n\r\nabout  the  censorship of films, we find ourselves  in  a\r\n\r\nvery difficult position because television programming is\r\n\r\na  daily affair, unlike a normal cinema where a film like\r\n\r\nJames  Bond 007, for example, can perhaps be shown for  a\r\n\r\nperiod of two months. But on a television programme,  the\r\n\r\nfilm  has to be changed every day. Therefore, in time  to\r\n\r\ncome,  we  will run out of supplies, and we must  on  our\r\n\r\npart  take  the  initiative to remedy our  dependence  on\r\n\r\nforeign T.V. film distributors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this cannot be done until our new studio is\r\n\r\ncompleted  in  mid-1966, and as  I  said  in  this  House\r\n\r\nyesterday  afternoon,  the facilities  are  limited.  But\r\n\r\nthese  are  technical aspects. The other difficulty  that\r\n\r\nconfronts  us  is  the availability of talent.  Now,  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  talent  does  not necessarily  satisfy  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  television. So the difficulty  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter  is  manifold, and with the purchase of  this  new\r\n\r\nmachine,  and together with the new facilities  available\r\n\r\nin  the  new studio, we hope in the future to be able  to\r\n\r\nproduce more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocally  orientated films, notwithstanding the fact  that\r\n\r\nthis  may  cost the Government a considerable  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 06 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead 010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek your permission to deal with\r\n\r\nmy amendment* on subhead 011 at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The amendment reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head D 06 to be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 011.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

First,  he  has\r\n\r\nraised the question of children's playgrounds. As far  as\r\n\r\nthe  programme  for children's playgrounds is  concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is to provide 50 new children's playgrounds\r\n\r\nover  a  period of five years, at the rate  of,  say,  10\r\n\r\nplaygrounds each year. Each playground will have a  lawn,\r\n\r\ncompound, swings and see-saws. It will be about  an  acre\r\n\r\nin  area. As far as possible, these playgrounds  will  be\r\n\r\nsited  in  areas  where  the need is  greatest,  but,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  main consideration will be the availability\r\n\r\nof  suitable  sites. Consideration can be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nprovision of a children's playground in the Punggol  area\r\n\r\nprovided that the Government is satisfied that there is a\r\n\r\nneed for such a playground and also if a suitable site is\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other matter brought up by the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  concerning  the improvements  of  beaches,  this\r\n\r\nproject  is  for the improvement of beaches along  Nicoll\r\n\r\nDrive,  which  has proved to be one of the  most  popular\r\n\r\nseaside  resorts in Singapore. Selected sites  along  the\r\n\r\nbeach  will  be  developed and  planted  with  trees  and\r\n\r\nflowery shrubs and beauty added to the scenery. The beach\r\n\r\nwill also be kept clear of rubbish and debris and special\r\n\r\nreceptacles will be provided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the dumping of rubbish by members of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As available funds are limited, it is proposed in the\r\n\r\nfirst  phase  to  develop the beach along  Nicoll  Drive.\r\n\r\nThere are no plans at the moment to develop the beach  at\r\n\r\nPunggol which is, in fact, not as popular as the beach at\r\n\r\nthe north-eastern end, i.e. Changi and Pasir Ris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to hear\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary say that our Government will\r\n\r\nconsider building children's playgrounds on merit.

I would like to ask the Minister whether there  is\r\n\r\na  Committee  in  existence which meet  and  approve  new\r\n\r\nparking  places  to  be installed;  if  so,  whether  due\r\n\r\nconsideration  can be given to the business  premises  in\r\n\r\nthe  area,  because  where the space  in  front  of  such\r\n\r\npremises  is  taken  up  for  parking,  this  in  a   way\r\n\r\njeopardises  the  business.  In  many  constituencies,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the owners or occupiers of houses  find  it\r\n\r\nvery difficult either to carry on with their business  or\r\n\r\ntheir private affairs, because the area in front of their\r\n\r\nhouses is being used for parking places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider whether\r\n\r\nsome  consideration could be given to occupiers  of  such\r\n\r\npremises  or  business  concerns  by  providing   certain\r\n\r\nparking lots free for common use; that is to say, without\r\n\r\nall  the  parking lots being taken up. Another suggestion\r\n\r\nis  that if the parking lot in front of a house is  taken\r\n\r\nup,  the resident can get priority to use another parking\r\n\r\nlot  by  paying  a  monthly fee,  so  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nrestriction on the resident's use of the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a bit confused\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for  River Valley.

I  do  not know whether he has thought  carefully\r\n\r\nover  this  matter,  because if we were  to  reserve  the\r\n\r\nfrontages  solely  for the use of  the  shops,  then  the\r\n\r\ncustomers would have no place to park their cars and  the\r\n\r\nshops would be more affected that way; whereas if it were\r\n\r\nleft  to  the members of the public to make use of  these\r\n\r\nparking places, then it would be easier for the customers\r\n\r\nor intending customers to park their cars, so that on the\r\n\r\nwhole  the shops would not suffer. In fact, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  inform  the  House that when the parking  scheme  was\r\n\r\nfirst introduced there was an outcry from the shopkeepers\r\n\r\nthat  this would result in loss of business. But after  a\r\n\r\ntrial  for several months in certain areas, it was  found\r\n\r\nthat  far from affecting the business, it did help  them,\r\n\r\nbecause it meant a greater flow of cars which are  parked\r\n\r\nalong that area. If the area is left free for parking and\r\n\r\nno  charge  is made, there are quite a lot of people  who\r\n\r\nwill  just  leave their cars there, with the result  that\r\n\r\nshoppers  will have no chance at all to park  their  cars\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his question whether special consideration\r\n\r\nwould  be  given to shops whose frontages are marked  for\r\n\r\nparking  lots,  I  think there is in operation  a  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  consideration  is given  for  special  types  of\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  For  instance,  the  doctors.   Where   some\r\n\r\ndoctors' premises have their frontages marked for parking\r\n\r\nlots, then a parking lot is reserved for them, so that in\r\n\r\ncases of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nemergency, their patients can come to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I merely  want  to  make\r\n\r\ncertain constructive criticisms to enable the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to build better houses and to transform\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a better city under the second  Five-Year\r\n\r\nplan.   I  quite  appreciate  the  efficiency  and  great\r\n\r\nachievements of the Board under the last Five-Year  Plan,\r\n\r\nand  everybody appreciates them. The Board is  under  the\r\n\r\ndirection  of our Government and I want to speak  on  it,\r\n\r\nnot  just to praise it. All the people in South-East Asia\r\n\r\nhave praised the achievements of the Board. Even visitors\r\n\r\nfrom  Eastern  and Western European countries  have  also\r\n\r\npraised the achievements of the Board. This is a concrete\r\n\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say in connection with this item is that\r\n\r\nsimple  houses  were  built in the past,  and  they  were\r\n\r\nmostly   six-storey   or   five-storey   flats,   usually\r\n\r\nrectangular in shape. They look like this in this picture\r\n\r\n[indicating]. Mr Speaker, you can see that this  is  the\r\n\r\ntype of houses that were built in the past under the last\r\n\r\nFive-Year   Development  Plan.  Under  that   Plan,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore built low-cost houses in order to\r\n\r\naccommodate people of the lower income-group, and also to\r\n\r\nenable people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  middle  class  to live  in  them.  The  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  not able to solve the  housing  shortage\r\n\r\nproblem. So when we came to power, we laid stress on  the\r\n\r\nhousing  development  plan and we  put  forward  a  crash\r\n\r\nprogramme  to build a flat every 45 minutes in  order  to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of the people. At that time we were trying\r\n\r\nto  build flats quickly to accommodate as many people  as\r\n\r\npossible,  and at the same time we were trying to  fulfil\r\n\r\nour objectives to the people. So the plans for the houses\r\n\r\nduring that period were very simple, because they were of\r\n\r\ncheaper quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now feel that such a period has passed. The number of\r\n\r\nhouses  built  by the Housing and Development  Board  has\r\n\r\nactually  exceeded what was stipulated  in  the  previous\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan.  The target has been  exceeded.  In  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Five-Year  Development Plan, I  feel  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be certain changes in the designs of the flats  to\r\n\r\nbe built. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development has also touched upon this.  He  has\r\n\r\nalso  said  that Singapore today is quite different  from\r\n\r\nwhat it was 15 years ago. I agree with him that we should\r\n\r\nprogress  with the times, and we should have new  designs\r\n\r\nfor  our  future  houses to be built by the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. The old type of flats  built  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  during  the  past five years should  give  way  to\r\n\r\nmodern flats designed to keep pace with our progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the people who lived in Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats might not have cars. So the roads\r\n\r\naround   such  flats  may  not  be  suitable   today   to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the present volume of traffic.  The  streets\r\n\r\nand  roads inside the estates are crowded with  cars.  We\r\n\r\nknow that the people staying in flats in areas like Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  and  Queenstown  own cars. There  is  insufficient\r\n\r\nspace  for the parking of cars. The old plans should  now\r\n\r\nbe  corrected  to  meet  the new requirements  of  today,\r\n\r\nbecause the situation today is quite different from  that\r\n\r\nof  before. Therefore, we should change the plans of  the\r\n\r\nhouses to make them more beautiful so that our city  will\r\n\r\nbe more modernised, befitting the title of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  \"New  York  of Malaysia\", as it was once  called  by\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of flats at the moment is of a one-room unit,\r\n\r\na  two-room  unit, or a three-room unit. As I have  said,\r\n\r\nsome  flats are meant for sale and others are for renting\r\n\r\nout. Why cannot the Government proceed now to build units\r\n\r\nwith  three bedrooms and one hall, because there are many\r\n\r\nlarge families with more than 10 members? Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of houses should be based on the actual needs of\r\n\r\nthe  people  and  should not follow the old  trend  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  course. The present living  standard  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  suitable for the future needs of our  people,  and\r\n\r\nthe  common corridors perhaps could be somewhat corrected\r\n\r\nto  enable  people  with a slightly  higher  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  to  rent  or  buy Housing and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats, so that they can have more ideal accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns roads which should be\r\n\r\nbroadened.  Consideration should also  be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion of parking spaces in order to accommodate  cars.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, because of the shortage of car parks, some\r\n\r\nresidents  have to park their cars on the roads alongside\r\n\r\nthe  white  traffic lines. Traffic Police are  unable  to\r\n\r\nfine  such car-owners, because, in actual fact, there  is\r\n\r\nno space to park the cars. The present situation is quite\r\n\r\na   headache   to  the  residents  of  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what I say is mainly on these two points. I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned will consider my suggestions  so  that\r\n\r\nunder our next Five-Year Development Plan, Singapore will\r\n\r\nbe more beautiful with more modernised flats built by the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, under\r\n\r\nthis subhead, the allocation is $45 million for 1966  for\r\n\r\n14,000  flats. This sum of money is quite a large one.  I\r\n\r\nknow   that  there  are  many  people  who  need  housing\r\n\r\naccommodation. Although the Government has  built  60,000\r\n\r\nflats  of  the two-room or three-room type for people  of\r\n\r\nthe lower income group, according to the actual situation\r\n\r\nnow, we need to build more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses and flats in order to meet the requirements of the\r\n\r\npeople. I understand that flats are mainly built  in  the\r\n\r\ncity  area  - in Queenstown and Toa Payoh. In  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas, it seems that no flats are being built; the  rural\r\n\r\nareas have been overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Minister concerned should look into\r\n\r\nthis  matter  because ours is a developing  country.  The\r\n\r\nconstruction  plans  of  our  country  should  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration all parts of the island - not only the city\r\n\r\narea but all the rural areas - so that there is a balance\r\n\r\nin respect of housing development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister concerned will allot part\r\n\r\nof this sum to build houses in the rural areas, including\r\n\r\nthe surrounding islands. I refer to such areas as Changi,\r\n\r\nTampines, Punggol, Nee Soon and Sembawang. The people  in\r\n\r\nthese  areas,  I  understand, need housing accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe  houses  at the moment are very small,  dirty,  quite\r\n\r\nuntidy and mostly in a dilapidated state. Thus the people\r\n\r\nwho  live  in  them  risk their lives  if  there  is  any\r\n\r\noutbreak  of  fire.  The  Fire  Brigade  has  very   poor\r\n\r\nequipment to deal with this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Government will build more houses in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas, this will be welcomed by the rural  people,\r\n\r\nand  this  will also show that the Government is carrying\r\n\r\nout  the policy of building houses both for the urban and\r\n\r\nrural  people.  The housing plans should be  carried  out\r\n\r\nequally both in the rural and city areas. Moreover,  land\r\n\r\nprices in the rural areas are cheaper. So I hope that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will build more houses in the rural areas, and\r\n\r\nrent them out to the rural people at low rentals, because\r\n\r\ntheir  income  is somewhat less than that  of  the  urban\r\n\r\npeople.  Low  rentals will be more in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nliving standard of the rural people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to pay attention to the\r\n\r\nbuilding standards of the flats built. For instance,  the\r\n\r\nflats  in Queenstown have cracks in the walls. Some flats\r\n\r\nhave  been built to last for 99 years, but after a period\r\n\r\nof only two or three years, some cracks appear in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwalls of certain flats in the Queenstown and Tanjong  Rhu\r\n\r\nareas  and  elsewhere.  What is the  cause?  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned will look into the matter and see that\r\n\r\nthe  building materials used for the flats are up to  the\r\n\r\nstandards stipulated, so that in future there will be  no\r\n\r\nsuch flats of poor quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other shortcomings in regard to the\r\n\r\nlifts  in these flats. They usually go out of order,  and\r\n\r\nthe  lights  suddenly  go  out. This  inconveniences  the\r\n\r\nresidents, especially the children. When they are trapped\r\n\r\ninside  the lifts, they cry aloud but they are not heard.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there  should be more  proper  management  of\r\n\r\nthese lifts in the flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that the lifts are very unhygenic\r\n\r\nbecause  of  poor maintenance. Some children pass  motion\r\n\r\ninside  the  lifts  which usually  stink.  Of  course,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that it is not the sole responsibility of  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board,  but  if  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned will look into it and try to seek some  way  to\r\n\r\nimprove the situation, of course, things will improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Housing and Development Board plans to have a\r\n\r\nResidents' Committee to run and manage the flats they are\r\n\r\nliving in, I suggest that the authorities concerned  will\r\n\r\nencourage  the residents to join this Committee  so  that\r\n\r\nspecial  paid  staff can be engaged  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\nlifts, thus helping to solve the employment problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Mr Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board for the previous five years was  to  build\r\n\r\nsufficient  units of houses to meet the  demands  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. I believe when the First Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  completed, it did satisfy the needs of  our  people.\r\n\r\nNow we are embarking on the Second Five-Year Plan, and in\r\n\r\nthis  item there is a sum of $45 million for loan to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board to carry out this  Second\r\n\r\nFive-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to the Minister that our policy for this Plan\r\n\r\nshould  be for more of our people to own their own homes.\r\n\r\nI  believe with the improved standard of living  and  the\r\n\r\neconomic  position  of  our  country  today,  this  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility. In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  Address  on\r\n\r\nthe   policy  debate,  I  mentioned  that  one   of   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties the people who wish to own their  own  homes\r\n\r\nwould face is the down-payment which a person would  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  before he could own a home. I asked the Minister\r\n\r\nin  charge  if  he  could look into  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nwhether  contributors to the Central Provident Fund,  who\r\n\r\nhave sufficient funds standing to their credit, could use\r\n\r\ntheir  funds as surety to buy one of these Housing  Board\r\n\r\nhomes. This means that if that person's money can be used\r\n\r\nas   a  surety,  he  would  have  to  pay  slightly  more\r\n\r\ninstalments over a period of, say, 10 to 15 years. And if\r\n\r\nthis is possible, I am sure there will be more people who\r\n\r\nwould be able to own their own homes and thus assist  the\r\n\r\nGovernment financially, in that they do not have to  seek\r\n\r\nmore  money  to  build homes and then rent  them  out  to\r\n\r\npeople who can afford to buy these homes on instalments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest report of the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Board  which has just been released, No.  S  13  of\r\n\r\n1965,  there are over 14,000 contributors who  have  over\r\n\r\n$900  in  their savings. If this plan is possible,  there\r\n\r\nwould  be over 14,000 contributors who would be  able  to\r\n\r\nbuy   homes  without  a  down-payment,  by  using   their\r\n\r\ncontributions in the Central Provident Fund as a  surety.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  Minister  for Law and National  Development\r\n\r\ncould look into this possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I  think  everyone  knows  that  our  housing\r\n\r\nprojects have won recognition not only in South-East Asia\r\n\r\nbut  in  the  whole world. It was only recently  that  my\r\n\r\npredecessor,  who,  in  fact, is  the  one  Minister  who\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  solving the housing problem in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwas awarded the Magsaysay Award for his community work in\r\n\r\nbuilding houses in this city of ours and thereby  helping\r\n\r\nto  house  about  one-quarter of the population  of  this\r\n\r\ntown.   Instead  of  being  grateful,  I  see  that   our\r\n\r\nBackbenchers are even asking for more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can deal first with the hon. Member for Delta. She\r\n\r\nsays  our  houses  are simple, they  are  rectangular  in\r\n\r\nshape, we have passed the phase when housing was really a\r\n\r\nshortage,  and therefore we should change the designs.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know what she wants. Probably something circular!\r\n\r\nBut  we have looked into this matter and given it careful\r\n\r\nconsideration, and the view is that the present structure\r\n\r\nand  the  pattern  of these rectangular blocks  with  the\r\n\r\nminimum  space wasted is the most efficient and  economic\r\n\r\nin  the  circumstances. And since the lowering of housing\r\n\r\ncost  is  of  primary importance in public  housing,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot at the moment change the shape of these\r\n\r\nflats just for the sake of appearance. That was her first\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point she referred to was about the roads\r\n\r\nwithin  the  housing flats and also the  parking  spaces.\r\n\r\nHere  again,  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  having  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  fact  that the Board is  providing  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing  at  subsidised rentals for people in  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group,  it is firmly against any  change  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  policy  of providing one car-parking  space  for\r\n\r\nevery  six  units of two- and three-room  flats,  and  15\r\n\r\nunits of one-room flats. Extensive road improvements have\r\n\r\nbeen  carried out, and will be carried out  in  our  next\r\n\r\nFive-Year Plan to facilitate the flow of traffic  to  and\r\n\r\ninto and out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  housing  estates,  but  within  the  housing  estates\r\n\r\nthemselves, the standard 36-foot wide road will  continue\r\n\r\nto  be  provided.  The Public Works Department  has  many\r\n\r\nplans  to  improve  the  many road  systems  linking  the\r\n\r\nhousing estates to different parts of the city. There are\r\n\r\nmany such schemes, Mr Speaker, but I will not bother you\r\n\r\nwith further details on these schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Member for Delta was that\r\n\r\nwe  should build flats of three rooms with a hall. I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the Member that the Board has introduced  several\r\n\r\nnew  types  of  flats for our Second  Five-Year  Plan  in\r\n\r\naddition to our standard one-, two- and three-room flats.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  a one-room improved type of  flat  with  a\r\n\r\nfloor  area  of  340 square feet is being  introduced  as\r\n\r\nanother  standard plan. This improved one-room  flat,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  attracted considerable interest when a  full-scale\r\n\r\nfurnished model was displayed at the exhibition  in  July\r\n\r\n1965   in  Outram  Road.  This  type  of  flat  is  being\r\n\r\nconstructed  in Toa Payoh, Kallang Basin  and  the  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru fire site. The rental of these flats will be $30 as\r\n\r\nagainst  the  emergency type one-room  flat  at  $20  per\r\n\r\nmonth. Further an improved three-room flat has also  been\r\n\r\nintroduced into our standard plan. This type of flat will\r\n\r\nhave  a  separate bathroom and water closet and  also  an\r\n\r\nenlarged balcony. The floor area will be about 80  square\r\n\r\nfeet  bigger than the standard three-room flats of  about\r\n\r\n550  to  630 square feet. The Board has also proposed  to\r\n\r\nconstruct  a small number of four-room flats for \r\n\r\nbigger-sized  families.  In fact, 472 units of  these  four-room\r\n\r\nflats  will be built at the corner of Alexandra Road  and\r\n\r\nHenderson Road. The proposed rental will be in the region\r\n\r\nof  about  $100  a  month. I think that disposes  of  the\r\n\r\npoints raised by the Member for Delta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Sembawang. He wants us to\r\n\r\nbuild flats in the rural areas. I say first things first.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not run before we can walk. The urgent need  for\r\n\r\nhouses is in the urban and semi-urban districts. If we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuild flats in the rural areas, I doubt whether they will\r\n\r\nall  be  occupied. In the rural areas the folk are mostly\r\n\r\nfarmers  or  fishermen.  They  need  land  on  which   to\r\n\r\ncultivate their crops or rear chickens and, at the moment\r\n\r\nanyway, we do not think we should start building flats in\r\n\r\nthese  areas. Besides, the population is not very  dense,\r\n\r\nand  if any rural farmer or fisherman desires a flat,  he\r\n\r\ncan  always  shift from the rural areas and apply  for  a\r\n\r\nflat  in  town. As far as the rural areas are  concerned,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  we feel that we should provide  the  rural\r\n\r\nfolks,   firstly,   with  water   and,   secondly,   with\r\n\r\nelectricity and, lastly, with housing accommodation. Most\r\n\r\nof   our  efforts  at  the  moment  are  concentrated  on\r\n\r\nextending the water and electricity supply throughout the\r\n\r\nisland, and in particular to the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complained about some of the\r\n\r\nflats in Queenstown having cracks in the walls. I am glad\r\n\r\nhe  said  \"some\"!  Mr Speaker, Sir,  it  is  practically\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  build so many flats in Singapore  without\r\n\r\nsome  of  them  having  cracks.  But  these  cracks,  are\r\n\r\nremedied  when  complaints are sent in. As  long  as  the\r\n\r\nhouses do not topple down and kill the occupants, I think\r\n\r\nif  I were in their place, I would be quite happy to have\r\n\r\na flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member complains about the lifts breaking\r\n\r\ndown.  May I remind the Member that lifts not only  break\r\n\r\ndown  in Housing Board flats, but also in other buildings\r\n\r\nin  Singapore? And as far as the flats in Queenstown  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, the lifts probably break down because  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents or their children. And if the children, as  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member complains, do things in the lift which  they\r\n\r\nshould not do, surely one cannot blame the Housing Board.\r\n\r\nThe  occupants  of  these flats should look  after  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  But on this point I am glad to note  that  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  said that the Housing Board is  not  solely\r\n\r\nresponsible.  He  has also asked us to provide  staff  to\r\n\r\nlook  after the lifts. This, I think, explains  my  point\r\n\r\nthat  they are never satisfied. You provide them  with  a\r\n\r\nhouse;  you provide them with a lift; they want staff  to\r\n\r\nup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  down the lift and to look after it. I say that there\r\n\r\nis a limit to what we can do for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  come  now  to the point raised by the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley  who  says  that we should  encourage  more\r\n\r\npeople  to own their own homes or flats. I say that  this\r\n\r\nis  a  good  policy.  We would be happy  if  everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore owns his own house. That is a Utopia  to  which\r\n\r\nwe can look forward, but I do not think we can accomplish\r\n\r\nit in the near future. But his main point is the funds or\r\n\r\nmonies  in the Central Provident Fund. He would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether the contributors to this fund can  withdraw\r\n\r\ntheir  contributions and use the money to pay  the  first\r\n\r\ninstalment  or \"surety\" that is needed when  one  buys  a\r\n\r\nflat. Mr Speaker. Sir, I am not in charge of the Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund. I believe it is the Minister for  Labour.\r\n\r\nBut  as  far as I am aware, there is no provision in  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund Ordinance to allow contributors to\r\n\r\nwithdraw their contribution, to use the money --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I make a\r\n\r\npoint of clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

When it rains, the roads become muddy, and when it\r\n\r\nis  hot, the roads are full of dust.

The increase  of  $210,000  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of agricultural and kampong roads  next  year\r\n\r\nshows  that  the  present Government is stepping  up  its\r\n\r\nefforts  to  give  kampong people better road  facilities\r\n\r\nnext year. It has always been the Government's policy  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the same facilities not only to the urban  areas\r\n\r\nbut  also  to the rural areas. Sir, I wonder whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  give priority to the  making  up  of  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  roads  in  my constituency.  They  are:  Jalan\r\n\r\nSaksama, Jalan Greja, Siak Kuan Road, Main Road at  Pulau\r\n\r\nTekong Besar and Jalan Darat Nanas. Jalan Darat Nanas,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  should be given immediate attention, because  the\r\n\r\ncompound  of Changi Prison is now fenced and  declared  a\r\n\r\nprotected  area.  There is a kampong  behind  the  prison\r\n\r\ncalled  Kampong  Darat Nanas, and  more  than  a  hundred\r\n\r\nhouses  are situated there. The people make use of  Jalan\r\n\r\nAwan  which  is  in  the compound of  Changi  Prison  for\r\n\r\ngetting  into the kampong. They have been making  use  of\r\n\r\nthis  road  for more than 25 years. Now that  the  prison\r\n\r\ncompound  is fenced, there is no other through road,  and\r\n\r\nthis   is  very  inconvenient  for  the  kampong   folks,\r\n\r\nespecially the school children. Sir, I wrote a letter  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the U.R.S.C. dated 15th of  July,  1965,\r\n\r\nand something was done to level up the reserve road, i.e.\r\n\r\nJalan Darat Nanas, for which I must be thankful. Sir, two\r\n\r\nmonths have elapsed and this road has become inaccessible\r\n\r\ndue to pot-holes caused by heavy rain. Therefore, I shall\r\n\r\nbe  extremely  grateful if the Minister could  look  into\r\n\r\nthis matter with great urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about 3,000 to 4,000 people in Pulau Tekong Besar\r\n\r\nare  making use of the only road in the pulau.

I  notice  some  roads  have  been\r\n\r\nmetalled in my constituency but no drains have been made,\r\n\r\ni.e. roads  are metalled without drains on  both  sides.\r\n\r\nVery  often  these  roads do not last  long.  Also,  such\r\n\r\nkampong  and  agricultural roads are made up of  laterite\r\n\r\nand,  when  repaired,  will last for  only  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nmonths.

The work done by it is well known. But is the\r\n\r\nMinister aware that in the rural areas the roads and\r\n\r\nbridges are not constructed in a practical manner? Their\r\n\r\nconstruction is a waste. In the rural areas the roads\r\n\r\nbuilt are laterite roads. If a car were to pass over a\r\n\r\nroad after a rainstorm, the whole road would be damaged.\r\n\r\nOn the average a rural road will have to be repaired\r\n\r\nafter only six months. If the Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nCommittee could allocate more money for the building of\r\n\r\nbetter roads, these roads do not need to be repaired\r\n\r\nafter only a few months. When we look at these roads\r\n\r\nduring the day-time, we can see dust flying about. This\r\n\r\nis rather unhygienic to the rural people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to bridges, if a heavy lorry were to pass\r\n\r\nover  one of these wooden structures, it may collapse.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  will  prohibit  heavy  lorries  from\r\n\r\npassing  over these bridges and roads. This is  the  only\r\n\r\nway to keep them in good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to bring up is the\r\n\r\nrequest  made by rural people for the building  of  roads\r\n\r\nand   bridges.  These  are  urgently  required  by  them.\r\n\r\nAlthough  these requests have been approved by the  Urban\r\n\r\nand  Rural Services Committee - and there are cases where\r\n\r\nsix  months have elapsed since the approval was  \r\n\r\ngiven - nothing  was  done. I hope once approval has been  given,\r\n\r\nwork  can commence after three months. But there are some\r\n\r\nroads and bridges in my constituency which have not  been\r\n\r\nbuilt even though their construction has been approved by\r\n\r\nthe  Urban  and Rural Services Committee. If Mr  Speaker\r\n\r\nwill  approve  of  it,  I  will  quote  two  examples  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  my point. This is a notice from  the  Urban\r\n\r\nand  Rural Services Committee. The excerpt says  that  if\r\n\r\nwithin  three  months no work is carried  out,  then  the\r\n\r\nUrban  and Rural Services Committee can be asked to  give\r\n\r\nan explanation.

According to him, most\r\n\r\nof   the  requests  which  were  made  during  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's visit to his constituency were submitted to my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  but  they were not carried out.  This  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  For example, in 1965, the Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nCommittee has already approved an amount of $106,845  for\r\n\r\nthe improvement of kampong roads, drainage, the provision\r\n\r\nof stand-pipes and other social amenities. Sir, the Urban\r\n\r\nand  Rural  Services  Committee  has  to  look  after  51\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  and  not  only  one  or  two  particular\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  As  such, the vote allocated  should  be\r\n\r\nspread out to 51 constituencies. So you will see that for\r\n\r\nthat one constituency we are spending over $100,000. This\r\n\r\nis a very special case. I also want to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan to the  fact  that\r\n\r\nbefore   the  P.A.P.  Government  came  to  power,  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan was totally neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has requested for repairs to\r\n\r\nJalan  Nanas.  This  road  leads  to  the  Changi  Prison\r\n\r\ncompound, and there are about one hundred houses there. I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the Member that the engineer in charge of the\r\n\r\narea  concerned has been asked to investigate the  matter\r\n\r\nand when the estimate of cost is ready, it will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubmitted  for the consideration of the Urban  and  Rural\r\n\r\nServices Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the road at Pulau Tekong Besar, this is a\r\n\r\nvery long road, probably more than three miles long,  and\r\n\r\nits  repair will cost a huge sum of money. But we are now\r\n\r\nlooking into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How long?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> More than three miles long. We can\r\n\r\ndo it by stages, you know!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol complained that there is very\r\n\r\nlittle  improvement to the road repairs  in  the  kampong\r\n\r\narea. Sir, he is a member of the Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  this type of problem can  be  raised  and\r\n\r\ndiscussed at Committee level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member for Ulu Pandan's complaint about\r\n\r\nthe  project approved by the U.R.S.C. in March, and  that\r\n\r\nno  work  has since been carried out, I have  to  explain\r\n\r\nhere  that  he is referring to Kampong Kim Ho. This  area\r\n\r\nhas  been  acquired by the Housing Board and is earmarked\r\n\r\nfor  future  development, probably in one or  two  years'\r\n\r\ntime.  There is no point at this moment in spending  much\r\n\r\nmoney  on the place when the Government is going to clear\r\n\r\nthe  area.  The  Urban and Rural Services  Committee  has\r\n\r\nissued  a circular to all Assemblymen concerned to inform\r\n\r\nthe Committee whenever any project is not carried out  by\r\n\r\nthe Committee after it has been approved. Any Assemblyman\r\n\r\nwishing  to do so must then write in officially  and  not\r\n\r\nraise a verbal complaint, so that the Secretary can  take\r\n\r\nup the matter with the Department concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan also complained that most of\r\n\r\nthe roads in the rural areas are of agricultural standard\r\n\r\nand  not  metalled. This is entirely wrong. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, from the beginning of this year, the Urban and Rural\r\n\r\nServices Committee has adopted a policy to metal as  many\r\n\r\nas  possible of the kampong roads so that the  number  of\r\n\r\nagricultural  roads will decrease. Most of these  kampong\r\n\r\nroads  that  we  are going to repair are of  agricultural\r\n\r\nstandard. After a shower of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrain,  the  whole road is damaged. So the  policy  is  to\r\n\r\nmetal  these kampong roads to avoid wasting public  money\r\n\r\non temporary repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  missed my point.

To give an example, I remember that\r\n\r\nat one place\r\n\r\n-  I  forgot  the  name of the road - we  provided  earth\r\n\r\ndrains  along a road but after two or three  months  they\r\n\r\ndisappeared.

There  is  one\r\n\r\nlittle complaint I wish to make here, and that is,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  big scheme in my area which is split up into three\r\n\r\nphases.  One of the phases extends from the 7th milestone\r\n\r\nPunggol  Road right up to 9\ufffd milestone Punggol  Road  and\r\n\r\ninto Serangoon Kechil. This is where I am concerned. In a\r\n\r\ncertain part of Serangoon Kechil, there are some numbered\r\n\r\nand unnumbered attap houses whose owners have applied for\r\n\r\nelectricity   supply.   But,  unfortunately,   the   last\r\n\r\nelectrical post that carries the overhead cable stops  at\r\n\r\na  certain place and, therefore, a few houses have to pay\r\n\r\nfor  the  extra poles. So petitions were made to  me  and\r\n\r\napplications were sent to the Electricity Department. The\r\n\r\npetitions sent to me were forwarded, but up to now, after\r\n\r\na lapse of well over six months, nothing has been done. I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister concerned to enlighten me on this\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of jetties, I would like to know\r\n\r\nthe  number of jetties that are to be constructed in  the\r\n\r\nIslands  next year. As regards water supply in  Track  13\r\n\r\noff Punggol Road, requests for water supply were made  in\r\n\r\n1963  and again this year. The residents have waited  for\r\n\r\nmore  than two full years for their request to be acceded\r\n\r\nto,  but  unfortunately up to date, no  water  facilities\r\n\r\nhave been made available to the residents in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding minor works in kampong areas, as I have\r\n\r\nsuggested just now, when roads are repaired, it is better\r\n\r\nthat  we  spend a little more money to metal as  many  of\r\n\r\nthem as possible and to construct some drains within  the\r\n\r\nsum  allocated  for this purpose. When I say  \"construct\"\r\n\r\ndrains, I do not mean just earth drains which are covered\r\n\r\nup  after a shower. What I mean is lining the drains with\r\n\r\nconcrete slabs so that public funds are well spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister concerned will enlighten me on the\r\n\r\npoints that I have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

There is a provision\r\n\r\nfor   jetties,  $100,000  provided  for  next  year.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is considering constructing 6 jetties  -5  in\r\n\r\nthe  Southern  Islands and one in Changi. The  5  in  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands are: (1) Pulau Seraya, (2) Pulau  Bukom\r\n\r\nKechil, (3) Pulau Seking, (4) Pulau Semakau and (5) Pulau\r\n\r\nAyer  Merbau.  These 5 are in the Southern  Islands,  and\r\n\r\nKampong  Panghang, Pulau Tekong, that is in  Changi.

The sum of money is  spent\r\n\r\non  the  repair  of  roads as well as  on  providing  for\r\n\r\nstandpipes and water supply. He should be satisfied, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever it is repair to a major road to provide for\r\n\r\ndrainage, the Committee will consider it, but not  for  a\r\n\r\nsmall track or a small lane to provide the drainage.

I  gladly  welcome  the  move  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of union recognition by an employer within  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  the  Ordinance by treating recognition  as  an\r\n\r\nindustrial matter. But my concern is that the question of\r\n\r\nunion  recognition does not seem to be  adequately  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  in the proposed amendment. I refer to the fact that\r\n\r\na  union may not be granted recognition by an employer if\r\n\r\nthe  result of a secret ballot shows that the trade union\r\n\r\ndoes not represent the majority of the employees or class\r\n\r\nof employees in respect of whom the right to represent is\r\n\r\nclaimed  by the trade union, as stated in subsection  (3)\r\n\r\nof the proposed section 15A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am bringing up this point because, once this\r\n\r\nBill  is  passed  by  this House  and  becomes  law,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  union recognition becomes  very  vital  and\r\n\r\ncrucial to any union, and until a union has been accorded\r\n\r\nrecognition  by  an  employer  in  accordance  with   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the proposed section, the  union  has  no\r\n\r\nright to represent the employees vis-a-vis the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem of union recognition does not arise in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  an  established industry or  undertaking  where\r\n\r\nunionisation has taken place or has been taking place for\r\n\r\nsome  time.  In  such  a case, the  provision  for  union\r\n\r\nrecognition  as  set  out  in  the  proposed  section  is\r\n\r\nadequate, because unionisation of workers will have taken\r\n\r\nplace.  The  problem then would likely be one of  whether\r\n\r\nUnion A or Union B should be given the right to represent\r\n\r\nthe  workers. In such a situation, where two rival unions\r\n\r\ncompete for the right to represent the workers - I repeat\r\n\r\nonce  more  here  -  I agree that the  provision  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment deals adequately with the problem  of\r\n\r\nresolving  which  union is to be accorded  the  right  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the employees. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not think there will be any disagreement among Members\r\n\r\nin this House that they would not consider it unfair that\r\n\r\nthe union which obtains the majority of votes in a secret\r\n\r\nballot  should  be given the sole right to represent  the\r\n\r\nworkers  vis-a-vis the employer. What I have in  mind  is\r\n\r\nthis,  that  in the case of a new industry or undertaking\r\n\r\nwhere unionisation is in the process of taking place  and\r\n\r\nin  such a case where a union has only started to move in\r\n\r\nand  organise the workers, it is plain common sense  that\r\n\r\nit  will  take some time before the union can  enrol  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  workers in such industry or undertaking  to\r\n\r\nbecome members of the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been given to understand by the Pioneer\r\n\r\nIndustries  Employees' Union that  the  workers  in  such\r\n\r\nindustry  or  undertaking are often reluctant  to  become\r\n\r\nmembers  of the union until they are convinced  that  the\r\n\r\nunion  can  do  something for them in relation  to  their\r\n\r\nbenefits,  terms  and  conditions of  service.  But  this\r\n\r\nmeans,  in effect, that the workers expect the  union  to\r\n\r\nobtain  a favourable collective agreement on their behalf\r\n\r\nbefore they consent to become members of the union.  This\r\n\r\nI  can  assure you, Sir, can make things rather difficult\r\n\r\nfor the union, because when negotiations for a collective\r\n\r\nagreement break down - and this is highly probable in the\r\n\r\ncase of a first collective agreement - the matter will be\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court   whose\r\n\r\npractice  in the case of a first collective agreement  is\r\n\r\nto  make an award that follows the minimum provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing employment Ordinance in Singapore. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  difficult  to  understand  here  why  these  workers\r\n\r\nquestion  the  purpose of a union when it  is  unable  to\r\n\r\nobtain  for them benefits over and above those laid  down\r\n\r\nin the relevant employment Ordinances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the point, it would be hardly conducive to\r\n\r\nindustrial peace to allow a situation to develop where an\r\n\r\nemployer can refuse recognition to a union solely on  the\r\n\r\nground  that  it does not represent the majority  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees. So to prevent such a situation I suggest  that\r\n\r\nsome provision be made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister to direct, at his discretion, that  any\r\n\r\nunion   be   accorded   recognition   by   an   employer,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that such a provision will  have\r\n\r\nthe  effectiveness of the proposed section  15A.  Such  a\r\n\r\nprovision,  of course, is subject to the fact  that  only\r\n\r\none   union  is  involved  in  this  question  of   union\r\n\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated earlier, Sir, where two or more unions\r\n\r\nare  competing for recognition it is only fair  that  the\r\n\r\nunion  which  obtains the majority of votes in  a  secret\r\n\r\nballot is entitled to represent the workers comprised  in\r\n\r\nthe  secret ballot. To extend this principle of  majority\r\n\r\nto   a   situation  where  only  one  union  is   seeking\r\n\r\nrecognition  from  an employer is to  create  unnecessary\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest and injustice because, as I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier, in the case of a new industry or undertaking, it\r\n\r\nmay be difficult for a union to organise the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe workers until some time has elapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to make in respect of this\r\n\r\nquestion of union recognition is that some provision must\r\n\r\nbe  made  to safeguard the interests of workers  who  are\r\n\r\nmembers  of a union which has lost out in secret  ballots\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are two unions competing for the  right  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  the workers. Now, according to the  provisions\r\n\r\nof the proposed section l5A, only a successful union will\r\n\r\nbe recognised as a negotiating body for the workers. But,\r\n\r\nas  it  often  happens, the members of  the  unsuccessful\r\n\r\nunion are liable to be victimised by the employers. I  am\r\n\r\nfully  aware that sections 75, 76 and 77 of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nprovide  legal protection for such workers who have  been\r\n\r\nvictimised  by  the  employers. The  difficulty  lies  in\r\n\r\nenforcing or seeking the legal protection provided  under\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance. The difficulty lies in the fact  that  no\r\n\r\nemployer  will be so foolish as to state in  writing  the\r\n\r\ntrue  reasons why he had victimised a worker. It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat the latter is engaged in trade union activities  and\r\n\r\nalso the fact that the worker, being a human being, is so\r\n\r\nperfect  that  an employer cannot find any fault  in  his\r\n\r\nconduct or competence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  efficiency  as to warrant his justification  for  the\r\n\r\ndismissal  of the employee. I will deal with  this  point\r\n\r\nmore  fully  later. For the present, I only wish  to  add\r\n\r\nthat the successful prosecution of an employer under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  sections 75, 76 and 77 of  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nmust  be  dependent  on circumstantial  evidence  in  the\r\n\r\nabsence of better evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer may tell a worker in the privacy of his\r\n\r\noffice  that  it is detrimental to the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworker if he persists in continuing his union activities.\r\n\r\nIf the employer is brought to court and if he denies that\r\n\r\nhe  ever  made such a statement, then it is the  worker's\r\n\r\nword  against the employer as to whether such a statement\r\n\r\nwas ever made by the employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the difficulty facing a worker when he\r\n\r\nseeks  to obtain redress through the ordinary law  court,\r\n\r\nit  is  no surprise that the worker would prefer to  have\r\n\r\nhis  legitimate grievance or complaint dealt with by  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I want to make here is that the proposed\r\n\r\nsection l5A should provide that where two or more  unions\r\n\r\ncompete  for  the right to represent the  workers,  those\r\n\r\nworkers  who have been members of the unsuccessful  union\r\n\r\nup to the time of the secret ballot and still continue to\r\n\r\nbe members of the unsuccessful union in spite of the fact\r\n\r\nthat  this union has no locus standi in the eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer, should be brought before the Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nby  the unsuccessful union. As I see it, this question of\r\n\r\nunion  recognition  should  be  properly  treated  as   a\r\n\r\nquestion of the definition of the relationship between an\r\n\r\nemployer and a union in respect of a collective agreement\r\n\r\nand  other incidental matters thereof. While an  employer\r\n\r\nis  entitled to refuse to deal with any union other  than\r\n\r\nthe   one  to  whom  he  has  accorded  recognition,   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the provision of the  proposed  section\r\n\r\n15A., he should not be allowed to seek refuge behind  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this section when he has committed  an  act\r\n\r\nof  injustice  which  is within the jurisdiction  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court to direct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I think I should remind Members that\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court grants hearing only  to\r\n\r\nan  employer or to a union - an individual worker has  no\r\n\r\nright  to appear before the Industrial Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\nThe  Industrial Arbitration Court grants hearing only  to\r\n\r\nan employer. So there is no opportunity for an individual\r\n\r\nworker, if he has grievances, to appear before the Court.\r\n\r\nEven no union can appear on his behalf, because, you see,\r\n\r\nit   is  not  recognised  by  the  employer.  Under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this proposed section 15A, the  plight  of\r\n\r\nthose workers who are members of the union which lost out\r\n\r\nin  the secret ballot is most unenviable. Any dispute the\r\n\r\nworkers  may have with their employer cannot  be  brought\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Industrial Arbitration Court, because  under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of section 20 (a) of  the  Ordinance,  a\r\n\r\njoint  application by both the employer and the union  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  reference  of  the  dispute  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court. In the situation  as  I  am\r\n\r\ndescribing now, the employer will not consent to  make  a\r\n\r\njoint  application with the union which the  employer  is\r\n\r\nentitled  not  to  recognise as a representative  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  and the union which is accorded recognition  by\r\n\r\nthe  employer will be entitled to refuse to take  up  the\r\n\r\ncase of these workers who are not their members. This, in\r\n\r\neffect,  leaves such workers without the right of redress\r\n\r\nto the Industrial Arbitration Court. Under the provisions\r\n\r\nof the present Ordinance, the Minister may direct such  a\r\n\r\ndispute  as  I  have  described to  be  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration  Court  in  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  section 28 (b) . But my  only  concern  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the enactment of the proposed section  15A  will\r\n\r\nhave  any effect on the Minister's right to intervene  in\r\n\r\nthe  situation I have described before. If  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  can give me an assurance that  it  is  still\r\n\r\npossible,  after  the enactment of the  proposed  section\r\n\r\n15A,  for  workers who are members of a union which  lost\r\n\r\nout  in  a  secret ballot to obtain redress  through  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the event of any dispute arising between them and the\r\n\r\nemployer, I shall be most satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to comment on another section of  the\r\n\r\nBill  which is section 18 where it is proposed to  delete\r\n\r\nthe existing subsections (2) and (3) of section 39 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  insert  in  place  thereof  another  five\r\n\r\nsubsections.   My   interest  lies  with   the   proposed\r\n\r\nsubsection  (6) wherein it is stated that an appeal  from\r\n\r\nthe  decision of a referee to the Court shall be made  in\r\n\r\nthe prescribed manner within 14 days from the date of the\r\n\r\nreferee's decision. I am of the opinion that the 14 days'\r\n\r\nlimit  for  the  making of an appeal  is  inadequate.  My\r\n\r\nreasons  for saying so are, (a) it is nowhere  stated  in\r\n\r\nany  of  the proposed subsections of section 39 that  the\r\n\r\nreferee  must  make  his award in  writing  or  that  the\r\n\r\nreferee  must  give the grounds of his decision  together\r\n\r\nwith his decision. I do not see how a person can make  an\r\n\r\nappeal  unless  he knows what he is appealing  from.  The\r\n\r\npresent  system of making available transcripts of  court\r\n\r\nproceedings  to  the  parties is  highly  unsatisfactory,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  apparent  understaffing  in  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court. It may take a party as long  as  three\r\n\r\nmonths  to obtain such transcripts. I have been given  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that some unions had made representations  to\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Arbitration Court in respect of this delay\r\n\r\nin  obtaining Court transcripts and had been told by  the\r\n\r\nCourt  officer  that the Court is under no obligation  to\r\n\r\nsupply Court transcripts to any party. While I agree that\r\n\r\nthe  Court officer is correct in making such a statement,\r\n\r\nthe fact remains that the party to any proceedings before\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court has to wait for  months\r\n\r\nbefore  he  can  lay his hands on Court  transcripts  for\r\n\r\nwhich he has to pay quite a sum of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that no union can afford to employ a\r\n\r\nstaff  of  stenographers at its own expense to take  down\r\n\r\nCourt  proceedings for its own use. I am not making  this\r\n\r\ncriticism  of  the Industrial Arbitration Court  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of running it down. What I want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemphasize  is  that the provisions of  making  an  appeal\r\n\r\nwithin  14  days  is impracticable in the  light  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  staff  situation in the  Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt. I would suggest that the phrase \"notice of appeal\"\r\n\r\nbe inserted in place of appeal in the proposed subsection\r\n\r\n(6) and that a longer time period be given for filing  an\r\n\r\nappeal under the provisions of this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in section 22 of the Bill wherein it is proposed\r\n\r\nto  delete  subsection (2) of section 79 of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nand  insert in place thereof seven new subsections, I  am\r\n\r\nof  the opinion that the proposed amendment does not  add\r\n\r\nto   the  efficiency  of  section  79  and  the  proposed\r\n\r\nprosecution  of an employer in respect of offences  under\r\n\r\nsection  75 or 77 is cumbersome as the existing  mode  of\r\n\r\nprosecution   under  the  present  provisions   of   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The crux of the matter, as far as the National\r\n\r\nTrades  Union  Congress  is  concerned,  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nwritten  consent  of the Public Prosecutor  is  necessary\r\n\r\nbefore  any  prosecution  can  be  instituted  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 79. As I have said earlier,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  enough  to  institute prosecution  proceedings\r\n\r\nagainst an employer in respect of any offences under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance  without\r\n\r\nmaking  it  more difficult by requiring that  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor must be satisfied that such a prosecution must\r\n\r\nhave a chance of success before he would give his consent\r\n\r\nto  the  prosecution being instituted.  In  effect,  this\r\n\r\nmeans that any complaint by a worker against his employer\r\n\r\nmust   have   a  double  trial  before  he   can   obtain\r\n\r\nsatisfaction for his complaint. First before  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor,  and then before the trial judge.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nspeculating  on  the  probable  effect  of  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendment, but I am speaking from bitter experience.  The\r\n\r\nNational  Trades  Union  Congress has  submitted  several\r\n\r\ncases  to  the  then  State  Advocate-General,  now   the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General,  for  his  necessary   consent   before\r\n\r\ninstituting prosecution proceedings. In such cases as the\r\n\r\nBritish  Eastern  (Malaya) Ltd, and  the  Singer  Sewing\r\n\r\nMachine Co., where some employees were dismissed  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhighly  suspicious  circumstances,  no  consent  to   the\r\n\r\ninstitution   of   prosecution  proceedings   under   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance was obtained because  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  was of the opinion that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nsufficient case. Only in one case that involved Lim  Teck\r\n\r\nLee  &  Co. was consent given to institute a prosecution.\r\n\r\nEven then I am given to understand that the police is not\r\n\r\npressing  forward  with  this  prosecution.  It  is   the\r\n\r\ncontention of the National Trades Union Congress that, in\r\n\r\nview   of   the   unsatisfactory  mode   of   instituting\r\n\r\nprosecution  proceedings under the  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   the  most  suitable  manner  of  instituting\r\n\r\nprosecution proceedings should be as provided  for  under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of section 132 of the Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode  (Chapter  132). In advocating such a  procedure,  I\r\n\r\nhave  in  mind  that  the  Public Prosecutor  is  already\r\n\r\noverburdened  with work and that it will take  some  time\r\n\r\nfor  him to examine the facts of the case before  he  can\r\n\r\ndecide   whether  to  give  his  whole  consent  to   the\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  any  prosecution proceedings  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance.  I  can\r\n\r\nsee  no strong objection to the adoption of the procedure\r\n\r\nlaid  down in Chapter 132 of the Criminal Procedure Code,\r\n\r\nexcept  that possibly the Government of Singapore has  no\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  incumbents  on  the  Bench  in   the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court, for surely a magistrate will be  able\r\n\r\nto  put a stop to any frivolous prosecution when he comes\r\n\r\nacross it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, there are sufficient safeguards under the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure Code to prevent a person  from  being\r\n\r\nunduly  inconvenienced by any complaint laid  before  the\r\n\r\nmagistrate.  I  presume from the term  \"public  officers\"\r\n\r\nreferred to in the proposed subsection, the Minister  has\r\n\r\nin  mind  any  Government employee other  than  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer.  He  is not very concerned as to  who  makes  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  I  would  have thought  that  the  police\r\n\r\nofficer,  by  the nature of his training, should  be  the\r\n\r\nproper person to make any investigation in respect of  an\r\n\r\noffence  under the provisions of the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the procedure laid down in the proposed\r\n\r\namendment,  it  may  take a long time before  consent  to\r\n\r\ninstitute  prosecution proceedings can be given.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  the worker who has been injured by an  offence\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  which  consent to institute  prosecution\r\n\r\nproceedings is sought, justifiably feels that his time is\r\n\r\nbeing  wasted. Where an ordinary worker is  concerned,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  happier if he is to appear before a magistrate  and\r\n\r\ntold by him that he has no case against his employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that it is not only sufficient to\r\n\r\nensure that justice is done, but it is also important  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  justice is seen to be done. As  far  as  an\r\n\r\nordinary  worker  is concerned, it appears  to  him  that\r\n\r\njustice  is  not  done  where the decision  to  institute\r\n\r\nprosecution   proceedings  for  an  offence   under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance is  left\r\n\r\nsolely  in the hands of the Public Prosecutor. After  all\r\n\r\nis  over, he will still be left with the feeling that  no\r\n\r\naction has ever been taken on his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather\r\n\r\nsurprised  that the Member for Bras Basah and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok Blangah have still got so much to say on  this\r\n\r\nBill. In fact, the amendments contained in this Bill were\r\n\r\nbased  on a memorandum submitted by the N.T.U.C. at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  1964 and throughout the whole of 1965,  we  have\r\n\r\nspent  much time with the representative of the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nto  work  out the amendments in this Bill. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\namendments  contained in this Bill were mainly  proposals\r\n\r\nmade  by  the N.T.U.C. and in many committee meetings  we\r\n\r\nhave already explained --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister give way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I can only agree with the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour that some amendments were effected in consultation\r\n\r\nwith the N.T.U.C. representative,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  not  all the amendments in the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance. In our deliberations with the officials of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour, we told them that we would  reserve\r\n\r\nour  right to comment. So we did not fully agree with all\r\n\r\nthe amendments, but we did agree with some amendments. We\r\n\r\ndid not make any comment on those amendments we agreed. I\r\n\r\nam  only  commenting on all those amendments on which  we\r\n\r\nstill have some area of disagreement with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Nevertheless, the whole of this\r\n\r\namendment is based on the proposals made by the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nOf  course, we cannot say that every proposal made by the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. must be accepted by the Government. Some of  the\r\n\r\nproposals  can be accepted, but some of them,  we  think,\r\n\r\nare demanding too much and will not be in the interest of\r\n\r\nindustry  as a whole. So we have rejected some  of  these\r\n\r\nproposals,  and  we have given full explanations  to  the\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the N.T.U.C. I think the  N.T.U.C. has\r\n\r\ndeveloped into such a big organisation that sometimes its\r\n\r\nleft  hand may not know what its right hand is  doing.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  blame  it for that, because the N.T.U.C. is  now\r\n\r\nrepresenting about 75 per cent of our working population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me come to the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMembers. One of the points raised by the Member for  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  is that he has some misgivings about clause  8  of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  Bill. He said that it  is  not  adequate\r\n\r\nenough   to   deal   with  unions  seeking   recognition,\r\n\r\nespecially   the  unions  which  are  in  the  pioneering\r\n\r\nindustries. I think he has not read the Bill as a  whole.\r\n\r\nHe  came across this clause 8 and he found that under new\r\n\r\nsection 15A there will be a provision: `No trade union of\r\n\r\nemployees  which  has not been given  recognition  by  an\r\n\r\nemployer  in  the  prescribed manner may  serve  on  that\r\n\r\nemployer a notice under section 16 of this Ordinance.' So\r\n\r\nhe  came  to the conclusion that unions in the pioneering\r\n\r\nindustries may not be able to seek recognition because of\r\n\r\nthis clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to him that there is still\r\n\r\nanother clause in the Bill \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- clause  23  -  which seeks to amend section  81  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  this provision empowers the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations  governing  the  recognition  of  trade\r\n\r\nunions,   and   I   must  inform  the  House   that   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the N.T.U.C. have, in fact, worked out\r\n\r\nthe regulations to be published governing the recognition\r\n\r\nof trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in these regulations which will be published if\r\n\r\nthis  Bill is passed, one of the things which is provided\r\n\r\nis  that  a  trade  union of employees may  serve  on  an\r\n\r\nemployer  a claim for recognition in the prescribed  form\r\n\r\nand  that once this claim is served on him, he must  give\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  that  union within seven  working  days,\r\n\r\nunless he has some reason for not recognising it. In this\r\n\r\ncase  then,  the union will have the right to notify  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour who will direct  that  a  secret\r\n\r\nballot  be taken in accordance with the directions  given\r\n\r\nby  him  within a reasonable period, and once the  secret\r\n\r\nballot  has  decided that the union is  representing  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the workers, the employer must recognise it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is no law to provide that an employer\r\n\r\nmust  recognise a trade union, but if this Bill is passed\r\n\r\nand  the  regulations  which we are  going  to  make  are\r\n\r\npublished,  then there will be something legally  binding\r\n\r\non  the  employer to recognise the union.  So  the  point\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Bras Basah will not arise here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member also complained that there are not\r\n\r\nenough  safeguards for the workers if they are victimised\r\n\r\nby  employers.  In  other words, he is  complaining  that\r\n\r\nsection 77 is not adequate enough to let our trade unions\r\n\r\nprosecute  employers  who  are found  to  be  victimising\r\n\r\nworkers.  Now,  I  would like to remind Members  that  in\r\n\r\nOctober  this  year the N.T.U.C. held its  Second  Annual\r\n\r\nDelegates Conference, and the then Secretary-General, Mr\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair,  made a report to the N.T.U.C. for  and  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Central Committee of the N.T.U.C. In one of\r\n\r\nthe passages in this report, he said --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Minister give the citation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes. This is the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General's  report  for  and  on  behalf  of  the \r\n\r\nCentral Committee  of  the  N.T.U.C. which was presented to the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. Conference in October 1965. In page 18  of  this\r\n\r\nreport, Mr Devan Nair, among other things, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  several discussions took place in  the  State\r\n\r\nEconomic  Consultative  Committee  as  well  as  directly\r\n\r\nbetween  the N.T.U.C. and the Government. The  Government\r\n\r\nis   happy  to  announce  that  as  a  result  of   these\r\n\r\ndiscussions, several major changes will be  made  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance. These  changes  will  be\r\n\r\ncontained in a Bill intituled \"An Ordinance to amend  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Relations  Ordinance,   1966\",   which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has agreed to introduce at the next sitting of\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, among the amendments envisaged by the Bill would be\r\n\r\nprovisions  covering  the following  matters.  There  are\r\n\r\nseveral matters here - (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f)  and\r\n\r\n(g), I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(g) A more efficient and simplified procedure to deal\r\n\r\nwith contraventions by employers under section 77 of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here it is very clear that the then\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  N.T.U.C. was quite satisfied  \r\n\r\nthat  the Bill,  which is now being debated here, provides \r\n\r\na  more efficient   and  simplified  procedure   to   deal   with\r\n\r\ncontraventions of the Ordinance. I do not  know  why  the\r\n\r\nMember  still  wants to raise this question  since  their\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  had agreed that what  is  provided  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill is adequate enough to deal with contraventions\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the N.T.U.C., of course, would like to be given\r\n\r\nthe  power to prosecute employers as soon as they dismiss\r\n\r\ntheir  workers.  This  would be an  ideal  case  for  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. and for the trade unions, but I am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot allow this, because once we make  it  a\r\n\r\nlaw  that  employers  would be prosecuted  whenever  they\r\n\r\ndismiss  their workers, then I am sure nobody would  like\r\n\r\nto bring in their capital to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.
