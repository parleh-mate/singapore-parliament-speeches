Each month, 160 rental flats are returned to HDB while 370 eligible applications are received.&nbsp; Given the limited numbers of rental flats, we need to ensure that rental flats are allocated to only deserving cases without alternative housing options.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;The average waiting time for a rental flat ranges from two to six months, depending on location.&nbsp; Those who need rental flats urgently can participate in HDB's Daily Selection Scheme where flats are available for immediate selection and allocation on a daily basis.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has no plans to build 3-room rental flats, as we need to focus our limited resources on meeting the housing needs of as many needy households as possible.&nbsp; In addition, rental flats also need to remain small so that the rent will be affordable to the families in need.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, HDB plans to convert some available 3- and 4-room blocks at Boon Lay and Woodlands into about 1,000 units of 1- and 2-room rental flats.&nbsp; HDB will also build new 1- and 2-room rental flats in the near future starting with around 1,000 units in the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We have a limited stock of rental flats and we have to allocate them carefully.&nbsp; From a resource allocation perspective, we would prefer to have two singles sharing a 1-room flat.&nbsp; HDB has facilitated the pairing up in the past.&nbsp; We do try to put them together and, in some cases, where it is extenuating, as the Member has mentioned, perhaps&nbsp;the demise of a spouse or there are some peculiar personality issues, we have made exceptions.&nbsp; But from a resource allocation perspective, we want to maximise the limited pool of rental flats that we have and, if possible, get as many needy people housed.&nbsp; For every 1-room flat that is only occupied by one person and leaving the other vacancies unoccupied, we do have another person basically to house.&nbsp; From our perspective, with a limited budget, having two singles paired up is the best solution, going forward.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, will the Ministry consider, for families which are low-income but larger in size and who may find 1- or 2-room flats too small for their living comfort, opening up 3-room flats for those families in need?&nbsp; The second question is:&nbsp; why is it&nbsp;that HDB is appointing commercial marketing agents to market 3-room flats to be rented out at commercial rates?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

To have new 3-room flats at the expense of being able to build two 1-room flats, for example, obviously it is&nbsp;wiser to have more 1-room flats than a single larger room flat, like a 3-room flat.&nbsp; So, from a resource allocation perspective again, we would stick to 1- or 2-room flats because, as much as we like to <p align=left>Column: 1349<p>provide a shelter for the needy, we would also like to encourage them to own their homes at some point in time, and&nbsp; comfort is&nbsp;a good&nbsp;reason to encourage them to perhaps start with acquiring a 2-room flat, for example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of&nbsp;management agents renting out 3-room flats, that is really for us to make better use of vacant flats.&nbsp; They do not come under the Public Rental Scheme.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):&nbsp;</B> Sir, some elderly cannot rent a flat in the open market.&nbsp; They cannot afford to stay in their own flat and they have to sell their flat.&nbsp; But HDB will come back to them to say that they cannot, because they have to go through a 30-month debarment period.&nbsp; Not only that, some of them have purchased two flats before.&nbsp; But these elderly, with medical bills to pay, have no choice but to sell their flat to settle the many bills that they have.&nbsp; I want to ask the Minister of State whether there is flexibility&nbsp;given for those who have bought two flats before and those who have sold their flats and have to move on to a smaller flat, to give them this rental option.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other question is that the Minister of State has been stressing that there is a limited number of flats.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister&nbsp;of State whether there is any possibility of increasing the number of rental flats to meet this increasing demand for rental flats?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B>&nbsp; I will take the second question first.&nbsp; As I have mentioned in my answer, we are planning to construct new rental flats over the next few years and we are also in the process of converting 3- and 4-room flats into 1- and 2-room rental flats.&nbsp; That review is done after considering the number of new applications that we have.&nbsp; We are receiving about 370 eligible applications <p align=left>Column: 1350<p>on a monthly basis.&nbsp; We have a stock of 1,200 at the moment.&nbsp; We will be using up our rental stock quite quickly if we are not careful in assigning the rental flats.&nbsp; That is what we are doing.&nbsp; We are starting to construct and convert the 3- and 4-room flats into 1- and 2-room rental flats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the 30-month&nbsp;debarment period rule as well as having sold two flats or more, I think Members would agree with me that the rental flats are heavily subsidised.&nbsp; For example, for those who earn $800 a month and below, we are charging them $30 for a&nbsp;1-room flat and $60 for a 2-room flat.&nbsp; It is highly subsidised and highly attractive, and if we do not have very strict rules, I think it will be very attractive for many to turn to rental flats as an option.&nbsp; We should keep rental flats to those that are really in need and therefore there are rules, for example, to stop families who have just sold and received a big proceed from their sale of flat, to rent and to look at rental housing as a first choice option.&nbsp; Having said that, we have exercised discretion and we have granted exceptions to cases that are really deserving.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In this case that the Member has mentioned, for income brackets of $800 to $1,500, after the revision, we are talking about a monthly rental of $110 for a 1-room flat and $150 for a 2-room flat.&nbsp; I believe that for someone who is earning $800 to $1,500, this would be an acceptable amount to pay.&nbsp; It is actually way below market rate.&nbsp; The subsidy is very heavy.&nbsp; But obviously we would apply a principle that if you have the ability to pay, you should pay according to your earning capacity.&nbsp; In this case, for $800 to $1,500, we have decided to raise the rental progressively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Having said that, we were very mindful of the impact on the low-income and that is the reason why we have capped those who are earning $800 and below at rentals of&nbsp;$30 and $60&nbsp;for 1- and 2-room respectively for the time being.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B><B>Mr</B> Hawazi Daipi:&nbsp;</B> Sir, in&nbsp;tandem with the robust employment growth, the prospects for residents retrenched from PMET jobs in 2006 were much better <p align=left>Column: 1353<p>compared to the three years before.&nbsp; 83% of the residents retrenched from PMET jobs in the first six months of 2006 were re-employed by September 2006, ie, within nine months of retrenchment.&nbsp; This is a significant improvement compared to 2004 and 2005 where the re-employment rates were 67% and 71% respectively.&nbsp; The re-employment rate for PMETs as at September 2006 is also higher than the overall resident re-employment rate of 76% for the same period.&nbsp; Furthermore, the re-employment prospects for retrenched PMETs aged 50 and above had improved dramatically from 54% in 2004, 61% in 2005 to 86% in 2006.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment of PMETs has also fallen.&nbsp; The resident unemployment rate for PMETs has declined steadily from a high of 4.1% in June 2003 to 2.9% in June 2006. This is much lower than the overall resident unemployment rate of 4.5%&nbsp; in June 2006 and 3.6% in December 2006.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we recognise that some PMETs may need help to find a job.&nbsp; Between January&nbsp; and December&nbsp; last year, the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) assisted some 3,800 PMETs to obtain employment through its Public Employment System (PES) and funded some 17,000 PMETs to upgrade their skills via SDF-funded programmes.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, other PMET-targeted programmes have been effective in helping many PMETs find&nbsp;work opportunities in wholly new career areas.&nbsp; For example, since 2003, more than 400 PMETs have been trained and put onto new career pathways in nursing and radiography, under the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme (SMCP) in Healthcare.&nbsp; A new programme introduced last year, called the Property Officer Re-skilling Programme, has helped 61 workers holding at least a diploma qualification to be retrained as property officers.&nbsp; 184 workers were placed and trained for the<p align=left>Column: 1354<p> marine and maritime industry, under the ASMI Super V programme in 2006. However, it is ultimately the buoyant economy that will create demand for PMETs, thus allowing them to find employment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If not for anything, it is at least an exercise to gauge how long these re-employed PMETs will stay in employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is that in a globalised economy, we know that retrenchment among PMETs is going to be a recurring problem, even when the economy is good.&nbsp; In view of this, what other kind of long-term programmes will the Ministry be looking into for the PMETs, especially also for PMETs in the service sector?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question I have has to do with the fact that PMETs represent a very rich pool of talents.&nbsp; If we do not capitalise on this talent pool, it is really a waste.&nbsp; Many of the skills and experience may be in demand outside Singapore, but PMETs may not be able to tap these opportunities on their own. Therefore, what plans does the Ministry have in terms of aggregating the talents and experience of these displaced PMETs in order to help them to secure overseas assignments?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We already have&nbsp;programmes covering&nbsp;14 industry sectors - retail, hotel and accommodation services, logistics, healthcare, marine and maritime engineering services, and so on.&nbsp; These are programmes which are designed to help PMETs to gain new skills, so that they are even more employable, whether for their future use or when they are seeking re-employment.&nbsp; We can always expand and look for new areas in which we can help PMETs to gain new skills.&nbsp; But I want to report that we have actually a lot of programmes already running for PMETs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on whether we can help Singaporean PMETs to find jobs overseas, our <p align=left>Column: 1357<p>best knowledge lies locally.&nbsp; I think we have a good knowledge about local employment needs, skill needs and employment demand.&nbsp; It is best to focus our attention on the local market and help our PMETs and job-seekers alike to look at areas in which there are demands for workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr Speaker, Sir, allow&nbsp;me to address Question Nos. 5, 6 and 7&nbsp;together.&nbsp; The three Questions&nbsp;relate to <p align=left>Column: 1358<p>the pre-school education scene, benefits of pre-school education, and opportunities to level up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pre-school landscape in Singapore is diverse, with various community and private organisations providing a variety of pre-school education programmes to cater to different needs and expectations.&nbsp; As at 1st January 2007, there are altogether 1,210 kindergartens&nbsp; and childcare centres offering pre-school education. &nbsp;Of these, 492 (40.4%) are kindergartens and the rest are&nbsp;childcare centres.&nbsp; This diversity provides choice for parents to select the most appropriate pre-school education in accordance to their needs and preferences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent international research suggests that the early childhood years are a sensitive period in which a child's future development can be influenced.&nbsp; Our own data at MOE indicates that pre-school education is particularly helpful in allowing children from low-income families and non-English speaking families to catch up with their peers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the vast majority of parents already recognise the value of pre-school education.&nbsp; We estimate that roughly 95% of children have received formal pre-school education.&nbsp; Given this attendance rate and the real choice parents have from a diversity of the pre-school options available, MOE does not see a need to make pre-school education compulsory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is therefore&nbsp;targeting its efforts at continuing to uplift the quality of pre-school education, particularly for children from lower-income backgrounds.&nbsp; Several measures to improve quality have been introduced over the years by MOE, such as developing a curriculum framework, introducing training, qualification requirements for teachers, and accrediting teacher training courses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1359<p> MOE is also working with MCYS, the People's Association and the self-help groups in a coordinated effort to reach out to the small number of families, ie, the 5% that I mentioned just now,&nbsp;who do not already send their children to pre-school and to persuade them to do so.&nbsp; The success of these joint and targeted efforts will, we hope, have a significant impact on this group of children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE and MCYS provide operators with guidelines on making fee revisions, but do not control their fees. &nbsp;For example, pre-schools intending to raise their fees are advised to provide adequate notice to parents about&nbsp;their fee revision plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a variety of financial assistance schemes in place to help children from lower-income families.&nbsp; MCYS provides a fee subsidy under its Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS).&nbsp; Families which cannot afford the initial costs related to sending their children to kindergarten may also be considered for a Start-up Grant (SUG) of up to $200 per child per year.&nbsp; For low-income families with children enrolled in childcare centres, there is also the Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC) if mothers are also working. &nbsp;Low-income families can receive up to $300 in childcare subsidies per month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who need further help, community-based support is available through the grassroots organisations and&nbsp;self-help groups.&nbsp; For example, CDAC and MENDAKI provide additional financial assistance to needy families under the Pre-School Assistance and Support Scheme (PASS) and Education Trust Fund (ETF) initiatives respectively.&nbsp; Advisers and grassroots leaders can also tap on the Citizens&rsquo; Consultative Committees' (CCC) <p align=left>Column: 1360<p>Welfare and Education Fund, and the ComCare Fund to assist their residents who need financial support to send their children to pre-school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our primary schools are doing good work to help children catch up and realise their potential, regardless of their initial starting point, whether or not they have attended pre-school.&nbsp; From this year, the enhanced Learning Support Programme (LSP) will be rolled out to all Primary schools, starting with the Primary 1 children.&nbsp; The enhanced LSP provides a more customised support for children to improve their basic early reading skills.&nbsp; Similarly, additional support in Mathematics for P1 pupils has also been introduced in all schools this year.&nbsp; Many schools continue to provide customised support for children needing help in English and Mathematics beyond Primary 2.&nbsp; Hence, support for these children does extend beyond the pre-school years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rigorous primary school curriculum, coupled with support programmes, builds strong foundations for our children to go on to secondary and post-secondary education.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Lastly, am I not correct to say that a $48-million opportunity fund has been set up to help children in schools to level up by paying for their co-curricular opportunities, such as going for overseas trips?&nbsp;

The funding for primary education&nbsp;is quite separate from compulsory education. Compulsory education compels people to attend school.&nbsp; It does not actually mean free education. So it is quite a separate issue altogether. The funding for pre-school is targeted at this point of time for the primary needs of those in need as well as to upgrade the skills of the teachers in the industry. So there have been a lot of efforts to put in resources to upgrade the teachers' skills, qualifications as well as the curriculum framework to help all children attending pre-school education to attain the same good standards for all.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MEDICAL PLANS FOR AN AGEING POPULATION--><p align=left>Column: 1363<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:MEDICAL PLANS FOR AN AGEING POPULATION:::1367--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>MEDICAL PLANS FOR AN AGEING POPULATION</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua</B> asked the Minister for Health (a) how are our medical training programmes and facilities at hospitals oriented towards coping with the needs of an ageing population; (b) how many of our doctors are trained in gerontology; and (c) whether there are plans to set up a special centre for gerontology in Singapore.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Health (Mr Heng Chee How)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Health (Mr Heng Chee How) (for the Minister for Health):</B>&nbsp; Sir, as our population ages, the skills of our healthcare professionals and the care facilities will need to change to meet evolving patient needs.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help doctors prepare for the care of the elderly, Geriatric Medicine is now a core module for undergraduate medical training. The Ministry has also taken steps to increase the exposure of doctors to this field and to encourage more to take up this specialty. Today, there are over 40 geriatricians in Singapore, and this&nbsp;is double the number in 2002.&nbsp; In addition, we have 46 doctors who completed the NUS Graduate Diploma in Geriatric Medicine over the last five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efforts are also in place to prepare nurses to take care of&nbsp;our elderly patients. Over the past 10 years, 177 nurses have been trained in Gerontology under the Nanyang Polytechnic&rsquo;s Advanced Diploma Programme. The NUS Master of Nursing programme also offers Gerontology as an area of specialisation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that elderly patients tend to have multiple medical needs, all restructured hospitals have in place geriatric departments or services which work closely with other specialties to coordinate care for elderly patients. Some hospitals also arrange for their geriatricians and other specialists to provide continued care for patients when they are <p align=left>Column: 1364<p>transferred to community hospitals for rehabilitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides specialist care within hospitals, there is also an important role for Family Physicians in helping society deal with the health challenges of an ageing population.&nbsp; A good Family Physician will know the medical history of his patient well and is in the best position to help coordinate that patient&rsquo;s need for specialist care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, MOH has made changes to the training programme for family physicians to better prepare them for an ageing population. Elderly care is now a compulsory module for all family medicine training programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, from May 2007 onwards, all trainees in Family Medicine will go through a compulsory posting in hospital geriatrics departments. They will also be given the option to do additional posting in community hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we are&nbsp;not aware of any plan to set up a special centre for gerontology.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask MOS whether&nbsp;we have a section on gerontology in the polyclinics now.&nbsp; If not, are there plans to set up, because a lot of our residents are now going to polyclinics for such help?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is:&nbsp; what are the three top common ailments among the elderly?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is:&nbsp; how is the physiotherapy department coping with the demand now?&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a shortage of these physiotherapists, what are the plans to address this problem?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Heng Chee How</B>:&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;on the different ailments of the elderly, you can&nbsp;divide them into diseases that become <p align=left>Column: 1365<p>more prevalent as one ages, as well as the risk associated with one's physical condition as one ages.&nbsp; On both fronts, we will&nbsp;have to&nbsp;put in efforts.&nbsp; We know that recently, the Ministry has introduced a chronic disease management programme.&nbsp;This one actually takes the society from the point of middle-age onwards and we have included four diseases in that programme - diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and stroke.&nbsp; The idea is&nbsp;to say that, as we prepare&nbsp;an ageing society to better take care of itself, we also organise the&nbsp;resources, both in the community&nbsp;as well as in the medical community, to gear up for this increasing need.&nbsp; These are not the only four diseases, but certainly, these would be diseases that we would want to care for.&nbsp; Obviously, as one ages, there will be other diseases, such as Alzheimers, for example, that would also become&nbsp;more prevalent.&nbsp; So there is a wide range.&nbsp; I do not have the exact rank order to provide to the Member.&nbsp; But, certainly, we will have to address that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the risk to the physical condition of the elderly,&nbsp;we all know that falls and hip fractures, for example, would be one category.&nbsp; It is something that we can do a lot about, both in terms of how do you help an&nbsp;elderly&nbsp;person who has suffered a fall to recover,&nbsp;and also&nbsp;at the same time, what can be done within the home setting, for example, to prevent these occurrences.&nbsp; I want to address the concern of the Member by saying that it is not only the medical facilities that we have got to look at, but it is an entire societal effort.&nbsp; Certainly, within the medical side of things, the emphasis is on what we call \"right siting\". What do we mean by \"right siting\"?&nbsp; It means that we try to address the needs as close to the community and as close to the person as possible, rather than to wait for a deterioration and for this person to be&nbsp;bumped around in a complex organisation and finally ending up in acute care which is actually very expensive and perhaps too <p align=left>Column: 1366<p>late.&nbsp; So it is precisely in this connection that we have and will continue to emphasise the role of family physicians and how we can better equip them. These GPs are&nbsp;the best gatekeepers&nbsp;in helping to refer our elderly patients in a familiar setting for the help that they need. Certainly, in this regard, our polyclinics is also part of this community network and we will look at our facilities there and to adjust to the needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of training up more manpower of&nbsp;the right kind to address this need, I have already earlier given some figures.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</B>:&nbsp; I would like to ask MOS,&nbsp;in line with the wish on&nbsp;the part of MOH to keep the elderly sick at home and in the community,&nbsp;are there plans on the part of MOH to intensify efforts to help caregivers take care of the elderly sick at home because the services and facilities currently available&nbsp;are extremely lacking?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Heng Chee How</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would&nbsp;agree with the Member&nbsp;that, as a society, much more can and should be done in the area of preparing all of us to take better care of the elderly in a home setting and in&nbsp;a community setting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of specific examples of what could be done, I recently visited the Jurong Medical Centre.&nbsp;There, I saw a particular section that has been constructed, specialising&nbsp;not only in showing people how&nbsp;they could&nbsp;configure the home setting in order to better provide for the safety,&nbsp;comfort and care of the elderly, but they also emphasise on the training of caregivers to use&nbsp;in the correct way such equipment and to provide such care.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of theft cases involving metals increased considerably last year. About 1,100 such cases were reported, representing an increase of some 570 cases (or about double the number) as compared to 2005. This increase can be attributed to opportunistic criminals capitalising on rising metal prices by stealing various metallic items for&nbsp;sale as scrap metal. Fuelled by the high demand in&nbsp;countries such as China and India, the price of metal is expected to rise even further in the next few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the types of goods stolen, they comprise cables and wires (44%), raw materials (9%), lightning conductors (6%) and urns (5%).&nbsp; These&nbsp;were among the most common items stolen last year.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1372<p>Other items include metal pipes, bars, strips, dry-riser lugs, signs and drain covers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these theft cases, items made of copper&nbsp;accounted for about some 62%, followed by those made of aluminium (13%). The remaining cases involved other types of metals, such as stainless steel, steel, brass and bronze. This trend reflects the price increases of both aluminium and copper compared to steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The total value of metallic items stolen last year was&nbsp;estimated at about&nbsp;S$4 million.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) has adopted a three-pronged strategy to combat this phenomenon, encompassing, firstly,&nbsp;enforcement; secondly, creating awareness; and, thirdly,&nbsp;prevention measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards this end, Police has stepped up enforcement efforts against both thieves and errant dealers.&nbsp; Hence, last year, Police arrested a total of 200 persons for committing 150 cases of metal theft.&nbsp; MHA also recently amended the Secondhand Dealers Act, introducing a more focused approach to specifically provide for the inclusion of \"cables and wires made of copper\" in the Second Schedule list of secondhand goods to be covered under the Act.&nbsp; Other key changes include requiring the buyer&rsquo;s details to be amongst details required to be submitted by the dealers to Police, and also increasing penalties for greater deterrence.&nbsp; In this way, we will more effectively deal with the disposal of such stolen goods by secondhand goods dealers, otherwise known as \"fencing\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create awareness, SPF will conduct briefings and issue crime advisories to licensed scrap yard dealers to alert them of this crime trend and the consequences if they are found to have transacted in <p align=left>Column: 1373<p>stolen metal items.&nbsp; Through public education campaigns, Police intends to solicit public assistance to act as its eyes and ears to deter such crimes.&nbsp; In addition, SPF has engaged stakeholders, such as PowerGrid, HDB, Town Councils, Singapore Cable Vision and NParks, to improve their respective crime prevention measures.&nbsp; As a result of this collaboration, useful measures, such as the embossing of metal items with organisational identification, replacing of metal with alternative materials such as concrete, and beefing up patrols by their own personnel, have been implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Members that Police will do its best to keep the metal theft situation in check.&nbsp; Let me also urge the public to&nbsp;play a part by being more vigilant.&nbsp; Some culprits are able to steal in broad daylight as witnesses assume that they are legitimate workers engaged to remove the metal items.&nbsp; If Singaporeans see such suspicious activities, they should immediately call the Police or town councils for verification or assistance.</p><p></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):</B>&nbsp; Sir, offenders who commit such crimes&nbsp;now are charged under&nbsp;the Vandalism Act, I believe.&nbsp; But thieves who steal lightning conductors are not mere vandals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the surge in such cases, in fact more than 100%, I want to ask the Ministry whether they can consider more effective deterrent measures, including making the punishment a lot stiffer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

For example, NParks has taken measures to&nbsp;replace their metal bollards with concrete bollards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Community vigilance is also important because some of these things are stolen&nbsp;at night.&nbsp; If Singaporeans see these people loitering around, they should alert the Police.&nbsp; I think it was Mayor Zainudin who was interviewed together with Mr Seah Kian Peng in&nbsp;a <I>The New Paper</I> article who called for community vigilance.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us work together.&nbsp; Let me assure Mr Seah that, indeed, I will personally monitor the trend and see whether tougher actions are necessary.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang):</B>&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Senior Minister of State what is the profile of these offenders?&nbsp; Are they mainly locals?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

These subsidies were increased under the Workfare package that was introduced last year to help low-wage workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, through the many-helping-hands approach, we partner with Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) in the community to ensure that there is a broad range of services available to help low-income families care for their elderly dependants or disabled children, so that they are able to go out to work.&nbsp; For the elderly, the services range from Day Care Services to Home Help Services.&nbsp; For children with disabilities, these include the Early Intervention for Infants and Children Programme, integrated child care programme, special student care and special education schools for children up to 18 years of age.&nbsp; We have also set up the ENABLE fund last year to encourage <p align=left>Column: 1376<p>employers to make that first step of employing persons with disabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government and the Community Chest help to co-fund these services to ensure that the cost of these services is affordable for low-income Singaporeans.&nbsp; The subsidies that MCYS provides to assist needy Singaporeans, under the ComCare last year, were about $68 million, out of which the subsidies for the elderly were $3.1 million&nbsp;and $4.8 million for the disabled children.&nbsp; The VWOs complement these subsidies with fund-raising efforts to assist needy families, for example, by waiving part or all of the fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also recognise that healthcare costs can be a major expense for those who are caring for the elderly or the disabled.&nbsp; The Government therefore provides significant healthcare subsidies for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Lower-income Singaporeans who cannot afford to pay for their hospital bills despite the Government subsidies, Medisave and MediShield, may also tap on Medifund for additional help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low-income sole breadwinners who need more help with their living expenses in caring for their disabled children and elderly parents, can also approach their Community Development Councils for assistance.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the caregiving needs of low-income families with elderly and disabled dependants will be addressed by the newly formed Ministerial Committee overseeing ageing issues, to be chaired by Minister Lim Boon Heng, and the inter-Ministry efforts on disability issues co-ordinated by MCYS.&nbsp; So I urge Members to give&nbsp;feedback and suggestions for us to consider when we come up with a comprehensive package to solve these two problems.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1377<p><B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> &nbsp;I am often baffled by the numerous financial assistance schemes and different assistance schemes for the low-income families.&nbsp; I wonder if the Ministry can consider doing a more user-centred communication package to help the low income and possibly uneducated families make sense of all the schemes that are available to them, and that might also help the Members&nbsp;in this House.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</B>:&nbsp; Yes, I am sure the suggestion is very useful.&nbsp; I just want to inform the House that&nbsp;we are now trying to develop a package for all the advisors as well as the CCC ComCare helpers, and also to give them some training as well as to share good practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;The package will give them an idea&nbsp;about the three key pillars&nbsp;which we mentioned a few times in this House.&nbsp;You can divide the ComCare help into three big areas.

Businesses only need to make payment of GST to IRAS after deducting the relevant input GST incurred from the output GST collected by them.&nbsp; They have one month from the end of their prescribed accounting period to do so.&nbsp; In fact, businesses that pay via GIRO have up to 45 days to pay the net output GST that they have collected on behalf of&nbsp;IRAS.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Businesses can choose their prescribed accounting period to be either&nbsp;quarterly or monthly. Most businesses choose a quarterly accounting period. This means that they would effectively enjoy a net cash float from the output GST collected during the quarter. As GST is actually money collected by the businesses on behalf of the Government, there is no reason to extend the one-month period to allow businesses to keep GST money for a longer period. For the same reason, a late payment penalty is necessary to enforce prompt payment.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For GST refunds sought by businesses from IRAS, so far, 90% have been processed within&nbsp;eight days and 95% within 30 days. The 5% of cases that require a longer processing time are those where the claims have to be verified before the refunds can be made.&nbsp; Nonetheless, IRAS will continue to seek improvements in its current service standards.&nbsp; Alternatively, if businesses want to receive refunds more regularly, they can opt for a more frequent accounting period of one month, instead of&nbsp;the quarterly accounting period of three months. The faster turnaround under the monthly GST filings should also help with businesses&rsquo; cash flow.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So in 2004, the Public Service introduced the 'No Wrong Door' policy so that members of the public do not get referred from one agency to another when they have an issue for the Government to resolve.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this policy, when a public agency receives a query or feedback on an issue that does not fall under its purview, it should identify the agency responsible for the issue and put it in touch with the person who submitted the query or feedback. If the issue involves <p align=left>Column: 1382<p>multiple agencies, then the agency who receives the query is to coordinate and put up an integrated response.&nbsp; Hence, the name 'No Wrong Door'.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key to the implementation of the policy lies in public officers being helpful and being able to make the connection and do the necessary coordination behind the scene.&nbsp; So when the policy works smoothly, the member of the public need not even know that such a policy exists.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the Public Service has focused its efforts on emphasising the importance of the policy to public officers through induction and training programmes, and urging public agencies to put in place processes to implement the policy smoothly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have observed that most public agencies have actively implemented the 'No Wrong Door' policy although we&nbsp;still do get lapses.&nbsp; While we have not officially solicited feedback from the public on this policy, we are aware that some public officers have been commended by the public for helping to put them in touch with the relevant agencies to solve their problems.&nbsp; We will continue to remind all public agencies and officers to practise the policy consistently.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then,&nbsp;when the policy does not work properly, we also get to hear about it pretty quickly.&nbsp; Of course, there are some complex issues and sometimes not clear where the issue falls under, and the 'No Wrong Door' policy may not work well.&nbsp; But overall, the policy has brought convenience to members of the public and the Public Service will continue to try and improve and do better all the time.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the implementation of ERP along the northbound and southbound CTE has helped keep average speeds within the optimal range of 45-65 kph during the morning and evening peak period. The average speeds on the alternative arterial roads are also within the threshold speeds of 20-30 kph.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While traffic may still be heavy on the CTE, the average speeds are better than before ERP was imposed.&nbsp; For example, before evening ERP was implemented, average speeds were about 25 kph during the period from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm when traffic flow was heaviest.&nbsp; With the ERP, the speeds have crossed 45 kph, which is within our optimal speed range.&nbsp; If we had not implemented evening ERP, we would expect that average speeds would have gone down to well below 25 kph by now, possibly resulting in a gridlock situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1385<p>However, the situation is never static, as the improvement in travel speed will wear off over time as the car population grows and more drivers feel that it is worthwhile paying the charge for the reduction in traveling time.&nbsp; Hence, the LTA needs to constantly monitor the traffic situation and make timely adjustments to deal with it.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):&nbsp;</B> Sir, I think if we look at the history of the ERP rate adjustments along the CTE, we can see that there has actually been a steady increase from 1999 to-date.&nbsp; In fact, for some gantries, the rates have gone up from $2 to $4, and it has actually been particularly acute from August last year to February this year when there was&nbsp;the latest round of increase.&nbsp; So, Sir, it appears that the cars are still coming back onto the CTE.&nbsp; And because of this, I have a few supplementary questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is that it seems to me that the residential population in the north and northeast of Singapore will continue to grow, based on the fact that there are still empty flats in some housing estates, as well as new condominium developments.&nbsp; So does the Minister agree with me that we can expect further demand to use the CTE city-bound, and also in the evenings coming back towards the north?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, all car users receive the same rebates for the implementation of ERP.&nbsp; And I wonder if the Minister would agree with me that users of the CTE, paying the highest rates, actually are bearing a disproportionate amount of the road charges for living in the north and having to work in the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, Sir, can the Minister tell us if there are any plans to control the car population, whether by way of COEs <p align=left>Column: 1386<p>available or, perhaps, reviewing the financing rules on vehicle&nbsp;ownership?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:&nbsp;</B> I think it is useful to look at this issue in perspective.&nbsp; When it comes to the problem of urban transport, there is no single solution.&nbsp; So you often need a holistic approach to solve it.&nbsp; The issue with the&nbsp;CTE is that, basically, you have demand for road space during peak period where the demand exceeds the supply.&nbsp; It is finite - the particular road space.&nbsp; And how is the best way to deal with it?&nbsp; Well, the best way, the most direct way, is through a pricing mechanism.&nbsp; So you have a choice:&nbsp; you decide whether you want to travel during that particular period of time or change the time; to use a different mode of travel, a different route, or not to make that particular trip at all.&nbsp; You are given a choice.&nbsp; So, that is the most efficient way, but, by itself, it is not enough.&nbsp; You need other measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in response to her first question, developments in the north and northeast sector, do we take that into account, yes, we work very closely with MND on this, because it is really urban planning, eg, where the residential sites are, where the&nbsp;business centres and commercial centres&nbsp;are, etc, and then we build the infrastructure accordingly.&nbsp; So for the north, northeast sector, besides the CTE, we are going to build the Kallang/Paya Lebar Expressway, which is new capacity, and that should help to reduce congestion.&nbsp; And along the CTE itself, we will be widening the CTE between Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question she has is, if you are travelling in that particular sector, are you bearing an extra cost?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really a matter of choice.&nbsp; You have to decide whether or not you want to pay the charge in order to have a faster speed of travel.&nbsp; It is not something which is imposed on you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1387<p> In terms of car population, that is a good question, something that we have to balance.&nbsp; Part of the problem is that, if the car population continues to grow, then, of course, it would put pressure on the infrastructure, and we need to strike a balance between car population growth, ERP and the amount of roads that we can put&nbsp;into Singapore because it is so finite.&nbsp; And one of the things that is worth emphasising is that we are very different from other cities.&nbsp; We are not a city within a country.&nbsp; The city is the country itself.&nbsp; Everything that you see in a country is within the city, whether it be business centre or military base, you cannot push it out, it is all here.&nbsp; So the space is extremely finite.&nbsp; We need to use a whole range of instruments, not just ERP pricing.&nbsp; We&nbsp;need a good road network, we need to have good public transport and&nbsp;proper and integrated land use and transport planning -&nbsp;the whole range.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Minister what is his response to a motorist's comment and feeling that the price mechanism employed, especially on the CTE, serves as a means to squeeze money from a motorist and, at the same time, also face the same jam?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:&nbsp;</B> That is actually factually inaccurate.&nbsp; Since we introduced the&nbsp;ERP,&nbsp;if we look at the numbers, the revenue has actually come down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the ALS,&nbsp;it is down by about 20 per cent.&nbsp; And the pricing actually changes.&nbsp; So, if we look at, say, since it was introduced in 1998 till now, have ERP rates gone down?&nbsp; Yes, it has <p align=left>Column: 1388<p>gone down, various periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in 1999 and 2003, it went down -&nbsp;certain periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;2004, it went down.&nbsp; So it is not a revenue-raising exercise like the Member&nbsp;said, nor do we intend to squeeze people.&nbsp; We are trying to match an imbalance between the demand, as I said, for finite road space, over that period of time, and the supply.&nbsp; So how best to do it?&nbsp; And I did not say that that was the only way.&nbsp; I think it is the most direct way but we need other things to&nbsp;solve this problem.&nbsp; There is no silver bullet to this.&nbsp; So it has to be&nbsp;all these measures and we have to keep on adjusting them all the time to try to address this problem.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our economy has done well.&nbsp; It grew by 7.9% in 2006.&nbsp; Both the manufacturing and&nbsp; services sectors are doing well.&nbsp; Asset management in financial services is booming.&nbsp; The construction industry is now seeing a resurgence.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans have benefited from this growth.&nbsp; An unprecedented 173,300 jobs were created last year, with more than half of these taken up by the local workforce.&nbsp; The unemployment rate went down to 2.7%.&nbsp; Our workers enjoyed good wage increases and better bonuses, with average wages rising by 3.2%.&nbsp; Overall, it has been an exceptionally good year, following two previous good years.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fiscal position for the Financial Year (FY) 2006 improved on the back of these&nbsp; buoyant economic conditions.&nbsp; I expect a budget deficit of $1.3 billion for FY 2006, much smaller than the deficit of $2.9 billion we projected at the start of the year.&nbsp; Operating revenues and contributions from Net Investment Income have come in higher than projected.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=left>Column: 1395<p><B><I>Global backdrop</I></B><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outlook for 2007 is positive.&nbsp; Globally, the major economies are doing well.&nbsp; The US economy has kept up its momentum.&nbsp; Consumer spending has been supported by more stable oil prices, offsetting the effects of a slowdown in the US housing market.&nbsp; Japan is continuing to recover from more than a decade of deflation.&nbsp; The major European economies too, especially Germany, are undertaking reforms and showing improvement after a long period of sluggish growth.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Asia, China and India continue to power ahead, pulling the rest of Asia with them.&nbsp; The Southeast Asian economies are growing, although some of them face difficult challenges.&nbsp; Vietnam, in particular, is stepping up its economic reforms, tapping into the forces of globalisation, and growing dramatically.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, the global picture for 2007 is positive.&nbsp; But it is not free of risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp slowdown in the US economy, which could happen if there is a hard landing in the US housing market, remains our biggest external risk.&nbsp; A disruption in global&nbsp; financial markets, for example, in response to America's large external deficits, is another factor that could slow down the global economy.&nbsp; Widening conflict in the Middle East is a significant geopolitical risk we have to look out for, which could disrupt energy supplies and force oil prices up sharply.&nbsp; We must continue to watch these potential threats, and stay ready to respond quickly and decisively.&nbsp;</p><p><br><B><I>Outlook for 2007</I></B></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barring such shocks, I expect the Singapore economy to continue to do well.&nbsp; Our investment pipeline is strong.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1396<p> Last year, we attracted manufacturing and services investments that will generate over $13 billion of value-added annually for our economy and we expect similar good performance in investment commitments this year.&nbsp; Tourism, which saw a record high of 9.7 million visitors last year, should remain strong and benefit the retail as well as the hotels and food and beverage sectors.&nbsp; The construction sector is set to expand further, with $17 to $19 billion worth of contracts expected to be awarded in 2007.&nbsp; There will be more jobs for Singaporeans at all levels of the workforce, as employment expands in the retail, healthcare and hospitality industries, financial services and across the manufacturing, marine and construction sectors.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, I expect the Singapore economy to grow by a healthy 4.5% to 6.5% this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>SECURING OUR FUTURE</B> &nbsp;</p><p><br><B><I>Globalisation is working to Singapore's advantage</I></B></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are looking ahead to the next five to 10 years for Singapore.&nbsp; Our prospects have never been better.&nbsp; The key reason is globalisation.&nbsp; Capital, enterprise and talent are flowing to countries where government can be trusted, where the workforce is well-educated and skilled, and where the quality of life is high.&nbsp; These are Singapore's advantages.&nbsp; They explain why globalisation is working to Singapore's advantage.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also well-placed at the heart of a globalising Asia.&nbsp; China and India are the big stories, but opportunities are also opening up across Asia, from the Middle East to Northeast Asia.&nbsp; Competition from China and India has galvanised ASEAN to accelerate integration and forge a collaborative ASEAN Community by 2015.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1397<p> Businesses large and small, home grown and foreign, are taking advantage of Singapore's strengths, and using Singapore to ride the next wave of growth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>The world is coming to Singapore</I> &nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not just getting more large investments, but more 'first-of-its-kind' investments.&nbsp; Take, for instance, the chip used in the latest PlayStation3 and Xbox.&nbsp; A French semiconductor company, Soitec, is investing $700 million to set up in Singapore its first offshore facility to make the wafer for this chip. It is high precision, high technology.&nbsp;The wafers have alternating layers of silicon and insulator, unlike conventional wafers which&nbsp; use silicon throughout.&nbsp;Why did Soitec choose Singapore?&nbsp; Because its technology has to be well-protected, and we are the only country in Asia that it trusts well enough to set up its first manufacturing campus outside of France.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soitec is like many other global companies which have come here because they know their investments will be protected, and we have the pool of talent and skills for sophisticated manufacturing.&nbsp; Like Sumitomo, which expanded its $500 million complex in Singapore only last year to make the special kind of plastic used in LCD screens and dentures.&nbsp; These are big votes of confidence by global investors.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not just the large MNCs that we are drawing here.&nbsp; We are also attracting a whole new category of small and mid-sized global players.&nbsp; Take Bob Chandran, for example, who came from the US.&nbsp; He had listened to PM talk on TV about Singapore being a place with 'Asian values but Western conveniences'.&nbsp; He explored further, looked around, and eventually decided to move his family and his company to Singapore.&nbsp; It is a marine fuel company, Chem-oil.&nbsp; In fact, he has now taken up Singapore citizenship.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1398<p> Chem-oil is listed on the SGX. And Bob Chandran just announced recently a major investment in a new fuel terminal on Jurong Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is Johan M Karlstedt. He first relocated from Finland to the US, lived there for several years, before deciding to come to Singapore&nbsp;- both for his company and his family.&nbsp; The company that he founded, QXSystems, creates virtual offices for businesses around the world.&nbsp; As he puts it, with the Internet, it does not matter if you are in a small country.&nbsp; QXSystems now owns five companies around the world, headquartered in Singapore.&nbsp; Johan himself doesn't work from an office; they call it working from home.&nbsp; So I emailed him to ask him what it really means. He said he actually sits and works daily, for hours, in many places around Singapore.&nbsp; His favourites are the al fresco cafes.&nbsp; Thanks to widespread WiFi, he can interact with anyone around the world from any spot in Singapore for the cost of almost nothing.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Chandran, Johan Karlstedt and the many others like them are&nbsp; here because we are a compelling home for enterprise and for families.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Singaporeans are going out to the world</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>Not only is the world coming to Singapore, Singaporeans are seizing opportunities abroad.&nbsp; Globalisation is working to the advantage of Singapore companies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food Empire, based in Geylang, owns MacCoffee, which has become immensely popular in Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Bahrain, Iran and Turkey.&nbsp; Its advertising slogan in Ukraine reads: \"Every other Ukrainian drinks MacCoffee.\"&nbsp; In fact, even the advertisement won the most&nbsp;prestigious award in the Ukrainian advertising industry, which I presume means it's&nbsp;true!</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1399<p>Rotary Engineering is another example.&nbsp; It was founded by Chia Kim Piow with a few friends in the 1970s.&nbsp; He was like many others at the time, not much education, nothing beyond secondary four - no diploma or degree.&nbsp; Everything was learnt on the job.&nbsp; Rotary began by handling electrical installations and sub-contracting for the big oil refineries.&nbsp; It now builds big oil refineries.&nbsp; Today, Rotary is one of Asia's leading&nbsp; engineering companies in oil and gas infrastructure. Very active in China and India, and&nbsp; now moving into the Middle Eastern market with Saudi Arabian partners.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not just the larger Singapore players that are going abroad.&nbsp; We have many individual Singaporeans taking their chances and making their presence felt in their own way&nbsp; in global markets.&nbsp; They are in demand all over Asia, as trusted managers and engineers, and increasingly too as creative professionals.&nbsp; Like our Singapore chefs.&nbsp; Justin Quek is amongst our best known, having won several awards while he was in Singapore, at Les Amis, is now based in Taipei running his own restaurant&nbsp;- I think it is called Le Petite Cuisine.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s already regarded as the best French restaurant in Taipei. Singaporean, in Taipei, running a French restaurant.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jek Tan, another example, trained at SHATEC, progressed in his career&nbsp;- last year became Executive Chef at the Shangri-la in Dalian in Northeast China.&nbsp; I met him there.&nbsp; We have been in contact and he mailed me last week to say that he had invited over to Dalian three other Singaporean chefs.&nbsp; He had known them because he had worked with them in another hotel in Singapore.&nbsp; He invited them over for two months to run a Singapore Food Festival.&nbsp; The Chinese were wowed by the menu&nbsp;- <I>bak ku teh, satay</I>, beef <I>rendang</I>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the '<I>rendang'</I> when translated into Chinese <p align=left>Column: 1400<p>sounded a bit like \"people's egg\".&nbsp; So, one of the compliments he received was that it tasted much better than it sounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what globalisation is about, and why it is working for Singapore. Companies and individuals coming from all around the world to Singapore, and using Singapore to reach out to the rest of Asia; and Singaporeans reaching out to global markets, taking their chances, competing, seizing opportunities. And this is why the outlook for Singapore is bright.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B><I>The challenge of the widening income gap</I></B></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But globalisation brings with it challenges for Singapore.&nbsp; We face a worsening of our income distribution and slow or no growth in wages at the lower end.&nbsp; Not just over the last few years or for now, but this would be with us for several years to come.&nbsp; It will be a key challenge for us, just as it is in most of the developed economies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons for the widening income spread are by now well known.&nbsp; China, India, Russia and Eastern Europe have doubled the global workforce, putting downward pressure on wages everywhere.&nbsp;Companies have more choices on where to invest, where to locate their plants based on where they can get the lowest cost or the best workers or the latest technology.&nbsp; At the same time, technology continues to advance, relentlessly. It is increasing the demand for workers with high skills and knowledge. And technology is making many types of workers redundant, especially those with low skills, and also making it easy for their jobs to be exported abroad to where wages are lower for the same skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is widening income gaps between the skilled and the low-skilled, between&nbsp; the young and old, between those who adapt quickly to the market <p align=left>Column: 1401<p>and the rest.&nbsp; Incomes are stretching out in the developed world, with the top rising rapidly, the middle growing slowly, and the low either stagnating or declining.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, the income gap has been widening for some time, especially in the last decade.&nbsp; In the last five years, despite strong economic growth, the wages of production and non-management workers have grown by only 1.7% in real terms over the&nbsp; period as a whole.&nbsp; The same is happening in Europe and Japan&nbsp;- incomes going up at the top, but stagnating or declining at the bottom.&nbsp; Even in China, with an economy growing at 9%-plus, workers in the bottom 10% have seen a decline in real incomes over the last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is facing similar pressures.&nbsp; Because we are a much more open economy, compared to the US, China, Germany or Japan, we are, in fact, more exposed to these pressures of globalisation.&nbsp; Over the last five years, lower-income households have seen little growth in their incomes.&nbsp; In fact, in real terms, the lowest 20% of households has seen their incomes per capita decline from 2000 to 2005.&nbsp; Fortunately, in the last year, the strong pick-up in employment within the lower-income group has reversed the decline.&nbsp; In fact, it has a little more than reversed the decline of the previous five years.&nbsp; Nonetheless, household incomes at the top end are pulling away faster.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a key item on our agenda.&nbsp; Although our economy is growing well, incomes are only increasing slowly at the lower end, or not at all and income gaps are widening.&nbsp; This is a problem for those at the bottom, but it is also a problem for the rest of society if those at the bottom feel left out.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution is not to grow more slowly, or to focus less on growth and <p align=left>Column: 1402<p>more on redistribution&nbsp;- although some people think we should do that.&nbsp; If we do that, it will only hurt the people we are trying to help.&nbsp; Slow growth will make everybody worse off, but it will have the greatest impact on those at the bottom.&nbsp; Jobs will be lost and incomes will fall through the floor for those at the lower end of the workforce, while at the top end, talented Singaporeans and those with the ability to seize opportunities elsewhere will up and go.&nbsp; Slow growth will not assure us of a more equal society, as long as we live in a</p><p>globalised world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B><I>Singapore's response&nbsp;- Growth with opportunity for all</I></B></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response therefore must be to focus on growth and embrace globalisation, but manage its downsides and make it work for everyone.&nbsp; We will do this by maximising opportunities for all Singaporeans&nbsp;- the opportunities to get a good education, to work or to start a business, to retrain and upgrade, and the opportunity to own a home.&nbsp; We must maximise opportunities for all, but we must also accept that doing so does not result in equal rewards for all.&nbsp; We should never reduce the incentive for Singaporeans to work and to make the most of their skills and talents, so as to get higher reward for themselves. That has to be the basis for our society, for how we keep our economy growing, and for how living standards of Singaporeans will rise over time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first priority therefore is to grow the economy.&nbsp; We must now build capabilities for the future.&nbsp; We must attract new investments, grow new businesses, and create new and better paying jobs to replace old ones.&nbsp; We must build on our strengths and compete&nbsp;- not just on efficiency and low cost, but on trust and value.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we grow the economy, we must ensure that no one is left behind and that <p align=left>Column: 1403<p>all Singaporeans have the opportunity to succeed.&nbsp; Over the years, the Government has been helping the lower-income groups through various assistance measures.&nbsp; Since 2001, the Government has distributed more than $7.5 billion through the Progress Package, U-Save and S&amp;CC rebates, CPF top-ups and New Singapore Shares, to share budget surpluses with Singaporeans.&nbsp; In all these distributions, we have made deliberate efforts to ensure that the lower-income groups get the greatest benefits.&nbsp; But going forward, we have to do more to help needy Singaporeans and we have to do it more systematically.&nbsp; This is why we are introducing Workfare.&nbsp;Workfare will give those at the lower end of the workforce a stronger incentive to get a job, stay&nbsp;in a job, and save for their future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to prepare now for the challenges of an ageing population.&nbsp;Healthcare spending will rise over time, as our people grow older and as medical science advances.&nbsp;Our living environment and physical infrastructure will have to be adapted to meet the needs of our growing ranks of senior citizens.&nbsp; This is the generation that has helped to bring Singapore up from Third World to First World.&nbsp; We must ensure their well-being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building capabilities for the future, strengthening our social security system and&nbsp; providing for the needs of older Singaporeans will require Government to spend more in future.&nbsp; This means we will need additional revenues.&nbsp;We cannot raise direct taxes.&nbsp; Countries the world over are reducing corporate and personal income taxes. &nbsp;To continue to attract talent and investments, and maintain strong incentives for our people to excel, we will in fact have to lower our direct taxes further over time.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore raise additional revenues by extracting more income from <p align=left>Column: 1404<p>our reserves and by raising the GST.&nbsp; Because we are doing this now, when the economy is doing well, we are able to provide a very comprehensive set of measures to help Singaporeans adjust to the GST increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget is therefore about preparing Singapore for the future and for the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;It ensures that we retain our dynamism as an economy while we take significant steps forward to preserve an inclusive society. It sets out the key changes we must make to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(a) &nbsp;Build capabilities for the future;</p><p><br>(b)&nbsp;Strengthen our social security system;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>(c) &nbsp;Reduce direct taxes and raise additional revenues, including GST;<br></p><p>(d)&nbsp; Provide Singaporeans with an offset package for the GST increase.</p><p><br><B>BUILDING CAPABILITIES FOR THE FUTURE</B> &nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To build new capabilities for the future,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>(a)&nbsp;We will invest in our people to maximise their potential.<br></p><p>(b)&nbsp;We will invest in R&amp;D to move our economy up the value curve.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>(c)&nbsp;We will make Singapore the best place to start and grow a business.<br></p><p>(d)&nbsp;We will make Singapore a leading centre for \"high trust\" services.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>(e)&nbsp;We will invest in economic infrastructure to build the business needs of tomorrow.<br></p><p>(f)&nbsp;We will transform our city and living environment to build the best home for</p><p>Singaporeans.</p><p><br><I><p align=left>Column: 1405<p><B>Investing in our people</B></I><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Central to our strategy is our people.&nbsp; Every Singaporean plays a crucial role in an innovation-driven economy. Every worker.&nbsp; Education and continuous learning will thus remain a top priority&nbsp; for Singapore.<br></p><p><I>A first-rate education</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will give every child access to a first-rate&nbsp;education.&nbsp; In every school, we have been focusing on quality.&nbsp; More teachers are being deployed, leading to more time to plan for quality and to innovate in their teaching.&nbsp; Ideas are bubbling up in&nbsp; schools across the island -&nbsp; different classrooms, different styles and different methods, but all bringing in new quality.&nbsp; At Hougang Primary,&nbsp;for example, Primary Two students are using iPods to create podcasts of talkshows, which they then showcase on the Internet for all to hear.&nbsp; Having a real audience means this is not just fun, but the kids have to take their lessons quite seriously!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Post-Secondary Education Accounts</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting a top-rate school education provides a critical foundation for every Singaporean, and we will keep improving, keep helping our children to learn better in our schools.&nbsp; But good schools are not the end of the story.&nbsp; That is why we have also made our ITEs, polytechnics and universities world class.&nbsp; They are widely regarded internationally as being in the top tier.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want as many Singaporeans as possible to obtain a post-secondary education, whether it be for a certificate, diploma, or degree.&nbsp; This is absolutely essential in the new innovation-driven economy.&nbsp; To help Singaporeans pursue their tertiary education, we will create a Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) for every Singaporean aged seven to 20.&nbsp; Students can use the PSEA at our <p align=left>Column: 1406<p>publicly-funded universities, polytechnics, ITEs, and also at NAFA and LaSalle, our arts institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise, however, that some Singaporeans may miss out on an opportunity for post-secondary education.&nbsp; I will therefore allow the PSEA to also be used for UniSIM, which provides for an open-style university education for adult learners, and WDA-accredited lead training providers.&nbsp; Unused monies in an individual's PSEA will be transferred to his CPF Ordinary Account when he turns 30.&nbsp; I will announce later the amount of top-ups that the Government will put into PSEA as part of this Budget.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Supporting lifelong learning</I><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also extending our focus beyond the post-secondary stage&nbsp;- beyond what we learn in school and at the post-secondary institutions.&nbsp; We have to do this because adult workers have to keep pace with a constantly changing economy. Lower-skilled workers are especially vulnerable to becoming displaced if they do not upgrade and pick up new skills, not just once but continuously.&nbsp; No matter what useful skills or knowledge we&nbsp; acquire in school and at the tertiary level, they will become less relevant over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many more workers are in fact going for retraining, and some upgrading themselves against considerable odds.&nbsp; Like Madam Sabariah Bte Ahmad, who was retrenched as a production operator 18 months ago at Maxtor.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at age 48, and as someone who had suffered from cancer, she had difficulty getting re-employed.&nbsp; But she persevered, and last year, she got onto NTUC's STPT (Screen, Train, Place and Train) scheme, and that got her onto a job as a cashier at the Kopitiam at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.&nbsp; She earns $900 a month, and is proud to be self-reliant, despite her illness.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1407<p> The Government will increase its support for lifelong learning to all Singaporeans.&nbsp;We already spend up to $170 million a year on adult worker training, drawn from the Skills Development Fund (SDF) and the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund (LLEF).&nbsp; But this is less than what several other developed countries are spending on continuous education and less than what is necessary for our citizens to keep pace with a globalised world. We must ramp up our investment in this area over the long term.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we need to allow individual workers to apply directly for subsidised training opportunities.&nbsp; We previously operated a system that was employer-centric -&nbsp; we reimbursed the employers&nbsp; who sent their workers for training.&nbsp; Over the past year, we have shifted to invest more in adult worker training institutions.&nbsp; This has lowered course fees and made training directly accessible to the individual - so that individual can himself or herself apply for a subsidised place at these training institutions.&nbsp; We will keep up our efforts on this front.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we will implement more Place and Train programmes, to help workers renew their skills and secure new jobs. Like how Madam Sabariah managed to get her job.&nbsp; The training will cover all segments of the workforce, from the unemployed, to operations staff, to supervisors, craftsmen, professionals and managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will encourage more adult learners to take up post-diploma courses in the polytechnics as part of lifelong learning. These comprise Advanced Diplomas and Specialist Diplomas&nbsp;- for example, in areas like Infocomm Security, Logistics and Semiconductor Technology.&nbsp; They cater to both basic diploma and degree holders.&nbsp; Currently, these courses <p align=left>Column: 1408<p>are fully self-financed by those who take them.&nbsp; I have decided to subsidise 80% of the cost of these programmes for Singaporeans, starting from the 2007 intake.&nbsp; About 1,400 students enter such courses today, and we hope many more will do so in future.&nbsp; The polytechnics will also expand their range of post-diploma offerings over time in response to market needs.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are only initial plans, towards the larger goal of providing continuous learning opportunities for all Singaporeans, and encouraging them to see this as a way of life.&nbsp; We will study this comprehensively&nbsp;- how to provide learning programmes that are relevant to every Singaporean and relevant to the job market, how they should be funded and how to foster a culture that makes lifelong learning the norm.&nbsp; Your certificate may lead to a diploma, your diploma may lead to a degree, and your first degree may not be your last.&nbsp; Or after getting your degree, you&nbsp; might get a certificate or diploma. That will be the culture.&nbsp; But this is not about the paper chase, but about the continuous refreshing of the skills and knowledge of Singaporeans that will prepare us well for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have to invest much more in Continuous Education and Training.&nbsp; As an initial estimate, we expect to triple our annual expenditure on lifelong learning to $500 million a year in the medium to long-term.&nbsp; This year, I will put another $100 million into the&nbsp; Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.&nbsp; But we will have to fund this important ongoing initiative using not just the income from the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund but also our operating revenues.<br></p><p><B><I>Investing in R&amp;D</I></B></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second area of focus&nbsp; is to invest in R&amp;D, to build up&nbsp; the capabilities that will help drive our economy over the long-<p align=left>Column: 1409<p>term.&nbsp; We plan to invest 3% of our GDP on R&amp;D annually by 2010 up from 2.4% in 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a major commitment, both in terms of resources and talent.&nbsp; We are investing large sums of money. We are also gathering many very able people in the biomedical sciences and other fields of science and technology.&nbsp; They include Singaporeans who are doing post-graduate studies and embarking on careers in R&amp;D, as well as globally renowned researchers who have uprooted themselves to come to Singapore because they know we are serious about our plans and ambitions, and they want to work with us on this enterprise.&nbsp; On top of that, we are attracting world-class corporate R&amp;D labs and grooming local R&amp;D firms.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not expect short-term returns.&nbsp; This is a long-term investment, and clearly there are risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot be sure of success, and even if we do succeed, many of the economic benefits are likely to be indirect. But the Government had considered this carefully, and decided that this was an investment we had to make for Singapore's future.&nbsp; Over time, we will build up a critical mass of top-rate researchers in Singapore, who will create new intellectual property in our research institutes, universities and hospitals, and will bring in new, technology-driven activities which will spin off benefits to the rest of the economy.&nbsp; Our investment in R&amp;D is critical, for Singapore to be a leading Asian hub for high-value, knowledge-based industries, even as Beijing, Bangalore and other cities catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since embarking on this endeavour in the bio-medical sciences and other areas of R&amp;D that we are engaged in, we have made significant progress.&nbsp; But we are still on the early legs of a long journey.&nbsp; Other developed nations, including small ones like Switzerland and Sweden, have taken decades to get to where they are.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1410<p>We need to persevere in our efforts, focusing our limited resources on areas in which Singapore can make an impact.&nbsp; That is the framework within which the Research Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC) is pursuing Singapore's R&amp;D strategies, and it will continue to guide us as we go forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is too early to evaluate the results of our R&amp;D initiatives.&nbsp; But from MOF's perspective, I am satisfied that this is a good use of public funds.&nbsp; Hence, I will inject another $500 million into the National Research Fund that was established last year. Along with other R&amp;D related expenditure in A*STAR,&nbsp; the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and other economic agencies, we expect a total of $2 billion of government expenditure to be invested in R&amp;D for this year.&nbsp; These will go towards continuing the applied and academic research in the public research institutes, universities and hospitals.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p><B><I>Making Singapore the best place to start, grow and globalise businesses</I></B><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we have to press ahead in our efforts to create a vibrant and supportive environment for enterprises, big and small.&nbsp; Our strength and reputation as a base for MNCs and leading global companies is well known around the world. We will make Singapore equally reputed for being the best place for SMEs, local and foreign, to locate, to grow and to globalise.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned Rotary and Food Empire earlier.&nbsp; Both started off very small but they found themselves having to extend their reach out of Singapore at an early stage, and&nbsp; now depend on markets abroad for most of their growth.&nbsp; In fact, about one-quarter of all our SMEs in Singapore now derive at least 50% of their revenue from overseas.&nbsp; Globalisation is there with our&nbsp; smaller firms.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1411<p> Many of our younger local players are going out to global markets at an even earlier stage of their growth.&nbsp; Dextrans Worldwide Group, founded just four years ago by two young Singaporeans, already has a bustling logistics business, managing inventory for major electronics manufacturers in China&nbsp;like Flextronics.&nbsp; Heulab was started by two NUS graduates in 2002 to create educational software on tablet PCs. Over 140 schools in Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Qatar use their products to introduce creative learning in the classroom.&nbsp; All this in just four years.&nbsp; And Heulab was selected a few days ago as a launch partner for Microsoft's Windows Vista Programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dextrans and Heulab are part of a new generation of local firms:&nbsp; fleet-footed, unafraid to venture out to the world early, and working at the leading edge of technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also seeing the rise of a new breed of players in the form of global SMEs&nbsp;- much smaller than the traditional multinationals but typically larger than the traditional SMEs rooted in one place, but taking advantage of globalisation to expand rapidly.&nbsp; Some of them are in fact very fast-growing companies,&nbsp;or 'gazelles', as they are called in Silicon Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More of these global SMEs&nbsp; are now coming to Singapore.&nbsp; They may not make huge investments like the MNCs, but they add vibrancy to our economy and expand the demand for financial and other business services, IT and logistics.&nbsp; Many are now listing on the SGX, and are expanding rapidly.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should attract and root this new breed of global players in Singapore. I mentioned Bob Chandran and Chemoil as an example of a global SME that we have brought to Singapore.&nbsp; Another is LMA, a <p align=left>Column: 1412<p>medical equipment firm that was based in the UK but which decided to establish its headquarters operations in Singapore to manage its global regulatory affairs, quality assurance, and R&amp;D.&nbsp; It has operations all over the world, and its products reach patients in over 100 countries.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OLAM, too, shifted from London to Singapore. It has a presence in 52 countries, managed from Singapore.&nbsp; Last week, OLAM announced that it is tying up with Chinatex, a leading Chinese state-owned enterprise. OLAM &amp; Chinatex will jointly invest&nbsp; to source soybeans in Brazil.&nbsp; They will also invest together in the Chinese market to process and supply soybeans, and to supply cotton&nbsp; for the&nbsp; Chinese market.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's how globalisation is being played&nbsp;- globalisation out of Singapore. We want to grow more Food Empires and Dextrans, and attract more OLAMs and LMAs to Singapore.&nbsp; We can provide the best conditions for them to start up, grow, raise funds, and reach out to markets in Asia and the world. We are already recognised as one of the easiest places in the world to do business. Each year, the World Bank compiles assessments from about 3,000-4,000 experts around the world.&nbsp; In its latest report, for this year, it put Singapore as the most business-friendly economy in the world, ahead of New Zealand, the US, Canada, Hong Kong and the UK.&nbsp; Later, I&nbsp; will announce how we will strengthen further this advantage we have in attracting businesses, small and big, to Singapore and growing them out of Singapore through our tax regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B><I>Growing \"high-trust\" services</I></B></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also develop Singapore as a centre for a range of \"high-trust\" services - from legal and financial services to highly specialised, niche services.&nbsp; Near Changi Airport, a company has set up the <p align=left>Column: 1413<p>Singapore Freeport, a Fort Knox-like vault to house private art collections and treasures from all over the world.&nbsp; Most of you would not have heard of it or seen it, and I think that's the way it's meant to be.&nbsp; It is an example of a niche area that plays to Singapore&rsquo;s strengths.</p><p><br><I>Legal services</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In legal services, we will position Singapore as a trusted centre for high-end arbitration work.&nbsp; We have the key ingredients in place to do so&nbsp;- efficiency, reliability and neutrality.&nbsp; We also have plans for an integrated dispute resolution complex.&nbsp; We will complement these efforts by introducing a tax incentive that allows a 50% tax exemption for a law firm's incremental qualifying income for international arbitration activities.</p><p><br><I>Financial services<br></I></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial sector is a key pillar of our economy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The asset management industry has seen double-digit growth each year over the past five years. Singapore's Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivative market has also doubled in size since 2004 to US$37 billion in daily volumes, building on our role as the fourth-largest foreign exchange trading centre in the world.&nbsp; More finance professionals and individuals are locating themselves in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also growing new niches in our financial sector. Singapore is increasingly serving as a bridge between the Middle East and Asia.&nbsp; More Middle Eastern banks are setting up in Singapore. We are also seeing double-digit growth in funds coming here from the Middle East, for investment in Asian capital markets and real estate.&nbsp; Banks in Singapore are structuring various new products, including Islamic financial products, such as murabaha investment products and Shariah-compliant mutual funds, to meet the needs of this new class of global <p align=left>Column: 1414<p>investors.&nbsp; These opportunities can only grow.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will keep refining our schemes to anchor more activities here and keep up the momentum of growth in our financial centre. We introduced a package of tax incentives to promote infrastructure finance in September last year. We will make other revisions in this Budget to ensure our tax rules and incentives remain relevant and competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I will remove the \"80:20\" rule under our tax exemption scheme for non-resident funds.&nbsp; This will give certainty of tax exemption to foreign investors whose funds are managed in Singapore, and also provide fund managers based in Singapore with greater flexibility in sourcing for mandates.&nbsp;The list of designated investments will also now include qualifying loans.&nbsp; Details of these changes will be released later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also enhance our tax incentives relating to Finance and Treasury Centres, OTC financial derivatives, and Qualifying Debt Securities.&nbsp; Details of these will be in the Annex*&nbsp; to my&nbsp; Speech.</p><p></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">* Cols. 1491-1510.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Growing Singapore as a philanthropy hub</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also capitalise on our strengths as a key financial centre to develop Singapore as an attractive hub for global philanthropic organisations.&nbsp; Philanthropy is growing exponentially around the world.&nbsp; More MNCs are now establishing charitable foundations and seeking to extend their reach into Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can play a useful role as a centre for these organisations.&nbsp; Local philanthropy, too, is blossoming&nbsp;- witness, for</p><p>example, the very substantial donations that have been made to our universities and medical schools in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence of more global philanthropic grantmakers in Singapore will go hand in hand with the growth of local philanthropy - injecting <p align=left>Column: 1415<p>vibrancy, promoting collaborative ventures and sharing best practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate the growing interest in philanthropy from both the local and international community, we will make a number of important changes.&nbsp; First, I will remove the 80:20 spending rule for income tax exemption for registered charities.&nbsp; This rule currently requires charities to spend at least 80% of their annual receipts on charitable causes in Singapore within two years in order to enjoy income tax exemption.&nbsp; International philanthropic grantmakers and local foundations, which are looking to contribute towards worthy causes in the region, apart from Singapore, perceive this rule as overly restrictive on their use of&nbsp; funds.&nbsp; Even those who are looking for causes in Singapore see the two-year limitation as too restrictive.&nbsp; Henceforth, I will grant all registered charities and exempt charities automatic income tax exemption.&nbsp; This will enable charities to optimise their activities in Singapore and in the region, and the use of their funds over time to sustain their programmes.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will relax the 80:20 fund-raising rule, which requires any organisation seeking to raise funds for any foreign charitable purpose to spend, in Singapore, at least 80% of the funds raised. This lifting of the 80:20 fund-raising rule is done so as not to hinder the efforts of reputable charitable organisations and grantmakers with an international or regional orientation, provided that the funds are raised from private donors rather than from the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, individuals and companies can obtain double tax deductions for donations to Institutions of Public Character (IPCs) but not for donations to foundations and other grantmakers.&nbsp; I will <p align=left>Column: 1416<p>therefore allow double tax deduction for all donations made to philanthropic grantmaking organisations, as long as these donations are subsequently channelled to an IPC in Singapore.&nbsp; More details on these initiatives will be released later.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I will introduce a tax incentive scheme to give income tax exemption to other Not-for-Profit Organisations (NPOs) that can bring economic value to Singapore.&nbsp; Our targeted NPOs&nbsp; include those which have links to key clusters of our economy, such as the International Bar Association (IBA) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organisations (JCAHO).&nbsp; EDB will administer this incentive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Logistics, maritime and aviation services</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logistics, maritime and aviation services are key to Singapore&rsquo;s connectivity and our role as a global business hub.

We will transform our HDB heartlands, connect them to a more extensive and convenient transport network, and integrate them into a network of parks and waterways that will together represent a quantum leap in our quality of life.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will make Singapore a city of gardens and waters or,&nbsp;as PM put it recently, a city of green and blue.&nbsp; The Gardens by the Bay will open in 2010, bringing further activity and vibrancy to the whole area.&nbsp; We will spend about $700 million on these gardens, the next phase of park connectors, and enhancements to existing parks in the coming years.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also make use of our extensive network of water bodies to enhance our living environment, be it in the city where we are converting the Marina Bay into a reservoir, or in the residential heartlands where we are bringing waterfront living to HDB neighbourhoods. &nbsp;In the next five years, the Active-Beautiful-Clean or ABC Waters Programme will cover 28 projects at a cost of about $200 million.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will transform Marina Bay into a vibrant live-work-play destination with distinctive architecture, lush greenery, public spaces and a pedestrian promenade that will encircle the entire Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our established city areas like Orchard Road, Bugis and Bras Basah will also be enhanced and refreshed.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, our housing estates.&nbsp; As the Minister for National Development announced last week, we will undertake a systematic and total \"urban regeneration\" of our housing estates.&nbsp;We will start with the older housing estates in about five years' time.&nbsp; This will cost us about $1 billion each year in the steady state.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1420<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The makeover of our public housing estates will be done together with the development of our public transport system so that residents can easily and conveniently commute from home to workplaces and commercial nodes all over Singapore.&nbsp; The Circle Line which will open from 2010, plus the new Downtown Line which we will embark on next, will allow commuters to enjoy greater convenience and faster rides.&nbsp; For example, a trip from Bukit Panjang to the city centre which now takes 60 minutes will be shortened to 40 minutes, ie, by one-third.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, we will also have to cater for a larger population, by expanding our road network.&nbsp; We will have to widen all our existing highways to four lanes.&nbsp; New highways will also be needed. Plans are already being finalised for a Marina Coastal Expressway to serve the new business district and other developments in Marina Bay.&nbsp; In all, over the next 10 to 15 years, we expect to spend at least $20 billion on our land transport infrastructure.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the way we will transform Singapore into a world class city and provide the highest quality of life for our citizens.&nbsp; Modern business centres, choice residences for all Singaporeans, and attractive leisure and recreational amenities at Marina Bay, Orchard Road, Bugis and other central areas.&nbsp; HDB homes nestled in lushly landscaped common areas, fully fitted with elderly-friendly facilities, connected to the rest of Singapore by an efficient road and rail system, and linked into green corridors and waterways.&nbsp; This will be the Singapore of 2020.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>STRENGTHENING OUR SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM&nbsp;</B></p><p><B><br></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are building an inclusive society where every citizen shares in the country&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; Since independence,<p align=left>Column: 1421<p> three pillars&nbsp;- all linked to the CPF&nbsp;- have underpinned our social security system.&nbsp; The first&nbsp;- the CPF Special or Retirement Account&nbsp;- has enabled every working Singaporean to build a nest-egg for his retirement needs.&nbsp; The second&nbsp;- subsidised public housing through the HDB and the CPF Ordinary Account&nbsp;- has made home ownership a reality for the vast majority of Singaporeans.&nbsp; The third&nbsp;- the 3Ms of Medisave, MediShield and Medifund&nbsp;- has provided Singaporeans with affordable, high-quality healthcare.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPF helps us achieve our social stability. We should continue to strengthen our CPF system, and include as many Singaporeans as possible in it. The three existing pillars of our social security system continue to serve the majority of Singaporeans well.&nbsp; Through the CPF schemes, most Singaporeans are able to save enough to provide for their own social security.&nbsp; However, low-income Singaporeans are finding it more difficult to save enough in their CPF.&nbsp; Their wages have stagnated because of globalisation, and will continue to be under pressure.&nbsp; For this group, we now need a fourth pillar&nbsp;- Workfare.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the existing three pillars, Workfare will also be linked to the CPF, to encourage more low-wage workers to save for their longer term needs.&nbsp; In doing all this, we must continue to preserve the key principles which underpin our social security system&nbsp;- namely, self-reliance and mutual support within the family, supplemented by the Government only to the extent necessary.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B><I>Raising the employer CPF contribution rate</I></B></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will raise the CPF contribution rate for employers.&nbsp; It is currently 33%&nbsp;-&nbsp;20% from employees and 13% from employers.&nbsp; We have set a long-term variable range of 30% to 36%. This range seeks to strike the right balance between <p align=left>Column: 1422<p>achieving our social security objectives and economic competitiveness, while giving us the flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions. With the economy doing well, I believe we can sustain a modest rise in the employer CPF contribution rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the Government has decided to increase the employer contribution rate by 1.5 percentage points to 14.5%, starting from 1st July 2007.&nbsp; One percentage point will go into the Ordinary Account.&nbsp; It will add to the savings of CPF members, and help many of them pay for their mortgages.&nbsp; The remaining 0.5 percentage point will go into the Medisave Account to better provide for healthcare needs.&nbsp; The Ministry of Health has made it easier for Singaporeans to draw from their Medisave Accounts, and will continue to liberalise the use of Medisave.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase in CPF will apply to all Singaporean workers, except for the group of workers who earn $1,500 or less and are also above 35 years old.&nbsp; For this group of workers, we will need a different approach.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B><I>Restructuring the CPF and introducing Workfare for low-wage workers</I></B></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Older low-wage workers are the ones most affected by the changes in our economy.&nbsp; They find it harder to learn new skills and upgrade themselves, they find it harder to get re-employed if they lose their jobs, and their families find it more difficult to make ends meet. We will therefore introduce Workfare to supplement the wages and savings of older low-wage workers, and modify the CPF system to complement the Workfare scheme.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many other developed countries have addressed the problems of the low-income group, often through extensive social welfare programmes.&nbsp; But Welfare has drained fiscal resources and, more <p align=left>Column: 1423<p>damagingly, eroded the work ethic and encouraged an entitlement mentality.&nbsp; The more successful model of assistance has been Workfare&nbsp;- which seeks to supplement the incomes of low-wage workers on the principle that the best way to help people is to help them find work and stay in work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage supplements are new to Singapore, but the concept has been tried with some success in other countries.&nbsp; In the US, this is called the Earned Income Tax Credit. This acts like a negative income tax for low-wage workers; in other words, it supplements their earned income instead of taking away from it.&nbsp; The UK has a Working Tax Credit which is similar.&nbsp; These schemes have helped to reduce poverty and encourage work.&nbsp; But they are not without problems&nbsp;- they are not cheap, and they potentially weaken the incentive for workers to upgrade themselves and earn more.&nbsp; That is why we have to consider the design of the scheme very carefully and move cautiously.&nbsp; We introduced the Workfare Bonus as part of the Progress Package last year, to test out the concept amongst Singaporeans.&nbsp; We are now ready to take a step further by making Workfare income supplements a long-term feature of our social security system&nbsp;- the fourth pillar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will move in parallel on both the CPF and Workfare for low-wage workers.&nbsp; We will reduce the CPF contributions for these workers, while introducing Workfare income supplements for them. This will achieve three objectives.&nbsp; First, workers will contribute less CPF, so as to increase their take-home pay. Second, employers will also contribute less CPF, to make the workers more employable. Third, the Government will give workers Workfare income supplements, mainly into their CPF accounts, so as to help them to build up their savings.&nbsp; Workfare provides more incentives for individuals to work, and for<p align=left>Column: 1424<p> employers to hire them.&nbsp; With Workfare, low-wage workers will end up with more in their CPF.&nbsp; With Workfare, the State is stepping in to share the burden of social support with the individual and his employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal target group of Workfare will be older full-time workers aged above 45 years who earn $1,000 or less.&nbsp; This group will receive the highest Workfare benefits.&nbsp; However, Workfare benefits will also extend to a wider group&nbsp;- those above 35 years who earn $1,500 or less, but at a lower rate. This is so that we do not miss&nbsp;any deserving cases, and also so that workers whose earnings increase beyond $1,000 do not suddenly lose all their Workfare benefits.&nbsp; I will go through each of the measures in turn.</p><p><br><I>Increasing take-home pay</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, increasing take-home pay.&nbsp; Currently, employees start contributing CPF when their monthly incomes exceed $500, but at a lower rate.&nbsp; Their contributions are increased to reach the full rate of 20% at a monthly wage of $750. We will now increase the employee CPF contributions more gradually, so that employees only pay the full rate of 20% when they get to a monthly wage of $1,500.&nbsp; Workers earning $1,000 or less will have larger reductions in employee contributions and hence larger increases in take-home pay.&nbsp; This change in employee contributions will apply to all low-wage workers regardless of age.&nbsp; The contribution rates for workers above 50 years old, which are lower, will be scaled down accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Improving employability</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improving the employability of older, low-wage workers is the second reason why we are doing this.&nbsp; Currently, employers pay the full 13% rate for all workers earning more than $50 per month.&nbsp; We will now phase in the <p align=left>Column: 1425<p>employer CPF contributions for workers who are aged above 35, so that employers only pay the full new contribution rate of 14.5% at a monthly wage of $1,500.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the contribution rates for workers above 50 years old will be scaled down accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Supplementing wages and savings</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two changes will reduce employer and employee CPF contributions for older low-wage workers.&nbsp; The new Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme that we are introducing will more than make up for this.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Workfare quantum will be based on age.&nbsp; For workers above 45 and earning $1,000 and below, the Workfare will supplement their wages by up to $1,200 per year, or between 10% and 20%<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; Workers aged between 35 and 45 will receive three-quarters the amount that workers above 45 will receive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><sup><sup>1&nbsp;</sup></sup>Workers above 45 years of age, earning between $500 and $1,000 inclusive, will receive $1,200 in total WIS, which translates to a 10%-20% increase in annual income.</p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workfare will be given partly in cash, but mostly in CPF.

The elderly use more healthcare services and incur higher costs per episode of care. For example, hip fractures because of osteoporosis are common among the elderly and hip <p align=left>Column: 1429<p>replacement surgeries are usually required to ease their condition.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incidence of heart disease and cancer among Singaporeans is also growing, leading to very costly hospitalisation and treatment cycles. And the expectations of Singaporeans are rising; they are demanding more medical services, better medical technologies and more effective drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cater to these healthcare needs, the Government will be ramping up our healthcare expenditure over the next five to 15 years.&nbsp; Over the next five years alone, we expect to increase spending to reach about $3 billion a year by 2012, compared to $2 billion today.&nbsp; Part of this will go towards growing the number of doctors, nurses and allied health professionals in our public hospitals. In particular, we aim to bring 4,500 more nurses into the public sector over the next five years, as they play an increasingly important role in supporting the elderly.&nbsp; We will also increase the number of acute hospital beds and improve</p><p>clinical services.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will create academic medical centres in our NUH and SGH campuses, which will allow us to better marry the strengths of academic and clinical practice.&nbsp; Both centres will have a stronger clinical research component, with funding focused on the major diseases afflicting Singaporeans.&nbsp; In addition, step-down care now provided by charities will be better integrated with hospital care.&nbsp; We also want to better&nbsp;integrate patient care between GPs and specialists so that GPs can play a larger role in looking after Singaporeans' health.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans will still have to foot their share of their medical bills, either in Medisave, insurance or cash.&nbsp; Some people, especially the elderly and low-income, have difficulty setting aside <p align=left>Column: 1430<p>enough in their Medisave for their healthcare needs.&nbsp; They need our help.&nbsp; I will top up the Medifund by $200 million this year so that it reaches a sum of $1.4 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I have outlined some of the major programmes that the Government will have to embark on over the next five years and beyond, to build our capabilities for the future and to strengthen our social security system.&nbsp;With the Speaker&rsquo;s permission, I will continue later with the changes I will make to our tax regime and how we can fund these expenditure programmes.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We are also making major new investments in our social and economic infrastructures.&nbsp; At the same time, we want to be able to reduce direct taxes to enhance our competitiveness.&nbsp; To do all this, we must therefore&nbsp; raise additional revenues.&nbsp; I will now map out our plans on the revenue front.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=left>Column: 1431<p><B><I>Reducing direct taxes</I></B></p><p><br><I>Restructuring the corporate income tax system</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, direct taxes&nbsp;- we will make a significant move on corporate income tax in this Budget.&nbsp; The landscape is now more competitive than it was, even five years ago.&nbsp;Globally, corporate tax rates have come down to an average of 27% compared to 31% five years ago.&nbsp; Hong Kong's rate is currently at 17.5%, and could go down further.&nbsp; Ireland's is 12.5%.&nbsp; The emerging Eastern European economies have become serious competitors for global investment&nbsp;- Czech Republic's is at 24%.&nbsp; Poland's and Slovak's Republic are at 19%.&nbsp; Hungary's is at 16%.&nbsp; Latvia's and Lithuania's are at 15%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a broad-based measure to help all companies and to keep Singapore attractive as a business location, I have decided to reduce the corporate tax rate by two percentage points, to 18%, with effect from YA2008.&nbsp; This will cost the Government $800 million a year.&nbsp; This corporate tax cut will bring Singapore more investments and more good jobs over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also do more to keep our tax regime relevant to new business structures and financial practices.&nbsp; Recognising that business borrowings are now taking various innovative and non-traditional forms, I will now allow all borrowing costs that are essentially similar to interest to qualify as tax-deductible expenses, with effect from YA2008.&nbsp; Such tax deductible costs will include certain guarantee fees and bond discounts.&nbsp; This will cost the Government $110 million a year.&nbsp; IRAS will release further details on this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><I><p align=left>Column: 1432<p>Making Singapore the best location to start and grow companies</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke earlier about our intention to make Singapore the best location for&nbsp; companies to start, grow and globalise.&nbsp;Our tax regime for SMEs and start-ups is already attractive.&nbsp; We will make it more so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to increase the Partial Tax Exemption threshold for companies from the current $100,000 to $300,000, with effect from YA2008.&nbsp; This will cost the Government $150 million. All companies will enjoy this exemption, but it will benefit SMEs the most.&nbsp;This will mean that almost 80% of taxable companies in Singapore will pay taxes at effective rates of less than 10%.&nbsp; It also means that a company with chargeable income of $500,000 will pay tax at an effective rate of 12.5%, equal to Ireland and significantly lower than comparable rates in Hong Kong.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also enhance our tax regime for start-ups.&nbsp; Start-ups currently enjoy full tax exemption on the first $100,000 of their chargeable income for each of their first three years of assessment between YA2005 and YA2009.&nbsp; I have decided to remove the YA2009 expiry date so that all start-ups will henceforth enjoy a full three years of exemption.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These moves, coupled with the reduction in corporate tax rate to 18%, will make Singapore one of the most competitive locations in the world for SMEs and start-ups.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that our SMEs will typically face greater difficulties in meeting the higher costs due to the CPF employer contribution increase.&nbsp; Therefore, I have decided to give them a rebate on their labour expenses for two years.&nbsp; In <p align=left>Column: 1433<p>the first year, this will take the form of a 2% cash rebate on the first $40,000 of total employer and employee CPF contributions of a firm. On the next $40,000 of total CPF contributions, we will give a 1% rebate.&nbsp; These percentages will be halved in the second year.&nbsp; This rebate will effectively offset up to 45% of the additional CPF cost that SMEs face in the first year and cost the Government $100 million in total.&nbsp; Details can be found in the Annex*.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">* Cols. 1525-1526.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Keeping our personal income tax regime competitive</I> &nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal income taxes have also been coming down worldwide, although not to the same extent as corporate taxes.&nbsp; We have gradually lowered our personal income tax rates, most recently with a two-percentage point cut to 20%.&nbsp; We aim to keep personal income taxes low.&nbsp; This will maximise the incentives for all Singaporeans to work hard and reap the rewards of their efforts.&nbsp; It will also help us to attract and keep both international and Singaporean talent here.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most taxpayers, our personal income tax regime is already competitive, because our marginal tax rate schedule is highly progressive.&nbsp; Thus, individuals with assessable incomes of up to half a million dollars pay less tax in Singapore than in Hong Kong; in fact, up to about $530,000 of assessable income, you pay less tax in Singapore compared to Hong Kong.&nbsp; However, at the very top end, some other jurisdictions have lower effective tax rates than us, including Hong Kong.&nbsp; For attracting and keeping top talent, this is an issue.&nbsp; Therefore, we will continue to monitor the trends in personal income tax rates of competing locations.&nbsp; The changes to the framework for drawing investment income on our reserves will enable us to lower our rates further if necessary.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=left>Column: 1434<p><B><I>Rationalising indirect taxes</I></B></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to implement other tax changes to rationalise our indirect tax regime.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Abolishing Cess</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I will remove the current broad-based Cess that applies to F&amp;B outlets.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who are not familiar with this, it is the second of the three 'pluses'&nbsp; on the bill you get at a restaurant.&nbsp; This will cost the Government about $30 million a year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cess has played a role in helping to fund the promotion of tourism.&nbsp; The Government will study more targeted ways to use Cess in future, where necessary, to fund specific tourism events.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reducing road tax</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will reduce road tax by 8% for passenger cars and motorcycles.&nbsp; This is part of our move to shift progressively towards taxing on the basis of vehicle usage rather than ownership. Someone who owns a 2.0 litre car (eg, a Toyota Picnic) and who currently pays $1,550 in annual road tax will get about $124 in savings.&nbsp; Details will be announced by the Ministry of Transport.</p><p><br><I>Reducing the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will reduce the monthly Foreign Domestic Worker Levy by $30 from 1st July 2007. This will benefit one in every six households in Singapore, which currently employs a foreign maid. It will be particularly helpful for families that need a maid to help take care of dependants.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also decided to extend the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy Concession, which currently only applies to those with young children and elderly parents, to employers with disabled family <p align=left>Column: 1435<p>members, in other words, where there are disabled family members, or the employers&nbsp; are themselves disabled and need additional care-giving support. This will take effect from 1st November 2007.&nbsp; The Foreign Domestic Worker Levy changes will cost the Government $75 million a year.&nbsp; More details on the qualifying criteria for the extension of the concession to those with disabilities will be announced by the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p><I>Reducing the foreign worker levy</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help companies save costs, I will lower the second tier foreign worker levy for the manufacturing and services sectors from $310 to $280 with effect from April 2007. This will cost the Government about $1 million a year. The Minister for Manpower will also be announcing other measures to facilitate access to manpower in the construction sector and certain other industries that are growing very rapidly.<br></p><p><I>Extending tax relief for cash top-ups to CPF Accounts by siblings</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, a person can claim up to $7,000 in tax relief each year for making cash top-ups to his, his parents', his grandparents' or his spouse's CPF Retirement Accounts, provided the beneficiary is aged 55 and above. To encourage greater support from close family members and not just children, we will extend this tax relief for cash top-ups to siblings who are aged 55 and above, and who earn $2,000 or less in the year preceding the top-up.&nbsp; This will take effect from YA2008.</p><p><br><I>Extending stamp duty relief</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, only limited liability companies and registered business trusts qualify for <p align=left>Column: 1436<p>stamp duty relief on intra-group transfers of assets.&nbsp; I have decided to extend this relief to unlimited companies, Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) where all the partners are companies, and Statutory Boards.&nbsp; This will take effect from today.</p><p><br><I>Rationalising liquor duties<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some liquors are taxed on the basis of alcoholic content while others are taxed on the basis of volume.&nbsp; We will progressively move towards taxing liquors on the basis of alcoholic content.&nbsp; From 1st January 2008, I will tax beer and stout on this new basis.&nbsp; This is a rationalisation of duties and is not aimed at generating additional revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we will harmonise the Customs and Excise duty rates for beer and stout.&nbsp; The new rates are set out in the Annex* to my speech.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">* Cols. 1527-1528.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reviewing asset taxes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mentioned in 2006 that we will review our asset taxes, including estate duty.&nbsp; I have decided to postpone a verdict on this. There have been many calls also to rationalise the structure of estate duty on residential properties and other assets respectively.&nbsp; I prefer to take this together with the decision on whether we will retain estate duty.&nbsp;</p><p><br><B><I>Raising new revenues<br></I></B></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the issue of raising revenues to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet our future expenditure needs and ensure that we remain competitive on direct taxes, we will raise additional revenues from two sources&nbsp;- income from our reserves, and GST.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Drawing more income from the reserves&nbsp;<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Government intends to amend the Constitution to revise the rule <p align=left>Column: 1437<p>that allocates Net Investment Income (NII) from past reserves for spending.&nbsp; We are studying this carefully and discussing with the President the proposed revisions to the Net Investment Income formula.&nbsp; We expect to be able to increase the investment income available for spending by the Government by taking in capital gains as part of this income.&nbsp; What we aim to do is to work out a formula that strikes a fair balance between the claims of present and future generations, because the financial security and spending needs of tomorrow are no less important than those of today.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we cannot rely on Net Investment Income alone to cover everything that we need to spend on.&nbsp; Instead, we must use the additional income from our reserves to secure further improvements to our competitiveness, to make longer-term investments in infrastructure and R&amp;D, and to top up the endowment funds that will bring value to Singaporeans for many years to come.&nbsp; This way, the NII will help to boost the growth of our economy over the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased expenditures that we will have to make on the social front over time should, therefore, be funded primarily by other revenues.&nbsp;<br></p><p><I>Raising the Goods and Services Tax rate</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why PM announced last year that we will raise the GST rate.&nbsp; Doing this will broaden our tax base, and enable the Government to implement Workfare and other initiatives to strengthen our social cohesion and grow our economy.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to raise the GST rate to 7% with effect from 1st July 2007.&nbsp; It is prudent to implement the GST increase now, in one step, while the economy is strong.&nbsp; This is expected to raise additional revenues of $750 million this year, and $1.5 billion per year going forward.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have carefully considered the alternative of spreading out the increase <p align=left>Column: 1438<p>in the GST over two years, and decided against it.&nbsp; It is better to raise prices at one go and compensate Singaporeans with a substantial offset package.&nbsp; By doing it in one step, it also means that no one can profiteer by raising prices in anticipation of a second step.&nbsp; For businesses, it also saves costs because they will not need to adjust their systems twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will make it easier for smaller businesses to register for GST.&nbsp; SPRING will subsidise up to 50% of GST registration-related costs for Internet connection and IT consultancy and training for small enterprises. This support will be in place for two years starting from March 2007.&nbsp; SPRING and IRAS will also work with the industry chambers and associations to provide free automation software to businesses and help them administer the GST.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>GST OFFSET PACKAGE</B></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to the measures we will take to offset the GST increase.&nbsp; We will put in place a comprehensive set of measures for Singaporeans, with more for the lower-income.&nbsp; The majority of Singaporeans will get offsets that are equal to at least five years of the increase in their expenditures as a result of the higher GST.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lower-income households will get much more than five years' worth.&nbsp; This GST Offset Package will cost the Government $4 billion in total over the five-year period.</p><p><br><B><I>Helping Singaporeans cope with the GST increase</I></B></p><p><B><br></B><I>GST Credits</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this $4 billion, $1.8 billion will be given out in cash, in the form of GST&nbsp; Credits.&nbsp; All adult Singaporeans will receive GST Credits in annual instalments.

These rebates will benefit 800,000 HDB households and cost a total of $800 million over five years.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Property tax rebate</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will provide a one-off property tax rebate of up to $100 per year in 2008 and 2009, in other words $200 in total for all owner-occupied residential properties.&nbsp; This will benefit about one million property owners, with three- and four-room HDB flat owners paying little to no property tax in 2008 and 2009.&nbsp; This will cost the Government $200 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Assistance for low-income families with young children</I><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To help lower-income families with young children, we will increase financial assistance for kindergarten and childcare.&nbsp; We will enhance the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) by increasing the level of subsidy from 75% of kindergarten fees, which is where it is currently, to 90%. This means that low-income families will now be able to enjoy a subsidy of about $80 a month.&nbsp; Subsidies for the Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for ChildCare (CFAC) will be increased by between $20 and $40 a month for each child.&nbsp; Other enhancements to the ComCare Fund programmes will be announced by MCYS later.&nbsp; These enhancements will cost a total of $6 million a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><I>Assistance for pensioners&nbsp;</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has decided to increase the Singapore Allowance further <p align=left>Column: 1444<p>by $20 per month, and raise the gross pension ceiling from the current $1,100 to $1,150 per month. The revision will give an additional $4 million a year to pensioners residing in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Public Transport Fund</I><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While public transport remains affordable for the majority of Singaporeans, there are lower-income families who need more help.&nbsp; The Government will commit $10 million, to a Public Transport Fund (PTF) in October 2007, to be given out over three years. This will provide additional help to lower-income households for their public transport costs where necessary.<br></p><p><I>Assistance through Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs), Self-Help Groups and VWOs</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we have a comprehensive GST Offset Package, it is possible that some households will face special difficulties.&nbsp; The best way to help them is through flexible assistance from their CCCs.&nbsp; I will therefore top up the CCC ComCare Fund by $5 million over five years.&nbsp; To help lower-income Singaporean families, the Government will also provide $2 million over five years to the Self-Help Groups, and $3 million over five years for Government-funded VWO programmes.&nbsp;More details will be announced by MCYS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Additional subsidies for healthcare, education and Service and Conservancy Charges<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will provide the restructured hospitals and polyclinics with more grants to fully absorb the additional GST on subsidised healthcare services. This will cost the Government an additional $12 million a year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also absorb the GST payable on school and miscellaneous fees as well as fees and tuition grants at ITEs,<p align=left>Column: 1445<p> polytechnics and universities.&nbsp; This will cost an additional $40 million a year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Town councils will also get an additional $10 million a year to absorb the additional GST payable on Service and Conservancy Charges.</p><p><br><B><I>Overall impact of the GST Offset Package on households</I></B></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me summarise the overall impact of the GST Offset Package for Singaporean households.&nbsp; Most households will receive GST Credits, Senior Citizens' Bonuses, PSEA top-ups, U-Save, S&amp;CC and rental rebates, and property tax rebates.&nbsp; Taking these offsets alone, those living in four-room flats will receive benefits that are, on average, seven times the extra GST that they will have to pay each year.&nbsp; In other words, seven years' worth of offset.&nbsp; Even those in executive flats will receive four years' worth of offset on average.&nbsp; The lowest-income households will receive the most.&nbsp; For instance, two-roomers will receive about 16 years' worth of offsets, or 16 times the increase in their annual GST expenditure.&nbsp;&nbsp; More details can be found in the Annex*.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>* Cols. 1529-1530.</p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the example of an average Singaporean family living in a four-room flat.&nbsp; This example is typical.&nbsp; If I were to choose a lower-income family, the benefits would be larger.&nbsp; Husband, aged 42, earns $2,800 a month. His wife, aged 37, earns $1,000 a month.&nbsp; They spend most of their take-home pay, or about $3,000 a month of spending.&nbsp; They will pay an additional GST of $57 per month or $685 per year typically.

We will invest in our people, enhance our infrastructure, and create a living environment that will inspire every Singaporean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget also strengthens our social security system.&nbsp; We are raising the employer CPF contribution rate to help our workers become more financially secure and to provide for their future medical, housing and retirement needs.&nbsp;We are taking a bold new approach to help those at the lower end of our workforce.&nbsp; Their wages are being held down by globalisation. Our older workers, especially, find it</p><p>difficult to secure jobs, and many lower-income households struggle to make ends meet.&nbsp; We will reduce their CPF contribution rates to help them stay employable and to increase their take-home pay.&nbsp; And we will supplement their incomes and savings through Workfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget strengthens our revenues for the future. We are raising the GST to broaden our tax base.&nbsp; It will give us critical additional revenues that will enable us to improve our social security system, increase spending on health, especially as our population ages, and ensure that our income taxes remain competitive.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help Singaporeans adjust to the higher GST, we are providing a <p align=left>Column: 1448<p>comprehensive offset package.&nbsp; Lower-income Singaporeans will receive much more than the extra GST they have to pay.&nbsp; The middle- and higher-income groups will also benefit from the offset package as well as from the higher employer contributions to their CPF.&nbsp; Most importantly, all Singaporeans will be better off because these decisive moves that we are making now will grow our economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are setting in place a strong and sustainable fiscal position.&nbsp; The GST increase will give us an additional $1.5 billion each year.&nbsp; Workfare will cost us about $400 million a year.&nbsp; Our increased health expenditures will amount to $300 million each year on average over the next five years, and considerably more beyond that.&nbsp; Expanding continuing education opportunities for all Singaporeans will cost us at least $300 million extra each year in the long term.&nbsp; The corporate tax cut will cost us $800 million per year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The GST increase will help us to finance these initiatives.&nbsp; But we also need to use more of the investment</p><p>income from our reserves.&nbsp; The additional income from our reserves, together with the increased GST revenues, will give us the resources to enhance our social security system, invest in new capabilities, further sharpen our competitiveness, and meet the challenges of the future from a position of strength.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we have every reason to be confident about our future. Globalisation is playing to Singapore's strengths&nbsp;- our openness to the world, our responsiveness to change, our reputation for trust.&nbsp; But what will ultimately determine our success is our people's spirit of enterprise, resilience and self-reliance.&nbsp; Even as we bolster our system of social support, we must keep these values strong in our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporeans bear testimony to these values.&nbsp; Like Mabel Ong, now in her mid-fifties.&nbsp; She did not get beyond <p align=left>Column: 1449<p>primary school. But she has always worked.&nbsp; First, as a seamstress for many years in garment factories. Until her mid-forties, when her eyesight deteriorated and she found it harder to sew clothes.&nbsp; She then started working at hotels as a valet, delivering laundry to hotel guests, and as a food server in restaurants.&nbsp; Two years ago, she took up a friend's recommendation and started work at the Oriental Hotel, checking and issuing mini-bar items for rooms.&nbsp; She does every type of work she can; during lull periods, she volunteers to help out at the linen department.&nbsp; She has also been going for courses so that she can take on new responsibilities.&nbsp; Recently, the hotel promoted her into a new position they created&nbsp;- 'Mini-bar Supervisor'.&nbsp; Mabel sums it up in her own words, her attitude to work and to life - \"Whatever I can do, I will do.&nbsp; And whatever I do, I will try to do well.\"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the Singapore spirit&nbsp;- can do, will do, do well.&nbsp; This is why we will succeed and this is why we have a bright future.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1450<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker,&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

Amongst the 70 award recipients in 2006, 55 of them have already implemented paid family leave. MOM will continue to promote the adoption of comprehensive and sustainable work-life policies through the Work-Life Excellence Award and other efforts.<br></p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 1453<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS:::1456--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Local teachers on placement and exchange of ideas--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Local teachers on placement and exchange of ideas)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Gautam Banerjee </B>asked the Minister for Education whether the National Institute of Education, as part of its normal teachers' training programme, regularly places trainee teachers in international schools so that they get an opportunity to experience different teaching methods and practices.<br></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1455<p>24.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Gautam Banerjee </B>asked the Minister for Education in light of the increase in the number of international schools in Singapore, whether there are programmes in place to promote the exchange of ideas and best practices between local and international schools.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the efforts to expose Singaporeans to a global environment, MOE encourages and facilitates efforts to collaborate with international schools.&nbsp; This includes providing opportunities both for our students and teachers.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, 31 of our schools were involved in 58 collaborations with foreign system schools.&nbsp; The collaborations range from joint efforts on projects, immersion programmes, sporting and cultural exchanges to sharing of good practices and ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Yumin Primary School has an ongoing collaboration with The Japanese School (Primary) since 2000. There are mutual visits by teachers to learn about the different school systems.&nbsp; They also organise an Immersion Programme every year for the P5 and P6 pupils, and a home-stay programme for the P5 pupils with their counterparts. Another example is the collaboration between Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' Secondary School and the Australian International School in the Arts Programmes.&nbsp; A few of our schools like St Andrew's JC, St Andrew's Secondary and CHIJ St Theresa's play friendly rugby, hockey and soccer games with the United World College.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is continuing with its efforts to encourage more schools to establish collaborations. We are also exploring other platforms for interactions between our schools and the foreign system schools in areas such as sports leagues, the Singapore Youth Festival for performing arts and an international friendship camp.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the teachers, MOE values the importance of building a strong foundation in pedagogy as well as developing the teaching force through broadening of their experiences.&nbsp; The exposure gained by teachers will benefit them professionally and enable them to contribute more to the teaching service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the objective of the pre-service training is to lay the foundation for our trainees to teach in local schools, trainee teachers are therefore not sent for teaching assignments in international schools.&nbsp; However, when they become trained teachers, there are opportunities for them to be attached to overseas or local international schools, such as Tanglin Trust School, Singapore American School, United World College and Overseas Family School, as part of Teacher Work Attachments or overseas immersion programmes to broaden their outlook on Education.&nbsp; In the first half of 2006, more than 200 of our teachers participated in these attachments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from teaching attachments and immersion programmes, there are also secondment opportunities for interested teachers to different type of schools, such as the Singapore International School in Hong Kong and the Bangkok-Pattana School, for them to experience different teaching practices and methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 1457<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SOCIAL WORKERS IN SINGAPORE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SOCIAL WORKERS IN SINGAPORE:::1460--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SOCIAL WORKERS IN SINGAPORE</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Measures to improve standing and career prospects--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Measures to improve standing and career prospects)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Sin Boon Ann </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports whether the Government is taking any further measures to improve the standing and long-term career prospects of social workers in Singapore.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to Mr Sin Boon Ann's question is \"yes\".&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have identified&nbsp;three &nbsp;areas that we will work on with the various stakeholders. They are: (i) Remuneration; (ii) Image and recognition of social work as a profession; and (iii) Professional development and growth.&nbsp; Let me elaborate on each of these areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(i) &nbsp;Remuneration</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS will be increasing our annual funding to voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) by about $11 million, to run the programmes supported by the Ministry.&nbsp; Part of the increased funding will go towards raising the salary of social workers. This will help VWOs to better attract, recruit and retain these professionals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>(ii) Image and recognition of the social work profession</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To improve the image and recognition of the social work profession, MCYS, together with the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), will work with the social work sector to introduce an accreditation framework for social workers. This will enhance the image and professionalism of social workers. There will also be a scheme for social workers to continue to learn and grow, and to develop their skills and knowledge so as to stay relevant. This will ensure that the profession maintains a high standard of credibility and enjoy the respect of the people they serve.&nbsp; We will be consulting the sector on the setting up of the accreditation framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Outstanding Social Worker Award, which recognises the best social workers in our midst, will continue to be given out.&nbsp; The Singapore Association of Social Workers will also continue to organise the annual Social Workers Day to showcase the contributions of social workers, and to recognise the profession in helping to build a more resilient society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(iii) Professional development and growth</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to encourage and support social workers to develop themselves professionally. Social workers can already access the VWO capability fund (VCF) for professional training, scholarship, and personal development.&nbsp; On top of this, MCYS is also introducing a $1 million Social Work Professionalisation Package, to further facilitate development and growth.&nbsp; As part of this package, a new Professional and Leadership Development Scheme will recognise and reward the best and most promising social workers by giving them the opportunity to develop their leadership potential. The details of the scheme will be announced later, but briefly, candidates for this scheme will get about&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1459<p>six weeks of paid leave from their regular work to attend leadership training courses for professionals in the sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another scheme in the pipeline is aimed at offering good and experienced social workers paid sabbatical, so as to allow them to recharge, re-energise, and renew themselves. This is to address concerns about burn-out and emotional stress. We recognise that work in the social service sector can be emotionally taxing and social workers need to be able to have time and the resources to take a break, take stock, and pursue professional and personal development. The paid sabbatical scheme will provide long-serving social workers with such opportunities.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 1459<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SANDWICHED MIDDLE-INCOME GROUP--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SANDWICHED MIDDLE-INCOME GROUP:::1460--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SANDWICHED MIDDLE-INCOME GROUP</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Tax reliefs--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Tax reliefs)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Ellen Lee </B>asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether there are any tax reliefs to help the sandwiched middle-income group that belongs to the generation whose parents practised birth control resulting in them having fewer or no siblings and having to take care of their aged parents and young children.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (for the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (for the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance):</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are generous tax reliefs for taxpayers caring for their aged parents and young children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A taxpayer may claim up to $8,000 in relief for maintaining each parent, depending on individual circumstances.

When the economy picked up and was doing well, as it did from 2004 to 2006, both local and foreign employment rose to match labour demand that sustained the economic growth. As at December 2006, there were 756,300 foreigners in employment.&nbsp; Our flexible labour policy has allowed us to respond quickly to changing business cycles.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, sectors which require labour-intensive work and which locals find unattractive have a higher dependency on foreign workers.

The move to smaller classes has provided young children with a more welcoming start to formal schooling. To take full advantage of <p align=left>Column: 1467<p>smaller classes, MOE also introduced the SEED*<sup>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; programme in 2005 to provide a more engaging learning experience for lower primary students.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback about SEED has been very encouraging.&nbsp; Schools are using the flexibility they have been given to try out varied methods to engage their young learners. Teachers have more room to cater to different learning needs and are able to invest more time in inculcating useful values among their pupils.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many of these schools, teachers customise activity-based lessons, to match the learning styles and abilities of their pupils.&nbsp; Concepts in Mathematics and English are taught by having pupils carry out hands-on activities in small groups of 6-10. As a result, teachers can spend more time with the weaker students, while students who learn at a quicker pace can learn to lead a group and help their peers.&nbsp; Overall, lessons become more interesting, and by working together, pupils learn important values like cooperation and tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternative forms of assessment have also been tried out under SEED.&nbsp; For example, Punggol Primary assesses pupils in role-play, presentations and story-telling to complement the traditional pen-and-paper assessment modes.&nbsp; The feedback from parents and teachers shows that these opportunities help the children develop their language skills and build self-confidence, and spark off a certain creative energy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, our experience with smaller class sizes at Primary 1 and 2 has been a positive one so far, although it is too early to come to definitive conclusions. MOE will continue to monitor and study the results of this move.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Yeo asked whether there are plans to extend smaller class sizes to other levels. Our approach to this issue beyond the early primary years is to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in schools, and let schools decide on how best to take advantage of the improved provisions. Schools may decide to reduce class size where there is benefit, or to use their additional teachers in other ways that can improve the quality of learning. This will vary from school to school, and by level, depending on the profile of students as well as the particular pedagogic skills of the teachers in the school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Improving the pupil-teacher ratio however hinges on our ability to recruit more teachers, without compromising the quality of the teaching service.&nbsp; This is important to ensure that we continue to provide a high standard of education to our students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, MOE's approach is to proactively recruit as many good teachers as possible. We are making good progress, and are on track to meeting our target of 30,000 teachers by 2010. MOE is also committed to providing the best possible support for our teachers, such as deploying more para-educators and administrative support staff to our schools, so that teachers can focus more time on helping their students learn better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Strategies for Effective and Engaged Development.</p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 1467<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SERVICE-RELATED JOBS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SERVICE-RELATED JOBS:::1470--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SERVICE-RELATED JOBS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Pay levels--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Pay levels)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo </B>asked the Minister for Manpower what is the trend on pay levels for services-related jobs with the increasing demand for these jobs and the impact of augmentation of foreign labour for these jobs.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1469<p><B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been good growth in pay levels in the services sector over the years. Between 1998 and 2005, average monthly earnings<sup>4&nbsp;</sup> in the services sector rose an annualised 3.2% per annum, from $2,800 to $3,500. In real terms, the growth was 2.6% per annum.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay in the financial sector was the highest, with an average monthly income of $5,950 per employee.&nbsp; It also grew the fastest, at 4.4% per annum, from 1998 to 2005.&nbsp; Other sectors had average monthly incomes ranging from $3,000 to $3,600.&nbsp; Over the same period, average monthly income grew at 4% per annum for <I>Community</I>, <I>Social</I> and <I>Personal Services</I>, 3.7% per annum for <I>Transport</I>, <I>Storage</I> and <I>Communications</I>, 2.5% per annum for the <I>Wholesale</I> and <I>Retail</I> Trade, and 2.1% per annum for <I>Business</I> and <I>Real Estate</I> Services.&nbsp; Average monthly earnings in the <I>Hotels</I> and <I>Restaurants</I> industry were lower, at $1,300, with negligible growth over the same period.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wages are primarily determined by specific industry conditions, rather than inflow of foreign labour.&nbsp; For example, the marine industry has a high proportion of foreign workers, but wages for resident workers&nbsp;are high, with average monthly earnings at around $2,700. Wage growth has also been good at about 4.5% in 2005. On the other hand, workers in the private security industry, who are largely Singaporeans, command comparatively lower average monthly wages, at $1,400<sup>5</sup>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite to the contrary, for sectors such as the financial industry, the flexible access to global talent has helped these sectors grow and as a result wage growth has been buoyant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real competition is not between local and foreign workers in Singapore.&nbsp; It is between all workers in Singapore, and the workers from countries such as China, India and Vietnam.&nbsp; For wages to be competitive, they must reflect the value of the job as well as the productivity and contributions of the worker.&nbsp; Hence, the solution to ensuring sustainable wage growth is to raise productivity and to train our workers in the skills to take on the jobs that are created.<br></p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><sup>4</sup> Average Monthly Earnings (AME) is computed based on mean concept and it includes all full-time and part-time employees who have contributed to CPF.

About 11 to 13% of them are students.&nbsp;&nbsp; The profile of resident singles by age and education is in Tables 1 and 2.&nbsp;<p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, 56% of singles were male, as was the case for 2000.&nbsp; 65% of the singles were between the ages of 20&nbsp;and 29.&nbsp; Using the past&nbsp;five years as a gauge, we do not expect the percentages in the next few years to vary too far from the present in terms of age and gender.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While single males aged 35 to 44 tend to be less educated than their female counterparts (in 2005, 37% of single males aged 35-44 have below secondary educational qualification, as compared to 20% of single females in the same age group), singles as a whole have become increasingly better educated over the last&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; 68% of non-student singles had at least a post-secondary education, up from 56% in 2000.&nbsp; The proportion of singles who are not students, but have attained at least a post-secondary qualification is likely to increase further in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With better educated singles, we expect them to be more sophisticated and have higher expectations of their marriage partners.&nbsp; It would also seem that more singles are opting for success in work and studies over getting married and starting a family.&nbsp; The median age at first marriage for male and female residents increased from 28.6 (males) and 26.2 (females) in 2000 to 29.7 (males) and 26.8 (females) in 2005.&nbsp; As a result of later marriages, the average number of children born to ever-married resident females fell from 2.2 in 2000 to 2.1 in 2005.&nbsp; This would negatively impact our total fertility rate and may affect our economic competitiveness in the long term.&nbsp; The Government has therefore put in place a comprehensive marriage and parenthood package to address this situation.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trends, against a backdrop of an ageing population, will also have implications on whether the immediate family will remain the first line of care and support.&nbsp; It is necessary to strengthen family ties beyond the conventional nuclear family or the traditional three-generation definition of children, parents and grandparents.&nbsp; Bonds between extended family members, especially ties between adult siblings, whether married or single, should be strengthened.&nbsp; If the relationship among the adult siblings is strong, there is greater possibility of support from nieces, nephews, and the single elderly <p align=left>Column: 1483<p>would have the support of the extended family for their emotional well-being and personal care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0cm 3pt;

In addition to the NVPC website, our Youth.SG online portal not only provides a virtual space for youth participation and youth expression, it is also an updated source of information on various possibilities and avenues of volunteering.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we empower our youth by providing funding for youth-initiated community projects through our Young ChangeMakers (YCM) Scheme. The decision-making and ownership responsibilities are also given to the panel of youth who assesses and disburses the funds. As of 31st December 2006, the youth panellists have assessed some 194 applications and approved 135 applications, amounting to about $233,000.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we support youth who are passionate to bring their volunteerism experiences overseas through our Youth Expedition Project (YEP). The YEP provides expertise and funding for youth preparing to embark on overseas volunteer expeditions. These exposure and experience will broaden their worldview so that they will return to become more active contributors to our society.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of strong service spirit is exemplified by the Nanyang Technological University Welfare Services Club (NTUWSC) which was conferred the Singapore Youth Awards (SYA) Medal of Commendation 2006. NTUWSC is an active contributor not only clinching the SYA for Community and Youth Services in 1999, but also getting international recognition with the prestigious Commonwealth Youth Gold Award in 2004. Their projects include 'Challenge Your Limits' (CURL), an annual community project that aims to promote interaction and understanding between the community and the less fortunate, through physically and mentally challenging activities, such as a kayaking expedition.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring about greater youth volunteerism, we need the public, people, as well as private sectors to play their part. Take, for instance, Citibank-YMCA Youth for Causes (YFC). YFC is a collaborative initiative by Citibank and the YMCA of Singapore to promote social entrepreneurship among youth. The programme functions as a 'social venture capital fund' to provide youth with seed funds and resources to execute creative ideas which they believe will benefit and support Voluntary Welfare Organisations of their choice. Our partners from the corporate and people sectors too have equally important roles in helping to raise civic consciousness amongst our youth.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong social capital is important to enhance a community's sense of belonging, resilience and cohesiveness. These attributes are essential to keep our social fabric intact and robust in face of adversities. Towards this end, the Government will continue to imbue in our youth the value of giving back to society.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Section Name: WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS NOT ANSWERED BY 3.00PM</span></div><BR><p align=left>Column: 1491<p><div align=left><span class=normal>Title: FOREIGN WORKERS IN SINGAPORE</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070215/Chart(OAnotAnswered-No.31)-15Feb07.doc\">Chart on Cumulative Employment Change</a></span></div><BR>\t  \t\t\t        \t<div align=left><span class=normal>MP Name: Dr Ng Eng Hen</span></div><BR>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Section Name: BUDGET</span></div><BR><p align=left>Column: 1491<p><div align=left><span class=normal>Title: ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070215/AnnexestoAnnualBudgetStatement.doc\">Annexes to Annual Budget Statement</a></span></div><BR>\t  \t\t\t        \t<div align=left><span class=normal>MP Name: Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</span></div><BR>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
