Since then it  has  a\r\n\r\nconstant inflow of about 5,000 National Servicemen\r\n\r\nannually. With the intake of more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers, the Corps was able to extend its  service\r\n\r\nin  1971 to include Civil Defence training for its\r\n\r\npart-time National Servicemen. Early this year its\r\n\r\nservice    was   further   extended    with    the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the  Community  Security  Force (CSF).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Vigilante Corps has emerged as a large\r\n\r\nand expanding disciplined force. Out of a total of\r\n\r\n31,089 National Servicemen in the Corps as at 30th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1974: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 11,208 are in the Vigilante Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 13,318 are in the Civil Defence Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) 5,892 are in the Community Security Service; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) 671 are in the Auxiliary Fire Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Vigilante Service is a mass youth organisation\r\n\r\nwhich  seeks to inculcate in the men  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nsocial    consciousness,    responsibility     and\r\n\r\ndiscipline  through  civics  and  organised  youth\r\n\r\nactivities.  Specific cultural  groups  have  been\r\n\r\nformed  to  enrich the cultural life of our  young\r\n\r\ncitizens. In addition, a Lifeguard Unit was set up\r\n\r\nin  February  this year. Within a  brief  span  of\r\n\r\neight  months since its inception, members of  the\r\n\r\nLifeguard Unit have saved the lives of 13 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Civil Defence Service, the National\r\n\r\nServicemen are trained in rescue operations, first-aid  and fire-fighting, so as to meet any national\r\n\r\nemergency.  Included  in  this  field  of  service\r\n\r\nrecently  is  the  introduction  of  Lift   Rescue\r\n\r\nTraining. It is hoped that the availability  of  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of well-trained VC National Servicemen  for\r\n\r\nsuch  rescue  work  will  help  to  minimise   the\r\n\r\ninconvenience  that  can be caused  to  HDB  flat-dwellers in the event of power failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Community Security Force became\r\n\r\noperational in January this year, there has been a\r\n\r\nsignificant reduction in crime between 7 p.m, and\r\n\r\n11 p.m, in the crime-prone areas selected for CSF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicing  service. During the first six months  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, there were on the average 21 days  per\r\n\r\nmonth  during which such areas were free of  crime\r\n\r\nbecause of the presence of the CSF members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of instructors to members of the Corps\r\n\r\nis  1  : 125. However, as there are some vacancies\r\n\r\nin the instructorate, the actual ratio is 1 : 172.\r\n\r\nSteps are being taken to fill the vacancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps has set up a counselling\r\n\r\nservice for VC National Servicemen. It is part  of\r\n\r\nthe  job  of  this  counselling unit  to  go  into\r\n\r\nindividual  cases  of  those  who  are  habitually\r\n\r\nabsent  from  duty or training.  They  also  visit\r\n\r\nhomes  of  habitual absentees to  find  out  their\r\n\r\nproblems and advise them to return for training or\r\n\r\nduty. Absentees working in shifts or at night  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  do  their training  during  the  day.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  they can attend  make-up  training\r\n\r\nsubsequently, provided they are granted  leave  of\r\n\r\nabsence  from  the usual training in  advance.  It\r\n\r\nshould,   however,  be  pointed   out   that   the\r\n\r\ncounselling service is not the decisive factor  in\r\n\r\nreducing the absentee rate in the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\nWith  suitable punitive measures and  an  improved\r\n\r\ntraining programme, the Corps has now been able to\r\n\r\ncut  down drastically the rate of absenteeism.  As\r\n\r\nat  1st  April, 1974, there were a total of  2,494\r\n\r\nbad   absentees  and  gazetted  deserters  in  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps. This number was reduced to 909 as\r\n\r\nat  30th  September this year. Taking into account\r\n\r\nthat  the  total  strength of the Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\ntoday  is  30,984  (excluding 105 deserters),  the\r\n\r\noverall  absentee rate has now dropped to an  all-time low of 2.9 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mass uniformed organisation like the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps,  it  is  not  possible  for  all\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Corps to be provided with made-to-measure  uniforms. However, every effort has  been\r\n\r\nmade to improve upon the style and comfort of  the\r\n\r\nuniforms provided for members of the Corps.  Prior\r\n\r\nto  1967, the national servicemen in the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  were provided with uniforms made of  drill.\r\n\r\nThis  has  since  been changed to cotton  for  the\r\n\r\nshirts and teteron for the trousers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJunior  officers  in  the Corps  are  issued  with\r\n\r\nuniforms made to standard sizes owing to the large\r\n\r\nnumbers  involved.  Slight  alterations   to   the\r\n\r\nuniforms  may have to be made by individuals.  The\r\n\r\nsenior  officers are provided with made-to-measure\r\n\r\nuniforms in view of their smaller numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DRUGS REGISTRATION BOARD</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Setting up of)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nand  Home  Affairs whether he is  considering  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  a  board for the registration  of\r\n\r\ndrugs,  and  what  measures  are  contemplated  to\r\n\r\nensure  that drugs are of clinical and therapeutic\r\n\r\nefficacy and are proven safe from dangerous  side-effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   the   setting  up  of  a  board   for   the\r\n\r\nregistration of drugs is being considered  as  one\r\n\r\nof  the  ways in which the proposed Medicines  Act\r\n\r\nmay  be administered. It will be necessary to draw\r\n\r\non  the  experience in drug control and safety  of\r\n\r\nother  countries, such as the United Kingdom which\r\n\r\nhas a similar Medicines Act. For instance, in U.K.\r\n\r\nthere   are  several  committees  which  undertake\r\n\r\nvarious  and  different aspects of  drug  control.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a Medicines Committee which is  charged\r\n\r\nwith  advising on the general policies  concerning\r\n\r\nmedicines,  answering questions  put  to  it,  and\r\n\r\nvolunteering  information. There  are  also  other\r\n\r\nexpert  committees  such  as  that  on  Safety  of\r\n\r\nMedicines,  and  the Pharmacopoeia Commission,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  sub-committees such as on the prevention\r\n\r\nof  microbial contamination of medicines.  In  our\r\n\r\ncase,  where  necessary, committees along  similar\r\n\r\nlines may be formed in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic measure to ensure safety, efficacy and\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  medicine will be  by  licensing.\r\n\r\nLicensing  of  the  products (in  other  words,  a\r\n\r\nregistration of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  products)  will be based on evidence  of  the\r\n\r\nfollowing: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The product does not contain any deleterious\r\n\r\nsubstance;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There is good quality control in\r\n\r\nmanufacture;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There has been exhaustive and comprehensive\r\n\r\ntesting  chemically, by bio-assays  and  by\r\n\r\nclinical trials; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) They are marketed in approved forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a corollary it will have to eliminate drugs\r\n\r\nwhich   are  of  doubtful  safety,  efficacy   and\r\n\r\nquality.  Drugs will be screened on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nscientific   evidence  of  safety,  efficacy   and\r\n\r\ncompliance  with the principles of internationally\r\n\r\naccepted standards of good manufacturing practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has now five officers with overseas\r\n\r\ntraining  in  quality  control  of  drugs  and  in\r\n\r\nprocedures  of drug registration.

This concerns the  Points\r\n\r\nDemerit  System  which  aims  at  identifying  and\r\n\r\nremoving dangerous drivers from the roads. It also\r\n\r\nserves   as  a  psychological  deterrence  against\r\n\r\nreckless  driving. This system entails the  giving\r\n\r\nof  points  by  administrative means  for  traffic\r\n\r\noffences  likely  to  cause  accidents.  A  points\r\n\r\npenalty  table  under the Rules will  specify  the\r\n\r\npoints for various traffic violations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a driver has attained a total of 12 or more\r\n\r\npoints  within a year, the Registrar  of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nwill have powers to suspend the driving licence of\r\n\r\nthe  driver for a period not exceeding six months.\r\n\r\nA  warning notice, however, will first be sent  by\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  of  Vehicles to the  motorist  the\r\n\r\nmoment  he has accumulated or exceeded six points.\r\n\r\nOn  receipt of a notice of suspension, the  driver\r\n\r\nhas  the  right  within 14 days to appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister against the decision of the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles.  The Minister's decision on  the  matter\r\n\r\nwill be final. Any person whose driving licence is\r\n\r\nsuspended  will  have  to  surrender  it  to   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Vehicles and will be prohibited  from\r\n\r\ndriving any motor vehicle on the roads during  the\r\n\r\nperiod of suspension of his driving licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Amendment Bill will impose\r\n\r\nliability  upon a motor vehicle owner for  parking\r\n\r\noffences  in  cases where the particulars  of  the\r\n\r\noffending  driver  are not available.  Unless  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  owner  can  furnish  particulars  of  the\r\n\r\ndriver  to the police within seven days  from  the\r\n\r\ndate of issue of the police notice or satisfy  the\r\n\r\npolice  or the court that the vehicle was, at  the\r\n\r\nrelevant time, stolen or had been illegally  taken\r\n\r\nor  used,  or establish that he did not  know  and\r\n\r\ncould   not,   with  reasonable  diligence,   have\r\n\r\nascertained  the name and address of  the  driver,\r\n\r\nthe vehicle owner would be liable for the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Amendment Bill will enable the\r\n\r\nMinister to make rules with respect to jaywalking.\r\n\r\nOver the last three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears,  a total of 10,519 pedestrians were  killed\r\n\r\nand injured by motor vehicles. In 1973, a total of\r\n\r\n380 persons were killed in road traffic accidents,\r\n\r\n185  of whom were pedestrians. While many of these\r\n\r\naccidents   involving   pedestrians    could    be\r\n\r\nattributed  to  reckless driving by  motorists,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  number of these fatalities were  caused  by\r\n\r\npedestrians crossing the road heedless of  traffic\r\n\r\nconditions. The pedestrians, therefore, need to be\r\n\r\ndisciplined as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Amendment Bill, it will be an offence\r\n\r\nfor  pedestrians to cross the road other  than  at\r\n\r\nplaces   where  proper  crossing  facilities   are\r\n\r\nprovided. This would, however, apply to  the  area\r\n\r\n50  metres  from either side of any such crossing.\r\n\r\nWhere the crossings are close to one another,  the\r\n\r\narea  of enforcement may be extended to cover  the\r\n\r\nlength between and a little beyond such crossings.\r\n\r\nTraffic  signs  will be erected  to  indicate  the\r\n\r\nareas  of  enforcement. As it is not the intention\r\n\r\nto punish but to educate pedestrians in the proper\r\n\r\nuse of the facilities provided for them, initially\r\n\r\nsmall  composition  fines  would  be  imposed   on\r\n\r\njaywalkers. This may be increased later  if  there\r\n\r\nis   no  salutary  effect.  Jaywalking  by  school\r\n\r\nchildren  will be referred to principals of  their\r\n\r\nschools  for appropriate action to be taken.  Aged\r\n\r\nand disabled persons who are unable to make use of\r\n\r\nthe   pedestrian  crossing  facilities  would   be\r\n\r\nexempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To empower the courts to impose and enhance\r\n\r\npenalties  in respect of traffic offences,  clause\r\n\r\n10   of  the  Amendment  Bill  provides  for   the\r\n\r\nimposition  of a fine not exceeding $1,000  or  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding three months\r\n\r\nfor the first offence. For a second and subsequent\r\n\r\noffence,   the  courts  may  impose  a  fine   not\r\n\r\nexceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not\r\n\r\nexceeding   six   months.   For   uniformity   and\r\n\r\nconsistency,  these  enhanced  penalty  provisions\r\n\r\nwould  apply  to  all offences under  the  various\r\n\r\nrules and regulations of the Road Traffic Act. The\r\n\r\nexisting   penal  sections  in   the   rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations   will   be  amended   in   subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new ticketing system in respect of traffic\r\n\r\noffences will be introduced under clause 12 of the\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill. The objective of this is to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  present  cumbersome paper work which  hinders\r\n\r\nthe  Traffic Police in its work and saps up  extra\r\n\r\nmanpower   unnecessarily,   thus   reducing    the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  enforcement action.  Under  the\r\n\r\nproposed ticketing system, a traffic ticket served\r\n\r\nby   the   policeman   on  the  motorist,   either\r\n\r\npersonally or by registered mail, will  be  deemed\r\n\r\nto be both a report as well as a summons to appear\r\n\r\nin  court.  If  the  offence is compoundable,  the\r\n\r\nticket   would   also  serve  as   an   offer   of\r\n\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the Points Demerit System and the\r\n\r\nticketing   system   function   effectively    and\r\n\r\nefficiently,  the Traffic Police and the  Registry\r\n\r\nof  Vehicles  have computerised their records  and\r\n\r\nprocedures,  and  the records  and  procedures  of\r\n\r\nthese two departments would be linked. Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  may be interested to know that  these\r\n\r\nnew  enforcement procedures are based  on  systems\r\n\r\nsuccessfully applied in countries like the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  England, Australia and Japan.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  recommended for adoption here after  careful\r\n\r\nstudy and research by the Traffic Police, Registry\r\n\r\nof   Vehicles,  Attorney-General's  Chambers   and\r\n\r\nComputer  Services  Division of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 15 of the Amendment Bill will\r\n\r\nenable  the courts to accept certificates endorsed\r\n\r\nby   a  police  officer  not  below  the  rank  of\r\n\r\ninspector,  as to the accuracy and reliability  of\r\n\r\nradar  speed  traps  and  speedometers  of  police\r\n\r\nvehicles.  This  is  required for  more  effective\r\n\r\nenforcement  against speed hogs  whose  mania  for\r\n\r\nspeed without consideration for others often  kill\r\n\r\nand maim innocent people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, traffic law enforcement consists\r\n\r\nbasically  of five processes: (i) detection;  (ii)\r\n\r\napprehension;     (iii)     prosecution;      (iv)\r\n\r\nadjudication;    and    (v)   penalisation.    For\r\n\r\nenforcement to be effective, there must be  enough\r\n\r\nteeth in the traffic laws to enable enforcement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers to carry out their task without  let  and\r\n\r\nhindrance.   The  underlying  objective   of   the\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill  is  to speed up  the  enforcement\r\n\r\nprocess  and,  at  the  same  time,  enhance   the\r\n\r\nefficacy  of traffic law enforcement. It  is  also\r\n\r\naimed  at  drastically reducing the  road  traffic\r\n\r\naccident rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All careful and law-abiding motorists and\r\n\r\npedestrians should welcome the various  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  Amendment Bill,  as  they  are\r\n\r\nintended to make our roads safer and to reduce the\r\n\r\nunnecessary heavy toll on lives we see today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the aim of this Bill is to introduce\r\n\r\na   Points  Demerit  System  in  order  to   deter\r\n\r\nmotorists  from driving dangerously or  recklessly\r\n\r\non  the  road.  The  number of road  accidents  is\r\n\r\nincreasing every year and the number of fatalities\r\n\r\nis  also  increasing. The adoption of this  System\r\n\r\nagainst  reckless  motorists  is  timely.  In  the\r\n\r\nPoints Demerit System, because of the awarding  of\r\n\r\npoints - four, five or six points depending on the\r\n\r\nnature of the traffic offence - a motorist who  is\r\n\r\nfound  guilty  of offences for which  12  or  more\r\n\r\npoints   are  awarded,  will  be  suspended   from\r\n\r\ndriving.  So  he must not commit more  than  three\r\n\r\ntraffic  offences. Otherwise his licence  will  be\r\n\r\nsuspended for six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that such a penalty is too drastic,\r\n\r\nespecially  against bus drivers, taxi drivers  and\r\n\r\nlorry drivers, who depend on driving as a means of\r\n\r\nearning a living. This system is a threat to their\r\n\r\nlivelihood as it may break their rice bowl.  These\r\n\r\nprofessional drivers spend at least eight hours of\r\n\r\ndriving  on  the  road. Take the case  of  a  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver.  He  is quite different from the  ordinary\r\n\r\nmotorist. He has to spend about eight to 12  hours\r\n\r\nof  driving, and working two shifts in one day.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that we should have a different system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof awarding points for these professional drivers.\r\n\r\nWe  should  increase the maximum number of  points\r\n\r\nfour-fold  for  the  penalty of  suspending  their\r\n\r\ndriving  licences. I am not advocating  that  taxi\r\n\r\nand  lorry  drivers  should be allowed  to  commit\r\n\r\ntraffic  offences. What I am pointing out is  that\r\n\r\nwe should be sympathetic towards taxi drivers, bus\r\n\r\ndrivers and lorry drivers. It is not quite correct\r\n\r\nto punish them heavily by suspending their driving\r\n\r\nlicences if they are awarded 12 points, because  a\r\n\r\nsuspension of six months' driving will  amount  to\r\n\r\ndepriving them of their livelihood for six months.\r\n\r\nHow  will  their families live? Who  is  going  to\r\n\r\nsupport  them?  And in the face of  inflation  and\r\n\r\neconomic  recession  these  days,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould see that the livelihood of these people  is\r\n\r\nsafeguarded.  The Government should  not  increase\r\n\r\nthe  pool of unemployed or cause more hardship  to\r\n\r\nthe  people. So we should adopt a different system\r\n\r\nof  awarding points for the professional  drivers.\r\n\r\nApart   from   serious  traffic  offences,   other\r\n\r\npunitive  measures  may be taken  -  for  example,\r\n\r\nwarnings, fines or suspension of driving  licences\r\n\r\nfor  one  week. For minor offences we  should  not\r\n\r\nsuspend their licences for six months in order  to\r\n\r\ndeter   them  from  committing  further   offences\r\n\r\nbecause  we  should  not cause hardship  to  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides for a ticket system.\r\n\r\nCareful  consideration  should  be  given  in  its\r\n\r\nimplementation  to ensure that it is  not  abused.\r\n\r\nFor example, the officers concerned should be fair\r\n\r\nin  their attitude. They should not be allowed  to\r\n\r\nabuse  their rights by causing unnecessary trouble\r\n\r\nto drivers so as to avoid disputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, civil servants in certain departments do not\r\n\r\ncarry out their duties correctly. Some of them are\r\n\r\nnot  even  familiar  with the relevant  laws.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  the  case of bus  lanes,  these  are\r\n\r\nreserved for buses during the hours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom 7.30 a.m, to 9.30 a.m, and from 4.30 p.m, to 6.30 p.m, on weekdays. On Saturdays, the hours  of\r\n\r\nrestriction  are from 7.30 a.m, to 9.30  a.m, and\r\n\r\nfrom   11.30  a.m, to  2.30  p.m.  Outside  these\r\n\r\nperiods, the restriction is not enforced. In other\r\n\r\nwords, outside these hours all vehicles can travel\r\n\r\nalong  bus  lanes just like any other  stretch  of\r\n\r\nroad.  However, taxi drivers have been  prosecuted\r\n\r\nfor  driving in bus lanes outside these restricted\r\n\r\ntimes.   This   shows   that   the   police   have\r\n\r\nunnecessarily interfered with the control of  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.  Beyond  these  restricted  times,   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers should be allowed to use the bus lanes  as\r\n\r\nwell.  This  shows that certain officers  are  not\r\n\r\nfamiliar with the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of an abuse of the law concerns\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers.  We  know that  taxis  have  to  be\r\n\r\ninspected every six months in order to ensure that\r\n\r\nthey maintain their engines properly. However,  at\r\n\r\nthe  headquarters of the Registry of Vehicles,  we\r\n\r\nsee  policemen  on the look-out  for  taxis.  They\r\n\r\ninvariably  cause  taxis  to  go  into   the   ROV\r\n\r\ncompound.  This  causes loss of earnings  for  the\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers because they are asked to bring their\r\n\r\ntaxis  to  the  ROV for inspection  before  it  is\r\n\r\nactually  due. I would urge the Minister  to  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter and to direct that department and\r\n\r\nthe officers in that department to comply with the\r\n\r\nrelevant laws and not to abuse their power. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister would give special training  to  law\r\n\r\nenforcement   officers  and  to  see   that   they\r\n\r\nfamiliarise  themselves with the laws before  they\r\n\r\ncarry out their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in principle, I support this\r\n\r\nBill because it will result in a reduction of road\r\n\r\naccidents and road fatalities. But I hope that the\r\n\r\nlaw  enforcement officers could be fair  in  their\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  the  motorist,  especially  the\r\n\r\nprofessional drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nview  of the very sad state of discipline  on  the\r\n\r\nroads today, a matter on which much has been said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the last few weeks, and in view of the frequent\r\n\r\ndisplay of disregard for lawful behaviour  on  the\r\n\r\nroads, no sensible person, I think, has any  other\r\n\r\nalternative  than to support this Bill completely.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  rise  to voice my unqualified support  for\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is interesting to note that\r\n\r\nthis debate on the Second Reading of this Bill  is\r\n\r\nbeing  conducted actually during a period in which\r\n\r\na  campaign has been launched and is very much  in\r\n\r\nthe  process of implementation. To my mind and  to\r\n\r\nmy  personal  and great satisfaction, I  interpret\r\n\r\nthis  as  highlighting the role of legislation  in\r\n\r\ncontinuing public education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, may I just recapitulate a few\r\n\r\npoints that have been raised during this campaign,\r\n\r\nbecause   while   there  has   been   debate   and\r\n\r\nsuggestions outside Parliament, I think the  final\r\n\r\narbitrating forum is Parliament itself. So let  me\r\n\r\njust make one or two points, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Points Demerit System. Instead of\r\n\r\nconsidering  this system as drastic or  Draconian,\r\n\r\nmaybe we should extend it to include even the less\r\n\r\ngrave offences. It may not be quite inappropriate,\r\n\r\ntoday  particularly,  for me  to  resort  to  some\r\n\r\nreligious imagery. There are, Sir, mortal sins and\r\n\r\nvenial  sins.  Perhaps what has been  incorporated\r\n\r\nadministratively in the Points System may  be  for\r\n\r\nmortal  sins,  but I think we ought also  to  give\r\n\r\none, two or three points for venial sins. If I may\r\n\r\njust   enlighten  this  House  further   on   this\r\n\r\nreligious  matter,  may I say that  no  amount  of\r\n\r\nvenial  sin  can equal one mortal sin. But  venial\r\n\r\nsins  lead  to mortal sins. So I think  we  should\r\n\r\nalso  attempt to penalise those who infringe  even\r\n\r\nin minor matters, just to bring to their minds the\r\n\r\npossibility that through their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarelessness  they may infringe  seriously.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould   appeal   both   to   the   Minister    for\r\n\r\nCommunications as well as to the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs to consider implementing the Points System\r\n\r\non the basis of one, two or three points for other\r\n\r\nminor offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is that when a licence is taken away\r\n\r\nfrom  a  person  for six months or  for  a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod  by  a  court order, it is not  correct  to\r\n\r\nallow  a person to resume driving just like  that.\r\n\r\nYou  must remember, Sir, that this person has  had\r\n\r\nhis licence suspended because he has infringed the\r\n\r\nlaw gravely. He has been a danger to life and limb\r\n\r\nof  other people. In fact, he might have been  the\r\n\r\ncause  of dangerous injuries to other people.  And\r\n\r\nyet  after  a  period  of six  months,  at  least,\r\n\r\nwithout  any driving, he is allowed to go back  on\r\n\r\nthe  road without any assurance that he indeed can\r\n\r\ndrive  well and with responsibility. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  when  a person has  had  his  licence\r\n\r\nsuspended,  he  should not be  allowed  to  resume\r\n\r\ndriving  unless  he has undergone another  driving\r\n\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to another point which I would\r\n\r\nlike  to bring up, Sir, and that is the very  high\r\n\r\nrate  of  failures of those people  who  take  the\r\n\r\ndriving  test.  The Minister's own  officers  will\r\n\r\nconfirm that three-quarters of those who take  the\r\n\r\ntest fail. The average rate of passing is only  25\r\n\r\nper cent. What does this signify, Mr Speaker? Does\r\n\r\nit  signify that people go for the test on a tikam\r\n\r\ntikam  basis:  just try your luck  without  really\r\n\r\npreparing  yourself  for  the  test?  Or  does  it\r\n\r\nsignify  that any Chang San and Lee Ssu can  teach\r\n\r\nhis brother, sister or friend to drive, and expect\r\n\r\nthis  person to rush off into a test? On the basis\r\n\r\nof  this  high rate of failure, perhaps we  should\r\n\r\nseriously  consider that those who wish  to  teach\r\n\r\npeople to drive ought to be specially licensed  to\r\n\r\ndo so. This matter has cropped up before, I think,\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry of Communications. Perhaps  we\r\n\r\ncould be enlightened as to why this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  not  been implemented. There must  have  been\r\n\r\ngood reasons, but I would suggest that this matter\r\n\r\nbe given further consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that - perhaps\r\n\r\nI  may  be  imagining -there seems to be more  \"L\"\r\n\r\nlicence  holders among the motor-cycle  fraternity\r\n\r\nin  Singapore than those who have actually  passed\r\n\r\nthe  test. Anyway, there seems to be too  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  motorcyclists with \"L\" plates. I have  been\r\n\r\ninformed  that they evade tests by renewing  their\r\n\r\nprovisional licences again and again, so  that  we\r\n\r\nhave on the roads quite a number of people who  do\r\n\r\nnot feel competent to take their motor-cycle test.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some limit should be placed on the  length\r\n\r\nof  time during which they can be allowed to renew\r\n\r\ntheir  provisional licences, so we can be  assured\r\n\r\nthat   in  view  of  the  fairly  high  motorcycle\r\n\r\naccident  rates efforts are being taken by  motor-cyclists to use their vehicles safely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is a pity that the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation   is   not  here.  I   would   like   to\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister for Education for coming\r\n\r\nout  in  such solid support for the principle  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  spirit of this educational  campaign  by\r\n\r\ninstructing  schools - oh, yes, the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  here - to support  this  \"accident-free\" campaign. I think this support has to be  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of the entire Government, not merely  of\r\n\r\none  or  two Ministries. All Government Ministries\r\n\r\nshould  support  this campaign  in  various  ways,\r\n\r\nprincipally by seeing that their own vehicles obey\r\n\r\nthe  laws.  I  may  mention to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications  that  I  saw  one   of   his   own\r\n\r\nMinistry's    vehicles    committing    a    minor\r\n\r\ninfringement. Perhaps that driver deserves one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  points! Again, I have also seen the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof the Environment's vehicles on the wrong side of\r\n\r\nthe road - one sampah lorry was going up a one-way\r\n\r\nstreet in the wrong direction. These infringements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  setting bad examples to others.  So  I  think\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments  should  particularly  see\r\n\r\nthat  their own vehicles proceed correctly on  the\r\n\r\nroad.  And  I  am very glad that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development is here now because  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  condition of our roads requires  his  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I have no irreconcilable\r\n\r\nobjections  to  the Bill. To me  the  Bill  merely\r\n\r\nreflects  a  kind of problem that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  face  as  we  reach a stage  of  growth  and\r\n\r\naffluence and where so many bodies wish to live in\r\n\r\norder and comfort within a very limited area. This\r\n\r\nsituation  requires empowering the  administration\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry with authority to regulate social\r\n\r\nconduct. It appears to be an unavoidable course of\r\n\r\naction.  Nevertheless, I think in  the  growth  of\r\n\r\ngovernments  the  world over,  it  is  a  striking\r\n\r\nfeature  that  as  social  problems  expand  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety, the more does it become necessary for the\r\n\r\nadministration  or the Ministry  to  be  empowered\r\n\r\nwith  executive action to regulate social conduct.\r\n\r\nThis  is the kind of situation that we are leading\r\n\r\nto.  I  do wish to say that, although unavoidable,\r\n\r\nempowering the Ministry with executive  powers  is\r\n\r\nregrettable. Therefore, it becomes very  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the  officials concerned to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\napplication of this authority is done in the  most\r\n\r\njust  way possible. In our case it is not a matter\r\n\r\nof  choice or convenience. In our case I think the\r\n\r\noption is a necessary one if we are to prevent our\r\n\r\nroads  from  becoming a bloody  scene  of  damaged\r\n\r\nbodies  and  injuries. Nevertheless, I  think  the\r\n\r\nabsorption  of executive power by the Ministry  or\r\n\r\nby  the  administration  must  be  explained  very\r\n\r\nclearly   by   the   Ministry  or  administration,\r\n\r\nillustrating to the people that the alternative is\r\n\r\nsocial  disorder which we must all try  to  avoid.\r\n\r\nThat is the point I wish to make in respect of the\r\n\r\nfirst section of the Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to make one observation on the\r\n\r\nDemerit  System that is envisaged in the Bill.  It\r\n\r\nstruck me that the system envisaged is negative in\r\n\r\napproach. The system appears to me to say  to  the\r\n\r\nmotorists: \"Don't drive fast, because  if  you  do\r\n\r\nyou  will  receive so many bad points\", or  \"Don't\r\n\r\ndrive  carelessly,  because if  you  do  you  will\r\n\r\nreceive so many bad points\". And at the end  of  a\r\n\r\nperiod, the Bill says: \"Now that you have  got  so\r\n\r\nmany  bad  points, you should not  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndrive  at  all for so many months.\" I am wondering\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  it is possible  to  construct  a\r\n\r\nsystem  which  has a positive approach,  a  system\r\n\r\nwhich  awards points to motorists for good driving\r\n\r\n-  a  system which perhaps at the end of the score\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to award privileges  to  the  good\r\n\r\nmotorist, such as a year's free driving licence or\r\n\r\na  rebate in road tax. I am sure it is not  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  ingenuity of the Ministry's officials to  try\r\n\r\nand  think  of a positive approach to the  problem\r\n\r\nbecause I think that such an approach will  induce\r\n\r\nthe  motoring  public to raise their standards  of\r\n\r\nsocial  conduct on the roads, rather than  confine\r\n\r\nthem to a low level which at best becomes only  an\r\n\r\neffort in driving without accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I wish to make a few comments on this  Bill,\r\n\r\nbut  it  may appear to be a bit too late  at  this\r\n\r\nstage; but it is better late than never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the point made by the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State for Communications relating  to\r\n\r\npedestrians.  He  said that the  intention  is  to\r\n\r\neducate rather than to punish jaywalkers.  We  all\r\n\r\nknow that quite a number of serious accidents were\r\n\r\ncaused by jaywalking. On the introduction of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  jay-walkers are let off very lightly.  This\r\n\r\nwill not help to reduce the number of accidents on\r\n\r\nour  roads.  The Minister of State also  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  for enforcement to be effective, there  must\r\n\r\nbe  enough teeth given to the Traffic regulations.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in so far as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njaywalking is concerned, we are merely giving  the\r\n\r\nregulations   false  teeth.  Especially   at   the\r\n\r\njunctions  of  North Bridge Road / Stamford  Road!\r\n\r\nBras  Basah Road, you can see hoards of jaywalkers\r\n\r\ncrossing the roads when the traffic lights  favour\r\n\r\nthe motorists. As a result many motorists have  to\r\n\r\nplay  hide and seek with such careless pedestrians\r\n\r\nand   run   the  risk  of  running  down  innocent\r\n\r\nbystanders. All these careless pedestrians  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  let  off so lightly for their negligence,\r\n\r\nwhich  however is the case with this Bill. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat   the   provisions  against  jaywalking   are\r\n\r\ninadequate, and this will not help to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of accidents that occur every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Sembawang, has\r\n\r\npointed  out that certain provisions of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nare  too drastic against professional drivers, and\r\n\r\nhe  mentioned the case of bus and taxi drivers. He\r\n\r\nsays  that  if  a bus driver or a taxi  driver  is\r\n\r\nsuspended  from  driving for six months,  it  will\r\n\r\nmore  or  less  affect  his rice  bowl.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether my colleague has given some thought to the\r\n\r\nproblems of the victims of such reckless driving - \r\n\r\nthose  who die on the roads through the negligence\r\n\r\nand  recklessness of bus drivers, taxi drivers and\r\n\r\nlorry  drivers.  Who will be responsible  to  look\r\n\r\nafter their families? I would like to quote a  few\r\n\r\ninstances where accidents were caused by negligent\r\n\r\nbus  drivers, as this will probably help to change\r\n\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Toa Payoh alone there were so many accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving  bus  drivers. A  bus  overturned  while\r\n\r\nrounding a circus in Lorong 7, Toa Payoh. Luckily,\r\n\r\nnobody was injured, other than causing a fright to\r\n\r\nthe  driver.  Two buses on going out  of  the  bus\r\n\r\nterminus ran into a drain. We had one instance  in\r\n\r\nwhich  a bus attempted to go over the flyover  but\r\n\r\ncrashed into the railings instead. Here again,  it\r\n\r\nwas  fortunate that it caused only a few injuries.\r\n\r\nIn  another case in Toa Payoh Central,  two  buses\r\n\r\ncollided head-on, causing injuries to 22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople.  In another accident in Dunearn Road  only\r\n\r\ntwo months ago, a bus ran into the path of another\r\n\r\nbus  and  15  persons were injured. In  Queenstown\r\n\r\nthere were about 20 to 30 bus commuters waiting at\r\n\r\na  bus stand, and there came along a bus which ran\r\n\r\ninto  them  and  knocked down the  bus  stand.  In\r\n\r\nanother  case in Punggol, a bus attempted  to  run\r\n\r\nbeyond  Punggol  Point! We have yet  another  case\r\n\r\nwhere a bus ran into the car of the Honourable the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation.  All  these instances are  examples  of\r\n\r\nnegligent driving of bus drivers, and I feel  that\r\n\r\nif no adequate punishment is meted out to such bus\r\n\r\ndrivers, we can never hope to reduce the number of\r\n\r\naccidents and fatalities on our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support all the provisions in the Bill except\r\n\r\nthe provision covering pedestrians, and I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  consider introducing  more  severe\r\n\r\npenalties for jaywalking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in  Singapore  today  I  find   it\r\n\r\ndifficult to drive around and I find it even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult to walk around. Although I support  this\r\n\r\nBill, I feel that it is not quite so effective. It\r\n\r\nis like leaving a headache to cure itself, or when\r\n\r\nyour  foot aches you treat it yourself. If we want\r\n\r\nto  reduce the number of accidents we will have to\r\n\r\nreduce the number of vehicles and drivers. I agree\r\n\r\nwith  Members that the minimum age for  holding  a\r\n\r\ndriving licence should be raised to 21 years. This\r\n\r\nis a correct move. If we do not allow more drivers\r\n\r\non  the road, the Government can easily reduce the\r\n\r\nnumber of private car ownership. This will lead to\r\n\r\na reduction in the number of accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against the introduction of the\r\n\r\nPoints  Demerit  System. It is only  a  medium  to\r\n\r\ntreat the symptoms of a permanent ailment. It does\r\n\r\nnot  cure  the pain fundamentally. In  the  Points\r\n\r\nDemerit System many different points of view  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given. Some Members think that we should  be\r\n\r\neven\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  strict,  but the Member for Sembawang  feels\r\n\r\nthat it is already too strict for the professional\r\n\r\ndrivers. I am in full sympathy with him. The  case\r\n\r\nfor  these professional drivers is just  like  the\r\n\r\nChinese  saying  that if you go  to  the  mountain\r\n\r\noften enough, chances are you will be eaten by the\r\n\r\ntiger.  Therefore,  I think the Government  should\r\n\r\ngive some consideration to this point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  any  law  to  be  effective,  there  must  be\r\n\r\nenforcement. But as far as the management of  road\r\n\r\ntraffic  is  concerned, we seem to have  a  rather\r\n\r\npeculiar  situation where the law is made  by  one\r\n\r\nMinistry,  but  without  any  control   over   its\r\n\r\nenforcement.  We have the Traffic  Police  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs  taking  care  of  the\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  this  Bill  introduced   by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Communications. To me  it  would  be\r\n\r\nlogical  either for the Minister for Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nto  take  charge of administering the Road Traffic\r\n\r\nAct,  or  for the Traffic Police to be transferred\r\n\r\nto    the   portfolio   of   the   Minister    for\r\n\r\nCommunications.  I  really  cannot  see  how   the\r\n\r\npresent system can be effective. I think what  one\r\n\r\nMember  has just said is quite true, that this  is\r\n\r\none  of the most inherent weaknesses in our entire\r\n\r\nsystem of road traffic management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I fully support this Road Traffic (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.   In  fact,  this  Bill  should  have   been\r\n\r\nintroduced a few years ago. Many innocent  persons\r\n\r\nhave  died or seriously injured by the actions  of\r\n\r\ninconsiderate  drivers  who  drove   their   motor\r\n\r\nvehicles recklessly and dangerously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the pamphlet on the Points\r\n\r\nDemerit  System,  six points  will  be  given  for\r\n\r\nreckless or dangerous driving. I think this is too\r\n\r\nlenient  a punishment for such a serious  offence,\r\n\r\nas  a reckless and dangerous driver could kill  an\r\n\r\ninnocent person. I would request\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State for Communications to  give\r\n\r\nserious  consideration to immediately suspend  the\r\n\r\ndriving  licence of a driver for a period  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths  if  he  is  found guilty of  reckless  and\r\n\r\ndangerous  driving.  This is more  effective  than\r\n\r\ngiving  him six points for the offence,  which  is\r\n\r\ntoo lenient a punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to\r\n\r\nanswer  first in Mandarin to the points raised  by\r\n\r\ntwo Mandarin-speaking Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang mentioned the Points Demerit\r\n\r\nSystem.  According to him, the system of  awarding\r\n\r\npoints  is  too drastic. If you commit  a  traffic\r\n\r\noffence  three times, you would reach the  maximum\r\n\r\nof  12 points, that is, if you get four points for\r\n\r\neach  offence, then after three offences you  will\r\n\r\nreach the maximum of 12 points allowed to you  and\r\n\r\nyour  driving licence will be suspended for up  to\r\n\r\nsix months. In his view, this is too drastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have heard the Member for Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nsaying that this system is not strict enough as we\r\n\r\nshould  consider  the plight of  the  families  of\r\n\r\nvictims  of  such accidents. He has also  given  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  instances  of  negligent  driving   by\r\n\r\nprofessional drivers to support his point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as this system is new, I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  professional  drivers need be  over-concerned\r\n\r\nabout    it.   Whether   the   effects   of    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this system will be  as  bad  as\r\n\r\nwhat  the Member for Sembawang thinks, we will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  know only after some time. He  has  also\r\n\r\nrecommended  that the period of suspension  should\r\n\r\nnot  exceed  one  week. Of  course,  he  is  quite\r\n\r\njustified  in being concerned about the plight  of\r\n\r\nprofessional drivers as, if I am not mistaken,  he\r\n\r\nis  the  adviser to the Taxi Drivers  Association.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think we will have to wait for  a  certain\r\n\r\nperiod to see the full effects of this new Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also brought up the question of the ticketing\r\n\r\nsystem, and added that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers  should not abuse their powers.  I  think\r\n\r\nevery  one  with any conscience - every Government\r\n\r\nofficial,   every   civilian,  every   Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament,   and   every   law-abiding    citizen\r\n\r\n-believes  in  this.  But  what  is  an  abuse  of\r\n\r\nauthority,  or  what  constitutes  an   abuse   of\r\n\r\nauthority? This is rather ambiguous and cannot  be\r\n\r\ndefined clearly. However, if the Member does  come\r\n\r\nacross instances where such abuse has taken place,\r\n\r\nI  shall be pleased to know more about the details\r\n\r\nof  the particular case so that I can try my  best\r\n\r\nto investigate and see what can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned that the Bill\r\n\r\nis  only a means of treating the symptoms  and  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  fundamental solution to the  problem.  The\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill are new, but we know  that\r\n\r\nin  many  other countries similar provisions  have\r\n\r\nalready been effectively implemented. Let us  wait\r\n\r\nfor some time before assessing the effects of this\r\n\r\nBill and come to the conclusion whether or not  it\r\n\r\nis sound or effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned the point about reducing the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  vehicles as the basic and  fundamental\r\n\r\nsolution to the problem. He further mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe  minimum age of drivers should be raised  from\r\n\r\n17  to  21 years. On these two points, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  reduction in the number of vehicles will help\r\n\r\nto  reduce accidents because, in theory at  least,\r\n\r\nif   there  are  fewer  vehicles,  the  number  of\r\n\r\naccidents  should  correspondingly  decrease.  But\r\n\r\nthis  is  not something that we can do immediately\r\n\r\nbecause reducing the number of vehicles may affect\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of many people. The policy of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is very clear. In the last few  months,\r\n\r\nwe have repeatedly announced our policy in respect\r\n\r\nof  this problem. We will try our best to restrict\r\n\r\nthe  number of unnecessary vehicles on our  roads.\r\n\r\nOn  the question of the age of the drivers,  there\r\n\r\nare  several  conflicting points  of  view.  Young\r\n\r\npeople, of course, feel that the age should not be\r\n\r\nraised.  There  are  some  young  people  who  are\r\n\r\nreckless or who are not so careful. But up to now,\r\n\r\nwe  have no concrete and positive evidence to show\r\n\r\nthat drivers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin this age group of 17 and 21 years are accident-prone. We know that young people today learn a lot\r\n\r\nof  skills,  and they learn various skills  at  an\r\n\r\nearly  age. Of course, they would like  to  obtain\r\n\r\nthe skills at an even earlier age. And driving  is\r\n\r\none of the skills they would like to acquire at an\r\n\r\nearly  age.  So for the time being, I cannot  give\r\n\r\nhim  a  very satisfactory answer because  I  think\r\n\r\ntime  is  needed to see the development  of  these\r\n\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may now answer\r\n\r\nthe other Members of Parliament in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the support of the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong.  He  raised the point on the  re-issue  of\r\n\r\ndriving licences. He 3pecifically maintained  that\r\n\r\na  re-test should be given to those whose licences\r\n\r\nhave   been  suspended,  and  not  just   re-issue\r\n\r\nlicences  to  them  on expiry  of  the  suspension\r\n\r\nperiod.  We all know that our driving test centres\r\n\r\nare unable to cope with new drivers right now.  So\r\n\r\nif  we  are  going to implement his suggestion,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  queue will be even longer.  `There  is\r\n\r\nmerit in his suggestion, but it takes some time to\r\n\r\nsee whether it can he worked out administratively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about \"L\" motorcyclists. The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Communications has recently introduced\r\n\r\nadministrative action to ensure that an \"L\" motor-cyclist  should try to pass a riding  test  within\r\n\r\nthree  years or else he has to re-sit the  Highway\r\n\r\nCode test before another \"L\" licence can be issued\r\n\r\nto  him. This is, in fact, one administrative step\r\n\r\nahead  to persuade \"L\" riders to sit for the test.\r\n\r\nThe  large number of these \"L\" motor-cyclists that\r\n\r\nwe see on our roads is partly due to the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  majority of them just do not bother to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  a  test  because the fee for an  \"L\"  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  is  just  twice the fee for  an  ordinary\r\n\r\ndriving licence. But with the introduction of this\r\n\r\nnew ruling, I am sure the number will be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding his comment on Government vehicles, I\r\n\r\ncan only assure him that Government vehicles enjoy\r\n\r\nno privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Serangoon Gardens, I thank him\r\n\r\nfor  his  support of the Bill. He mentioned  about\r\n\r\nthe   positive  measures  instead  of  the  Points\r\n\r\nDemerit  System  which, he says,  is  negative  in\r\n\r\napproach.  Legal action by itself is negative.  It\r\n\r\nis   only  by  educating  our  people,  the   next\r\n\r\ngeneration,  to be better educated, that  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  approach  through education will  be  a  more\r\n\r\npositive one. As for awarding privileges  to  good\r\n\r\ndrivers,   I   doubt  this  could  be  implemented\r\n\r\nadministratively  because  it  will   become   too\r\n\r\ncomplicated an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh has suggested that\r\n\r\njaywalkers  should not be let off so lightly,  and\r\n\r\nhe  commented  that  the  penalties  provided  for\r\n\r\njaywalking  are  not enough.  I  mentioned  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech  that initially the penalties are meant  to\r\n\r\neducate  the jaywalkers, hut if we find that  they\r\n\r\npersist  in jaywalking and their accident rate  is\r\n\r\nstill high, then the existing law has provision to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  penalties. It  is,  therefore,  not\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide heavy penalties to deal  with\r\n\r\nthem  at  this  stage. The existing law  is  quite\r\n\r\nadequate, and because it is something new  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  initially  jay-walkers  should  be  given  a\r\n\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Jalan Kayu's comment that\r\n\r\nthe  law  is made in one Ministry and enforced  by\r\n\r\nanother,  I have listened to it with deep interest\r\n\r\nand I have no comments to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee supports the Bill.\r\n\r\nHe  has  specifically pointed out that the penalty\r\n\r\nof   six  points  for  dangerous  driving  is  too\r\n\r\nlenient.   The  Points  Demerit  System   can   be\r\n\r\nadministratively  changed. If it  is  subsequently\r\n\r\nproved  that six points are not adequate  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  this group of reckless drivers, perhaps they\r\n\r\ncan  he increased. I hope I have answered all  the\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nIn  his reply to my suggestion that those who  are\r\n\r\nsuspended need another test, the Minister of State\r\n\r\nstated  that there are so many people waiting  for\r\n\r\ntests  that  this is not feasible.

By not  giving  a\r\n\r\nfirm  answer, he has given me the impression  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  he  agrees, but for political reasons  he\r\n\r\ndoes not want to offend his colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may follow up on the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu's comments. He has raised  a\r\n\r\nmost  interesting point on the question of traffic\r\n\r\nproblems  and  its  solution, that  is,  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic   Act   comes  under   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications but its implementation falls within\r\n\r\nthe  purview  of  the Traffic Police  which  comes\r\n\r\nunder   the   Ministry  of  Home   Affairs.   This\r\n\r\nunfortunately has been the position  for  quite  a\r\n\r\nlong  time. It is a matter which we have  referred\r\n\r\nto the Management Services Unit of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance to look into especially the reorganisation\r\n\r\nof  the  Registry of Vehicles. After  a  study  of\r\n\r\nabout  eight months, they produced a report  which\r\n\r\nrecommended that an Authority for Inland Transport\r\n\r\nbe  established to bring into it the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles, the Roads Department of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, the Car Parks Division,  as\r\n\r\nwell as the Traffic Police of the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs. That was the suggestion put up if we  are\r\n\r\nto  make  an  effective contribution  towards  the\r\n\r\nresolution of traffic problems as a whole. Arising\r\n\r\nout  of  this, as was stated in the Second Reading\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Minister of State, a Road Transport\r\n\r\nAction Committee was formed in November last  year\r\n\r\ncomprising  five Permanent Secretaries  from  four\r\n\r\nMinistries,  that  is to say,  the  Ministries  of\r\n\r\nNational Development, Communications, Home Affairs\r\n\r\nand two Permanent Secretaries from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance, one from Budget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the other from the Development Division. That\r\n\r\nis  why over the past one year, i.e, from November\r\n\r\nlast  year  until  today, there  has  been  a  co-ordinated  effort  to  resolve  the  problems   of\r\n\r\ntraffic  in  general, and I  think  we  are  going\r\n\r\nplaces  now  with this large, all-powerful,  high-powered co-ordinating committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the present amendments to the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act  were initiated by my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs, the group of officials\r\n\r\nfrom   the   various  Ministries  and  departments\r\n\r\ninvolved  in road traffic had to come together  to\r\n\r\nproduce  these  two  systems, the  Points  Demerit\r\n\r\nSystem as well as the Ticketing System. This is  a\r\n\r\nmeans  towards an end, and we believe  that  these\r\n\r\ntwo  measures will contribute a great deal towards\r\n\r\na  rationalisation  of  our traffic  problems  and\r\n\r\nshould  be able to reduce considerably the  havoc,\r\n\r\nthe  carnage  of human lives that are  being  lost\r\n\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the only problem that is being\r\n\r\ntackled  by  the Road Transport Action  Committee.\r\n\r\nThere  are other measures. In fact, there  are  as\r\n\r\nmany  as  ten measures going on simultaneously  at\r\n\r\nthis  moment. Various traffic management  measures\r\n\r\nare  in  force  or will be introduced  that  would\r\n\r\ncompletely change the pattern of traffic as we see\r\n\r\nit today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Katong's other\r\n\r\nquestion has not been answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. There is also\r\n\r\na valid point raised by the Member for Katong when\r\n\r\nhe  talked of mortal sins and venial sins.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that under the Points Demerit System  points\r\n\r\nare  awarded for very serious offences.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  aim  of  the  Points  Demerit  System  is  to\r\n\r\nidentify  and  remove dangerous drivers  first  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  less dangerous drivers will  be  looked\r\n\r\ninto  later. The idea is that we should first deal\r\n\r\nwith  those  with serious sins. Those with  venial\r\n\r\nsins,  the minor ones, we will come to them  after\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  has  been  fully  implemented.

One such measure was that all\r\n\r\nplanning approvals granted but on which no attempt\r\n\r\nhad been made to get on with the work would be\r\n\r\ncancelled unless there was a firm contract for\r\n\r\nconstruction work between owner and building\r\n\r\ncontractor signed on or before the 10th of\r\n\r\nSeptember last year or the owner/developer had\r\n\r\nsigned binding contracts for the sale of\r\n\r\nresidential properties with purchasers. In order\r\n\r\nto implement the above decision, it was necessary\r\n\r\nto cancel all planning approvals granted before\r\n\r\n10th September, 1973, under section 9 of the\r\n\r\nPlanning Act. These would otherwise be valid for a\r\n\r\nperiod of two years by virtue of subsection (8) of\r\n\r\nsection 9 of the Act. There were, in all, 329\r\n\r\ncases of development affected by this policy.\r\n\r\nPlanning permission for 270 cases have since been\r\n\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to treat as cancelled all\r\n\r\nplanning permission granted before 1st February,\r\n\r\n1960, under section 61 of the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Ordinance, and those granted between\r\n\r\n1st February, 1960, and 12th December, 1965, under\r\n\r\nthe 1959 Planning Ordinance if no work had been\r\n\r\ncarried out by 10th September, 1973.

As part of the plan,  low-cost\r\n\r\nflats  have, therefore, been built so that workers\r\n\r\nmay stay near their places of work. So far, 14,440\r\n\r\nunits have been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with Government's policy to encourage\r\n\r\nhome  ownership, the JTC has been selling some  of\r\n\r\nits  low-cost flats since December, 1969. To-date,\r\n\r\n3,461 units have been sold. It is hoped that  such\r\n\r\nsales   will  encourage  more  workers  to  settle\r\n\r\npermanently  in  Jurong  and  that  there   would,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be  added stability to  the  workforce\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JTC sale of flats has been on terms and\r\n\r\nconditions similar to those applied by the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board,  and  elaborated  in  new\r\n\r\nsections  36  to 47 introduced under clause  7  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  Under  these  terms  and  conditions,\r\n\r\nstrict   conditions  to  prevent  flats  sold   on\r\n\r\ninstalments  from  falling  into  the   hands   of\r\n\r\nspeculators and profiteers have been imposed.

Members may recall that when moving  the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the National Cadet Corps Bill in\r\n\r\nNovember, 1972, it was indicated that steps  would\r\n\r\nbe  taken to update the Police Cadet Corps Act  to\r\n\r\nbring  it in line with the main provisions of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Cadet  Corps Act.  Hence  this  National\r\n\r\nPolice Cadet Corps Bill before this House today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This updating of the Police Cadet Corps Act to\r\n\r\nplace it on the same footing as the National Cadet\r\n\r\nCorps is necessary in the interest of the Corps as\r\n\r\nboth   these  organisations  are  playing  equally\r\n\r\nimportant  roles in imbuing their members  with  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  loyalty  for  the  establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nnational identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the updating of the Police Cadet\r\n\r\nCorps  Act  is  necessary to remove  the  existing\r\n\r\nanomaly  where there appears to be a dual  control\r\n\r\nof  the  organisation  by  both  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation and the Police. The establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nCouncil,  with three nominees of the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Police  as members, one of whom shall  be  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Chairman, will enable the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice  to continue to play an equally significant\r\n\r\nrole  in  the  administration and control  of  the\r\n\r\nCorps  as  has been hitherto the case.
