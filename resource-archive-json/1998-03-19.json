I think BG Yeo's vision of Singapore becoming\r\n\r\nthe  watering  hole  for  Silicon  Valley  experts  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore to hone our expertise for the IT commerce sector is  a\r\n\r\nvery stimulating and intellectually an uplifting one.  I applaud\r\n\r\nthat  vision.   But if we could also visualise  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nnation   where   people  on  wheelchairs  who   are   physically\r\n\r\nhandicapped but mentally brilliant, like Dr William Tan, or  not\r\n\r\ntoo  bright but still able, can mix freely and openly over a jug\r\n\r\nof  beer  with  other Singaporeans without social stigma,  in  a\r\n\r\nbarrier-free physical environment, then I say we are a  city  of\r\n\r\ngraciousness.   Because it is a city with intellect,  enterprise\r\n\r\nand humanity prevailing side by side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this vision of a city as a driving value for my cut\r\n\r\ntoday,  I  would  like  to  raise the following  issues  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what progress has been made on the 1993 Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil's   recommendations,  and  the  number   of   facilities\r\n\r\nidentified for the needs of the disabled?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, do we have a central registry of disabled children\r\n\r\nto  enable us to reach out to kids hidden away by parents?  What\r\n\r\nfurther  resources and support can be committed by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto help disabled children integrate in the mainstream education?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, could the Minister also reinforce our plea to MOE to\r\n\r\npersuade  neighbourhood  school principals  to  accept  disabled\r\n\r\nchildren  and  to  create  a  barrier-free  school  environment,\r\n\r\nfocusing on physical accessibility to laboratories, canteens and\r\n\r\nlibraries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, another concern is the physical and sexual abuse of\r\n\r\ndisabled  children,  especially the  girls.   Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\ninform  us  of  past  records of such  abuses  and  whether  the\r\n\r\namendment  to the Women's Charter is an enabling legislation  to\r\n\r\nprotect them and prevent such abuses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, PWD, some years ago, assured MCD that it would\r\n\r\ncreate  a  disabled-friendly  environment  through  its  walkway\r\n\r\nupgrading  projects, to increase physical accessibility  of  the\r\n\r\ndisabled.   Can  the Minister confirm that this  is  now  a  HDB\r\n\r\npolicy  for all constituencies?  At this point, I would like  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  plea  to  all  MPs in this House to  take  this  matter\r\n\r\nseriously.   The  disabled  wish  for  a  barrier-free  physical\r\n\r\nenvironment, so that they can manoeuvre their way  around  in  a\r\n\r\nwheelchair   without  assistance.   Gradient  of   kerbs,   road\r\n\r\ncrossings,  ramps  are a few suggestions  which  can  be  easily\r\n\r\ndesigned.   These  user-friendly features  are  helpful  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially young mothers with infant  push-carts.\r\n\r\nThey do not cost a lot.  I was heartened to hear from Mr Charles\r\n\r\nChong, MP for Pasir Ris, and I applaud his initiative, that  his\r\n\r\nTown Council built a ramp for a handicapped girl to help her get\r\n\r\nto  the  car park to go to school every day.  These are  simple,\r\n\r\nconcrete  but  significant measures which MPs can do  for  their\r\n\r\nconstituents to spread the spirit of care and share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, could the Minister reinforce our plea to HDB to\r\n\r\nestablish a policy whereby ground floor units of flats  or  lift\r\n\r\ndecks  can  be  allocated to families with disabled  persons  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate their access and mobility?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCD, NCSS and about 56 voluntary welfare organisations\r\n\r\nhave  done  a  lot  in  the caring of the disabled  by  offering\r\n\r\nfunding  for basic facilities, training and service development.\r\n\r\nI  see  the  need  now  to lift our eyes to  the  community  for\r\n\r\nassistance.  I see two areas of focus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first focus is to enhance employment opportunities for\r\n\r\ndisabled  persons.   We have talked about this  during  the  MOM\r\n\r\ndebate.  I am pleased to know that NCSS will be carrying  out  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  on employment problems of the disabled, to identify  the\r\n\r\nfactors  securing and retaining employment for the disabled  and\r\n\r\nthe  views of employers regarding their employment.  This survey\r\n\r\nwill  help  us  develop  a strategic plan to improve  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities but, meanwhile, I hope the CDC could channel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqueries  and  job  recommendations through  its  Helpline.   The\r\n\r\npublic  sector  could take the lead by employing  more  disabled\r\n\r\npersons, so as to encourage more employers in the private sector\r\n\r\nto  do  the same.  But as Minister Dr Lee Boon Yang said  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  the  challenge is in changing  the  mindset  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers.   It  looks  like we will need a  national  awareness\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second focus is to encourage VWOs to develop informal\r\n\r\nnetworks, eg, a disabled children's circle, youth circle  or  an\r\n\r\nelderly  circle within neighbourhoods to enhance mutual  support\r\n\r\nas well as strengthen inter-agency help networks through sharing\r\n\r\nof services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a call again to all Members of\r\n\r\nParliament to support the programmes of MCD, CDC, NCSS and  VWOs\r\n\r\nat each of their constituencies.  MCD, given its limited budget,\r\n\r\nhas accomplished many targets in the areas of service provision.\r\n\r\nWe  now have to generate community-based initiatives by focusing\r\n\r\non  enablement  and participation approaches to help  vulnerable\r\n\r\ngroups reach an optimal level of independent functioning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Abdullah Tarmugi has broad shoulders to take on\r\n\r\nthis  huge task of community development, but the responsibility\r\n\r\nof community building requires the collaboration of everyone.  I\r\n\r\nurge the hon. Members of Parliament in this House to support his\r\n\r\nmission,  participate and help to generate an enduring reservoir\r\n\r\nof  resources  and  helping networks for community  bonding.   I\r\n\r\npropose  that  they visit VWOs, find out the problems  faced  by\r\n\r\ntheir  constituents,  and  serve as a  bridge  to  convey  their\r\n\r\nproblems  to  the respective Government bodies.  The  experience\r\n\r\nwill only enhance MP-constituent relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in 1995, during\r\n\r\nthe  Committee of Supply debate, I proposed a national volunteer\r\n\r\nservices scheme for women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to resurface that proposal today. I believe,\r\n\r\nthat as Singapore matures, we need to pay more attention to  the\r\n\r\nissue of social cohesion.  If we are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncareful,  stratification  of  our society  along  socio-economic\r\n\r\nlines could occur.  Over time, the poor will become better  off,\r\n\r\nwhile the rich  could become even richer so that the gap between\r\n\r\nthe  haves  and  the  have-nots could widen, particularly  where\r\n\r\nproperty  and other assets are concerned.   In other  words,  we\r\n\r\nneed to make an effort to develop social bonding at the national\r\n\r\nlevel, particularly across socio-economic lines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the greatest institutions of social bonding that we\r\n\r\nhave  in Singapore today is national service.  During their  two\r\n\r\nand  a  half years, men of diverse social backgrounds,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nHokkien   speaking,  or  shall I say  Hokkien  swearing  primary\r\n\r\neducated  man, together with the Cambridge-trained  son  of  the\r\n\r\nrich tycoon are thrown together.  They train together.  They eat\r\n\r\ntogether.   They  suffer together.  They  relax  together.   And\r\n\r\nbecause  of  these  ties, bonds of friendship are  forged  which\r\n\r\ntranscend  socio-economic status.  As a result, an understanding\r\n\r\nand   tolerance   of  others  from  entirely  different   social\r\n\r\nbackgrounds  is developed, which will stand them in  good  stead\r\n\r\nthroughout their lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this form of social cohesion is absent for women.\r\n\r\nSchools  offer  some  opportunity but this  is  limited.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, a Chinese girl may grow up never having been to the home\r\n\r\nof  a  Malay friend and vice versa.  A girl living in a district\r\n\r\n11  bungalow  may never understand the concerns and  mindset  of\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  grew  up in a rented 3-room HDB  flat.   There  is\r\n\r\nsimply no opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Government to seriously consider\r\n\r\na national cohesion scheme for women.  The objectives are clear.\r\n\r\nFirst,  it  is  to develop social  bonding among  women  at  the\r\n\r\nnational  level and, second, in developing that social  bonding,\r\n\r\nit  will  also foster a greater sense of community, of  national\r\n\r\nidentity, of what it means to be Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best time for such a scheme to occur is after `A'\r\n\r\nlevels  where there is a window of about six months  before  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  term begins.  The scheme could involve  a  range  of\r\n\r\nduties, including social work, health care and administrative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport   services.   It  should  include  a  physical  training\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  develop physical fitness, much like  the  Outward\r\n\r\nBound School.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I believe that social cohesion and social\r\n\r\nbonding  should not just be for men alone, simply  because  they\r\n\r\nhave  national service and women are excluded.  A scheme  should\r\n\r\nbe  started for women.  The beneficial effects of such a  scheme\r\n\r\nare  of strategic importance for Singapore.  I also believe that\r\n\r\nin  this  day  and  age, this is the time to  implement  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme.  It is a scheme for which the time has come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on quality of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to go through the corporate brochures or annual\r\n\r\nreports of various Ministries and statutory boards, we will find\r\n\r\nthat  most  of them have impressive mission statements,  visions\r\n\r\nand  goals  for  their respective organisations, many  of  which\r\n\r\nstrive to develop Singapore into a world-class city, a city that\r\n\r\noffers  diversity  and choice, a city with  a  rich  variety  of\r\n\r\nenvironment, a city of character and grace, and a  city  with  a\r\n\r\nrich quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all these mission statements reflect what the\r\n\r\nrespective Ministries or statutory boards would like to  achieve\r\n\r\nin  the  next  century, many fail to reflect  what  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nreally  want  in life.  While it is easy to define a world-class\r\n\r\ncity,  it is difficult to define quality of life.  Thus, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to urge the Ministry to develop a set of social indicators\r\n\r\nto measure our quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent Straits Times report on 2nd June 1997 highlighted\r\n\r\nthat, \"Life has become better for Singaporeans in the five years\r\n\r\nbetween   1990  and  1995.   Singaporeans  are  richer,  better-educated, live in bigger homes and hold better jobs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another survey which was conducted by Asiaweek in October\r\n\r\n1996,  ranked Singapore's standard of living second, as compared\r\n\r\nto  40  other  cities  in Asia.  But, are these  measures  truly\r\n\r\nreflective of the quality of life of Singaporeans?  I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink so.  If you were to conduct house visits to a block of  3- or  4-room HDB flats, you will receive this common feedback from\r\n\r\nthe  residents, \"Living in Singapore is very good, but  life  is\r\n\r\nvery tough.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some developed countries, the standard of living is\r\n\r\nimproving, but the quality of life does not necessarily  improve\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time.  Are people happier, more  fulfilled,  more\r\n\r\ncreative,  more  able  to develop their  potential?   Are  their\r\n\r\nrelationships at work and leisure as satisfying?  Do  they  find\r\n\r\ntheir neighbourhood and environment as pleasant to live in?   Is\r\n\r\nthere  a supportive network of families, friends, and neighbours\r\n\r\nto help them in their old age or childcare?  All these questions\r\n\r\nmust  be  properly addressed before we embark on  our  ambitious\r\n\r\nplans to develop Singapore into a world-class city.  I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  could  update  the House on the  quality  of  life  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to urge the Ministry to consider\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a Quality of Life index for Singaporeans.   Economic\r\n\r\nindicators are used to track the performance of the economy.  We\r\n\r\nalso  need  Quality of Life indicators to monitor the fulfilment\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans' needs and aspirations in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, it is commonly\r\n\r\nacknowledged that there is too much stress in Singapore and,  as\r\n\r\nDr  Teo has eloquently put it, the quality of life is not as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be.   We are too strung-up.  We are too serious  minded.\r\n\r\nAs  the Minister for Information and the Arts said in the debate\r\n\r\nin  this House a few days ago, quoting Mr Sim Wong Hoo, our best\r\n\r\nand most famous entrepreneur, there is not much of a fun element\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   Even a pressure cooker needs safety  valves  or\r\n\r\nelse  the pot will explode and then whatever you are cooking  is\r\n\r\nuseless and wasted.  I do believe, Sir, that the pressure cooker\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  in  in Singapore needs safety valves.   There  is\r\n\r\nanecdotal evidence that more and more children, for example, are\r\n\r\ngoing for counselling and the mental health of our nation is  at\r\n\r\nstake.  The talents that we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnurturing could one day explode and then be wasted.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow if there are figures, but if there are, I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwould reveal them to the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my purpose today is not just a call to the Minister to\r\n\r\ndo something about this, but also a call to all Singaporeans, my\r\n\r\nfellow  Singaporeans, to remember to work hard  and  play  hard.\r\n\r\nThis  is a call to all Singaporeans to keep a healthy mind in  a\r\n\r\nhealthy body.  Being competitive is fine because we are a  small\r\n\r\nnation that survives on our wits, but being a small nation  that\r\n\r\nis  competitive does not mean that we have to spend every single\r\n\r\nmoment making money and forget about our health and forget about\r\n\r\nour  families  and  having  fun with them.   Being  competitive,\r\n\r\nwithout being healthy, is thus foolish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call is also to the Singapore Government to promote\r\n\r\nsports (not only for the masses, we have been doing that a  lot)\r\n\r\nand I think it is time we move on to a higher level, and that is\r\n\r\nwe  should also be promoting sports for professional talents  to\r\n\r\ngrow, not just in soccer but in everything else.  This may  seem\r\n\r\nlike  benefiting only a small group of people but as we can  see\r\n\r\nfrom  other  nations, every time somebody wins a  medal  in  the\r\n\r\nOlympics, the whole nation wins and cheers.  Every time there is\r\n\r\na  medal  won in the World Cup, not only in soccer, but  in  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of things, everyone stands up and cheers.  So I think  it\r\n\r\nis important now for us to start looking for programmes to groom\r\n\r\nprofessional   talents  and  be  serious  about   this   because\r\n\r\nprofessional  talents and champions also serve this  purpose  of\r\n\r\nbonding  the  nation and the community together, and  giving  us\r\n\r\nall,   you  might  say,  a  vicarious  national  pride  in  this\r\n\r\nachievement.     We   need   bigger   grants   for    grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  for example, to organise family oriented  sports\r\n\r\nand  games and recreational activities and be more proactive  in\r\n\r\nstarting some of these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call is also to the Government to promote mental health\r\n\r\nby building facilities that would give fun, inexpensive fun, for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   It is nice to build big resorts or  big  tourist\r\n\r\nspots that can also be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nused  by  locals, but these are expensive and generally  if  you\r\n\r\nlook  at the entrance fees of $15-$16, nobody goes.  If you look\r\n\r\nat  the  Lianhe Zaobao celebrations, they opened up Tang Dynasty\r\n\r\nCity  for a dollar and crowds came.  Perhaps we do not  have  to\r\n\r\ncharge  a dollar, maybe $3 or $5, and I think much more response\r\n\r\nwill be there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to create facilities for Singaporeans to play,\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities that do not cost the earth, perhaps such\r\n\r\nas adventure campsites.  I think we have got adventure campsites\r\n\r\nthat were planned but are now suffering from the regional crisis\r\n\r\nbecause these things have to be put on the shelf as they are not\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  be necessities.  Sir, I think that is short-sighted.\r\n\r\nThese  are  necessities  - fishing sites,  perhaps  even  kelong\r\n\r\nsites.    I   think  PPD  and  some  other  agencies  discourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  from  going up to kelongs to just  spend  a  night\r\n\r\nthere, or fish and do things like that.  I think we should allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  do so.  We should allow for more outdoor accommodation\r\n\r\nfor  fun  activities, more parks like Sungei Buloh and  Labrador\r\n\r\nand  we  should leave Pulau Ubin alone so that it is  unburdened\r\n\r\nwith all our improvements.  There is value in being able to just\r\n\r\nrun  around  in  the wild, so to speak.  Sir,  if  we  leave  it\r\n\r\nuntouched, it also helps our Singaporeans to be reminded of  the\r\n\r\ntimes  that  we  have gone through, that once  upon  a  time  in\r\n\r\nSingapore it was like that.  It would give them some lessons  in\r\n\r\nhow  far we have come and how much we should appreciate the work\r\n\r\nthat we have put in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps this can be modified a little. We might be\r\n\r\nable to preserve one or two villages in there as pristine as  we\r\n\r\ncan.   Leave it there, the Malay village or the Chinese village,\r\n\r\nso that the people would remember how we lived once upon a time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for this model village we can put people there.  Like in\r\n\r\nother  countries, for example, Plymouth, in Massachusetts,  they\r\n\r\nhave  got a village there as if it is still living in the 1600s.\r\n\r\nThey  have got people moving around, sowing, planting,  milling,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  Maybe we can do a model village like that just  to\r\n\r\nremind Singaporeans of where we were and how far we have come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this call is also to the Government - and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance is happily here - for the Minister for  Finance  to\r\n\r\nallocate   some  more  funds  to  the  Minister  for   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  so that we can have funds to educate and  publicise\r\n\r\nthese things that Singaporeans can do to help them to learn  and\r\n\r\nthis is a learned thing  to learn the art of relaxation and  the\r\n\r\nproper use of leisure time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nadopts  a many helping hands approach in the provision of social\r\n\r\nservice.   This approach harnesses the collaborative efforts  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  and non-government  organisations  in  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of social welfare and community support services  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the less fortunate in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although a wide range of services has been put in\r\n\r\nplace  by  various  organisations, the general  public  or  even\r\n\r\nsocial service agencies may not be aware of the availability  of\r\n\r\nthe full range of services.  MCD could perhaps identify specific\r\n\r\ntarget  groups  which would be most likely to need  such  social\r\n\r\nservice.   I believe the group that needs this service most  are\r\n\r\nusually  low  income families staying in the  1-room  or  2-room\r\n\r\nrental  units.  I understand there are about 100,000  households\r\n\r\nin  this  category.   MCD, together with CDC  volunteers,  could\r\n\r\ntarget  this  group  for an extensive outreach  programme.   CDC\r\n\r\nvolunteers could first be trained to understand the entire scope\r\n\r\nof   social  services  available.   The  volunteers   in   their\r\n\r\nencounters  with these families would then be able  to  explain,\r\n\r\nand  also assist those who need such service, to apply for  them\r\n\r\nor help to refer them to the relevant authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what measures will be taken to provide\r\n\r\ngreater  publicity  on  the different types  of  social  service\r\n\r\navailable so as to reach a wider audience?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I feel we should ask\r\n\r\nourselves one basic question.  Are we giving enough help to  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  sector?  I am sure Members would be  able  to  assess\r\n\r\nthis.  They have been involved in the various voluntary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsectors   and  encouraged  people  to  participate  in   various\r\n\r\nvoluntary activities.  Sir, my own assessment is that,  yes,  we\r\n\r\nhave  given  some help to a certain extent.  Moral  support  and\r\n\r\nencouragement, plenty.  You and I can give all this to the  many\r\n\r\norganisations.  But this is insufficient.  Just  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nhearts and cajole people is a good thing, but it is insufficient\r\n\r\nbecause  a lot of efforts go into the raising of funds,  to  run\r\n\r\nprojects  and  to  translate  ideas, interests,  concerns,  into\r\n\r\nconcrete programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you assess the financial grants given to voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations,  I  would  say that some  are  given,  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nlittle.  Let me tell you what has been provided to the voluntary\r\n\r\nsector.   First,  you  have  the  matching  grants  for  various\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   It  is  up  to 50% for selected  programmes.   The\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisation has to raise the rest.   It  is  a  good\r\n\r\nthing, but how much can you raise because a lot of organisations\r\n\r\nare  competing out there for funds, including the CDCs today who\r\n\r\nare  also  in  the scene competing to raise funds  from  various\r\n\r\npeople.   And you and I are being cajoled all the time.   It  is\r\n\r\ngood  if  we  can help.  But I think at some point, many  of  us\r\n\r\ncould  suffer  from compassion fatigue.  But,  nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nshould do something for the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For capital grant, I think there is good mileage because\r\n\r\norganisations get up to 95%, but these are for a few  buildings,\r\n\r\nand   new  facilities  and  other  developments.   This  is   an\r\n\r\ninteresting  development and I must say that  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\ngiven  support  in  this  aspect.  For  many  of  the  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations, their facilities need to be upgraded  and  I  see\r\n\r\nthat  some  of the facilities are really down to the  pits.   So\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  to  do is to see what can be done  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nproviding grants for them to upgrade their facilities.  I assert\r\n\r\nthat more could be done in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that moral support alone is insufficient. I\r\n\r\ncan   understand  the  Minister's  predicament.   He  has   been\r\n\r\npersuading the Ministry of Finance, year in and year out, to get\r\n\r\nmore  funds  and  since the Minister for Finance  is  here  this\r\n\r\nafternoon, I am glad he is here, I see that it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  important that he be persuaded to support community building\r\n\r\ncause and to note that the funds that he will be releasing is in\r\n\r\nterms  of investment for the social infrastructure.  It  is  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  we  are  looking at, ie,  community  building  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  cohesion.  We want to prevent social  divide  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   If the community is divided, how could  we  harness\r\n\r\nthem  to be productive people?  Sir, almost every sector of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  is  important to us.  Whether they are  the  able  or\r\n\r\ndisabled, I feel it is important for us to find ways to  support\r\n\r\nthem.   And I hope that next year the Minister for Finance would\r\n\r\nbe  better  persuaded  to release more  funds.   I  am  sure  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues would agree with these suggestions and persuasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister would consider this matter\r\n\r\nseriously.   And  I  hope  he is not suffering  from  compassion\r\n\r\nfatigue  but  able to see what he can do to boost the  voluntary\r\n\r\nsector as well as the Ministry of Community Development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasingly voluntary organisations are also\r\n\r\nencouraged  to provide more and more services.  We ask  them  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  programmes.  We persuade them with all good  intentions\r\n\r\nand  purposes.  Many of them want to do good.  But  how  can  we\r\n\r\nhelp them to have a better mileage, in terms of contributing  to\r\n\r\nthe  community?  What more than by providing them adequate funds\r\n\r\nto  enable  them  to achieve the missions and objectives  to  do\r\n\r\npublic good.  This is an area where we should examine seriously,\r\n\r\nin terms of what support we can give them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these organisations are affected by spending a\r\n\r\nlot  of time in raising funds.  I suppose more than 70% of their\r\n\r\ntime  is  spent  in  raising funds and 20% in terms  of  service\r\n\r\ndelivery, thinking about what and how they can plan ahead.  So I\r\n\r\nhope we can relieve them of this fund-raising burden.  It is not\r\n\r\neasy  to raise funds today, because many of us are all the  time\r\n\r\napproached  by many organisations, persuading us to do  what  is\r\n\r\npossible,  and many of them are very supportive.   I  hope  that\r\n\r\npeople will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue to do so, but there is a threshold to how much  we  can\r\n\r\ndo.   And the heart of the matter is that volunteers and  others\r\n\r\ncan  do  things up to a point.  But Government must  demonstrate\r\n\r\nits  capacity to do more and should be encouraged to do a little\r\n\r\nmore so that it could inspire more volunteers and people in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  contribute to this common good.   To  reduce  the\r\n\r\nproblem  and  burden of fund-raising, it is  necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to persuade the Ministry of Finance to increase  grants\r\n\r\nfor the voluntary sector.  I would like to persuade the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance to see whether the CDC funding formula of $3 to  $1\r\n\r\ncould  be  applied  to the voluntary sector, ie,  for  every  $1\r\n\r\nraised,  the Government will give $3.  If it is matched by  that\r\n\r\nformula, then I think the voluntary sector would be able  to  do\r\n\r\nmore  and  the community would be able to benefit in the  longer\r\n\r\nterm.   We  will  be  able to reduce the social  divide  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity   and  people  will  participate  fully  in  community\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the funding formula and support for the\r\n\r\nvoluntary sector could be reviewed and the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nwould  be  able  to  think of ways in  which  he  can  urge  and\r\n\r\nencourage people to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I would like to know from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  what  measures have been  taken  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of the social worker sector.  Based on a  number\r\n\r\nof  conversations I had with various people following my  maiden\r\n\r\nspeech  in  November last year, I have observed  some  uncertain\r\n\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fear that by recognising the professionals\r\n\r\nthrough accreditation measures, we may risk losing thousands  of\r\n\r\nneeded  good-hearted volunteers who may now \"disqualify\".   That\r\n\r\nis  not  so.   In fact, the feedback is we are losing volunteers\r\n\r\nbecause  of  unclear  role  expectations,  low  professionalism,\r\n\r\nabsence  of  training  and self-growth  opportunities  and  weak\r\n\r\nvolunteer  development  programmes.   Moreover,  volunteers  can\r\n\r\nstill  be  accredited by experience and performance accordingly.\r\n\r\nThey can also take up course modules in their work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperience  and  become  progressively professionalised,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak.  So they will not be excluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the professionals, for the sake of\r\n\r\nprotecting  public  interest, they feel  strongly  the  need  to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate the volunteers and professionals by skills so that\r\n\r\nthe  qualified  and  certified social  work  professionals  will\r\n\r\nhandle  therapy related work and the social work  volunteers  or\r\n\r\nnon-accredited   staff   can   be   trained   to   offer   other\r\n\r\nadministrative,   management  and  non-clinical   client-related\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confusion of the word \"social worker\" which has been\r\n\r\nused  very loosely in the community and by the media because  it\r\n\r\nis  referred interchangeably to everybody - professionals,  non-accredited staff and volunteers in the field.  They assume  that\r\n\r\nsocial workers are primarily volunteers.  Sometimes legitimately\r\n\r\nso  because  a  social work professional can be a volunteer.   A\r\n\r\nvolunteer in the social work sector, on the other hand, may  not\r\n\r\nhave  professional qualifications.  And a staff not  trained  at\r\n\r\nall  in  the social work discipline, who is managing a  VWO,  is\r\n\r\nalso  seen  as  a  social  worker.   Everyone,  irrespective  of\r\n\r\nqualifications  and  skills, as long as she contributes  in  the\r\n\r\nsocial service sector becomes commonly known as a social worker.\r\n\r\nThat is the root of the confusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight to Members of the House that they\r\n\r\nare different in their areas of focus, the kind of training they\r\n\r\nbring to the field and the sort of professional outcome and work\r\n\r\nperformance we expect from their participation.  We must develop\r\n\r\na  system  of job functions and skills levels.  Once clear  work\r\n\r\nroles  are established and their contributions are organised  in\r\n\r\ncomplementary  terms,  the closer we are towards  developing  an\r\n\r\naction  model of cooperation for enhancing performance standards\r\n\r\nin that sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will continue his effort in pursuing\r\n\r\nthe need to professionalise the social service sector and accord\r\n\r\ndue  recognition  by  accreditation, rank  and  remuneration  of\r\n\r\nsocial workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another matter, Sir, there were special requests from\r\n\r\nnumerous  VWOs  whether we could give direct service  volunteers\r\n\r\nsome  incentives  to influence a minimum standard  of  services.\r\n\r\nSixty-one agencies, about 82% in a survey of 75 VWOs last  year,\r\n\r\nconducted  by  NCSS,  expressed  problems  in  sustainment   and\r\n\r\ndeployment  of volunteers.  Organisations which focus  on  their\r\n\r\nservice  delivery  standards through  training  are  finding  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  retain their volunteers.   I  was  told  that  an\r\n\r\noccasional praise, a door gift, lucky draw prizes, a certificate\r\n\r\nor  inspirational  talks and stories are no longer  adequate  to\r\n\r\nmotivate these thousands of people to give up their leisure  and\r\n\r\ntake  up  the  burden of fulfilling someone  else's  need  on  a\r\n\r\nregular basis.  On top of this, like Dr Vasoo says, these people\r\n\r\nare asked to look for funds to perpetuate their own sacrifice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 12,500 lonely elderly poor in Singapore;\r\n\r\nthe  number is going to grow to 17,500 by the year 2030.  Unless\r\n\r\nsuch  people  are befriended for psycho-emotional support,  kept\r\n\r\nclean  and  fed  by  volunteers or full-time staff,  they  would\r\n\r\nbecome  early  candidates for nursing homes.  It was  calculated\r\n\r\nfor  me that it costs the community less than $50 per month  for\r\n\r\neach  of  these  elderly to be supported by  volunteers.   In  a\r\n\r\nnursing home it would cost $1,000 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need an average of 2,000 volunteers to assist direct\r\n\r\nservice  VWOs  to care for the chronic sick, the  disabled,  the\r\n\r\nyoung  and the abandoned individuals.  The social burden on  the\r\n\r\nstate  will  increase.   We  need to look  deep  into  community\r\n\r\nresources   by   mobilising  and  deploying  the  thousands   of\r\n\r\nhomemakers  and  retirees  for action.   By  giving  them  basic\r\n\r\ntraining  in care programmes, they form a significant  community\r\n\r\nof  reservist  volunteers whom we should bestow some  degree  of\r\n\r\nprestige and privilege.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two views about the use of material\r\n\r\nincentives.   One which urges us to accept the  reality  of  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary movement and offer material incentives to attract  and\r\n\r\nretain volunteers.  The second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview  sees  the use of material incentives as a wrong spirit  to\r\n\r\npromote  in  voluntarism.  Moreover, by  having  the  Government\r\n\r\nstepping  in  to  do  this, a whole lot of requests  from  other\r\n\r\nquarters  will  follow.   What  limits  and  on  whom  does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  impose?   And  how much is  enough  as  benefits  to\r\n\r\nvolunteers, anyway?  So although I support Dr Vasoo's  call  for\r\n\r\nmore support for the volunteers, I think this is a complex issue\r\n\r\nthat we need to handle cautiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle view sees the voluntary movement being organised\r\n\r\nand  incentivised at the NGO level, but there is then an overall\r\n\r\nneed  to  critically  examine if the  resources  and  management\r\n\r\ncapabilities  of  NGOs  can effect such  an  outcome.   We  need\r\n\r\nadvocates and leaders in the social service sector who  are  not\r\n\r\ncare-givers,  therapists or social work professionals,  but  are\r\n\r\ngood  managers  with a helicopter view for developing  community\r\n\r\ninitiated programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some strategic planning and visioning is urgently\r\n\r\nneeded  to  promote voluntarism as a philosophy and a  movement.\r\n\r\nNCSS is working hard at this, but the Government must step in to\r\n\r\nsupport with resources and public education programmes.  If not,\r\n\r\nthe  State  will only be saddled with increasing  social  burden\r\n\r\ncosts  and  a desperate lot of Singaporeans with no  one  taking\r\n\r\ncare of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek the Minister's direction and leadership on this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, today in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nplanning and delivery of community and social services occurs at\r\n\r\nthree levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is at the national level where the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development studies overall trends, ascertains  needs\r\n\r\nand plans and implements programmes nationwide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is at the district level. With the advent of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  Councils last  year,  we  now  have  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  of  local  governments to  cater  to  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nresidents at the CDC district level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have the community groups and volunteer welfare\r\n\r\norganisations.   These organisations target specific  groups  or\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods in order to serve the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clearly, there is a need for coordination and\r\n\r\ncooperation across these three tiers.  And it already occurs  to\r\n\r\nsome extent.  MCD has enlisted the support of many helping hands\r\n\r\nby  working  closely with the VWOs.  CDCs are  doing  the  same,\r\n\r\nparticularly  with volunteer organisations in  their  respective\r\n\r\ndistricts.   However,  it is the third axis,  that  between  the\r\n\r\nMinistry and the newly established CDCs that is perhaps  not  as\r\n\r\nstrong as it ought to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the provision of Before-and-After-School\r\n\r\nCare services.  MCD has a plan to roll out BASCs islandwide.  It\r\n\r\nthen  invites  VWOs to indicate their interest in running  these\r\n\r\ncentres.  Most, if not all, the CDCs have similar plans to offer\r\n\r\nBASC  services.   They too are approaching VWOs to  collaborate.\r\n\r\nIt  seems  to  me  that much duplication can be avoided  if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  shares its long term master plan for  BASCs  with  the\r\n\r\nCDCs.  The implementation can then be a joint effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Ministry should not just share but also jointly\r\n\r\ndevelop these master plans with the CDCs and possibly the  VWOs.\r\n\r\nMCD  would  have the macro perspective of overall trends.   CDCs\r\n\r\nwould   bring   the  micro  perspective  of  local   needs   and\r\n\r\nconstraints.  Together, MCD and CDC can identify VWOs  with  the\r\n\r\nexpertise  and interest for specific projects and  support  them\r\n\r\nwith  resources.  In this way, each party is able to  add  value\r\n\r\naccording to their strengths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach applies not just to BASCs but also to other\r\n\r\nservices  aimed  at  the  aged,  the  disabled  and  the  young.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  the many helping hands must work in concert  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to  reap the greatest benefit for our community.  I  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, like to ask the Minister what plans there are to step\r\n\r\nup  cooperation  and  coordination with CDCs  and  VWOs  in  the\r\n\r\nplanning and implementation of the community service programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah\r\n\r\nTarmugi):   Sir, I thought I should stop the debate here  for  a\r\n\r\nwhile  to  reply to some of the questions.  I am  not  too  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  I  can  finish  answering  everyone  by  the  time  the\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\" for my Ministry comes into effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we were concentrating on the aged, but today\r\n\r\napparently  we have shifted to the other side of  the  fence  by\r\n\r\ngoing   to   the  children.   We  have  questions  on   juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency, child abuse, and child care centres.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  start  with  Dr  Vasoo's  questions  yesterday  on  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency and also Mr Shriniwas Rai's and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim's.\r\n\r\nThese three gentlemen raised some questions and concerns on  the\r\n\r\nissue of juvenile delinquency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of juvenile delinquency is a very complex\r\n\r\none.   There  is till now no single, quick fix solution  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of juvenile delinquency in any community.  And  in  any\r\n\r\ncommunity,  no matter at which stage of development  it  is  in,\r\n\r\nthere is the problem of juvenile delinquency.  The best approach\r\n\r\nis a multi-disciplinary and multi-pronged one which involves the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  the Government, the VWOs and, most importantly,  the\r\n\r\nparents.   So  we involve the schools, social service  agencies,\r\n\r\nthe  Police,  the community, teachers, preachers,  friends  and,\r\n\r\nmost  importantly, as I said, the parents.  At the local  level,\r\n\r\nwe  already have a network involving the different agencies.  At\r\n\r\nthe  national level, I am not too sure whether Members are aware\r\n\r\nthat   there   is  an  Inter-Ministry  Committee   on   Juvenile\r\n\r\nDelinquency  chaired by the Minister of State for Home  Affairs.\r\n\r\nThis  Committee looks into all problems of juvenile  delinquency\r\n\r\nwhich  are  brought up by the various Ministries and coordinates\r\n\r\nthe efforts of the various Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two approaches which the Government takes on\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquency.  One, is the preventive  and  development\r\n\r\nprogrammes   approach,   and,   two,   the   reinforcement   and\r\n\r\nrehabilitative  programmes approach.   In  terms  of  preventive\r\n\r\nprogrammes, we have an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintensive public education programme to make people aware of the\r\n\r\ndangers of juvenile delinquency and also how to prevent juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency from happening.  We have linking of schools with MCD\r\n\r\nand social service agencies.  We have in schools a checklist for\r\n\r\nteachers  and also for VWOs where they can identify children  or\r\n\r\nstudents who are at risk and would need help so that schools can\r\n\r\nrefer  them  to  FSCs  or  professional  social  workers  to  be\r\n\r\ncounselled.   They can be helped.  Then of course there  is  the\r\n\r\nBefore-and-After-School programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of enforcement and rehabilitation programmes, we\r\n\r\nhave  the  Guidance  Programme for  Police  Caution  Cases,  the\r\n\r\nNational  Youth  Council's Streetwise programme  and  networking\r\n\r\nbetween  MCD and social service agencies to provide counselling,\r\n\r\nsupport and supervision for juvenile delinquents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob asked how do we keep our children and teenagers\r\n\r\noccupied   so   as  to  prevent  them  from  becoming   juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents.   As you know, there are many programmes  organised\r\n\r\nby  the People's Association Youth Movement, the National  Youth\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and  the social service agencies to keep the  children\r\n\r\noccupied.  Even the BASCs will keep them occupied to ensure that\r\n\r\nthey  keep themselves away from bad peer influence.  And we will\r\n\r\nbe  looking  into  more  ways  to  see  how  children  could  be\r\n\r\ndistracted  from  bad peer influence into activities  which  are\r\n\r\nwholesome and useful for them when they grow up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one interesting point which Dr Vasoo and Mr Rai\r\n\r\nbrought  up,  and that is, empowering schools to  send  children\r\n\r\nbeyond  parental  control  (BPC)  cases  to  the  Homes.   I  am\r\n\r\nreluctant to support this and I would not want to advocate  this\r\n\r\nproposal.   Let me explain.  If we do this, we will  run  across\r\n\r\nproblems  with differing standards of assessment by teachers  or\r\n\r\nprincipals.   Some  principals may be more than  happy  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  students direct to the Homes.  But some other  principals\r\n\r\nor  teachers may have more stringent standards; in other  words,\r\n\r\nthey will not want to send them to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Homes.  We may have very differing standards and we may also\r\n\r\nencourage  schools to be less stringent in trying to help  their\r\n\r\nstudents  because it is an easy avenue for them to  get  rid  of\r\n\r\nproblem students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that it is not fair for us to\r\n\r\nplace this very heavy responsibility on the schools.  Whether we\r\n\r\nlike it or not, they may suffer the stigma of being sent to  the\r\n\r\nHomes.   The thing to do is to empower the parents instead,  not\r\n\r\nthe  schools.  We must put the whole responsibility  of  looking\r\n\r\nafter  the  children  on  the parents.  Therefore,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nreinforce  parental  responsibility.  We  have  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nparents get the help and the knowledge  parenting knowledge   to\r\n\r\nlook  after  their  children  and to  bring  up  their  children\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are avenues, Sir, in the community which parents can\r\n\r\nturn  to.   They can go to the Family Service Centres for  help.\r\n\r\nThey  can  come to my Ministry for help, advice or  counselling.\r\n\r\nAnd  if a child is really recalcitrant, the parents can lodge  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint.   The parents must lodge a complaint to the  Juvenile\r\n\r\nCourt and the child may be placed under statutory supervision or\r\n\r\nadmitted  to an approved Home.  It is a serious matter before  a\r\n\r\nchild  can  be  sent to a Home.  So I do not think  we  want  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  schools to send children direct to the  Homes.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is unfair to them.  Sending of children to the  Homes\r\n\r\nshould  be  a last resort, something which we would not  do  and\r\n\r\nsomething which we only do after trying other ways to solve  the\r\n\r\nchild's problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai and Dr Yaacob also asked about the Boys'\r\n\r\nHome  and measures to improve the Boys' Home.  Members must have\r\n\r\nheard  about  the recent riot which happened in the Boys'  Home.\r\n\r\nIt  is  something  which  we did not  want  to  happen,  but  it\r\n\r\nhappened.   The  Singapore Boys' Home,  as  has  been  mentioned\r\n\r\nyesterday, is over 100 years.  We face problems of staff.  There\r\n\r\nis overcrowding.  But, more importantly, the profile of the boys\r\n\r\nthat  are  admitted into the Homes has changed over  the  years.\r\n\r\nPreviously,  the  number  of boys with history  of  violence  or\r\n\r\ninvolvement in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolent  crimes was about 20% but now it is about half, or  50%.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, the kinds of children and teenagers  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing sent to the Homes are different.  About 90% of these  boys\r\n\r\nhave previous secret society or gang connections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the attempted break-out, MCD had further upgraded the\r\n\r\nsecurity of the Home because security was the immediate concern.\r\n\r\nWe  had  brought in the Prisons Department.  We had  sought  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of  the  Police on how to increase the security  of  the\r\n\r\nHome.   We  even had to employ CISCO officers as guards because,\r\n\r\npreviously, we had only commercial guards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had some of our internal procedures reviewed and\r\n\r\ntightened  our management and control of the boys in  the  Home.\r\n\r\nThere will be a new Home for the boys to replace the Boys' Home.\r\n\r\nIt  will be ready by the end of the year.  And in the new  Home,\r\n\r\nwe  hope  that things will be better.  The environment  will  be\r\n\r\nbetter,  there will be more facilities, more space, and security\r\n\r\nwill be better.  We would also improve the staff/resident ratio.\r\n\r\nSo be assured that we have looked at the problem very carefully.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor the boys there and we will see to it\r\n\r\nthat  the conditions in the new Home will be so much better than\r\n\r\nthe old one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the Children and Young Persons (CYP) Act are\r\n\r\nbeing thought of by my Ministry.  We will be amending the Act to\r\n\r\ninclude  provisions  for enhancement in the treatment  of  young\r\n\r\noffenders and those who are beyond parental control.  There will\r\n\r\nbe  new  sentencing  options which will be  available  and  will\r\n\r\nprovide  the  courts  with  a  wider  choice  in  selecting   an\r\n\r\nappropriate  treatment for the kinds of cases that  come  up  to\r\n\r\nthem.   In  the amendment too, we will see to it that  not  only\r\n\r\nparents  but  also  family  members are  more  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation of children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Rai - I am afraid he is not here - who has offered to help review the CYP. The CYP has in fact\r\n\r\ngone  through a lot of discussions between my Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\ncourts, the Police, the AG's Chambers and even the GPC for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity Development.  I intend to table the amendments in this\r\n\r\nHouse  later this year.  However, I would be pleased to  receive\r\n\r\nviews and suggestions from the NMP in the meantime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also suggested that instead of sending children to\r\n\r\ncourt,  he would rather that a tribunal, similar to the Tribunal\r\n\r\nfor  the Maintenance of Parents, be set up to deal with juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  This is to divert the juveniles from the  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency  system and also not to criminalise  the  boys.   We\r\n\r\nsupport  the use of diversionary measures wherever possible  and\r\n\r\nwe too believe that the juvenile court should be the last resort\r\n\r\nwhere  boys  should be sent to for treatment and rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nBut  we  do  not  think that a tribunal is necessary  because  a\r\n\r\ntribunal,  as proposed, will also include a judge  and  a  judge\r\n\r\nwill  preside and thereby it would be similar to a court  or  at\r\n\r\nleast a quasi-court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP also suggested that there should be social workers\r\n\r\nto  sit  with  the  judges  in  dealing  with  cases.   This  is\r\n\r\nhappening,  Sir.  In the juvenile court setup, we have  a  court\r\n\r\nsystem but we also have a magistrate who sits with at least  two\r\n\r\nmembers  of the panel of advisors who are laymen (not  lawyers),\r\n\r\nwho  may  be teachers and social workers to advise or  hear  the\r\n\r\ncase  together  with  the  judge.   They  serve  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nmagistrate on the possible treatment of cases and to discuss the\r\n\r\ncase with the magistrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked about the Boys' Home. I think I have\r\n\r\nanswered  some of his concerns.  He suggested that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  better programmes in the Home.  I am glad to say that in the\r\n\r\nnew  premises, there will be a classification centre  where  all\r\n\r\nnew  committals will begin their rehabilitation programme.  Each\r\n\r\nboy  will  be  assessed by a team of officers and an  individual\r\n\r\ntreatment  plan will be designed for each inmate and a  contract\r\n\r\nworked  out.   In  other words, there will be a  more  sensitive\r\n\r\nclassification system, so that each inmate or each committal boy\r\n\r\nwill be better looked after in that sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards staff/resident ratio, I agree with Members that\r\n\r\nthe  ratio of 1:40 for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting  homes is simply unacceptable.  We will look into  this\r\n\r\nand we will improve the staff/resident ratio in the new complex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On child care centres, Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay asked\r\n\r\nwhether  there ought to be stricter control over  the  usage  of\r\n\r\nchild care centre premises.  He mentioned that some of the child\r\n\r\ncare  centres,  instead  of  administering  the  programmes   as\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  my Ministry, come out with a lot  of  enrichment\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  They even refuse to take in extra students  because\r\n\r\nthey  feel  that the students will not be \"enriched\"  enough  if\r\n\r\nthey  take in more students.  I would like to inform the  Member\r\n\r\nthat there are child care regulations which stipulate that child\r\n\r\ncare  premises  cannot be used for any purpose, other  than  the\r\n\r\nordinary  conduct  and  business of a child  care  centre.   Our\r\n\r\nofficers  visit these centres frequently and, in fact, there  is\r\n\r\nan  annual report.  In other words, we have an annual assessment\r\n\r\nof  each  centre and we use a list of criteria to  evaluate  the\r\n\r\ncentres.   The Ministry, however, does allow child care  centres\r\n\r\nto conduct one approved enrichment programme, in addition to the\r\n\r\nnormal programme for children enrolled in the centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Low also mentioned the shortage of child care\r\n\r\nplaces.   This problem apparently arises every year, that  there\r\n\r\nare not enough places and there are long waiting lists.  But the\r\n\r\ntruth  of  the matter, as I have answered at a previous sitting,\r\n\r\nis  that there are enough places and, indeed, some centres  have\r\n\r\nvacancies.   The  problem is that parents want  to  choose  more\r\n\r\npopular  centres,  and  they want to choose  preferably  centres\r\n\r\nbelow their blocks.  Therefore, there are some centres which are\r\n\r\nover  subscribed and there are other centres which are empty  or\r\n\r\nwhich  have  vacancies, simply because parents  tend  to  choose\r\n\r\ncentres  which are more convenient to them or which they prefer.\r\n\r\nSo  if  we look at the child care centre situation at the  macro\r\n\r\nlevel,  there are enough places.  The supply is enough  for  the\r\n\r\ndemand.  But if we look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  each  child  care centre, there seems to  be  some  mismatch\r\n\r\nbetween what the parents want and what the centres can provide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there are 464 child care centres providing\r\n\r\nplaces  for 38,000 children.  Another 40 new child care  centres\r\n\r\nfor an additional 3,000 children will be provided this year.  We\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to provide sites.  We will continue  to  monitor\r\n\r\ndemand  and  supply and, if need be, we will continue  to  build\r\n\r\nmore child care centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung feels that MCD should take a more\r\n\r\npositive  role  in  planning and coordinating the  provision  of\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  child  care centres.  Mr Zulkifli  calls  for  a\r\n\r\nnational  child  care  centre system where  Government  will  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the setting up and running of child care  centres.\r\n\r\nAs  of  now, actually Government is very deeply involved,  as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, in the development of child care centres.  It\r\n\r\nhas  regulations for these centres.  It sends officers to  check\r\n\r\nand monitor the progress of these centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD actually adopts a three-pronged approach in developing\r\n\r\nchild  care centres. First, to ensure that there is availability\r\n\r\nand  accessibility of child care centres; second, to ensure that\r\n\r\nchild care centres are affordable; and, third, we want to ensure\r\n\r\nthe quality of the child care centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We project the demand of child care centres, review such\r\n\r\nprojections  annually,  and  we take  into  consideration  HDB's\r\n\r\nhousing  development plans in new estates.  So there is  already\r\n\r\nclose  coordination between my Ministry, HDB, URA and  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice   in  terms  of  location  of  child  care  centres   and\r\n\r\navailability  of  sites for child care centres in  the  estates.\r\n\r\nHDB  will  indeed be incorporating child care centres and  other\r\n\r\nsocial facilities in its building plans for new estates, and, as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible, to have such facilities built in tandem  with\r\n\r\nthe  development of the estates in the future.  Therefore,  once\r\n\r\nwe  have  the  estates, we will have the child care centres  and\r\n\r\nother social facilities built up at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of quality, MCD ensures that there are enough\r\n\r\ntraining   programmes  for  child  care  centre   teachers   and\r\n\r\nsupervisors, training programmes by accredited agencies.  We set\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum for the training to ensure standards.  MCD  also\r\n\r\ngives training awards to those who are interested in pursuing  a\r\n\r\nfull-time  career in child care centres.  The award comprises  a\r\n\r\ngrant  for fees and allowance during the duration of the course.\r\n\r\nAnd  on  completion of the course, the candidate is  allowed  to\r\n\r\nwork  in  any  child care centre.  In other words, there  is  no\r\n\r\nbond.   The  person is not bound to work in any centre.   He  is\r\n\r\nfree  to  work in any non-profit organisation's centre or  in  a\r\n\r\nprivate child care centre if he or she wants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked for tax rebate for child care courses. I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  there  are  no such rebates, but  SDF,  I  am  told,\r\n\r\nprovides  80%  funding  for course fees,  whether  it  is  basic\r\n\r\ncourse,  intermediate course or advanced course.   In  addition,\r\n\r\nSDF  also  funds 50% of the course fees for first aid and  other\r\n\r\nenrichment  courses.  I think there is really no  need  for  tax\r\n\r\nrebates for people to go to child care courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the supply of child care centres in Woodlands,\r\n\r\nProf. Chin commented that MCD was slow or rather sluggish in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  child  care centres in his  constituency.   The\r\n\r\nMember  must  be aware that there are currently  12  child  care\r\n\r\ncentres providing 920 child care places in the Woodlands estate.\r\n\r\nThe  total enrolment in these 12 centres is about 90% right now,\r\n\r\nand there are, in fact, still 50-odd vacancies in these centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the long waiting list, I have given the reasons\r\n\r\njust  now.  They are mainly for the more popular centres in  the\r\n\r\nward.   Assoc. Prof. Chin may not be aware that for some  years,\r\n\r\nWoodlands had only two centres and the utilisation of these  two\r\n\r\ncentres was actually poor.  Consequently, private and non-profit\r\n\r\norganisations  were  actually reluctant to  set  up  child  care\r\n\r\ncentres  in the estate for some time.  Despite this, my Ministry\r\n\r\npushed for the development of more centres in the estate and  as\r\n\r\nthe  estate  expanded.  And within two years, between  1996  and\r\n\r\n1997, 10 new centres became operational, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10  more  with a total of 780 places are being planned  for  the\r\n\r\nestate.   Out  of  this number, I am told that six  are  already\r\n\r\nunder  construction  and  will be  ready  by  the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nfinancial year.  If demand still exceeds supply despite all this\r\n\r\nbuilding,  my  Ministry will consider building more  child  care\r\n\r\ncentres in Woodlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked for more child care centres in the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   I cannot agree with him more on this.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant and I think it is very convenient for parents to  have\r\n\r\nchild  care  places in their workplace.  Indeed,  we  have  been\r\n\r\nworking toward this.   We have been trying to do this for  quite\r\n\r\nsometime  now.   The  benefits of  child  care  centres  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace  are immense.  I think nobody can argue   against  it.\r\n\r\nIt  is  mutually beneficial for the employer as well as for  the\r\n\r\nemployees.   And  it  is also good for the bottom  line  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been setting an example in this. It has\r\n\r\ntaken  the  lead in providing child care centres in  workplaces.\r\n\r\nThere  are  about  30  workplace centres in  various  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.   Actually,  there are  a  lot  of  incentives  for\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  set  up  child care centres  at  their  premises.\r\n\r\nThere are financial subsidies, for example, which we give to non-profit  organisations, and which we also extend  to  firms.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the firms are allowed to claim expenses  incurred  in\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure and subsidies given to employees for  child\r\n\r\ncare   as  tax  deductive  expenditure.   They  may  also  claim\r\n\r\nindustrial  building  allowance on capital expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\nrenovation and conversion of their premises.  In fact, there are\r\n\r\nalready enough incentives for firms to set up child care centres\r\n\r\nin  their  buildings,  and  we will  continue  to  find  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  companies  to  build  such  centres  in   their\r\n\r\nworkplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Claire Chiang spoke very extensively on the disabled,\r\n\r\nand  she made a rallying call.  I am thankful for that.  I think\r\n\r\nMPs  at the local level can help as advisers to their grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.   They  can network with other  VWOs.   They  can\r\n\r\nnetwork with CDCs to ensure that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  enough help or social agencies or institutions to help  the\r\n\r\ndisabled in their constituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been my Ministry's philosophy that the\r\n\r\ndisabled can live meaningful lives and can be integrated in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  In fact, they ought to be.  It is better for them to\r\n\r\nbe integrated into the community, rather than being put aside in\r\n\r\ninstitutions or being hidden at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned three areas of focus - training, employment\r\n\r\nand  informal  support  networks.   In  terms  of  training,  we\r\n\r\nactually have many agencies serving disabled people, which  also\r\n\r\nrun  training  programmes,  eg, Rainbow  Centre,  Down  Syndrome\r\n\r\nAssociation, Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped,\r\n\r\nCanossian  School for the Hearing Impaired.  They have  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes for disabled people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the NMP that employment plays a very important\r\n\r\nrole  in  the integration of disabled people into the community.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry, in fact, together with NCSS set up Bizlink  Centre\r\n\r\nin 1988.  So the Centre is 10 years old now.  It is now known as\r\n\r\nBizlink  Centre  Singapore Limited.  It is  a  central  body  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate   employment  assistance  for  disabled  persons   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It works together with the Ministry of Education and\r\n\r\nalso  the  Ministry of Labour and provides vocational assessment\r\n\r\nand assistance and also job placements for the disabled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the Centre's data bank has about 2,000 potential\r\n\r\nemployers  which  we can draw on to provide  employment  to  the\r\n\r\ndisabled.   We  feel  that there is scope for  Bizlink  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  with  CDCs  to  reach out to  the  community  for  job\r\n\r\nplacement/assessment of the disabled.  We  will  see  that  this\r\n\r\nhappens  and we will encourage such coordination between Bizlink\r\n\r\nand the CDCs and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also funds vocational training programmes\r\n\r\nleading  to  Certificates  of  Vocational  Training  for   Basic\r\n\r\nComputer Applications, Office Practice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Service Skills for the handicapped to ensure that they have\r\n\r\nthe skills for employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage employment of disabled persons, the Government\r\n\r\nalso  provides  financial  incentives  to  employers,  like  tax\r\n\r\nrebates  for  modifications which they make in the workplace  to\r\n\r\nenable the disabled to work, and for reimbursements of the first\r\n\r\n1 1/2  months  of  the  disabled employee's salaries,  as  well  as\r\n\r\ntransport  and  food allowance, for the disabled  worker,  where\r\n\r\nneeded.   In other words, there are incentives for employers  to\r\n\r\nemploy  the disabled and we would certainly encourage  employers\r\n\r\nto look into the disabled as a source of manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector actually is the largest single employer\r\n\r\nof  the disabled people.  As at end of last year, we have  about\r\n\r\n224  disabled persons employed in the public sector and we  will\r\n\r\nincrease that number when we find suitable disabled to  work  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service.  But the greatest obstacle to the disabled,\r\n\r\nas  I  mentioned  this afternoon, is the prejudice  against  the\r\n\r\ndisabled in the community, that existed in the community  itself\r\n\r\nand  this is something I think we have to tackle through  public\r\n\r\neducation,  through  the  public knowing  more  about  what  the\r\n\r\ndisabled can and cannot do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked about the recommendations of the Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  for  the Disabled.  It is quite a long  list,  Sir.   I\r\n\r\ncould  provide  the NMP with the list if she needs  it.   It  is\r\n\r\nquite a long one and most of them have been implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to schools, where possible, disabled children\r\n\r\nare  integrated  in  normal schools.   There  are  no  barriers,\r\n\r\nphysically,   to   the  handicapped  and   schools   have   been\r\n\r\ncooperative.   Where there are handicapped in  the  school  they\r\n\r\nmake sure that mobility and access for the disabled are made  as\r\n\r\neasy  as possible, where necessary and appropriate.  But we feel\r\n\r\nthat it is not always advantageous for the disabled children  to\r\n\r\nbe  sent  to  normal  school because some of them  are  mentally\r\n\r\ndisabled.  Therefore it may be better for them to attend special\r\n\r\nschools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead  of  going to normal schools, where they can  be  better\r\n\r\nlooked  after,  where their needs and learning can  be  tailored\r\n\r\nmore to their level of understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On barrier-free environment, she did mention that the BCD\r\n\r\nhas  got a Code on Barrier-free Accessibility in Buildings.   It\r\n\r\nwas I think revised in 1995.  The code requires new buildings to\r\n\r\nhave  barrier-free features such as toilets for the handicapped,\r\n\r\nramps with gentle slopes and kerb ramps which slope upwards from\r\n\r\nthe  road  to the building.  In other words, there is  a  gentle\r\n\r\nslope  from the road to the building walkways instead of a sharp\r\n\r\nangle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New buildings have to conform to the requirements of this\r\n\r\ncode  and old buildings would have to comply with these  revised\r\n\r\nrequirements  when they undergo major renovations.   HDB,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold,  has also incorporated accessibility features in  the  new\r\n\r\nHDB  buildings  as well as existing buildings  which  are  being\r\n\r\nupgraded in the Main Upgrading Programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the provision of ground floor units for families of the\r\n\r\ndisabled,  HDB does allocate ground floor flats where  they  are\r\n\r\navailable  and  possible for families of the disabled.   In  the\r\n\r\nrental  flats, they are also given ground floor flats  and  also\r\n\r\nflats  at lift landings and when they transfer their flats  they\r\n\r\nare also given priority for ground floor units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to sexual abuse of disabled individuals, this\r\n\r\nis  something which we all abhor.  It is right that we feel very\r\n\r\nstrongly  against this, and I agree.  I share the NMP's  concern\r\n\r\nabout   physical  and  sexual  abuse  of  disabled  individuals,\r\n\r\nparticularly the young ones and the girls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in both the Children and Young Persons Act,\r\n\r\nas  well as the Women's Charter, protect all victims from abuse,\r\n\r\nincluding the disabled.  In fact, the amendments to the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter  provide  an  added avenue through  which  help  can  be\r\n\r\nobtained, for example, the Charter now allows persons  to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  a protection order on behalf of an abused victim.  In other\r\n\r\nwords, for the disabled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson who could not make any report, a protection order can  be\r\n\r\napplied for on behalf of that person by other persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the NMP also asked about the central registry for\r\n\r\ndisabled.   She  may want to know that there was a  Registry  of\r\n\r\nDisabled  People  or  CRDP  which was established  by  the  then\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Social  Affairs in  1969.   But  there  were  some\r\n\r\ninherent  difficulties in maintaining the  Registry  because  of\r\n\r\npeople being reluctant to report, infrequent reporting and  very\r\n\r\nunreliable reporting.  Therefore, in 1988, the Advisory  Council\r\n\r\non  the  Disabled  recommended for the CRDP to be  discontinued.\r\n\r\nBut currently, I am told that welfare organisations working with\r\n\r\nthe  disabled  themselves maintain their  own  registry  of  the\r\n\r\ndisabled  who  are  under their charge  and  they  update  these\r\n\r\nregistries regularly.  So if the Member is interested in knowing\r\n\r\nwho  are  the  disabled and where they are,  perhaps  she  could\r\n\r\napproach these organisations directly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan talks about a national cohesion scheme for\r\n\r\nwomen.   This is quite a different subject from what  the  other\r\n\r\nspeakers  have  been  talking  about.   But  I  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nsentiments  about the need for cohesion.  There are avenues  for\r\n\r\nmales  but  apparently  there is none  for  females.   There  is\r\n\r\nsomething about being in the trenches together, eating together,\r\n\r\nwallowing in the mud together for National Servicemen.  They  do\r\n\r\nset up this bond between the rich and poor, between the Hokkien,\r\n\r\nthe Cantonese and the Malay and the Indian or whatever race.  So\r\n\r\nI  agree with the sentiments.  The question is whether NS should\r\n\r\nbe  extended to women.  This question is one which Government is\r\n\r\nstill  looking into.  It has not dismissed the idea.  But  there\r\n\r\nare  several  issues which we need to look into very  carefully.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the reasons for having NS for women in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace.   Well,  she has given one reason, to encourage  cohesion\r\n\r\nand  bonding  among women.  Other issues are whether  we  should\r\n\r\nenlist  all women or some of the women, and at what level.   Who\r\n\r\nshould  be enlisted?  Which Ministry should be in charge?   What\r\n\r\nwould the enlistees do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are issues which have to be carefully looked into and,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  mentioned, the scheme ought to  be  very  carefully\r\n\r\nformulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that we shall look into her suggestions,\r\n\r\nto  see  whether  a  modified form of National  Service  can  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  for  some women in Singapore.  But  notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthat,  NS is not the only way to bring about social bonding  and\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion  among  women.  They  could  engage  in  social\r\n\r\nservice,  they could go down to the constituencies and join  the\r\n\r\nCDCs; they can join as Civil Defence volunteers.  They can  help\r\n\r\nin  the  self-help groups.  Indeed there are many  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  women to get together and help out others.  I think through\r\n\r\nsuch  involvement in the community, our girls would be  able  to\r\n\r\ninteract  with Singaporeans from all walks of life and from  all\r\n\r\nincome  groups.   Besides deriving personal  satisfaction,  they\r\n\r\nsomehow  very  quickly  learn  to  understand  the  plight   and\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of the families and individuals  whom  they  work\r\n\r\nwith  and whom they help.  They are able to empathise with those\r\n\r\nwho  come  from completely different socio-economic backgrounds,\r\n\r\nbut  they  share,  nevertheless,  a  common  identity  of  being\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin talked about quality of life. The definition\r\n\r\nof  quality of life can be very nebulous.  Different people have\r\n\r\ndifferent definitions of what a good quality of life is.  I grew\r\n\r\nup  in  an urban slum, and I used to have a neighbour who was  a\r\n\r\nhawker, who had eight children.  To all intents and purposes, he\r\n\r\nconsidered his life as of good quality.  He said, \"I have got no\r\n\r\nproblems.  I don't owe any mortgages.  I don't have money in the\r\n\r\nbank  but  I  have enough to eat.\"  To him, quality of  life  is\r\n\r\ngood.  And yet I know of someone who earns $25,000 a month,  who\r\n\r\nkeeps  on complaining he has not got enough and that his quality\r\n\r\nof life is somehow very rotten.  So the definition of quality of\r\n\r\nlife  indeed  can vary between one individual and another.   But\r\n\r\neven then I agree that we should not neglect the development of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial  and  community infrastructure and  we  should  not  just\r\n\r\nmeasure quality of life by material standards alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the PM presented his ideas on Singapore 21 last year,\r\n\r\nhe  said that Singapore needs to go beyond economic and material\r\n\r\nneeds  and  reorient  society  to  meet  the  intellectual   and\r\n\r\nemotional,  spiritual, cultural and social needs of our  people.\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard, my Ministry will continue to develop policies,\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and infrastructure for individuals to  lead  a  more\r\n\r\nmeaningful and balanced life through promoting community bonding\r\n\r\nand  social  cohesion and inculcating family  values,  promoting\r\n\r\nvoluntarism and caring for the young, the aged and the needy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of quality of life indicators, again this is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  we have to think about.  We have  to  work  at\r\n\r\ndefinitions.   We  have  to  work at  measurements  and  at  the\r\n\r\nindices.  We have now on-going a survey on the state of families\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  It is being carried out by my Ministry.  We hope\r\n\r\nit  will produce some important social indicators for Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  Members have any proposals on what kind of indicators  ought\r\n\r\nto be included in this index, my Ministry would be most happy to\r\n\r\nreceive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working hard, playing hard - that is the motto of Dr Toh\r\n\r\nSee Kiat.  In MCD, we believe in playing hard but, alas, we work\r\n\r\nharder.  We agree that Singaporeans work hard but we also  agree\r\n\r\nthat  they  must learn to make meaningful use of their  leisure.\r\n\r\nThey  must  have  some balance in life.  In  this  respect,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council, which is under the Ministry, has  done\r\n\r\nquite a lot, in terms of promoting sports at the community level\r\n\r\nSports for Life  and also the SPEX 2000 programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Sports for Life programme, since its\r\n\r\nlaunch  in September 1996 from Sports for All programme, we  had\r\n\r\nmade a survey last year on sport participation.  It was revealed\r\n\r\nthat the percentage of regular sport participation had increased\r\n\r\nfrom  24%  in 1992 to 34% in 1997, within five years, so  a  10%\r\n\r\nincrease within five years.  But what is significant is that 72%\r\n\r\nof the participants spend more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  45  minutes  in  each session.  This is  very  significant\r\n\r\nbecause  it  shows  not only the regularity of participation  in\r\n\r\nsports  but  also the length of each session.  And  for  72%  to\r\n\r\nspend more than 45 minutes is indeed significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council has launched a public\r\n\r\neducation  programme to promote the message that sports  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  fun  but  it is also beneficial to one's  fitness  and  to\r\n\r\noneself.   The  SSC has now embarked on a second phase  of  this\r\n\r\nnational  public  education  campaign.   The  mass  media   will\r\n\r\norganise road shows, exhibitions, to bring home the message that\r\n\r\nsports  is  fun, it is easy to take up and it is  healthy.   The\r\n\r\ncampaign will impress on Singaporeans that we do not have to  be\r\n\r\nfit to take up sports but rather sports will develop fitness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to what the SSC does, PA also has many leisure\r\n\r\nactivities in the CCs.  Quite apart from sports, it  has  got  a\r\n\r\nsea  sports  centre, karaoke, outings, dancing, barbecues,  etc.\r\n\r\nSo indeed there are many opportunities for Singaporeans to play.\r\n\r\nJust  like  the proverbial horse which we want to  drag  to  the\r\n\r\nwaters  to  drink,  unless the horse wants to drink  nobody  can\r\n\r\nforce  it  to  drink.   Therefore, we have  enough  outlets  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to play; it is up to the Singaporeans themselves to\r\n\r\ntake up these opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know statistics on children\r\n\r\nattending counselling or children with problems.  I am afraid we\r\n\r\ndo not have the details but what we have are statistics from the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Mental Health.  According to them, there are 16,253\r\n\r\nattendees  seeking child and adolescence psychiatric  outpatient\r\n\r\nservices  at  the child  guidance clinics.  We do not  know  the\r\n\r\ndetails.  If the Member is interested, perhaps he could approach\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health to pursue the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin proposed that we consider reaching out to the\r\n\r\npoor  to  make  them  aware of the kinds of  services  that  are\r\n\r\navailable.  I agree with the Member of the need for us to  reach\r\n\r\nout  to the poor.  In fact, it has been our experience, not only\r\n\r\nin  MCD but also in self-help groups and among the VWOs that the\r\n\r\ngroup  which  you  try to help is the very group  which  is  the\r\n\r\nhardest to reach, for example, the low\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  group.   I  am glad to say that last  year  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nembarked on a joint project with the Marine Parade CDC  and  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  CDC  to launch a public education  programme  on\r\n\r\nsocial  services to reach out to households living in 1- and  2-room  HDB  flats.  In this programme, volunteers from the  CDCs,\r\n\r\nRCs  and VWOs were enlisted to go door to door, we go and  knock\r\n\r\non  each  door,  literally reaching out  to  the  community,  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the  1- and 2-room flat residents  of  the  various\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  services that are available for  them  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also has established a booklet entitled \"We're\r\n\r\nJust  A  Call  Away\"  which  contains information  on  available\r\n\r\nservices  and  schemes which families can avail  themselves  of.\r\n\r\nThe  booklet  can  be  used by volunteers to  brief  and  advise\r\n\r\nfamilies.   There  are  also  two  other  publications:  one  is\r\n\r\n\"Helping  Low-income Families  The Singapore Way\" and the  other\r\n\r\nis  \"Reaching  Out  - Directory of Services to  Help  Low-income\r\n\r\nFamilies\".   These two publications can also be used  by  social\r\n\r\nservice  providers, schools, grassroots organisations for  their\r\n\r\nown  reference  and also for them to pass on the information  to\r\n\r\ntheir residents and students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDC has also launched a National Helpline in January\r\n\r\nthis year.  This is where people can contact the CDC directly, a\r\n\r\none-stop information provider, as it were, for them to  ask  the\r\n\r\nkinds  of  help available to them.  This has made things  easier\r\n\r\nfor  people.   Instead  of going to several organisations,  they\r\n\r\njust call on this Helpline and they get all the information they\r\n\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Vasoo for lending his moral\r\n\r\nsupport, again, for MCD to get more funds and also for VWOs.  He\r\n\r\nalso mentioned \"compassion fatigue\".  I sincerely hope that this\r\n\r\nwould  not happen because once we have compassion fatigue,  then\r\n\r\nthere go our plans for having more volunteers and more people to\r\n\r\ncare  for  others.  I do hope that compassion fatigue  will  not\r\n\r\noccur and will not happen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various Ministries dealing with VWOs (MCD, MOE and MOH)\r\n\r\nare working very closely with NCSS to monitor the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpact  of the current economic downturn on social services  and\r\n\r\nthe  ability  of  the VWOs to raise funds and to anticipate  the\r\n\r\nsort  of  support  that VWOs may need.  But VWOs  themselves,  I\r\n\r\nthink, can help themselves.  We really feel that they are  still\r\n\r\nable  to raise funds, provided they have good programmes,  their\r\n\r\naims are clear and the programmes are perceived by the community\r\n\r\nas  worthy of support.  For example, the recent President's Star\r\n\r\nCharity  collected more than $2 million whereas last  year  they\r\n\r\ncollected only about $1 million.  So it is more than double what\r\n\r\nthey  collected.  Indeed people are still able and  they  donate\r\n\r\neven in bad economic times like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can also look into how they can streamline their\r\n\r\nservices  further,  review  or  re-prioritise  their  needs  and\r\n\r\nexpenditures like what the Government and the private sector are\r\n\r\ndoing.  And they may also want to consider more creative ways of\r\n\r\nraising  funds.  Indeed, this is the time for them  to  be  more\r\n\r\ncreative,  to examine themselves and to face the whole situation\r\n\r\nas  a  challenge for them, which can be very exciting.  And they\r\n\r\ncan look into other avenues, and more innovative ways of raising\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members of this House that Government has\r\n\r\nnot  cut back on its budget for approved programmes run  by  the\r\n\r\nVWOs which receive Government funding.  And Government will also\r\n\r\nnot  be cutting back on its development programme for community-based  social  services such as FSCs, child  care  centres,  and\r\n\r\nBASCs.   In fact, there will be a 14% increase over FY97 in  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the development and operating  expenses  of  the\r\n\r\nVWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to CDC funding, whether we can extend the 3:1\r\n\r\nformula  to  VWOs,  if  there is a real  need  and  Members  can\r\n\r\nconvince the Minister for Finance - he is not here now - I think\r\n\r\nhe might consider the proposal very sympathetically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On voluntarism and professionalism in social work, Mdm\r\n\r\nChiang  mentioned  about the need for people to  recognise  what\r\n\r\nsocial  work really is.  We need both types of workers really  - the professional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial  workers and the volunteers.  Indeed, in our many helping\r\n\r\nhands approach, we need a variety of such workers.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nwide  range  of  services requiring a variety  of  skills.   For\r\n\r\nexample, at one end, there is the befriender type where we  need\r\n\r\nvolunteers.  There is also the more administrative duties  where\r\n\r\nwe   can   get   via   paid  staff  in  the  voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations.  Then at the extreme end or the high end, you may\r\n\r\ncall it, where we need real professional social workers to deal,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  cases of child abuse, domestic  abuse  or  family\r\n\r\ncasework.   These  really need professional,  knowledgeable  and\r\n\r\nskilful workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need volunteers and we need social workers, and we\r\n\r\nneed  those in- between too.  And there is room actually  for  a\r\n\r\nwhole continuum of services to be served by these people.   They\r\n\r\nneed  different  knowledge and skills.  She is  right  that  the\r\n\r\npublic is somehow unclear about what a social worker really  is,\r\n\r\nand  there  is this confusion also that social worker  equals  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  equals a counsellor, equals anybody who  works  in  a\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisation.  The public is largely  unaware\r\n\r\nof  what  social  work  actually involves,  and  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nprofessional   service   rendered  by   trained   persons   with\r\n\r\nspecialised   knowledge  and  skills  and  these   are   to   be\r\n\r\ndifferentiated  from acts of charity carried out by  volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe  professionals will have an increasingly important  role  as\r\n\r\nour  society  develops  further and the  social  service  sector\r\n\r\nexpands.   My  Ministry will help bring about better recognition\r\n\r\nof  social workers by way of investing in training and improving\r\n\r\nservice  conditions  and public education about  what  a  social\r\n\r\nworker really is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of training, for example, my Ministry has been\r\n\r\nsponsoring   specialised  training  for  social  workers   which\r\n\r\nincludes training in working with family violence victims  (this\r\n\r\nis  training  in  specific  areas  about  family  violence)  and\r\n\r\ntraining   for  new  services  such  as  counselling  first-time\r\n\r\noffenders in Police caution cases.  We are also working with the\r\n\r\nNUS  Department of Social Work and Psychology and  with  various\r\n\r\ntraining institutions to increase the specialised and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofessional upgrading opportunities.  MCD's staff  itself  will\r\n\r\nbe  attending  upgrading courses to equip them with professional\r\n\r\nskills to perform their work properly.  At the other end of  the\r\n\r\nscale,  the  voluntary sector will also be given more  resources\r\n\r\nfor  training of the volunteers so that agencies can upgrade the\r\n\r\nskills of the helpers and those working in the organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is also studying how best to achieve a good standard of\r\n\r\npractice,  especially in the most critical area of  social  work\r\n\r\ninterventions,  like child abuse and domestic  abuse.   We  will\r\n\r\nlook  into an ethical code of practice and the need to  regulate\r\n\r\nthe  practice  in  those critical areas so as  to  ensure  that,\r\n\r\nespecially in cases where the clients are vulnerable, the social\r\n\r\nworkers  who handle the cases are properly qualified, that  they\r\n\r\nknow  what  they are doing.  These are critical areas  and  this\r\n\r\ncan, in fact, either help the victims or cause more problems for\r\n\r\nthem,  if  the social workers are not knowledgeable and  skilful\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD will also work with the Singapore Association of Social\r\n\r\nWorkers and NCSS to look into the development of the social work\r\n\r\nsector  as a whole, in terms of manpower planning and standards.\r\n\r\nThere   is  always  the  challenge  to  attract  volunteers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  have  found  that  somehow  people   are   more\r\n\r\ncharitable when giving donations of money because it is  a  one-time commitment.  You want $10, I give you $10; you want $50,  I\r\n\r\ngive  you $50.  But if you ask me to commit one hour a week,  it\r\n\r\nis  a long term commitment.  So it is much more difficult to get\r\n\r\npeople to volunteer their time and energy than getting people to\r\n\r\ndonate.  But it is a challenge which we will face.  We will need\r\n\r\nto  calibrate  carefully  between  passion  and  compassion  and\r\n\r\nwhether  there needs to be some reward for volunteers.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  balance the two.  I know some of us really abhor the idea of\r\n\r\nrewarding  volunteers.  And at the other end of the scale,  some\r\n\r\npeople  feel that they may be volunteers but, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nthey are human beings too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question by Mr Iswaran was whether there could be\r\n\r\ncloser coordi-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnation or cooperation between the CDCs and MCD.  I would like to\r\n\r\nassure the Member that indeed we work closely not only with CDCs\r\n\r\nbut  also  with  the  other agencies I  mentioned  earlier.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, he mentioned about the BASC programme.  MCD has  got\r\n\r\na Social Service Development Master Plan for BASCs, FSCs and all\r\n\r\nthe other centres.  We have met with the officers of the Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  and Marine Parade CDCs and we shared with them our Master\r\n\r\nPlan  for BASCs, FSCs, CDCs and the other centres.  We  will  be\r\n\r\nholding  similar sessions.  In other words, we will  be  working\r\n\r\ntogether.  It is not as if we work on certain directions and the\r\n\r\nCDCs  work  on  another.  We have regular  dialogues.   We  have\r\n\r\nregular consultations in the planning and implementation of  our\r\n\r\nsocial service facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is currently working with the CDCs on a number of\r\n\r\nprojects, including public education on social services.  We are\r\n\r\nalso  working  with  them on the development of  social  service\r\n\r\nfacilities,  as I mentioned earlier, such as the BASCs  and  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  services, such as food rations to the  needy  and\r\n\r\nmeals-on-wheels project.  We welcome proposals from the CDCs and\r\n\r\nadvisors  on  the services that are of priority and  which  they\r\n\r\nfeel would be needed for the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to make some comments on the subject with regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  Family  Development Department in MUIS.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  my  interest  as  the former President  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council of Singapore and Chairman  of  the  Committee\r\n\r\nthat  was  appointed  by  the Minister  responsible  for  Muslim\r\n\r\naffairs  to  study and make recommendations on the  question  of\r\n\r\ndivorce.   One  of the suggestions was that there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nspecial  unit  established to handle the problem.   It  has  got\r\n\r\nclose connection with the question of family development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House may still remember that at the Budget\r\n\r\nsession  last  year,  I  had stressed the  importance  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should increase its assistance to MUIS.  The work and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  MUIS  in  the  development  of  the   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecome so wide that MUIS should be given more opportunities  and\r\n\r\nresources to carry out its duties.  Therefore, I am happy to see\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has allocated an increased contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe Family Development Department.  Though the provision of $1.8\r\n\r\nmillion  is quite a lot I see that it is only for the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  1997.   The  Government  should  consider  increasing  its\r\n\r\ncontribution as the responsibility of this Department  is  heavy\r\n\r\nand  important.   If it is not done through MUIS, the Government\r\n\r\nmay   assist   through   MENDAKI,  AMP  and   other   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.   If  the  Government is  to  promote  this  good\r\n\r\neffort,   MUIS  will  have  to  rely  on  the  effort   of   the\r\n\r\norganisation.   Strategies  will  have  to  be  made  for   this\r\n\r\nDepartment to increase its responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, the relevant unit of MUIS has to\r\n\r\nwork   closely   with  AMP,  Madrasahs  and   other   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  to obtain better synergy.  It is  important  that\r\n\r\nthis department together with other Muslim organisations set  up\r\n\r\na  network  with  other Government agencies  and  non-Government\r\n\r\nagencies  to  utilise  the  resources available  as  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity is taking part in this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister for\r\n\r\nMuslim  Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, for showing great interest\r\n\r\nin   the  Family  Development  Unit.   Family  is  the  core  of\r\n\r\nindividual development.  The stronger the family is, the  better\r\n\r\nwill be the opportunity for individuals to progress forward with\r\n\r\nthe other communities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the idea to set up a\r\n\r\nunit  under the Islamic Religious Council (MUIS) to help  Muslim\r\n\r\nfamilies  to strengthen family relationship in order  to  reduce\r\n\r\ndivorce rate among them has evolved into something bigger.  Like\r\n\r\nMr Zainul, I think we should applaud this.  A Family Development\r\n\r\nDepartment  will  now be formed to look into not  only  ways  to\r\n\r\nreduce the number of divorces among Muslim families but to  find\r\n\r\nways to strengthen family values among them.  This is a move  in\r\n\r\nthe right direction as the work of the department should include\r\n\r\nfinding ways to strengthen parenting skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo.   I hope the Minister can enlighten Members as to the staff\r\n\r\nstrength and responsibilities given to the Department and how it\r\n\r\nwill   work   with   existing  Malay/Muslim  voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  in strengthening family values among  Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  reduce the number of divorces.   The  department\r\n\r\nshould be given sufficient manpower and resources to achieve its\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of its work that should be given some emphasis\r\n\r\nis in the area of improving the contents and presentation of pre-marital  courses and counselling.  I found that the few lectures\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  heard over the radio sounded more like  religious\r\n\r\nsermons  rather  than something that could appeal  to  potential\r\n\r\ncouples,  ie,  those who are planning to get married.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I  would  like to know how MUIS or the relevant  agency\r\n\r\nassesses the effectiveness of the pre-marital courses.  How many\r\n\r\ncouples who attended the courses have divorced within the  first\r\n\r\nfive  years  of  their  marriages?   One  other  area  that  the\r\n\r\ndepartment should take a closer look at is how to help unmarried\r\n\r\nMuslims,  including, if not particularly, female graduates.   In\r\n\r\nthese  two  areas,  I hope the department will conduct  thorough\r\n\r\nstudies so that the programmes that will be carried out will not\r\n\r\nonly  be suitable to Muslims but are more effective in achieving\r\n\r\ntheir objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, recently, NMP Dr\r\n\r\nLee  Tsao  Yuan  reminded  the House how  important  it  is  for\r\n\r\nnational cohesion to exist.  Her interest and concern of society\r\n\r\ntouches  on  the  question of community and religion.   We  must\r\n\r\nensure  that  this element will not divide the multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious community in Singapore.  Islam, as we  know,  is\r\n\r\nan   important  instinct  for  the  Malay/Muslim  community   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We also know that Islam encourages harmonious living\r\n\r\nand Islam is holistic and encourages us to live in tolerance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Education, RAdm Teo Chee Hean, raised\r\n\r\nhis  concern that a number of Muslim pupils are unable to  enter\r\n\r\nthe  national school system, it  has become a topic  of  general\r\n\r\nconcern of the Muslim community.  Is the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  happy  with  the  Muslim  students  attending  classes   at\r\n\r\nMadrasahs?  What is the future of these Madrasahs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident it is not the policy of the Government to\r\n\r\nput  aside the Madrasah.  Madrasah has an important role to play\r\n\r\nand is close to the hearts of the Muslim community in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  we  know,  the Muslim community of Singapore has voluntarily\r\n\r\ngiven $14 million for the Madrasah Aljunied in a short time  and\r\n\r\nin  record  time.  We know the Malay/Muslim community  has  high\r\n\r\nhopes  for their Madrasahs.  The Muslim community wants Madrasah\r\n\r\ngraduates  to  fulfil the religious needs of the  community  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen their beliefs in the religion.  The question  is  not\r\n\r\nthat the Madrasah should be there or not, but whether the system\r\n\r\nis suitable for the Muslim community in Singapore in the context\r\n\r\nof this multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the Madrasah will have its place in the\r\n\r\ncommunity and that MUIS and Madrasah sponsors can work  hard  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  Madrasah.  Probably, the Minister responsible  for\r\n\r\nMuslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, can explain the mission  of\r\n\r\nMUIS  with  regard to the development of Madrasahs.  What  steps\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken  to  ensure that not only  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  are  fulfilled but the potential of each  student  who\r\n\r\nenters  Madrasah  education  for the  benefit  of  the  national\r\n\r\neconomy?   The Madrasah should play an important role to  fulfil\r\n\r\nthe  aspirations  of the community and the nation  in  order  to\r\n\r\ndevelop fully the potential of our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the future of Madrasah, the Minister can\r\n\r\nconsider  the  establishment of a joint  committee  between  the\r\n\r\nsponsors of Madrasahs and MUIS and the Ministry of Education  to\r\n\r\nsettle issues connected with these Madrasahs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the question of Madrasah\r\n\r\neducation  has  been  a topic of discussion between  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity and the Minister for Education touching on the subject\r\n\r\nof  500 Malay pupils each year who will not be able to enter the\r\n\r\nnational  school system.  He expressed concern  that  they  will\r\n\r\nmiss the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity to obtain quality education and skills and  as  such\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to integrate into the economy and the  social\r\n\r\nsystem of Singapore in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that some Muslims in the community have\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern  about  the  comment  of  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation on the education and job opportunities of Malay-Muslim\r\n\r\nchildren  who  are  attending  normal  school.   Also  they  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  the  Government may take steps  to  change  the\r\n\r\nMadrasah  education system or close the Madrasahs.  May  I  take\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to  ask  the Minister responsible  for  Muslim\r\n\r\nAffairs  whether  this assumption is correct  or  not.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  no  intention of doing so,  please  express  it\r\n\r\nclearly  and the Malay-Muslim community should accept  it  as  a\r\n\r\ncomment  and that will be a hopeful sign within the Malay-Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  that  the madrasah education system be  improved,  so\r\n\r\nthat more benefits will be obtained by its pupils and the public\r\n\r\nin  general.  Sir, the question that I express here is  in  that\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, my question is with regard to the statement made by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister responsible for Muslim Affairs earlier this  month\r\n\r\nthat  a committee comprising members and representatives of  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs,  the Malay/Muslim community, the Majlis  Ugama  Islam\r\n\r\nSingapura (MUIS) and the Ministry of Education will be formed to\r\n\r\nstudy the question of madrasah education.  I welcome this move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encouragement of parents to send their children to\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  is  clear. Some of them like to  see  their  children\r\n\r\nhaving  alternative education, balancing secular  and  religious\r\n\r\neducation.  This is because there are six full-session madrasahs\r\n\r\nwhich  are  having subjects with regard to secular and religious\r\n\r\neducation.   Some of the parents like their children  to  become\r\n\r\nMuslim  teachers  and  scholars, and  it  is  the  hope  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim  community locally that religious educated  leaders\r\n\r\nshould have the highest education possible.  However, the  point\r\n\r\nis  that  about 10%-15% of each cohort of standard one  madrasah\r\n\r\nare able to go for higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearning.  What about the fate of students who are not  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with   higher education?  Will  they  have  the  basic\r\n\r\neducational  needs  to enable them to follow courses  in  skills\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the economy so that they have the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nhigher employability?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the type of investments that will be brought into\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  future  will be those  concentrated  in  the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  component  parts and  high-tech  goods,  whereas\r\n\r\nlabour  intensive  industries will be leaving Singapore  one  by\r\n\r\none.   In  short,  how can the madrasah be able to  improve  its\r\n\r\nservice  to the Malay/Muslim children so that they are  prepared\r\n\r\nfor  the  job  market?   It is important  that  the  economy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is knowledge-based.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a full report on madrasah education was published in\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times  and it reflected clearly the views that have\r\n\r\nbeen raised by Malay/Muslim leaders with regard to improving the\r\n\r\nprestasi  or  performance of madrasah education to children  and\r\n\r\nthe  public  at  large.  First, the concern of the  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity   is  that,   with  the  cooperation  of  the   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity,  the  Government  should make  the  madrasah  mission\r\n\r\nschools use the curricula approved by the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, start full-time madrasahs beginning with secondary\r\n\r\nschool level, so that all students could follow the same primary\r\n\r\nlevel  basic  education before they make the choice for  further\r\n\r\neducation in madrasahs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, upgrade the quality of the week-end madrasahs so\r\n\r\nthat  more  parents  will  be able to  send  their  children  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  religious education while such students  attend\r\n\r\nformal school as far as they can attain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give his views and inform the\r\n\r\nHouse  concerning MUIS' efforts in helping in the management  of\r\n\r\nupgrading  the  quality  of education  offered  to  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\nchildren and also in upgrading the work capability during  their\r\n\r\nworking life.  To what extent can the Ministry of Education help\r\n\r\nto upgrade?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I will be brief.

The  SBA  has  been\r\n\r\nholding  all  its  tournaments at the  Geylang  Indoor  Stadium,\r\n\r\nformerly known as Gay World Stadium or Happy World Stadium.   If\r\n\r\nyou  happen  to  pass by the Geylang Indoor  Stadium,  you  will\r\n\r\nnotice  that the stadium is exactly the same as it  was  in  the\r\n\r\n50s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that many people are saying that basketball\r\n\r\nis  a game played predominantly by the Chinese-educated.  So why\r\n\r\nshould  the Government look after them?  But why do people  have\r\n\r\nthis  sentiment?   I think the Sports Council should  take  some\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for this perception.  Why can  the  SSC  not  do\r\n\r\nsomething to upgrade the stadium?  If the site is earmarked  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment, then the stadium should be demolished.    If   not,\r\n\r\nthen  something should be done to spruce up this  stadium  where\r\n\r\nall  major basketball tournaments are held, so that  it will not\r\n\r\ngive  people  the  impression that since  basketball  is  played\r\n\r\npredominantly by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese-educated, the Government will not  look  after  it.

The  people\r\n\r\nfollow  the fortunes of the club, and win or lose, they  support\r\n\r\nthe club and there is a bonding in the town.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have started the S-League. We now have 11\r\n\r\nsoccer  clubs in the S-League, and we have eight CDCs, following\r\n\r\nthe  idea of our Prime Minister.  The time has come that we have\r\n\r\nto  use sports, particularly soccer, to link and bond people  in\r\n\r\nthe CDCs.  My suggestion to the Minister is to link these 11  S-League clubs to the respective eight CDCs.  In some CDCs,  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  more  than one club.  For example, in Manchester,  they\r\n\r\nhave  Manchester City and Manchester United.  In the  same  way,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  Central Singapore, we can  have  Home  United  in\r\n\r\nBishan and Balestier in Kreta Ayer-Tanglin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already started linking these clubs and CDCs at our\r\n\r\ncentral CDC, thanks to our Chairman.

I would like to urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to extend it and make it a comprehensive network so\r\n\r\nthat this process of community bonding can be expedited.

But, more important, the  success\r\n\r\nof  these  self-help  groups  is based  on  feelings  of  ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunities that are receiving the kind of services more  suited\r\n\r\nto  the  problems  they experience.  Based on group  membership,\r\n\r\nthis can bring about other problems.  I am concerned about these\r\n\r\nproblems  and  I  think we need to have CDCs to do  more  multi-cultural  programmes.  Because the experiences in some of  these\r\n\r\ncountries  which  practise assimilation of different  races,  we\r\n\r\nhave  now seen the problems, racial tension and unease in  times\r\n\r\nof  economic turmoil.

Because\r\n\r\nI  think  and  believe the normal way of thinking,  feeling  and\r\n\r\nbehaving,  when begun at an early age with children,  contribute\r\n\r\nto  a culturally sensitive atmosphere that is needed for all age\r\n\r\ngroups  in  Singapore.  So I urge that more be done  to  promote\r\n\r\nmulti-culturalism in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to take the question\r\n\r\nof madrasahs  first, because I think it is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, madrasahs are important and established institutions\r\n\r\nin all Muslim communities.  They are primarily set up to provide\r\n\r\nreligious education for Muslim children and to prepare those who\r\n\r\nwish to pursue vocations such as religious teachers, leaders and\r\n\r\nscholars in madrasahs, mosques and Muslim organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government understands the importance of madrasahs to\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community, and would like to assure  the  community\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not the intention of Government to stop  them  from\r\n\r\ncontinuing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the madrasah system is not without its concerns\r\n\r\nand problems, and the community must be prepared to make changes\r\n\r\nto  overcome these problems and concerns.  One is as pointed out\r\n\r\nby   Mr  Hawazi  on  the  issue  of  employability  of  madrasah\r\n\r\ngraduates.  As mentioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier,  madrasahs will have to produce religious teachers  and\r\n\r\nleaders required by the Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not all madrasah graduates have the inclination or\r\n\r\nability to go on to become religious teachers and scholars;  nor\r\n\r\ndo  we  need  all the graduates of madrasahs to  go  into  these\r\n\r\nvocations.   This  means that those who do  not  go  into  these\r\n\r\nvocations  or   who  fail to complete  their madrasah  education\r\n\r\nwill have to secure other employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS will continue to revamp the madrasah curricula to\r\n\r\nenhance  the teaching skills of teachers and also to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe management and administration of madrasahs.   Apart from the\r\n\r\nexisting   core  curriculum  of  religious  subjects,   English,\r\n\r\nMathematics  and  Science  are also  taught  in  madrasahs.   IT\r\n\r\nliteracy  programme will also be introduced in  madrasahs.   The\r\n\r\ncurriculum time and subject combination will be revised to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  dual needs for a trained workforce and a qualified pool  of\r\n\r\nreligious  workers  for the community.  More  students  will  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to sit for the `O' and `A' level examinations.    And\r\n\r\nthese   measures,   hopefully,  will  help   to   increase   the\r\n\r\nemployability of madrasah graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is also looking into the streaming of students at the\r\n\r\nprimary  level,  so  that  weaker students  can  be  given  more\r\n\r\nattention.   This, together with better trained  teachers,  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  reduce the high attrition rate in madrasahs, which  is\r\n\r\nanother concern about the system mentioned by Mr Hawazi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul may be pleased to know that National Education\r\n\r\nwill  be incorporated in the madrasah system.  An MOE-MUIS joint\r\n\r\ncommittee  on  National Education has been formed to  study  and\r\n\r\nhelp  the implementation of NE in madrasahs.  MUIS has  met  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  and  they  have supported  the  inclusion  of  NE  in\r\n\r\nmadrasahs,   which  also  plan  to have  joint  programmes  with\r\n\r\nmainstream  schools as a way of enhancing the common Singaporean\r\n\r\nidentity.  These and other measures mentioned earlier will  help\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbring   the   madrasahs  in  tandem  with  national  needs   and\r\n\r\naspirations, as proposed by the Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch briefly again on the question by Dr Vasoo\r\n\r\nabout  what are we doing about the service conditions of  social\r\n\r\nworkers.   The Ministry, as I mentioned earlier in my answer  to\r\n\r\nMadam  Claire Chiang, is looking into how the service conditions\r\n\r\nof  the  social workers can be improved.  Because we  know  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  onerous jobs and we know that we are really  competing\r\n\r\nfor  manpower  against  the other industries.   So  we  will  be\r\n\r\nlooking into how we can improve their service conditions and  we\r\n\r\nwill  also  be looking into their training needs, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sports, I wish to thank Mr Choo Wee Khiang for\r\n\r\ncomplimenting us on what we did for Toa Payoh Stadium.  We  have\r\n\r\nair-conditioned the stadium and I think the table tennis players\r\n\r\nnow  are  playing  in a much more comfortable  environment  than\r\n\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards to funds for the NSAs, we are always looking at\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  help  the NSAs.  But the NSAs will  also  have  to\r\n\r\nconvince  and  show  us that they are running  the  Associations\r\n\r\nproperly and they have a proper management system.  So  we  will\r\n\r\nbe  looking into these criteria and we will extend all the  help\r\n\r\nthat we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of Gay World Stadium, the area is going to\r\n\r\nbe  redeveloped and, therefore, it is on annual TOL.  So we feel\r\n\r\nthat it is not economical for us to upgrade the stadium.  But we\r\n\r\nhave done something to the seating and whatever improvements  we\r\n\r\ncan,  but we thought it would not be economical for us to invest\r\n\r\ntoo  much funds to upgrade the stadium.  I hope the Member  will\r\n\r\nunderstand  what we can and cannot do to upgrade or improve  the\r\n\r\nGay  World  Stadium.  It is not because basketball is played  by\r\n\r\nChinese school students and therefore we are neglecting it.   It\r\n\r\nis  because  of  the  circumstances which surround  the  stadium\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CDCs and S-League, yes, we agree with the sentiments of\r\n\r\nMr Sinnakaruppan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  bonding  and  the  ability  of  football  and  sports  to\r\n\r\nencourage bonding among citizens.  We encourage the adoption  of\r\n\r\nS-League teams by CDCs.  Marine Parade CDC has done it.  Central\r\n\r\nCDC  and  also  Tanjong  Pagar CDC have done  it,  and  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to promote the idea to all the CDCs.  But  really  the\r\n\r\ndecision  would  have to be on the CDCs themselves  and  on  the\r\n\r\nteams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the change of names of teams, I leave it to\r\n\r\nthe  teams themselves, whether they want to call themselves  the\r\n\r\n\"Tanjong  Pagarers\"  or \"Marine Paraders\",  instead  of  calling\r\n\r\nthemselves the \"Cobras\" and the \"Stallions\" or whatever.

I fully agree with the need for the self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  to  see beyond the community.  And really the  important\r\n\r\nthing  is the leadership of these organisations.  The leadership\r\n\r\nmust  see  the importance of going beyond their own  communities\r\n\r\nand  seeing  themselves  as part of the whole  of  the  national\r\n\r\npopulation rather than as a small community which looks  inwards\r\n\r\ninto themselves.  I have encouraged joint programmes between the\r\n\r\nself-help groups and the CDCs.  They have in fact come up with a\r\n\r\njoint  project of setting up a family service centre  or  social\r\n\r\nservice centre which is at one of the CCCs in Toa Payoh.  So  we\r\n\r\nwill  try to encourage more of these joint programmes among  the\r\n\r\nself-help groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nhis reply.

This  is\r\n\r\nmade  up of $3,785 million for operating expenditure and  $1,915\r\n\r\nmillion  for development expenditure.  The total expenditure  on\r\n\r\neducation  constitutes 3.6% of GDP and 20% of  total  Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  For every $5 that Government spends,  $1  goes  to\r\n\r\neducation.   I  wish to commend the Government  for  giving  top\r\n\r\npriority  to  education.  The Government  has  not  allowed  the\r\n\r\npresent  regional financial crisis to affect our  focus  on  the\r\n\r\nlong term competitiveness, growth and development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, brain power is the basis for Singapore's success today\r\n\r\nand the spring-board of our prospects tomorrow.  If we look back\r\n\r\non  our  lives,  we  can remember fondly the teachers  who  have\r\n\r\naffected  us.   We  will readily attribute our  development  and\r\n\r\nachievements  to  those beloved teachers  who  had  excited  our\r\n\r\nimaginations  and set us on the path which we have  subsequently\r\n\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a human enterprise. It is people, teachers,\r\n\r\nstudents,  administrators and parents, who make  the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  success and failure in our school system.  But teachers\r\n\r\nare  the key.  Teachers open the door to new knowledge and moral\r\n\r\nvalues.   Teachers  are  at the forefront of  implementation  of\r\n\r\nschool and educational policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the classrooms, teachers wield considerable influence on\r\n\r\nthe  students  in  the  way they teach  and  behave.   There  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  a  link  between  teacher-effectiveness  and  school\r\n\r\nperformance.   The  planned changes in  the  National  Education\r\n\r\nprogramme,  information  technology,  creativity  and   thinking\r\n\r\nskills  and curriculum review, will not be successful if  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  the  support  and commitment of  the  teachers.   The\r\n\r\nteachers must be persuaded to own the new approaches in teaching\r\n\r\nmethodology, instructional materials and assessment  modes.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  find  new  and  better ways  to  involve  teachers  in\r\n\r\nempowering  them  to  enhance their work performance  and  bring\r\n\r\nabout  the  desired  outcomes  in  our  students.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  give  us an update on the progress  made  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the key initiatives of the Education Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has done much in recent years to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  salaries and conditions of service  for  teachers.\r\n\r\nThe  anticipated  slower growth of the economy may  require  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service to either freeze or moderate the salary increases\r\n\r\nof  public sector employees.  I hope the Ministry will  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully  whether  any  wage restraint exercise  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice should be extended to those in the Education Service.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  there is still some catching  up  to  do  in  the\r\n\r\nremuneration  package of the teachers.  Now is a good  time  for\r\n\r\nour  teachers  to  be recognised and rewarded  with  competitive\r\n\r\nsalaries, promotion and career development opportunities.   This\r\n\r\nwill enhance the status of teachers in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the salaries and fringe benefits, there are other\r\n\r\naspects of the job that can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuplift  the morale of the teachers.  Teacher-principal  relation\r\n\r\nis  important.  The transfers and postings of principals to  new\r\n\r\nschools  should be better planned and communicated to  teachers,\r\n\r\nstudents  and parents.  Teachers are affected by the  leadership\r\n\r\nand   competencies  of  principals  in  making  firm  and   fair\r\n\r\ndecisions.   Teachers  are  also  affected  when  they  perceive\r\n\r\ninequitable distribution of workload assigned by the  principal.\r\n\r\nTeachers  also  lament that they have to take on  administrative\r\n\r\nand  clerical work at the expense of their teaching  roles.   We\r\n\r\nshould  build  and develop more trusting relationship  and  team\r\n\r\nspirit  among  principals  and  teachers  in  our  school.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  has already provided school administrators in  schools\r\n\r\nand  launched  the School Clusters Scheme.  I wish  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  on the improvements made towards achieving  excellence\r\n\r\nin  the management of our schools.  Perhaps it is also time  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to  seriously  consider  the  setting  up  of   a\r\n\r\nPrincipals  College to train and develop potential  talents  and\r\n\r\nthose already holding the principal's position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry's budget, 511 temporary and relief staff\r\n\r\npositions  have  been done away with.  Does  it  mean  that  the\r\n\r\npositions have been regularised and made permanent?  In the  new\r\n\r\nfinancial year there is the need to recruit 1,750 teachers.   We\r\n\r\nneed  highly  committed and dedicated individuals  to  join  the\r\n\r\nteaching profession.  With the recent large intakes of  new  and\r\n\r\nyounger  teachers, I would imagine that the median age  and  the\r\n\r\naverage  length of service of teachers will be  lower.   We  may\r\n\r\nhave  better  educated and more knowledgeable  teachers,  but  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether they have the necessary experience and  maturity\r\n\r\nto  handle,  for  example,  the teenage  students  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that we are short of English Language\r\n\r\nteachers.  This has affected the general performance of students\r\n\r\nin the \"O\" level examinations in English Language.  What are the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  plans in attracting and retaining very good  English\r\n\r\nLanguage teachers in our schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there\r\n\r\nis a Chinese saying,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If  you  are my teacher for a day, I will respect you like   my\r\n\r\nfather  for my whole life time\".  This saying reflects how  much\r\n\r\nrespect students in the old days had for their teachers.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso said that a successful teacher would have students all over\r\n\r\nthe  world.  This saying affirms the social status of  teachers.\r\n\r\nWith  the changes of time, students are difficult to teach, even\r\n\r\nparents  are  harder to handle and the pressure on  teachers  is\r\n\r\nincreasing  day  by  day.  The question of how  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nmorale of teachers is a great challenge.  There are four reasons\r\n\r\nfor  this.  One, generally parent's educational level is  higher\r\n\r\nand   therefore   their  expectations   on  the   teachers   are\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly higher.  As a result, their respect for teachers\r\n\r\nalso  correspondingly  declines  and  some  even  criticise  the\r\n\r\nteachers  and interfere with their methods of teaching  --   and\r\n\r\nthis is a big blow to the dignity of our teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the past, teachers enjoyed a very high social\r\n\r\nstatus.  Society generally respected the teachers and emphasised\r\n\r\non  morals.  Now, the number of children in the family is  small\r\n\r\nand parents both go to work.  Accordingly, their way of bringing\r\n\r\nup  children  is  different and this again further  weakens  the\r\n\r\nstudents' respect for their teachers.  On the other hand,  there\r\n\r\nis  this  problem  of knowledge explosion and so  the  teachers,\r\n\r\nstudents and parents have to do all they can in the pursuit  and\r\n\r\ntransmission of knowledge and therefore the question  of  stress\r\n\r\non morale also begins to decline in the minds of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, with the advancement in science and technology, it\r\n\r\nis  difficult  for us to catch up with the time, especially  for\r\n\r\nthe  older  teachers  who  will find it  more  difficult.   Some\r\n\r\nteachers,  particularly  the  older  ones,   have  developed   a\r\n\r\ntechnology  phobia.   In fact, technology itself  is  making  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  us to catch up with the times.   Especially  for\r\n\r\nolder  teachers, they will find it more difficult.  And so  some\r\n\r\nteachers  are  beginning to take courses  to  learn  the  latest\r\n\r\ntechnology available to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the syllabi and curricula of schools have also\r\n\r\nbeen  changing  all  the  time.   Now,  apart  from  the  normal\r\n\r\ncurricula and syllabi, the teachers have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook after National Education, thinking and creativity, computer\r\n\r\nteaching,  etc.   As a result, they are highly stressed  in  the\r\n\r\nclassroom and they really crave that they can have \"three  heads\r\n\r\nand  six  arms\".  That shows how much pressure  is  put  on  the\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the teachers have to upgrade themselves to catch\r\n\r\nup  with the latest technology.  On the other hand, the pace  of\r\n\r\nthe schools is on the move all the time and they may well suffer\r\n\r\nthe   \"fatigue  syndrome\".   If  we  do  not  face  up  to  this\r\n\r\nphenomenon, it will only worsen the morale of the teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Budget, I really appreciate the Minister's\r\n\r\nvision.   The Minister for Education has stressed the importance\r\n\r\nof  professional  training  and it has  also  committed  to  the\r\n\r\nupgrading of teachers in their skills.  I hope that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education can go one step further to give the teachers  more\r\n\r\nsupport.  This will not only improve their salaries and  service\r\n\r\nconditions, but more importantly, they must go a step further to\r\n\r\nimprove  the social status of teachers, and the kind of  respect\r\n\r\nthey  used  to enjoy in the past.  We must affirm the  teachers'\r\n\r\nposition  so  that  they can develop their  professionalism  and\r\n\r\nteach our next generation better.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, schools\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  are  well-equipped with first class  hardware  in\r\n\r\nterms of school buildings, classrooms,  computers, teaching aids\r\n\r\nand  other facilities.  Our students enjoy studying in  a  high-tech  and  comfortable  environment.   However,   in  terms   of\r\n\r\nsoftware, we are quite inadequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about having \"thinking school\" and creativity,\r\n\r\nhaving  good   hardware  is  not  enough.   Creativity  is   not\r\n\r\nsomething that you can learn in the classroom.   Creativity must\r\n\r\nbe inculcated through experience in the reality of life.  If you\r\n\r\nwant  to  catch the light at the end of the tunnel, you must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to go through the dark passage in life, work hard  and\r\n\r\npersevere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged the parents and students\r\n\r\nnot to narrowly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npursue more \"A\" grades, and neglect the importance of moulding a\r\n\r\nperfect character.  I fully agree with him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest mission of education is to cultivate the\r\n\r\nstudents  through the five aspects of education, namely,  moral,\r\n\r\nintellectual,  physical, community and aesthetic  education,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can mould a perfect character on the basis  of  moral\r\n\r\nvalues,   knowledge,  physical  fitness,  social  concept,   and\r\n\r\naesthetic appreciation.    Only in this way can  we assure  that\r\n\r\nthe future generations of Singaporeans are capable of playing  a\r\n\r\nmore  important  role when our nation faces  greater  challenges\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of this principle, I appeal to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education to include the behaviour and conduct of students as\r\n\r\npart  of  the  criteria for admission to secondary  schools  and\r\n\r\ninstitutes  of  higher  learning.   So  students  with  slightly\r\n\r\ninferior  academic results, but have good \"A\" or \"B\"  grades  in\r\n\r\ntheir  conduct  marks,  can  also have  the  opportunity  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  to  the better secondary schools, junior  colleges  or\r\n\r\nuniversities.  This will indirectly encourage students and their\r\n\r\nparents  to attach more importance to seek perfection  in  their\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also call upon all the schools to set up an\r\n\r\n\"Excellent  Conduct Award\" for every standard  and  every  class\r\n\r\neach  year.   We  should not put our emphasis only  on  academic\r\n\r\nresults.   Excellence  in  conduct  and  behaviour  is  just  as\r\n\r\nimportant.   By  focusing on how many \"As\"  and  neglecting  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of the students is an imbalance in the whole  education\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a large extent, the conduct of students is influenced by\r\n\r\nthe  school environment, the words and deeds of the teachers and\r\n\r\nthe  principal.  This is what the Chinese described as  wei  ren\r\n\r\nshi  biao (be a model of virtue for others).   Recently, I  read\r\n\r\nin  the  newspaper a real-life story of how a group of secondary\r\n\r\none  students  of  the Class of 63 in Thomson  Secondary  School\r\n\r\ninserted an advertisement in the newspaper, some 34 years later,\r\n\r\nto look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  a certain teacher whom they were very fond of but had  lost\r\n\r\ncontact  with.    They  found the teacher and  had  a  memorable\r\n\r\nreunion.   I  was very touched by this report.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister has read this report in the newspaper.   If\r\n\r\nhe has not, I can supply him with the relevant cuttings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that to mould the perfect character of the students,\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility must lie squarely with the principal and the\r\n\r\nteachers.   Credit must also be given when it is  due.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  suggest  that the Ministry of  Education  set  up  an\r\n\r\n\"Engineer  of  the  Soul  Award\" to show appreciation  to  those\r\n\r\nprincipals  and teachers who have worked their hearts  out  with\r\n\r\nperseverance and dedication to education throughout their  whole\r\n\r\nlife-time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I try to remember the good teachers I had the good\r\n\r\nfortune  of  coming under during my 10-odd years in  school,   I\r\n\r\ncannot hardly count  beyond my five fingers.  So if we do not do\r\n\r\nsomething to encourage these good teachers, how are we going  to\r\n\r\nbuild  the good character of our students?  I think it would  be\r\n\r\nvery  difficult.

For a small nation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour students have done well, often times performing better in\r\n\r\ninternational examinations and surveys than their counterparts\r\n\r\nfrom larger and more developed countries.  Credit must go to our\r\n\r\nteachers and students.  However, in a very rapidly changing\r\n\r\nworld, our education system must continue to change to keep\r\n\r\nabreast of the fast changing time, better still we should strive\r\n\r\nto move ahead of new requirements.  But this is no easy task.\r\n\r\nFor what we are seeking to do to our education system is not to\r\n\r\nrepair a defective one but to make a good system better and more\r\n\r\nsuitable for a demanding and uncertain future.  This is a\r\n\r\ndifficult task which carries heavy responsibilities and requires\r\n\r\nmuch care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has done very well in bringing\r\n\r\nchange to the education system.  One area that deserves mention\r\n\r\nis for the efforts to improve the management of our schools.\r\n\r\nSeveral innovative management initiatives like school cluster\r\n\r\nand the appointment of administrative assistants and operation\r\n\r\nmanagers have been introduced.  I was proud to read that the UK\r\n\r\nintroduced the cluster school management concept at the end of\r\n\r\n1997, long after we had implemented it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers are a critical educational resource. Good\r\n\r\nmanagement of our schools is crucial to draw out the potential\r\n\r\nin our teachers.  Good managers motivate their staff and bring\r\n\r\nout the best in them.  I would recommend that principals adopt a\r\n\r\nmore business management approach towards running their schools.\r\n\r\nPrincipals should therefore be introduced to modern management\r\n\r\nknowledge and techniques used in business, especially in the\r\n\r\narea of human resource management.  I believe the business\r\n\r\nschools in our universities can help in this task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent salary adjustments, promotion exercise and\r\n\r\ngreater flexibility and opportunities to upgrade themselves have\r\n\r\nbeen great morale boosters to the teachers.  They are better\r\n\r\nmotivated when the Ministry is responsive to their needs.  They\r\n\r\nfeel that the Ministry cares about them and has their interest\r\n\r\nin mind.  The public will also view the teaching profession with\r\n\r\ngreater and higher regard. With all these changes, I look forward\r\n\r\nto greater motivation and a higher morale \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong our teachers, students and parents and\r\n\r\nbetter performance and discipline from our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the courses that the Ministry has\r\n\r\nintroduced to upgrade our teachers.  The Ministry has introduced\r\n\r\nmany innovations like IT and new teaching and assessment methods\r\n\r\ninto our schools.  It is vital that our teachers are properly\r\n\r\ntrained and equipped to handle these innovations.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nhas introduced many training courses, including IT courses, to\r\n\r\nimpart these new skills and knowledge to our teachers.  The\r\n\r\nefficacy of these courses depends on the implementation of the\r\n\r\ntraining programme.  I hope that the Ministry will look into\r\n\r\nways to make the implementation process more effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some feedback which may be of help. Teachers have\r\n\r\nexpressed three areas of concern, namely, the course schedule,\r\n\r\nthe course content and the use of the newly acquired knowledge\r\n\r\nand skills.  Teachers, generally, have difficulties juggling\r\n\r\ntheir training schedule with a full load of teaching duties.\r\n\r\nSome principals have helped by rescheduling activities and\r\n\r\nothers have given their teachers time off to attend training.\r\n\r\nThe support of the principal is crucial.  Teachers want their\r\n\r\nprincipals to understand their difficulties and to show support\r\n\r\nfor training, both in words and deeds.  Secondly, teachers\r\n\r\nquickly lose their newly acquired knowledge and skills if these\r\n\r\nare not put to use.  Teachers have to use the new knowledge and\r\n\r\nskills in order to deepen their understanding of it and to\r\n\r\ninternalise it.  They must be encouraged and given opportunities\r\n\r\nto do so.  If this is not done, they will quickly forget what\r\n\r\nthey learn.  It will be a case of training for training's sake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the course content. Some teachers found\r\n\r\nthe courses too theoretical.  They prefer to start with\r\n\r\npractical courses which they can use immediately.  They can move\r\n\r\non to intermediate and advanced level courses after they have\r\n\r\ngained some experience and confidence with the new technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now move on to the needs to reduce the course\r\n\r\ncontent to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearning  easier  and  more efficient  for  our  students.   Our\r\n\r\nchildren work very hard in schools.  The result of their  effort\r\n\r\nis good grades and success.  In the future where information and\r\n\r\nknowledge decide the outcomes of competition, our students  must\r\n\r\nalso  acquire the ability to think more and to be more  creative\r\n\r\nand  innovative.  Our students must therefore continue to  score\r\n\r\nin   their   examinations  while  becoming  more  creative   and\r\n\r\ninnovative  in  their thinking process.  At the same  time,  one\r\n\r\nshould not be achieved at the expense of the other.  This is  no\r\n\r\neasy  task.  If we do not do it right, our students will  become\r\n\r\nmore  stressed  out.  One way is to help our students  to  study\r\n\r\nmore  efficiently.  With interconnected computers, there is less\r\n\r\nneed  to memorise volumes of information which has grown rapidly\r\n\r\nover  the years, partly also a consequence of IT.  But no matter\r\n\r\nhow  easily accessible facts and information become, each  child\r\n\r\nmust still acquire a core set of facts, knowledge and skills  in\r\n\r\norder  to  make  use of the volume of information  that  can  be\r\n\r\naccessed on the network.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning can be made easier if we pare down the volume of\r\n\r\ninformation to this core of facts and knowledge that we need to\r\n\r\nteach our students.  This will free time in the curriculum for\r\n\r\nother activities which can be organised to help develop their\r\n\r\nthinking, creative and innovative skills.  I have been told that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry is already doing this and in some subjects, they\r\n\r\nhave been able to scale down the content by as much as 30%.  I\r\n\r\nwould like the Ministry to make more urgent efforts in this\r\n\r\narea.  We should make more use of the Internet as a teaching\r\n\r\ntool and its vast store of information as educational resources.\r\n\r\nWe should thus give our students better and easier access to the\r\n\r\nInternet.  Our students therefore need to be proficient in the\r\n\r\nuse of information technology.  In the new millennium, every\r\n\r\nstudent who misses the opportunity to be computer literate will\r\n\r\nbe handicapped.  We must not delay the IT programme to equip our\r\n\r\nschools with computers for our students to work on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand to imbue our teachers with the resources and skills to teach\r\n\r\nwith the computer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to add that preparing teaching materials\r\n\r\nand resources is a time consuming and tedious process.  For\r\n\r\nteachers new to the technology, it is in fact also a daunting\r\n\r\nand intimidating task.  I would like the Ministry to consider a\r\n\r\ncentralised effort to produce such teaching materials and\r\n\r\nresources to assist the teachers.  Such a centralised body would\r\n\r\nallow teachers to seek help, especially when they start to use\r\n\r\nIT in their work.  The use of common syllabi in our schools\r\n\r\nmakes a centralised effort practical and feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me touch on the topic of technical\r\n\r\neducation and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).  Four\r\n\r\nof every 10 of our young will not go to the polytechnic or\r\n\r\nuniversities.  They will go to work or proceed to the Institute\r\n\r\nof Technical Education where they will acquire practical skills\r\n\r\nneeded by our companies.  The first batch of the Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) stream students has completed their secondary\r\n\r\neducation.  Some of these students have come to seek my help to\r\n\r\nget them into ITE courses.  I hope that this is an indication\r\n\r\nthat our students have accepted ITE as an educational path.\r\n\r\nHowever, the shortage of places suggests that IT has some work\r\n\r\non its hand to either re-allocate its teaching resources to the\r\n\r\nmore popular courses or to sell the less popular but  important\r\n\r\ncourses to the students.  As the first batch of Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) students has passed through the portals of our\r\n\r\nschools and ITE, I would like the Ministry to update and apprise\r\n\r\nthe House of the progress made by students in the Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) stream and ITE in providing technical education to\r\n\r\nour young.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to make two\r\n\r\nsuggestions to the Minister.  One, is to introduce education\r\n\r\nprogrammes, especially for parents, to make them better and more\r\n\r\neffective tutors at home and, two, to provide a more flexible\r\n\r\nand accessible training programmes for teachers in recognition\r\n\r\nof the great demand placed on our teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent study conducted by the AMP involving some 2,004\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim workers, it was found that Malay/Muslim parents now\r\n\r\nhave much higher aspirations for their children in education.\r\n\r\n61% of them want their children to obtain at least a polytechnic\r\n\r\ndiploma.  That is the good news.  In fact, more parents want\r\n\r\ntheir children to obtain higher degrees like Masters and PhDs.\r\n\r\nThe result of this survey was in fact recently published in the\r\n\r\nBerita Harian.  But the not-so-good news is that, of this 61%,\r\n\r\nmore than half of the parents are uncertain of ways to help\r\n\r\ntheir children to succeed academically.  I am sure a lot more\r\n\r\nare incapable of teaching, guiding or tutoring their children at\r\n\r\nhome.  While I do not have any empirical evidence of the\r\n\r\nsituation in other communities, I believe there is some\r\n\r\nrelevance here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was extremely disturbed by these statistics. It has\r\n\r\ntaken this country and community so much and for so long to give\r\n\r\nparents the hope, promise and optimism and the feeling that in\r\n\r\nSingapore, despite differences in race, language, religion and\r\n\r\nincome group, their children have equal opportunities to\r\n\r\nprogress and achieve the desired academic success.  But there is\r\n\r\na danger that parents may become frustrated and disappointed if\r\n\r\nthey continue to feel helpless to assist and guide their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed this matter with a number of parents and\r\n\r\nfound that even those with tertiary education have some problems\r\n\r\nunderstanding, let alone tutoring their primary school children\r\n\r\nin Mathematics.  Some, for example, especially among the more\r\n\r\naffluent, have found it necessary to attend special classes\r\n\r\norganised to guide and help parents on ways and methods of\r\n\r\ntutoring their children.  Many of these parents have discovered\r\n\r\nthat the methods and concepts taught in school today are alien\r\n\r\nto many of them.  Quite naturally, some of these parents see\r\n\r\ntuition as the only solution to these problems.  In fact, some\r\n\r\nof them feel inadequate if their children are not getting enough\r\n\r\ntuition compared to their peers.  This brings about a host of\r\n\r\nother problems, namely, stress, excessive workload, complaints\r\n\r\nof high tuition fees.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink we should not allow parents to feel that the academic\r\n\r\nachievement is dependent upon the amount of tuition that\r\n\r\nstudents get.  Parental guidance and help are more significant\r\n\r\nfactors.  I am therefore suggesting to the Minister to structure\r\n\r\na programme to prepare and equip parents so that they can play\r\n\r\nan effective role as teachers and tutors at home.  Self-help\r\n\r\ngroups can also have such programmes by making parents the\r\n\r\nfacilitators in their children's education.  We must demonstrate\r\n\r\nand emphasise that the teaching and education of our children is\r\n\r\nas much the responsibility of parents as it is for teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on another point that was raised by\r\n\r\nsome other Members earlier and that is with regard to teacher\r\n\r\ntraining.  I would like to ask the Minister on the type and\r\n\r\nscope of training that teachers receive in order to keep pace\r\n\r\nwith increasing demands placed on them.  I sympathise with the\r\n\r\nteachers who are under tremendous pressure from parents and\r\n\r\nsociety to produce and nurture creative, disciplined, well-rounded, eloquent, IT literate students with the right moral and\r\n\r\nnational values.  It is a very difficult task indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But teachers do need training in all these matters,\r\n\r\nincluding IT skills, problem solving and many others.  It  would\r\n\r\nindeed  be  very  difficult for the Ministry to provide  such  a\r\n\r\ndiverse  range  of  training for teachers through  its  in-house\r\n\r\ntraining  programme.   I  personally  would  like  to  see  more\r\n\r\nteachers  attending privately run seminars and  conferences  and\r\n\r\nhope   that   teachers  are  given  greater  accessibility   and\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  attend  such courses.   Perhaps,  through  such\r\n\r\ninteraction,  we can enhance the profile and image  of  teachers\r\n\r\nand instill greater understanding amongst parents and society at\r\n\r\nlarge  of  the  huge responsibilities and pressure our  teachers\r\n\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, it is easy to think of ways to spend\r\n\r\nmoney  to  build  good  schools and  provide  the  hardware  for\r\n\r\nschools,  like  computers and the sort of  equipment  that  they\r\n\r\nneed.  These can all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  listed  out.   I  think it is important to  talk  about  the\r\n\r\nsoftware  that goes into the schools, the children and  what  we\r\n\r\nput into their minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, creative people are divergent thinkers. They tend to\r\n\r\ncome  to different conclusions from the majority of us.  I  have\r\n\r\nread somewhere that Thomas Edison, for example, was deaf in  one\r\n\r\near, because he had been boxed as a child for misbehaviour.   We\r\n\r\nhave  got  a  society that tends to, they say, build  conformist\r\n\r\npatterns  in  children, and this is a clear  way  of  destroying\r\n\r\ncreativity  of people who are divergent thinkers.  Children  who\r\n\r\nact differently, think differently or give different answers are\r\n\r\nlooked  upon  as  being too smart, too big for  the  shoes  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, punished and suppressed in normal schools.   I  think\r\n\r\nwe need to think of ways of changing that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also burdened with all sorts of programmes.\r\n\r\nMany  of  these programmes are, of course, introduced with  good\r\n\r\nintentions,   with  well-meaning  purposes.   But   when   these\r\n\r\nprogrammes are implemented in schools, they are done  in  rather\r\n\r\nunthinking  ways.  There are all sorts of enrichment programmes,\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  teach  children  IT,  programmes  that   teach\r\n\r\nchildren  who  are bad in their mother tongue to pick  up  their\r\n\r\nskills, remedial classes, even community service hours for  them\r\n\r\nto  learn how to serve others.  Our children are very, very busy\r\n\r\npeople.   They have so many things to do.  Sir, I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe  schools  actually do think carefully of  how  to  implement\r\n\r\nthis, whether the schools give the rationale to the children, so\r\n\r\nthat  the  children grow up learning why they  are  doing  these\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thinking schools, we need to reduce the academic load\r\n\r\nsomehow,  because there is this irresistible desire for  schools\r\n\r\n(and  parents,  I  suppose, pressuring  the  schools)  to  teach\r\n\r\nprimary  6 work, for example, in primary 4.  And drill  for  GEP\r\n\r\naptitude test.  I think this is ridiculous.  Creating needs time\r\n\r\nto  think.  Play aids creativity.  I think we need to give  back\r\n\r\nto our children time to play, time to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren,   time  to  do  things  that  fill   up   their   time\r\n\r\nmeaningfully.  And not just to see that if there  is  some  time\r\n\r\nleft, they must not be given time to be idle, let's fill it  up.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have  teachers and parents who have this temptation  and\r\n\r\nthey say, \"Well, you have got a long weekend ahead.  Chinese New\r\n\r\nYear  is coming, many days of holidays, I think you need  to  do\r\n\r\nsome  homework.\"  And then piles of homework are given to  them.\r\n\r\nHow  do  they enjoy their long weekends and holidays then?   And\r\n\r\nhow do we give them time to play and learn to be creative?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think creativity perhaps needs to be nurtured, but I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  creativity can be taught.  How  would  creative\r\n\r\nteachers  be identified?  Because if creativity can  be  taught,\r\n\r\nsurely they must be taught by creative teachers.  Otherwise, how\r\n\r\ndo uncreative teachers teach creativity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a pertinent question to think about, and we\r\n\r\ncertainly do know that we have got a lot of good teachers.   But\r\n\r\nI think it is not every teacher that knows how to be creative or\r\n\r\nknows how to teach creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sending a lot of teachers, in a way, back to school,\r\n\r\nto  seminars and workshops to learn things that they perhaps did\r\n\r\nnot  learn when they were in the teachers' training school.   We\r\n\r\nare  sending  them  to do all these things because  we  want  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills and improve their professionalism.  But  we\r\n\r\nalso  need to be careful that we do not fill our teachers'  time\r\n\r\nso  much  that they too have no time to think.  And if  teachers\r\n\r\nhave  no time to think, how can they teach students to think  in\r\n\r\nthe thinking schools?   Tired teachers have no time to think and\r\n\r\nplan.  Tired teachers have no ability to rest, read, refresh and\r\n\r\nkeep  up to date.  If this happens, we are not going to get  our\r\n\r\nthinking and creative schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to mention that we need to be careful\r\n\r\nwhen we plan all these programmes with purpose and good meaning,\r\n\r\nbut  they  may be implemented in a way that is not expected.   I\r\n\r\nknow, for example, that the Ministry of Education sets some very\r\n\r\nreasonable standards.  But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  policy makers must remember that at the ground, things  are\r\n\r\nlooked  at  differently.   And if they  do  not  understand  the\r\n\r\nrationale of some of the programmes that are being introduced at\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry level, they are going to do it their own way,  and\r\n\r\nthey are just going to look at it as yet another thing to do  to\r\n\r\nimprove the ranking.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, we live in a society that venerates the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the  teacher.   Over the past  year  or  so,  we  have\r\n\r\nwitnessed  many  Government initiatives on the education  front.\r\n\r\nNational  Education, information technology and creativity  have\r\n\r\nbeen  at  the  core.  I would like to look at these  initiatives\r\n\r\nfrom the perspective of the teacher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new initiatives have brought about considerable\r\n\r\nchange in the school environment.  Teachers have had to adapt to\r\n\r\nnew  technologies.  They are asked to incorporate new  pedagogic\r\n\r\nmethods in their classroom.  At the same time, they have to deal\r\n\r\nwith   extra-curricular  activities  and  other   administrative\r\n\r\nduties.   It  would  not  be an exaggeration  to  say  that  our\r\n\r\nteachers  have found life becoming a little bit more  hectic,  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more stressful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in part, to address these concerns, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  for some information on initiatives  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry in a few areas.  The first area pertains to curriculum.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Addendum  to  the President's Address  last  year,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  announced  that efforts would be made  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   This is an initiative much awaited,  not  just  by\r\n\r\nstudents and teachers, but also the parents.  In particular,  it\r\n\r\nwould   give  teachers  the  capacity  to  undertake   the   new\r\n\r\ninitiatives the Ministry has introduced with greater vigour.  So\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if the Minister could give us an update on\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in a somewhat mundane but I think very important\r\n\r\nadministrative arena, can more be done to help and  support  our\r\n\r\nteachers  in  schools?  Some of our staff rooms look  like  they\r\n\r\nhave  remained unchanged since the 60s and 70s, and yet we  live\r\n\r\nin  an  era where systems furniture and open office systems  are\r\n\r\nthe  norm.   Similarly, it is not unusual to find a computer  on\r\n\r\nevery desk or every other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesk  in  the commercial world.  This is certainly not  yet  the\r\n\r\ncase  in  our  staff  rooms.  I know the  Minister  has  already\r\n\r\nundertaken  initiatives to address this.  I would appreciate  it\r\n\r\nif we could understand the progress and the targets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, according recognition to our teachers is extremely\r\n\r\nimportant.  In  part,  this  is  done  through  the  competitive\r\n\r\nremuneration.    And  I  know  the  Ministry  has  conducted   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  review last year and recently, and will  continue\r\n\r\nto  monitor  this  situation.  It is the non-monetary  arena  in\r\n\r\nwhich I am concerned.  I think more can be done.  We have annual\r\n\r\nevents  like  Teachers' Day to acknowledge their  contributions.\r\n\r\nBut I think it is more than just one localised annual event, and\r\n\r\nit is certainly not the responsibility of just the Ministry, the\r\n\r\nstudents  or  the  teachers.   I  think  our  society  and   our\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  as  a  whole, should cultivate  this  culture  of\r\n\r\nconstantly  recognising our teachers' contributions.   Recently,\r\n\r\nthe  Lianhe  Zaobao  introduced an award for excellence  in  the\r\n\r\nteaching of Mandarin.  I wonder if this could be emulated by the\r\n\r\nother vernacular media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in every day's Straits Times, we have at least 4-6\r\n\r\npages  of business news and 15 minutes on TCS talking about  the\r\n\r\nachievements  of corporations and their leaders.   We  have  400\r\n\r\nover  schools.  We have about 300-350 listed companies.   Surely\r\n\r\nwe  can do something similar, if not on a weekly or daily basis,\r\n\r\nthen  perhaps on a fortnightly basis to highlight some of  their\r\n\r\naccomplishments.  After all, our future wealth creators  are  in\r\n\r\nthese schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in keeping with the spirit of thinking schools and\r\n\r\nlearning  nation,  I  believe it is very  important  for  us  to\r\n\r\nconstantly   think   of  our  teachers  and   learn   of   their\r\n\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the Education Ministry has\r\n\r\nsucceeded in attracting many candidates as teachers.  Its bumper\r\n\r\nharvest  can help overcome the shortage of teachers  and  enable\r\n\r\nnew programmes to be implemented in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot rest on one's laurels, because it\r\n\r\nappears that we need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany teachers not only to take the place of those who retire  or\r\n\r\nresign,  but also to reduce the burden experienced by  teachers.\r\n\r\nIf  we  look around, we can see that many schools are forced  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on  temporary teachers, because teachers who  retire  or\r\n\r\nresign or fall ill are not immediately replaced by permanent  or\r\n\r\nfull-time  teachers.   This results  in  many  of  the  students\r\n\r\naffected  not getting the full guidance in the subjects  taught.\r\n\r\nIs the Education Ministry looking into this problem and how does\r\n\r\nit intend to overcome it?  If we actually need more teachers, is\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry reviewing its policies on recruitment of  teachers\r\n\r\nwith overseas degrees?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge that the teaching profession needs teachers\r\n\r\nwho are dedicated, of good morals and are people who can educate\r\n\r\ntheir  students,  not only teach particular subjects.   However,\r\n\r\nwould it not be better if the Ministry reassesses its policy  on\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  graduate teachers from foreign universities  if\r\n\r\nthese people can contribute to the education of our children?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are some candidates with overseas degrees, who are\r\n\r\ncurrently employed as part-time teachers with graduate salaries,\r\n\r\nnot   offered  salaries  which  are  commensurate   with   their\r\n\r\nqualifications?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about teachers, I would also like to point out\r\n\r\nthe  need   for  the   Ministry to send teachers  who  are  more\r\n\r\ncapable as educators, guides and, what is no less important,  as\r\n\r\ndisciplinarians,  to  schools which are likely  to  accept  more\r\n\r\nstudents  with limited academic abilities.  This is so that  the\r\n\r\nteachers concerned can increase the motivation of the students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter that I would like to touch on is how our\r\n\r\nschools  fund  their  various activities while  their  operating\r\n\r\nbudgets  are becoming more restricted.  How can schools  provide\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  increase creativity, for example,  with  limited\r\n\r\nfunds?  Does this mean that we have to compromise the quality of\r\n\r\nour education?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Education could clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I would like to talk on higher\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities have budgetted an increase in student\r\n\r\nintake  in  the new financial year.  The question in the  public\r\n\r\nmind   is  how  many  of  the  places  will  actually   be   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, as the universities have announced plans  to  take\r\n\r\nin  more  foreign  undergraduate students.   With  the  regional\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis,  the  depreciation of  the  Singapore  dollar\r\n\r\nagainst  the US dollar and the British sterling pound,  and  the\r\n\r\nanticipated slower economic growth, there would be students  who\r\n\r\nhad  originally intended to study overseas, but  have  to  shelf\r\n\r\ntheir   plans  and  remain  in  Singapore  for  their   tertiary\r\n\r\neducation.  What then would be the impact of this on the student\r\n\r\nenrolment and the ability of the universities to accommodate all\r\n\r\nthe   students  who  meet  the  entry  requirements?   Will  the\r\n\r\nuniversities be able to expand its facilities quickly to take in\r\n\r\nlarger  intakes  of students if there is demand,  especially  in\r\n\r\nsome popular courses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the regional financial crisis persists for a prolonged\r\n\r\nperiod, the Ministry would have to accelerate the opening of the\r\n\r\nthird  university to take in the large number of  undergraduates\r\n\r\nwishing  to  remain in Singapore for their university education.\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister  give his assessment on  the  impact  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  regional financial crisis on the demand for  places  in\r\n\r\nour  universities in Singapore and how will the universities  be\r\n\r\ncoping with the situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities have recently announced that the future\r\n\r\nadmission  criteria for university would not be based solely  on\r\n\r\nacademic  results.   There is already  the  test  and  interview\r\n\r\nselection process conducted for students applying for courses in\r\n\r\nlaw  and  medicine at NUS.  How different is the  new  basis  of\r\n\r\nselection  for  university admission?  Can the Minister  explain\r\n\r\nthe  merits  of  this new entry system?  How do we  satisfy  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  and  their  parents, that they would  not  be  unduly\r\n\r\npenalised under the new system of admission?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have viewed this system to be subjective and are\r\n\r\nconcerned that the wrong selection could lead to unintended  and\r\n\r\nundesirable outcomes.  How do we assure the students  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be denied the opportunity of studying the courses  of\r\n\r\ntheir choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably under the new entry system more weightage would\r\n\r\nbe  given  to extra-curricular activities.  Would it  then  mean\r\n\r\nthat  those  youths  who  had represented  Singapore  either  in\r\n\r\nsports,  arts, music and culture, in international  competitions\r\n\r\nand  have  won medals, would be given automatic admissions  into\r\n\r\nour universities, if they meet the minimum entry requirements?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has recently informed prospective\r\n\r\napplicants  of Business Administration and Business  courses  at\r\n\r\nNUS  and  NTU,  that NTU would cease to offer  business  courses\r\n\r\nafter  year 2000.  Singapore Management University is a  private\r\n\r\nuniversity.  What would be the difference for students  choosing\r\n\r\nto  study either at the NUS or SMU?  What would be the focus and\r\n\r\norientation  of  NTU  when it no longer runs  business  courses?\r\n\r\nWhat  would  the vacated facilities at NTU be used  for  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture?   Would there be any difference in the fees payable  and\r\n\r\nthe  entry requirements between the two universities of NUS  and\r\n\r\nSMU?   Will  there  be an overall increase or  decrease  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of places for students pursuing business courses in  NUS\r\n\r\nand  SMU?   Would SMU be strictly a university for business  and\r\n\r\nfinance  related  courses?

Can  the\r\n\r\nOpen  University  be more flexible in its entry requirements  to\r\n\r\ncater  to  working adults who have made good progress  in  their\r\n\r\ncareers?   We should be open-minded and make it easy for  mature\r\n\r\nstudents  to  qualify  for admission into  the  Open  University\r\n\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really necessary for applicants to have relevant \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel  subjects  to  apply for courses in  the  Open  University\r\n\r\nDegree  Programme?  We are already facing a shortage of  English\r\n\r\nLanguage and Literature teachers.  If non-graduate teachers  who\r\n\r\nhave \"A\" levels in other arts subjects and have the interest  to\r\n\r\ndo  a degree in English Language and Literature, we should allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  do  so, provided they pass the entrance  examinations.\r\n\r\nAfter all, they need to work hard to earn their degrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister whether there are plans to\r\n\r\nexpand  the range of courses in the Open University to encourage\r\n\r\nmore working adults to take up continuing education programmes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been concerns expressed that the private\r\n\r\neducational  institutions  conducting twinning  programmes  with\r\n\r\noverseas  universities  may fall short  in  the  high  standards\r\n\r\nexpected of a university.  In such an important area of  quality\r\n\r\ncontrol, I do not think we should completely allow the market to\r\n\r\ndecide.  The Government can make the Open University a model for\r\n\r\nstandards  of  distant  learning courses  and  a  benchmark  for\r\n\r\ncomparison against private educational institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  state  that I am currently an academic staff member  of  the\r\n\r\nNational University of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a total of $1 billion is provided to our 2\r\n\r\nuniversities  for the financial year 1998.  The  average  annual\r\n\r\nsubsidy  per  student  is  stated to be,  at  NUS,  $18,300  per\r\n\r\nstudent,  and  at NTU, $15,200.  These are major investments  on\r\n\r\nour  universities  and their students.  The aim  is  to  provide\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  graduates having the  requisite  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills  for  employment and to promote research and  innovation.\r\n\r\nThe  broader vision sketched out by DPM, Dr Tony Tan, last  year\r\n\r\nin  the  debate on the President's Address, is to make  the  two\r\n\r\nuniversities  world-class and its graduates more  responsive  to\r\n\r\nlife-long  learning  and  changing circumstances.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals  was to broaden the curricula of the universities,  to\r\n\r\nhave courses such as history, regional cultures or language  and\r\n\r\nexpository writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, university or tertiary education is regarded as the\r\n\r\npinnacle  of  one's educational career.  Graduates usually  join\r\n\r\nthe  workforce after university.  At the university, the student\r\n\r\ntakes  a  degree course that may determine his career.  Economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  plays a large part in the student's  perception\r\n\r\nof what he or she should be reading at university.  Excelling in\r\n\r\nthe  subjects  that  are seen to be most relevant  to  employers\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  uppermost in the minds of most  students.   The\r\n\r\nproposal to broaden the curricula of the university is  seen  to\r\n\r\npromote  other objectives, besides job competence  and  economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   It  is  to arm the  graduate  with  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning  skills and a better appreciation of the  world  around\r\n\r\nthem.   Additionally, these subjects serve the more  traditional\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  university  education,  namely  to  build   civic\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and cultivate tolerance, in short, to produce a\r\n\r\nwell-rounded  educated person.  There are several  points,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  should be made concerning these broader aims of university\r\n\r\neducation.  I hope the Ministry will see fit to comment on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, and most important of all, unless the consumers buy\r\n\r\nthe  product, that is to say, unless they believe in  the  aims,\r\n\r\nall  will come to nought.  Subjects are learned, examined on and\r\n\r\ndiscarded  by semester.  At the end of the day, only  the  grade\r\n\r\ncounts.   To  avoid  this,  our  university  students  have   to\r\n\r\ninternalize  a  different set of values,  a  sense  of  pursuing\r\n\r\nknowledge  for  its own sake, a sense of civility,  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nculture, a sense of community.  Without a new perception on  the\r\n\r\npart of our students, there will only be the appearance that  we\r\n\r\nare doing the right thing.  This should be avoided at all costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the employers must believe in the broader\r\n\r\ncurricula.   Many enlightened employers do look at the  totality\r\n\r\nof  the  graduate's time at the university,  not  only  in  what\r\n\r\ngrades  he has obtained, but how broad the sweep of subjects  he\r\n\r\nhas  taken and the intellectual maturity that he displays.   But\r\n\r\nthere are also many who take a blinkered view and who would hire\r\n\r\nonly graduates who had done the subjects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmost  relevant  to the jobs.  This has to change.   Professional\r\n\r\nbodies  must take a more enlightened view about what is required\r\n\r\nfor professional competence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the home universities must provide the wherewithal\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  facilities and teaching to  foster  the  academic\r\n\r\ntradition.   There  must be intellectual autonomy,  intellectual\r\n\r\ncuriosity  and intellectual rigour to inspire and  motivate  the\r\n\r\nstudents.   The  worst  thing  that  could  happen  is  a  broad\r\n\r\ncurriculum, badly taught and half-heartedly learned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there must be recognition of the quality of the\r\n\r\nhome universities - that its faculties are comparable to some of\r\n\r\nthe  world's  best.  That recognition must be shown through  the\r\n\r\naward  of  prestigious scholarships and to the top  students  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Education would do its best to\r\n\r\npersuade   the  top  students,  the  scholars,  that  the   home\r\n\r\nuniversities  are  equal  to the task  of  providing  for  their\r\n\r\ntertiary  education.   Sir, the Government has  been  farsighted\r\n\r\nenough   to   continue  to  invest  heavily  in   the   tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   We  are  still  on  course  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nobjective.  For our home universities to be world-class, let  us\r\n\r\nalso ensure that our graduates are world-class.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to applaud\r\n\r\nthe   move  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  our  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions to fine-tune the admission criteria for  our  local\r\n\r\nuniversities.   The  encouragement of the  development  of  all-rounded  students, taking into account each student's  ECAs  and\r\n\r\nachievements,  personality and communication  skills,  deductive\r\n\r\ncapacity  and  general  knowledge,  is  a  step  in  the   right\r\n\r\ndirection,  as these attributes are necessary for graduates  and\r\n\r\nSingapore to succeed in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the objective of the new admission criteria is\r\n\r\nto  nurture all-rounded talents so that our graduates  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  be  equipped with specialised skills, but also be able  to\r\n\r\nconduct  themselves  gracefully when they  enter  working  life.\r\n\r\nSir, I understand the Ministry will appoint a panel or committee\r\n\r\nto review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  admission criteria and work out implementation details  for\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  to be effected in the year 2001.  I wish  to  raise\r\n\r\nsome concerns and suggestions to the Ministry as regards the new\r\n\r\nadmission criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, whilst I agree that greater emphasis should\r\n\r\nbe placed on ECA as a criterion for admission to the university,\r\n\r\nwe   should  not  over-emphasise  this.   Students  could  over-compensate, and parents could put undue stress on them to  spend\r\n\r\nan   exorbitant   amount  of  time  on   ECA.    The   resulting\r\n\r\nparticipation for the sake of participation might  detract  from\r\n\r\nany  benefits that these changes are designed to create and also\r\n\r\ncompromise  academic excellence, which has been the hallmark  of\r\n\r\nour  education  system all these years.  There  is  therefore  a\r\n\r\nneed,  Sir,  to  properly establish an optimum  balance  between\r\n\r\nacademic excellence and ECA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I believe there must be social consensus all\r\n\r\nround,  among parents, teachers and employers, that  indeed  the\r\n\r\nnew  admission criterion is in the interest of all, particularly\r\n\r\nin  producing  graduates who should be more forward-looking  and\r\n\r\nwho  have  to  compete with talents all over the world  as  they\r\n\r\nventure out to the region to seek opportunities in line with our\r\n\r\nmove  towards  regionalisation and globalisation.   To  do  this\r\n\r\nsuccessfully, and to gain acceptance, we must also  educate  and\r\n\r\nprepare  our  parents, our teachers and our employers,  on  this\r\n\r\nmove.  And I believe that we should start now and not wait  till\r\n\r\nthe  year  2001.   The  Government therefore  should  look  into\r\n\r\nimplementing  changes  to our education  system  and  employment\r\n\r\nscene  to  facilitate  this  process of  acceptance  and  social\r\n\r\nconsensus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in establishing new criteria for admission\r\n\r\ninto  our  universities, inevitably we have to  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nexperience of more well-known and established universities world-wide.   By all means, learn from the others, but I would caution\r\n\r\nagainst the wholesale adoption of a particular model, whether it\r\n\r\nis  based  on the US, UK, Australian or Japanese model.   May  I\r\n\r\ntherefore suggest that the Ministry look into the various models\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadopt whatever is relevant to our needs.  At the end of the day,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  must  develop our own admission  criteria,  given  the\r\n\r\nunique  nature  of Singapore, with its constraints  and  limited\r\n\r\nmanpower.   Sir, I urge the Ministry to consider these  concerns\r\n\r\nand  suggestions  in  drawing up the  new  university  admission\r\n\r\ncriteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

In fact, many of my friends who  I  have\r\n\r\nspoken to, welcomed this announcement.  But, however, there  are\r\n\r\nsome  who do have concerns and are anxious as to how it will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented, as the GPC Chairman, Mr Loh, has pointed out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our education system, the top 20% in each school\r\n\r\ncohort enter the university.  It is from this elite that leaders\r\n\r\nof  industry,  business and politics in Singapore  will  largely\r\n\r\nsurface  from.   Whether one becomes a leader  in  industry,  in\r\n\r\nbusiness  or  commerce or in politics, the  fundamental  factors\r\n\r\nthat  will make him or her a successful leader is his intellect,\r\n\r\nhis  character, that is, integrity, honesty and confidence;  his\r\n\r\neffective  communications  skills, that  is,  written  and  oral\r\n\r\nskills;  and  inter-personal skills, and  other  qualities  like\r\n\r\ncharisma,  perseverance,  tolerance and  compassion  for  fellow\r\n\r\nhuman  beings.   Sir, this list is by no means  exhaustive,  but\r\n\r\nthese are some of the key qualities of leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in politics, certain of these factors will be\r\n\r\nemphasised  -  charisma,  ability  to  convince  the   mass   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans on the policies that have been implemented  and  to\r\n\r\nfollow through, to understand ground feelings and so on.  If you\r\n\r\nare  in  business,  operational  skills  become  essential.   So\r\n\r\nbroadly,  these  skills are required in whatever  you  do  as  a\r\n\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have often heard that a good degree is but only a\r\n\r\npassport to a good job.  But whether one develops a good  career\r\n\r\nand succeeds in his life depends on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany of the above qualities that I have mentioned.  Sir, when  I\r\n\r\nwas  a  student  leader in my undergraduate  days  at  NTI,  the\r\n\r\npredecessor  to  NTU,  a  very  senior  administrator   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity used to meet student leaders for lunch from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.  At one lunch meeting, he said that he was very happy that\r\n\r\nwe  were involved in student leadership because he felt that the\r\n\r\nexperience that we could gain would indeed give us an  all-round\r\n\r\nor  universal  university education.  He said that he  reflected\r\n\r\nback to his own group of friends during his Raffles College days\r\n\r\nand  came  to  the conclusion that those friends who  were  very\r\n\r\nactive in student activities and, of course, did reasonably well\r\n\r\nin studies, had as a rule done much better in their careers than\r\n\r\nthose  who  had excellent results but did not have an  all-round\r\n\r\neducation.   By  the  way, the university  undergraduate  hostel\r\n\r\nlingo,  we  called this type of people, the latter, \"square\"  or\r\n\r\n\"Martians\", people from Mars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, after graduating 13 years ago, I find that what\r\n\r\nthis administrator has told me is very true indeed.  Personally,\r\n\r\nI  have  been  very  active in ECA in primary school,  secondary\r\n\r\nschool, pre-U and in the university due to the kind guidance  of\r\n\r\nmy  parents,  my teachers, relatives and friends.  I  feel  very\r\n\r\nstrongly  that  ECA  has  helped me  very  significantly  in  my\r\n\r\npersonal  development and career.  And therefore,  I  feel  very\r\n\r\npassionately in supporting this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities in Singapore have moved in recent years to\r\n\r\nthe  modular academic system.  Although it is a good policy, one\r\n\r\nof  the  side  effects of this, sadly, is  that  the  time  that\r\n\r\nundergraduates  have  for  ECA  is somewhat  lessened,  somewhat\r\n\r\nsqueezed.    Therefore,  broadening  the  university   admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  would encourage an earlier development  of  this  all-round  university  education at junior  colleges,  at  secondary\r\n\r\nschools and even primary schools.  But the main fear really that\r\n\r\nI  have is that some principals, some teachers and perhaps  some\r\n\r\nparents may go overboard and unduly emphasise ECA in lieu of the\r\n\r\nacademic curriculum.  The Education Minister should be aware of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  and  ensure that the academic curriculum and ECA find  the\r\n\r\nright  balance  in our schools so that a balanced foundation  is\r\n\r\nlaid  before  some  of  the  brighter  children  who  enter  the\r\n\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the Minister to release more\r\n\r\ndetails on the implementation of these policies as soon  as  the\r\n\r\nappointed  panel  completes its work.  I would  urge  that  this\r\n\r\npanel  complete  its  work  as soon as  possible  so  that  this\r\n\r\napprehension that people have on a balanced weightage of ECA vis-a-vis  academic results can be resolved.  And I would also  like\r\n\r\nto urge the Minister not to wait till the year 2001 to implement\r\n\r\nit;  try and implement it as soon as possible, if not, the  next\r\n\r\nacademic year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I reiterate my interest\r\n\r\nas  an  academic  staff  member of the  National  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the perennial problems that has always plagued every\r\n\r\nuniversity staff member when he sees a new batch of students for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time is: Have we admitted the right people?   Or  an\r\n\r\neven  more  difficult question: Did we leave out some  deserving\r\n\r\nones?  These are questions that are hard to answer.  Recently, a\r\n\r\nsuggestion was made that admissions should not be based  on  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel  results alone and that other activities of  the  students\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken  into account.  The so-called extra-curricular\r\n\r\nrecord  should be examined with points to be awarded to  various\r\n\r\ntypes of deserving activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is, of course, well and good. But it must be\r\n\r\nnoted  that the \"A\" result is really the culmination of at least\r\n\r\ntwo  years'  hard work.  Examination smartness  should  not,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  be dismissed lightly.  If the extra-curricular  records\r\n\r\nwere  taken into account, my first concern is that it would take\r\n\r\nthe spontaneity and fun out of participating in such activities.\r\n\r\nStudents, together with parents, in Singapore are very  good  at\r\n\r\napplying what is specified, what earns most points.  We may,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  encourage  an unhealthy attitude, for example,  of  doing\r\n\r\ncommunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  without  the heart in it.  Extra-curricular  activities\r\n\r\nwill  be pursued very much like grades in \"A\" levels themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would detract from, rather than reinforce, the aims of extra-curricular  activities, that of pursuing certain activities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own sake, whether it be community work, sports or  drama.\r\n\r\nWe,  therefore,  need  to exercise great care  in  this  matter.\r\n\r\nExtra-curricular activities should be encouraged but not  forced\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly on students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that consistent with the approach of\r\n\r\nthe universities in broadening the curricula, the specialisation\r\n\r\nthat  has taken root for a long time in the \"A\" levels,  namely,\r\n\r\nseparating  the students into Science, Arts or Commerce  stream,\r\n\r\nshould  be  re-examined.  Both numeracy and literacy  should  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  conditions  for  the admission  of  students  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.   This  would be in keeping  with  the  proposal  to\r\n\r\nbroaden  the  university's curricula. A  JC  student  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  take  a  preponderance of subjects  in  his  chosen\r\n\r\nspecialisation  but  he should take at least  one  from  another\r\n\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that care has to be taken in instituting\r\n\r\nother forms of admission procedures, like interviews.  There  is\r\n\r\nalways   the  danger  of  subjectivity  in  personal  forms   of\r\n\r\nassessment.  For this reason, it would be wrong to put too  much\r\n\r\ncredence on it.  An interview probably operates best as a  means\r\n\r\nto  sift  out those who cannot make it rather than as a positive\r\n\r\nfactor  for taking in students.  Drawing from my own experience,\r\n\r\nfor  example, it is very difficult to tell what the student  has\r\n\r\nprepared  for and what he actually genuinely believes  in.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  one candidate, having declared his great  interest  in\r\n\r\nreading  law,  he  was asked: \"As you have a great  interest  in\r\n\r\nreading  law,  what  can  you  tell  us  about  the  courts   in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\"  And the response was: \"Colombo Court\".  It is quite\r\n\r\ninappropriate in the circumstances.  Other answers to  the  same\r\n\r\nquestion,  taken  by  my  colleagues: \"Badminton  court,  tennis\r\n\r\ncourt.\"  This clearly indicates that the students with some idea\r\n\r\nabout  having  an  interest practising law but have  not  really\r\n\r\ntaken the trouble to look at the matter seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that the signals should be sent strongly\r\n\r\nand  clearly  to parents and teachers that they must  give  some\r\n\r\nleeway to their children to pursue their own interest.  A  child\r\n\r\nor  young  person  is  much more likely to excel  in  an  extra-curricular activity if he did it out of interest and commitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that these views will be taken into account by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  when working out the new guidelines for the admissions\r\n\r\nto universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the Open University\r\n\r\nProgramme  should  have  a more flexible  entry  requirement  to\r\n\r\nprovide a second chance to those who did not see the need for  a\r\n\r\nhigher education when they were younger.  Back in the 60s,  many\r\n\r\npeople aspired to complete just the Cambridge examinations.   It\r\n\r\nwould  have  been sufficient for them to secure a good  job  and\r\n\r\nearn  a  living.  As Singapore advances, it became necessary  to\r\n\r\ngain   good  `0'  level  results.   Subsequently,  the  standard\r\n\r\nincreased  and  one needed \"A\" level passes.   Today,  one  will\r\n\r\npursue  for  a  diploma, degree or a professional qualification.\r\n\r\nSome people will go on to earn a Masters degree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Open University concept in the United Kingdom caters\r\n\r\nfor  anyone who wishes to upgrade himself or herself by studying\r\n\r\nfor  a  degree.  Anyone without the requisite \"0\" and \"A\" levels\r\n\r\ncan enrol for a foundation course where the necessary skills for\r\n\r\nthe pursuit of a degree are taught and examined.  On passing the\r\n\r\nexaminations or the foundation course, one becomes  eligible  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with the degree course.  This way, all adults  have  a\r\n\r\nchance  of  studying for a degree, irrespective  of  their  past\r\n\r\nstudy  track  record.   Their  working  experience  would   have\r\n\r\nequipped them to embark on this journey.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, those who have targeted entry into one of our\r\n\r\nmain universities stand a better chance to qualify for admission\r\n\r\nto the Open University Degree Programme.  Sir, there is a danger\r\n\r\nthat it would become the University with easier options for  the\r\n\r\nstudents of today.  The Open University Programme must  set  for\r\n\r\nitself higher ideals than just being equal to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  two  major universities.  It can be recognised as an  equal\r\n\r\nwhile catering for different segments of our society.  Room must\r\n\r\nbe  made  for the mature students, the experienced workers  with\r\n\r\nfew  or no GCE passes at \"0\" or \"A\" levels.  Only then is it  an\r\n\r\nOpen University.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I think we all know that we\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  high literary rate in Singapore.  I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  there is a measurement for motivation.   But I am  sure\r\n\r\nif  there  is one in Singapore, Singaporeans would measure  very\r\n\r\nwell on that score.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at this booklet on \"Desired Outcomes of\r\n\r\nEducation\",  Sir, you will find that the Ministry  has  outlined\r\n\r\nvarious  attributes which they would want to see as outcomes  of\r\n\r\neducation.   If  you look at just secondary and junior  college,\r\n\r\nyou  will  find that they want the products of education  to  be\r\n\r\nenterprising and innovative, possessing a broad-based foundation\r\n\r\nfor  further education, believe in their own ability, understand\r\n\r\nwhat   it  takes  to  inspire  and  motivate  others,  have   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial   and  creative  spirit,  be   able   to   think\r\n\r\nindependently and creatively, and strive for excellence and have\r\n\r\na  zest for life.  I think all these will contribute to more and\r\n\r\nmore  Singaporeans wanting to improve their level  of  education\r\n\r\nand,  thus,  I  am  glad to see that we are  pursuing  the  Open\r\n\r\nUniversity actively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is: what level of\r\n\r\ncoordination is there among the institutions of higher  learning\r\n\r\nin  Singapore with the Open University?  And what more could  be\r\n\r\ndone   to   make  the  Open  University  more  open  with   more\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  those who are not able to  pursue  full-time\r\n\r\ntertiary education?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to suggest, Sir, that there is room for\r\n\r\nselective  twinning  with  foreign  universities  on   an   open\r\n\r\nuniversity  concept  and level.  For I am sure  all  these  will\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards making our Singapore achieve the  target  of\r\n\r\nexcellence and a thinking society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, it has been announced that the\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement  University  will be run  privately  along  lines  of\r\n\r\nAmerican universities, and I think this is a good move.  It  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  announced that entry standards at this SMU  will  be\r\n\r\nhigh  but not necessarily based on academic results.  That is  a\r\n\r\ngood assurance because we do not want the SMU to be a third rate\r\n\r\nuniversity.   It has been announced too that amongst  the  other\r\n\r\nthings that would be referred to when choosing students for  the\r\n\r\nSMU  would be their record of extra-curricular activities  (ECA)\r\n\r\nand  aptitude tests and perhaps essays and interviews.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat this is also a move that is to be highly commended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of education really must be to produce a\r\n\r\nrounded student that is not just word perfect, and not certainly\r\n\r\nnot  word  perfect \"bookworms\".  We need flexible  thinkers,  we\r\n\r\nneed  people who care for society to be compassionate.   And  Mr\r\n\r\nZainul  has referred to the booklet called the \"Desired Outcomes\r\n\r\nof  Education\".   Several of the outcomes for potential  leaders\r\n\r\nare  also  listed in this book on page 4:  First,  committed  to\r\n\r\nimproving  society;  compassionate  towards  others;   able   to\r\n\r\ninspire, motivate and draw out the best from others and has  the\r\n\r\ntenacity to fight against the odds, not quitting.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I doubt that any of these things can be learned in the\r\n\r\nbooks  and  from professors, no matter how intelligent  and  how\r\n\r\nbrilliant they are.  These are things that you have to learn, as\r\n\r\nMr Sinnakaruppan has mentioned, from living in the hostels, from\r\n\r\nacting in the plays produced by the student societies and  being\r\n\r\nstudent leaders, like Mr Sinnakaruppan was.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not easy for a student these days, especially in\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Not only do they have very little time for ECA, but\r\n\r\nthey  are  sometimes actually discouraged because they  will  be\r\n\r\nfaced with comments like, \"You stupid fool!  Go and study!   Why\r\n\r\ndo you care so much for other things?\"  These are things that we\r\n\r\nhave to nip in the bud.  If ECA is to be one of the criteria for\r\n\r\nadmission  into SMU, I think we ought to look at  the  character\r\n\r\ndevelopment aspect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  ECA  rather  than to worry that it is going  to  be  another\r\n\r\npressure  point, another thing for which the parents would  say,\r\n\r\n\"Son,  you'd  better  go  and get a gold  medal  for  100  metre\r\n\r\nsprint.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other thing that I would want to raise is to urge\r\n\r\nthose  who  are planning for SMU and those who will be  choosing\r\n\r\nstudents  for admission that they mind what Prof. Chin has  said\r\n\r\nabout  not leaving out those who are deserving.  There are  many\r\n\r\nways  that  students can be deserving to enter into SMU  without\r\n\r\nhaving  got  sterling  academic results.  American  universities\r\n\r\nchoose  students sometimes based on their potential.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  a  child's  personal  interests  and  potential  are  as\r\n\r\nimportant in deciding whether he should go for a course or  not.\r\n\r\nIf  he  is a violin prodigy, as has been reported in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  recently, he may be a teenager, his age is too far  below\r\n\r\nwhat  his cohort would be but he, nonetheless, is a genius,  and\r\n\r\nhe should be admitted.  We do not want to have a situation where\r\n\r\nAlbert  Einstein  is  refused entry  into  SMU  or  any  of  our\r\n\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other requirement that perhaps SMU could look\r\n\r\ninto,  when  looking into admission criteria, is to consider  if\r\n\r\nthis high emphasis we put, as a society, on the mother tongue is\r\n\r\nimportant.   I know I am going to be accused of heresy  at  this\r\n\r\npoint  with  some members of the establishment.  But  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsaying we should drop or stop teaching mother tongue.  What I am\r\n\r\nsaying  is that the stress of our current educational system  is\r\n\r\nsometimes  due  to parents putting on more pressure  though  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education requires them to  have  some  reasonable\r\n\r\nstandards in achieving mother tongue proficiency.  Actually  all\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Education requires is just a pass  in  the\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, parents adopt this attitude that to reach the\r\n\r\ntree  tops you have to aim for the moon.  And so they force  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to  go for all kinds of remedial lessons  and  tuition\r\n\r\nwhen  actually the standard is already proficient.  And so  they\r\n\r\nadd  the  stress because they fear that if they do not do  this,\r\n\r\nthe  student may not even pass the mother tongue and  so  cannot\r\n\r\nget into university.  Sometimes,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  know  that their own children can pass mother  tongue  but\r\n\r\nthey are afraid that in a contest between two equal persons, the\r\n\r\none  with  the lower mother tongue grade would drop  out.   Then\r\n\r\nthey  may  say,  \"Son/daughter, I  cannot  afford  to  send  you\r\n\r\noverseas.\"  Here, we have an opportunity for SMU to be a kind of\r\n\r\noverseas university based locally and this is where we can  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  if you pass mother tongue or even if you don't pass,  we\r\n\r\ncan  consider and see if you are really one of those who deserve\r\n\r\nto  enter  otherwise.\"  Then we would not have people who,  when\r\n\r\nasked  about  the  courts, say \"Colombo Court\"  or  maybe  \"food\r\n\r\ncourt\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is also important that if we do have\r\n\r\nstandards  that  are flexible like this, in terms  of  admission\r\n\r\ncriteria, then we can also afford to be lenient in deciding what\r\n\r\ncourses the students can do in this university.  I hope that  if\r\n\r\nthese  cases arise, our SMU will be more flexible than  the  two\r\n\r\nestablished universities that we have currently.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainul Abidin is not here.

As such, there has been  an\r\n\r\ninflux   of   private  educational  institutions  and   overseas\r\n\r\nuniversities  offering  a  wide range  of  tertiary  courses  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Although  it is assumed that Singaporeans  who  are\r\n\r\nattending  tertiary  courses should  be  able  to  evaluate  the\r\n\r\nquality  and  recognition of these programmes, in practice  this\r\n\r\nmay not be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am the President of a professional body. Very\r\n\r\noften,   I   receive  queries  from  students  or  practitioners\r\n\r\nconcerning  the recognition of various professional degrees,  or\r\n\r\ndiploma   courses  conducted  by  private  institutions.    Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have spent large sums of their  savings  on  these\r\n\r\ncourses.   Sometimes, they do not obtain value  for  money.   In\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  they were disappointed when they  found  that  the\r\n\r\ndiplomas  or degrees which they have obtained are not recognised\r\n\r\nby  our  Government, statutory boards or companies.   The  above\r\n\r\nsituation  could  happen because we do  not  have  a  system  of\r\n\r\naccrediting  tertiary courses conducted by  private  educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to protect the interest of Singaporeans who are keen\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  themselves,  I would like  to  urge  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry to accredit all tertiary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourses  conducted  by private institutions in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry can license these private educational institutions, and\r\n\r\nconduct quality audit to assess the standard and quality of  all\r\n\r\napproved  tertiary courses. This could be achieved by appointing\r\n\r\nquality   auditors  from  the  Ministry,  our  universities   or\r\n\r\npractitioners in the industry.  The accredited courses may  then\r\n\r\nbe included in the list of approved courses in the CPF Education\r\n\r\nScheme.   In this way, more Singaporeans would be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope the Education Ministry can take steps to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  quality  of tertiary courses  that  are  currently\r\n\r\nconducted by private educational institutions.  We should set up\r\n\r\na  national accreditation body similar to that of the UK or USA.\r\n\r\nAccreditation will assist Singaporeans to make a better-informed\r\n\r\ndecision to upgrade themselves.  To have a quality workforce, we\r\n\r\nneed to control the quality of education of both the public  and\r\n\r\nprivate educational institutions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I will not talk on pre-primary education. I will go straight to special education.\r\n\r\nBut  first,  I  want to give special thanks to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nincreasing this year's budget on special education to 39.9%,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of $11 million, from $26.7 million to $37.5 million.  I\r\n\r\nalso  note  that an average cost per pupil in special  education\r\n\r\nprogrammes of $5,229 is almost equal to that of secondary school\r\n\r\neducation.  I would like to suggest to the Minister to  consider\r\n\r\npartial  or  full  integration of special  schools  into  normal\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the emphasis on special education reflects our social\r\n\r\nresponsibility and value that we attach to train as best  as  we\r\n\r\ncan children with special disabilities so that they can maximise\r\n\r\nand  realise their full potential.  This is a worthwhile,  noble\r\n\r\nand  difficult cause involving the Government, the community and\r\n\r\na  dedicated pool of volunteers.  In schools, these children are\r\n\r\ngiven   specialist   attention  to  cope  with   their   varying\r\n\r\ndisabilities from hearing impaired to slowness and those with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeech  problems.  But they and their parents  have  one  common\r\n\r\ndesire and aspiration, that is, to be accepted and integrated as\r\n\r\npart  of society to make their lives as normal as possible.   We\r\n\r\nowe  it to them to give our special attention.  I would urge the\r\n\r\nMinister   to  set  aside  classrooms  in  normal   schools   to\r\n\r\naccommodate  children  who are now attending  special  education\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   This  would  allow for maximum  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nintegration  and speed up adaptation process.  They should  have\r\n\r\ncommon  programmes and curriculum, where appropriate,  but  have\r\n\r\ntheir own specialised care and training, when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the complex administrative difficulties\r\n\r\nand  inconveniences it can pose.  But I think this  is  a  small\r\n\r\nprice  that we should be willing to pay.  Our children can  also\r\n\r\nbenefit  enormously  by learning, playing and  growing  up  with\r\n\r\nchildren  of special disabilities.  If they are not prepared  to\r\n\r\nput up with the minor inconveniences and sacrifice, how are they\r\n\r\ngoing to grow up into adulthood to appreciate that it is part of\r\n\r\nnature  to  have  amongst us those who  are  born  with  special\r\n\r\ndisabilities?  How are they going to appreciate that it is their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  as part of society to take care  of  people  and\r\n\r\nensure  their  quick recovery, adjustment and  integration  into\r\n\r\nsociety?   It  is  indeed  expensive to  provide  the  necessary\r\n\r\nspecialised  facilities in such schools.  But I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\ntremendous  improvements being made to schools can also  benefit\r\n\r\nstudents of special education programmes if they are allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe integrated into part of our normal education process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen recently more structured community\r\n\r\nparticipation and involvement in some schools.  Perhaps, we  can\r\n\r\nexperiment  more integration at these schools to  emphasise  and\r\n\r\ndemonstrate our joint responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these children may have special disabilities but they\r\n\r\nneed not be specially segregated.  Their only wish is to be part\r\n\r\nand  parcel  of a normal mainstream education.  I think  we  can\r\n\r\ngrant them this wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, I just want to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  what  more  can  or will be  done  for  a  small  but\r\n\r\nimportant  group of students with disabilities.  As Mr  Zulkifli\r\n\r\nhas said, they too have aspirations, they too have potential  to\r\n\r\nbe  realised.  Equipping them with skills for life and  even  in\r\n\r\nemployment goes to the heart of human dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, there are two approaches through which we can\r\n\r\neducationally assist students with disabilities.  The  first  is\r\n\r\nby  integrating  them,  where possible, in  mainstream  schools.\r\n\r\nThis approach offers important benefits for the intellectual and\r\n\r\nsocial  development  of high-functioning disabled  children  who\r\n\r\nhave  the capacity to do so.  I understand from the experts that\r\n\r\nthis is, in fact, part of the world trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is being done to\r\n\r\nenhance the capacity of our schools to better cater to the needs\r\n\r\nof  high-functioning disabled students.  Can  more  training  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to our teachers to help them be better prepared to  teach\r\n\r\ndisabled  students  in  the  mainstream?   Or  could  additional\r\n\r\nresources be given for them to enhance this capacity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is through special schools which have\r\n\r\ndevised customised programmes catering to these students' unique\r\n\r\nrequirements.  Last year, the Ministry announced an increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  financial  resource allocation for such schools.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  raise  a  specific question  regarding  these  special\r\n\r\neducation  schools.  There is a need to professionalise  special\r\n\r\neducation.   In the UK, for example, special education  teachers\r\n\r\nare  properly  trained, often with post-graduate qualifications.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore, their qualifications are far more modest and many\r\n\r\ndo  not  even  have  a  degree.  In general,  special  education\r\n\r\nteachers  appear  to  be  placed at the level  of  an  assistant\r\n\r\nteacher.   The work is physically and emotionally demanding  and\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  employment compare less  favourably  with  other\r\n\r\noptions in the market.  Morale is low and turnover is high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Ministry able or considering any possibility of\r\n\r\noffering  a  professional  course for the  training  of  special\r\n\r\neducation  teachers,  possibly  by  augmenting  the  basic   NIE\r\n\r\nprogramme?   Also, I would like to ask whether the  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nundertaking  any measures to help special education  schools  to\r\n\r\nretain  their teachers, perhaps by offering terms comparable  to\r\n\r\ntheir counterparts in the mainstream schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, recently, I encountered a case of a\r\n\r\nperson  who was posted overseas.  He, in his youth, was  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  star  performers  in his particular  department.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  that,  he was sent overseas and he  stayed  several\r\n\r\nyears,  working for his employer.  When he came back, of course,\r\n\r\nhe  felt that he was by-passed for promotion because his  cohort\r\n\r\nhad moved ahead. But, Sir, I want to talk about what happened to\r\n\r\nhis children.  When he brought his children overseas, of course,\r\n\r\nhe  wanted  to be with his family.  But when he came  back,  his\r\n\r\nteenage  children could not fit in our school system and  became\r\n\r\ndrop-outs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government has been encouraging Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  second  wing for the economy and for companies  to  go\r\n\r\nregional.   I  think it is important for us to think  of  things\r\n\r\nthat  we can do to encourage people who have been loyal to their\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  who  have  been  posted  overseas.   Can  we  do\r\n\r\nsomething to help them adjust when they come back?  Perhaps even\r\n\r\nbefore  they  leave,  we  can  have  programmes  to  help   them\r\n\r\nunderstand the problems that they will face when they come back.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  could emphasise that in cases like this, they would  be\r\n\r\ngiven exemptions if they need to apply for it.   Because in some\r\n\r\nof  these countries they are posted to, their children  are  not\r\n\r\nable  to  study  the mother tongue and their  standards  of  the\r\n\r\nlanguage   would   therefore   deteriorate.    We   could   have\r\n\r\norientation.  Besides orientation, we can think of scholarships,\r\n\r\nloans or grants for education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this parent that I met, his children cannot enter our\r\n\r\nlocal university.  But he is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot rich enough to send them for an overseas education.  And  so\r\n\r\nhe  feels  that  for  his loyalty to his company,  he  has  been\r\n\r\ndeprived of something that others take for granted.  Perhaps  in\r\n\r\nthis  situation,  we can think of grants or loans  or  something\r\n\r\nwhich we can give to help them send their children to university\r\n\r\nor  for further studies.  And if this is needed, perhaps we  can\r\n\r\neven look at relaxing our rules on the use of CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that we can also do to help these students\r\n\r\nfit back into Singapore society, and besides looking at relaxing\r\n\r\nthe  standards  for the mother tongue grades, perhaps  we  could\r\n\r\nalso  look  at  accepting  the grades that  they  have  obtained\r\n\r\noverseas in their overseas educational systems.  I think we  are\r\n\r\nrather  rigid in this and perhaps our universities, for example,\r\n\r\ncould look into accepting the equivalent of `A' levels, so  that\r\n\r\nthese children will not be penalised.   Otherwise, if we do  not\r\n\r\ndo  these things, who would want to go overseas?  Who would want\r\n\r\nto be penalised for being good?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, parenting is an under-rated skill that is\r\n\r\ntaken  for  granted.   The practitioners are generally  left  to\r\n\r\ntheir   own   devices.   There  are  no  courses,   manuals   or\r\n\r\nevaluations, except perhaps by their children.  Parents  usually\r\n\r\nrely  on  experiences within their family and circle of  friends\r\n\r\nfor  references.   Yet, as we have heard time and  again  today,\r\n\r\nparents play an important complementary role to our teachers  in\r\n\r\nour schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the members of the resource panel for the GPC for\r\n\r\nEducation  have  highlighted the dissonance that exists  between\r\n\r\nparents'  perceptions  of school life today,  and  the  reality.\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to illustrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most parents, their understanding and idea of life in\r\n\r\nschool dates back to more than two decades ago.  Back then,  the\r\n\r\nadvent  of  the hand-held calculator was momentous.  Today,  PCs\r\n\r\nare the norm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are still grappling with the intricacies of our\r\n\r\neducation  system.   In a sense, they themselves  are  streamed.\r\n\r\nThose in the fast track understand our system well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers,  whom  I  believe  constitute  the  bulk,  have  a  more\r\n\r\napproximate understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are also unaware of some of the norms in our\r\n\r\nschools  today.  For example, what is the going rate for  pocket\r\n\r\nmoney?   In  the business world, HR managers can consult  salary\r\n\r\nreviews by consultants, like Hays, to get some reference points.\r\n\r\nWhom or what can parents turn to other than their intuition  and\r\n\r\nperhaps casual discussions with their friends?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the perennial question of what they call BGR\r\n\r\n-  boy-girl relationships.  What are the OB markers?   What  are\r\n\r\nthe  acceptable  limits?  Parents have to walk a  tightrope  for\r\n\r\nfear of being labelled as rude or a prude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions highlight the gaps, I think, in the\r\n\r\nawareness  of today's parents.  I believe that the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation, perhaps in conjunction with MCD, could undertake some\r\n\r\nsteps  to  better educate our parents as well.   In  particular,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  urge  the Ministry to consider the use of  the  Parent-Teacher  Associations (PTAs), strengthening them and using  them\r\n\r\nfor  this  purpose.   PTAs could facilitate regular  discussions\r\n\r\nbetween  the  schools, the teachers, on the one  hand,  and  the\r\n\r\nparents  to  help  them to better understand  and  navigate  our\r\n\r\neducation system.  At the same time, PTAs could facilitate group\r\n\r\ndiscussions  amongst  parents  so  that  they  may  share  their\r\n\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Ministry has any plans to\r\n\r\nfurther  strengthen  our PTA system and, in particular,  in  the\r\n\r\narea of parent education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I doubt many will\r\n\r\nfault our education system in terms of first-rate facilities, in\r\n\r\nterms  of fantastic academic results, and even in terms of  free\r\n\r\nand fair opportunities for all our children.  The Government and\r\n\r\neducators  spare no effort in trying to let our young  have  the\r\n\r\nbest.   We  should all be glad.  But \"no\", we moan  and  we  are\r\n\r\ndisgruntled.  We are not quite satisfied, and we tell the  world\r\n\r\nand  allow  the world to tell us how stressed we  are  from  the\r\n\r\neducation of our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I contend that the problem has to do with our mindset\r\n\r\non  \"success\" and \"competition for success\".  We are a  success-orientated  nation.   It is only natural  for  parents  to  want\r\n\r\nsuccess  and the best for their children.  Compete  for  it,  if\r\n\r\nneed  be.  It is not enough to assume that this is only part  of\r\n\r\nkiasuism, and it is harmless.  Having competition for betterment\r\n\r\nis  not  a bad thing at all.  But when such competition  becomes\r\n\r\nexcessive  and begins to look like a survival pre-requisite,  we\r\n\r\nmust take note.  We need to change our mindset towards this type\r\n\r\nof  \"success\"  and  this  type  of  \"competition  for  success\".\r\n\r\nAlthough  this may take  years to achieve, we do have  to  start\r\n\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind that the Government will help the children\r\n\r\nrealise their maximal educational potential, let us see if  life\r\n\r\ncan  be  better  when  this is achieved, but  with  a  different\r\n\r\nmindset.   Consider emphasising a new ideology and  interpreting\r\n\r\nan  old policy somewhat differently from the way we do now.  Let\r\n\r\nme use the following aspects of our present system to illustrate\r\n\r\nwhat I mean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The introduction of a range of textbooks may be good\r\n\r\nfor  a  whole lot of people, but it may not be so for  the  very\r\n\r\npeople  that matter, namely, the students.  The idea  of  giving\r\n\r\r\npeople  a  choice  is right, but this offer,  with  the  present\r\n\r\nmindset, opens the door to the problem of \"too many books\".   It\r\n\r\nis  not  easy to have a \"perfect\" book, so parents will probably\r\n\r\nbuy a couple more to be taught by tuition teachers.  This cannot\r\n\r\nbe  good  for  the  children.  It is my opinion  that,  for  the\r\n\r\npresent,  we  should still have a standard textbook.   From  the\r\n\r\nbooks  by  various  authors, the work that best  represents  the\r\n\r\ntopic  in the syllabus is extracted from such a textbook  to  be\r\n\r\ncompiled.    Some sort of a standard is thus made  available  to\r\n\r\nguide  the  students, teachers as well as parents.    Sir,  this\r\n\r\nway,  the students will have less books to carry and the parents\r\n\r\nwill  have  less  books to buy.  Indeed, the  opposite  will  be\r\n\r\nawesome as there can be an endless amount of materials available\r\n\r\nout there in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It has been said that our students are doing too many\r\n\r\nsubjects  for  the `O' levels.  They say that \"only  6  subjects\r\n\r\ncount, but you can do as many subjects as you wish\" and you have\r\n\r\nstudents  doing  10 or more.  This is just too  much  work,  let\r\n\r\nalone  too  much  stress.  Let us try to reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\nsubjects.   What happens when the rule is \"6 subjects count  and\r\n\r\nyou  will  be  examined on only 7\"?  It is likely that  students\r\n\r\nwill  not  want  to study more than 7 subjects  for  examination\r\n\r\npurposes.   The Singaporean is pragmatic.  Mind you, Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  many students will still want to study more subjects,  but\r\n\r\nthey  now  can enjoy these other subjects for personal  interest\r\n\r\nrather   than  for  examinations.   To  deal  with   this   more\r\n\r\neffectively,  the authorities would need to modify and  simplify\r\n\r\nthe subject-combination choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Adding value to extra-curricular activities (ECAs) is\r\n\r\na  step in the right direction to encourage students to be  all-rounders.  However, the mindset is that there is a \"new subject\"\r\n\r\nto  score  from.  All at once, ECAs will be in addition  to  the\r\n\r\nacademic  workload.  If the rule for admission to  course  X  is\r\n\r\n\"get  3As+1B  and  your  ECAs can give you  further  advantage\",\r\n\r\nstress  is increased, because the requirement for course  X  now\r\n\r\nbecomes 3As+1B+ECAs and the \"new subject\" must be pursued.   Let\r\n\r\nus please emphasise that to do course X, just get 3As+1B, and if\r\n\r\nyou  should  get only 2As+2Bs, your ECAs can help  make  up  the\r\n\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Standards and requirements should not fluctuate too\r\n\r\nmuch year to year.  If a student with 3As+1B in subjects PQRS is\r\n\r\neligible for course X in one year, then another student with the\r\n\r\nsame  results  in  another year should also qualify.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  an  inclusive, rather than exclusive, policy  should  be\r\n\r\nadopted.  You want course X?   Just get 3As+1B, and that is all.\r\n\r\nYou have what you want.  Let the standards be more finite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fear that our education system may become too\r\n\r\nexclusive  if we do not simplify more and quantify  less.   This\r\n\r\nmindset  of  our people should be borne in mind when  we  change\r\n\r\npolicy or introduce new ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, our young are unflatteringly\r\n\r\ndescribed  as smart, but self-centred, selfish, and  lacking  in\r\n\r\nhumility,  moral values and community spirit.

It  is  the\r\n\r\nextremity  of  the position that the graduates take  that  is  a\r\n\r\nworrying sign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our young are our future. Today we are still able to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  course of the nation, but tomorrow  we  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend on them to do it.  The attitude and mindset of our  young\r\n\r\nto  duties  to the nation, society and community,  is  of  great\r\n\r\nconcern.   Without  a strong sense of community responsibilities\r\n\r\nand  duties among our young, the future of the nation stands  on\r\n\r\nflimsy  ground.  This is a pressing and serious  issue.   Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, BG Lee Hsien Loong, has spoken  eloquently  and\r\n\r\npersuasively  on this issue in his recent ministerial  statement\r\n\r\non bond breaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I am accused of being unfair to our youths, let\r\n\r\nme  hasten  to  add that the sense of community responsibilities\r\n\r\nand duties of our youth is high.  But we are noticing a downward\r\n\r\ntrend.  We cannot shrug off this concern by reassuring ourselves\r\n\r\nthat  somehow  things will turn out right as in the  past.   The\r\n\r\nwhole society, including the school, community and parents,  has\r\n\r\nduties  and  responsibilities for the moral development  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung  and  I  would urge each to make conscious efforts  to  do\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children do spend a substantial amount of their waking\r\n\r\nhours  in  the  schools, in the company of  their  teachers  and\r\n\r\nschool  friends.   I  am  happy to note that  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nrecognised  the  importance  of  the  role  of  the  school  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped several programmes to foster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity spirit and to widen the outlook of our students beyond\r\n\r\nmere  school books and examinations.  National education is  one\r\n\r\nexample.  The requirement that each of our secondary school  and\r\n\r\njunior college students performs 6 hours of community service is\r\n\r\nanother.   The  recent Learning Journey programme  adds  to  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  available to our students  to  learn  more  about\r\n\r\ncountry and community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud our companies who have opened their doors to our\r\n\r\nstudents.  Participation will cost them time, money and manpower\r\n\r\nresources.  Hence it is a noble act on their part to  serve  the\r\n\r\nwider  interest of the community.  I hope more organisations  in\r\n\r\nboth  the  public and private sectors will take part.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  key  must  be the principals and teachers.   They  must  be\r\n\r\nconvinced  that these are desirable programmes and will  support\r\n\r\nthem fully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community, too, has its role in the moral development\r\n\r\nof  our  young.  The young learned from what they see  going  on\r\n\r\naround them.  If adults behave responsibly and show care for the\r\n\r\ncommunity,   such  as  protecting  and  properly  using   common\r\n\r\nproperties,  in  showing care and respect for one  another,  our\r\n\r\nyoung  will  emulate these behaviours.  In the  debate  on  last\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget, I called upon grassroots organisations  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  schools  to give our students the opportunity  to  do\r\n\r\ncommunity  work.   The recently announced Community  Involvement\r\n\r\nScheme for our secondary school and junior college students will\r\n\r\nmake  this task easier.  Grassroots organisations like the CCCs,\r\n\r\nCCMCs,  RCs, Town Councils and CDCs should seize the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  work  with  the  schools to provide more  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nstudents  to  serve  the community.  Besides  making  our  young\r\n\r\nbetter  and  caring people, some of them may  well  stay  on  to\r\n\r\nbecome  the  next generation of grassroots leaders.  The  lament\r\n\r\nthat not enough residents are coming forward to serve may, in  a\r\n\r\nfew short years' time, be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ultimate responsibility for the moral development\r\n\r\nof  a  child  rests with the parents.  Parents must accept  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Some have tended to put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  blame  on society and the schools for their children  going\r\n\r\nwayward.   Parents must find time to spend with their  children,\r\n\r\nand  during these times to discuss and impart family and  social\r\n\r\nvalues.  They must realise that the children grow up to be  like\r\n\r\nthem  as  the children emulate not just what they advocate,  but\r\n\r\nmore,   what   they  do.   Parenting  is  a   heavy   task   and\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   Unfortunately, society  does  not  impose  any\r\n\r\nqualifications to become a parent.  We learn from experience and\r\n\r\nour  mistakes, but by which time our children would  have  grown\r\n\r\nup.   I  believe  that courses in parenting  are  necessary  and\r\n\r\nimportant and will help many to be better parents.  I would like\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations to take up the  challenge  to  conduct\r\n\r\nparenting  seminars  and  courses  for  young  parents  in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Some community organisations like AMP, Mendaki  and\r\n\r\nFamily  Service Centres are already doing this.   These  efforts\r\n\r\nwill help our schools and teachers in doing their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> First of\r\n\r\nall,  I would like to thank Members, especially Mr Loh Meng  See\r\n\r\nand   his   GPC  members,  for  their  feedback,  comments   and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  so  far.  I am grateful that so many  Members  have\r\n\r\ntaken  such  an  active  interest in education.   It  is  always\r\n\r\nrefreshing  to  have  ideas coming from different  perspectives,\r\n\r\nchallenging our assumptions and triggering off even  more  ideas\r\n\r\non how we can do better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a good education system which has been developed\r\n\r\nover  the  years through strong leadership, clear foresight  and\r\n\r\ndetermination,  and  through the commitment  and  hard  work  of\r\n\r\nteachers,  students and parents.  We have achieved good  results\r\n\r\nby  international standards.  Nevertheless, we are often our own\r\n\r\nharshest  critics; and that should be the way.  We should  never\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied with what we have.  We need to continue  improving\r\n\r\nour education system, building upon the solid foundation that we\r\n\r\nhave.   We  must maintain the rigour and high standards  of  our\r\n\r\nsystem  as we make adjustments and improvements.  This principle\r\n\r\nundergirds all our efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing a good education is our investment in Singapore's\r\n\r\nfuture.   The currency crisis and its ripple effects  underscore\r\n\r\nthe importance of sound fundamentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound fundamentals extend beyond prudent economic and\r\n\r\nfinancial management to include preparing the next generation to\r\n\r\nface any combination of possible future scenarios.  In times  of\r\n\r\nprosperity,  it  is the people of Singapore who must  seize  the\r\n\r\nopportunities and even create new opportunities.   In  times  of\r\n\r\nadversity, it is the people of Singapore who must turn adversity\r\n\r\ninto opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, our young must learn not just the knowledge\r\n\r\nand  skills  for the economy of the future, but also values  and\r\n\r\ninstincts  so  that  when they come of age, they,  collectively,\r\n\r\nwill   be   able   to  face  the  future  with  confidence   and\r\n\r\nsteadfastness,  identify  the  real  problems,  find  the   best\r\n\r\nsolutions and chart Singapore's destiny.  The better we  develop\r\n\r\ntheir talents and abilities, the better will be the home that we\r\n\r\nbuild together for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people are the future of Singapore. And the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  shown its commitment to invest  in  our  future\r\n\r\nthrough  good times and through not so good times.   This  year,\r\n\r\nalthough  the Minister for Finance has allocated a significantly\r\n\r\nlarger  budget for education, we should not imagine  that  funds\r\n\r\nare  unlimited.  The Minister for Finance still  keeps  a  tight\r\n\r\nrein  on things.  Nor should we go away with the idea that  more\r\n\r\nspending is the solution for all our problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending more money does not ensure that we will have a\r\n\r\nbetter  system.   I agree with those Members who have  expressed\r\n\r\nthe  view  that it is the \"software\" in our system that  counts.\r\n\r\nWhat  we spend on, and how we spend, is more important.  In June\r\n\r\nlast  year, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong unveiled the vision  of\r\n\r\nThinking Schools, Learning Nation to prepare our young  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Allow me to provide an update on what the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation has done to move towards this vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to define our goals. In any long\r\n\r\njourney, we need to set out with a purpose in mind.  We need  to\r\n\r\nask  ourselves  what  is  it that we want  formal  education  to\r\n\r\nachieve.   Given  our  transition to a knowledge-based  economy,\r\n\r\ngiven  the demands of life in the 21st century, given  a  likely\r\n\r\npicture of the social environment in the future, what attributes\r\n\r\ndo  we  want Singaporeans to have?  What characteristics  should\r\n\r\nour  community,  business,  professional  and  national  leaders\r\n\r\npossess?   What intermediate outcomes should primary,  secondary\r\n\r\nand junior college education achieve?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Ministry of Education published a\r\n\r\ndocument called \"The Desired Outcomes of Education\" and  Members\r\n\r\nhave  a copy of it before them.  I need not read it out to  you.\r\n\r\nSome  Members have already done this favour on my behalf.   This\r\n\r\ndocument  defines the aims of a holistic education by  giving  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive yet succinct list of values, skills and  attitudes\r\n\r\nour young at different stages of their education should possess.\r\n\r\nThe  press  has dubbed this the \"88888\" list, which I  think  is\r\n\r\nquite appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Desired Outcomes of Education\" is a reaffirmation of\r\n\r\nwhat  educationists,  parents, teachers and  students  have  all\r\n\r\nalong wanted a good education to provide.  The list was drawn up\r\n\r\nafter extensive consultation with our principals and teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that explicit academic achievement targets\r\n\r\nare  conspicuously  absent  from  the  list.   This  is  not  an\r\n\r\noversight.    Cognitive  development  is  one  of  the   desired\r\n\r\noutcomes.   And academic performance is one of the ways,  and  a\r\n\r\nwell-accepted,  objective and rigorous  one,  by  which  we  can\r\n\r\nmeasure cognitive development.  It is a good indicator,  but  by\r\n\r\nno  means a comprehensive one nor the only one.  But we can  all\r\n\r\nagree  that  we  are looking for more than that from  education.\r\n\r\nOur  intention  is to deliver holistic education in  partnership\r\n\r\nwith parents and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some wonder if the pursuit of holistic education will mean\r\n\r\na drop in academic standards.  I do not think so.  I cannot see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  a more morally upright, socially responsible student should\r\n\r\nperform  less  well  academically.  I  cannot  see  how  a  more\r\n\r\nindependent,  creative  thinker can do worse  than  someone  who\r\n\r\nrelies  on reproducing facts and content.  This is not a  matter\r\n\r\nof  sacrificing academic standards to nurture students with high\r\n\r\nmoral  standards and community spirit.  This is not an  \"either-or\"  situation.   Holistic education is entirely  possible  with\r\n\r\nhigh  academic achievement.  Getting good grades in examinations\r\n\r\nshould  be a product of holistic education, but I agree with  Mr\r\n\r\nPeh  Chin Hua that it should not be an all-consuming passion  in\r\n\r\nitself, pursued to the exclusion of everything else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An organisation sets itself performance targets for two\r\n\r\npurposes:  to  focus  the efforts of the  organisation,  and  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  the  progress they are making towards  achieving  their\r\n\r\ntargets.   Focusing  efforts is important  to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation because in the provision of education, as we can  hear\r\n\r\ntoday, there are many `good' things we can do.  We want to  make\r\n\r\nsure  we direct our efforts at those activities that go furthest\r\n\r\nin   achieving  our  aims.   But  the  issue  of  measuring  our\r\n\r\nachievements does pose some problems.  How will the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation know if we have achieved these desired outcomes?  What\r\n\r\nare our yardsticks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure of success will not be easily quantifiable.\r\n\r\nHow, for example, do we quantify compassion for others?  How can\r\n\r\nwe  objectively measure a student's love for his country or  his\r\n\r\ncommitment  to the nation?  Perhaps we will know,  not  when  we\r\n\r\nhave succeeded, but when we have failed.  However, the fact that\r\n\r\nwe have no reliable measure does not mean that we should give up\r\n\r\ndelivering  holistic education.  Ten or twenty  years  down  the\r\n\r\nroad,  if  we succeed, our economy will be more prosperous,  our\r\n\r\nnation  will  be  more united, our society  more  gracious,  our\r\n\r\npeople  more  creative,  our  community  more  cohesive.   These\r\n\r\noutcomes  may not be easily quantifiable nor tangible, but  they\r\n\r\nare no less real, and are absolutely critical for our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now update the House on the progress of various\r\n\r\nspecific initiatives my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry has undertaken in the past year to achieve the goal  of\r\n\r\nThinking  Schools, Learning Nation, and The Desired Outcomes  of\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, National Education. Members will remember that the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  National  Education  is  to  foster  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nidentity,  and  to help our young understand the challenges  and\r\n\r\nconstraints  confronting  Singapore.   Efforts  are  ongoing  to\r\n\r\ninfuse  National  Education into different  subject  syllabuses.\r\n\r\nYou will have learnt through the media about the imaginative and\r\n\r\nengaging  ways  our schools are bringing the National  Education\r\n\r\nmessages across, even in extra-curricular activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, we also launched the Community\r\n\r\nInvolvement Programme.  Through this Programme, we hope that our\r\n\r\nyoung  will  learn  to be active participants in  community  and\r\n\r\nnational life when they grow up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools have also started to commemorate key historical\r\n\r\nevents  in  Singapore's history.  Besides National Day,  schools\r\n\r\nnow  commemorate  three other events.  These are  Total  Defence\r\n\r\nDay, Racial Harmony Day and International Friendship Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of last month, `Learning Journeys' were\r\n\r\nlaunched.   Pupils  from  Primary Four to  JC2  will  visit  key\r\n\r\nnational  institutions at least once a year.  We hope  that  our\r\n\r\nstudents   can   understand   the  country's   constraints   and\r\n\r\nvulnerabilities,  develop a sense of pride in Singapore,  and  a\r\n\r\nconfidence  that with ingenuity, determination  and  hard  work,\r\n\r\nSingapore  will remain an exceptional island-nation for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Masterplan for Information Technology in\r\n\r\nEducation.   Phase 1 of the IT Masterplan has been  successfully\r\n\r\nimplemented in 22 demonstration schools, comprising  10  primary\r\n\r\nschools,  10  secondary schools and 2 junior colleges.   On  4th\r\n\r\nApril, these schools will be holding an open house, and I invite\r\n\r\nMembers  to  drop by and have a look.  We are now  embarking  on\r\n\r\nPhase 2 involving 100 schools.  In 1999, we will move on to  the\r\n\r\nremaining 240 schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, buying and installing hardware is relatively\r\n\r\nsimple  compared to the training of our teachers  and  providing\r\n\r\nour  teachers with the necessary guidance and support.  This  is\r\n\r\nmost  critical to the success of the Masterplan.  And it is here\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of Education has focused its main effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All trainee teachers in NIE now undergo a course in IT.\r\n\r\nBasic  IT  literacy training for all serving teachers  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  completed.  As their schools come on stream under  the  IT\r\n\r\nMasterplan,  teachers  will  receive  further  preparation   and\r\n\r\ntraining which will include the design of lesson plans  and  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  different kinds of software.  IT instructors  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  go  to the schools  to  work  with  the\r\n\r\nteachers  and sometimes even co-teach in classrooms so that  our\r\n\r\nteachers are able to learn by observation and practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also set up a Media Services Section which reviews\r\n\r\nand   recommends  software  titles  and  websites.   These   are\r\n\r\nclassified by subjects and by levels.  Teachers have  access  to\r\n\r\nthis  via  the  Ministry  of  Education  Intranet.   There   are\r\n\r\ncurrently about 350 software titles posted on this site.  I hope\r\n\r\nthis goes some way to address the concerns raised by Dr Tan Boon\r\n\r\nWan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of new technology at such a pace into the\r\n\r\nschools is a little daunting.  But this is the pace at which the\r\n\r\nIT  industry  is  moving.  Our schools, which must  prepare  our\r\n\r\nstudents  for  the world of tomorrow, cannot be behind  what  is\r\n\r\nalready  commonplace in the workplace.  We need to put computers\r\n\r\ninto  the  hands of our teachers.  After an initial one  or  two\r\n\r\nyears  of  learning,  experimentation  and  experience,   I   am\r\n\r\nconfident that our teachers will be able to use computers  as  a\r\n\r\npowerful tool to enhance the learning and teaching that goes  on\r\n\r\nin our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also pressed on with initiatives in school\r\n\r\nadministration.  The School Cluster scheme was piloted last year\r\n\r\nto  devolve  greater  autonomy to schools in  order  to  enhance\r\n\r\nschool management.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember  1997,  the Ministry introduced five more  clusters:  2\r\n\r\nprimary  and  2  secondary  clusters, with  one  mixed  primary-secondary  cluster.  A junior college was also added to  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  original  clusters formed in early 1997.   The  reason  for\r\n\r\nmixing  different schools in the same cluster is to add  variety\r\n\r\nand richness of experience to the cluster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final and fourth initiative, perhaps the most important\r\n\r\none  announced  last  year, is fostering creative  thinking  and\r\n\r\nreviewing the curriculum.  The curriculum is important, as it is\r\n\r\nthe  medium  through  which  most initiatives  in  teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of ideas as to what we should add to\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum - everyone has his or her pet topics to put  in:\r\n\r\nmodern  art, Singapore literature, astronomy, even swimming  and\r\n\r\nlife-saving skills.  There are comments that our students  today\r\n\r\nare   not  as  knowledgeable  or  as  well  prepared  as   their\r\n\r\npredecessors,  ergo,  they should be better  prepared.   Several\r\n\r\nhave  commented that our curriculum is too narrow and should  be\r\n\r\nbroadened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many have also expressed the view that our\r\n\r\nnational  curriculum is too content-heavy,  and  does  not  lend\r\n\r\nitself  to  the development of creativity and critical  thinking\r\n\r\nskills.  But we must not forget that each topic already there in\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum was put there for a good reason - to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nspecific  learning outcome.  The problem then is not a  shortage\r\n\r\nof  good ideas as to what to put into the curriculum.  The  real\r\n\r\nquestion  is the opposite one: among all these wonderful  ideas,\r\n\r\nwhat  should  we leave out?  That is the real challenge.   After\r\n\r\nall, there is only so much time in a day and so much that we can\r\n\r\nask our children to cope with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the various curricula in different\r\n\r\neducation systems, and I visited a number of countries this past\r\n\r\nyear, it does not mean that one with more subjects, more topics,\r\n\r\nmore  content  is  better.  For example, if  someone  tells  me,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  the curriculum of this school system covers all that  is\r\n\r\ntaught in our school system in Singapore and much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore.  It must be better, let's follow it.\"  I would say, \"Stop,\r\n\r\nthink a while, think very carefully.\".  Most parents would agree\r\n\r\nthat  what  their  children are now doing in school  is  already\r\n\r\nquite  a  heavy load, and we should beware the \"more is  better\"\r\n\r\nsyndrome.   In  our case, teaching less may allow  us  to  teach\r\n\r\nbetter.   If  anyone  has found a magic  formula  to  teach  our\r\n\r\nnational  curriculum and more without over-stressing  our  kids,\r\n\r\nplease let me know.  I would like to find out how it is done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British have decided that they are trying to do too\r\n\r\nmuch  in  their  primary  schools and  are  failing  to  provide\r\n\r\nsufficient  focus  on  the basics.  In January  this  year,  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Education  and Employment Secretary Mr  David  Blunkett\r\n\r\nannounced  that  from  this year, British primary  schools  will\r\n\r\nfocus  on  just four things: English, Mathematics,  Science  and\r\n\r\nInformation Technology.  Minimum teaching hours are mandated for\r\n\r\nthese four subjects.  The prescribed programme for the six other\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  the  curriculum have been suspended,  and  primary\r\n\r\nschools are no longer required to follow them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the solution obviously is not simply to slash our\r\n\r\nsyllabuses.  We have to balance breadth and depth.  We  want  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the rigour in our curriculum and the high standards  in\r\n\r\nour  schools.   We need to develop and to deliver  an  essential\r\n\r\ncore  of  knowledge  in each subject, and to overlay  this  with\r\n\r\nhigher  order  thinking skills.  Creative and critical  thinking\r\n\r\ncannot occur in a vacuum, they can only be learnt and applied in\r\n\r\nthe context of some content knowledge.  We also want to design a\r\n\r\ncurriculum that adequately stretches our most able students.  At\r\n\r\nthe same time, we must be mindful of our less able students.  We\r\n\r\nmust  not leave them way behind, unable to catch up, discouraged\r\n\r\nand disillusioned with school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1996, the Ministry of Education invited a senior\r\n\r\nacademic, Prof. Hang Chang Chieh, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of  the\r\n\r\nNational University of Singapore, to lead an external review  of\r\n\r\nour curriculum and assessment system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  objective was to provide a fresh perspective; a perspective\r\n\r\nof   recipients  of  the  products  of  our  school   system   - universities, polytechnics, and future employers of our students\r\n\r\n- as to what they would like to see being taught in our schools.\r\n\r\nThe  committee submitted its report to the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nin August 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has been studied by the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nOne  of the main themes in the report is that the syllabuses are\r\n\r\ngenerally  too heavy and should be cut back to allow  more  time\r\n\r\nfor  creative  thinking  and application  of  knowledge  through\r\n\r\nactivities such as project work in the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has decided to implement the recommendations\r\n\r\nwhich the committee has made on the curriculum in a major review\r\n\r\nwhich we are now undertaking.  But this review will take several\r\n\r\nyears as it is a major review that will involve not only what we\r\n\r\nteach,  but  how  we teach it and how it is assessed.   In  this\r\n\r\nreview,  we  want  to make sure that not only  do  our  students\r\n\r\nacquire  content and factual knowledge, but also process skills.\r\n\r\nThese  are  significant changes, and we will need some  time  to\r\n\r\nstudy   them  carefully,  consult  experts  and  users,   orient\r\n\r\nteachers,  make course materials and design assessment  systems.\r\n\r\nWe can only introduce the bulk of these changes into the schools\r\n\r\nfrom the year 2001 onwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we have decided to take some interim\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  reduce the curriculum load on our students.   With\r\n\r\nvery  few exceptions, most syllabuses will be reduced by 10%  to\r\n\r\n30%,  most  of them in the range of 10% to 20%.  However,  there\r\n\r\nwill be no change to the structure of the syllabuses, nor to the\r\n\r\nexaminations nor the type of questions that will be set.   These\r\n\r\ninterim  curriculum reductions can therefore be introduced  into\r\n\r\nthe  schools  from  next year.  Some schools  may  already  have\r\n\r\nselectively  omitted teaching certain topics;  these  curricular\r\n\r\ncuts make it official.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content which has been reduced or cut include those which\r\n\r\nfocus mainly on recall, or technical details not critical to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents' understanding of the topic.  Content inconsistent with\r\n\r\nreal  world practice, too difficult or too broad has  also  been\r\n\r\ncut.   Content which is repeated either at other levels or in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent subject may be retained in one subject at a particular\r\n\r\nlevel, and removed from the others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lighten the load so that teachers and students\r\n\r\ncan  have  more  time  to  implement  the  initiatives  that  we\r\n\r\nintroduced  in the last year.  This will free up time  for  more\r\n\r\ncollaborative   learning,  more  self-directed  research,   more\r\n\r\nindependent investigations, to develop process skills,  thinking\r\n\r\nskills, and communication skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reduced syllabuses will take effect next year, and\r\n\r\nstudents  will be examined on these reduced syllabuses from  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000  onwards.  This is the first step we are  taking,  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  can  be an immediate reduction in curriculum  load.\r\n\r\nTeachers and students should have no difficulty adapting to this\r\n\r\nreduction, as it only involves removing some topics,  while  the\r\n\r\nremaining topics and the examination system remain the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This immediate reduction will allow a lightening of the\r\n\r\nload  from next year, while we do a more thorough review of  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  and our assessment system to see how we  can  better\r\n\r\nbring out the creative spirit and thinking ability of our young.\r\n\r\nChanges  to  the curriculum, if not accompanied by corresponding\r\n\r\nchanges  to  assessment modes, teaching methodologies,  learning\r\n\r\nresources  and learner attitudes, are likely to be futile.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education will continue to  work  on  these  other\r\n\r\nareas.   As  I  said earlier, we will not be able  to  introduce\r\n\r\nthese major changes earlier than 2001 into the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the progress described above would not have been\r\n\r\npossible, or will come to naught, without the teacher.  Teachers\r\n\r\nare key to everything that we do in the education system.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid  last  year,  teachers are the heart and the  soul  of  our\r\n\r\nsystem.   They are out there in the classrooms, in  the  science\r\n\r\nlaboratories, in the school field, delivering total education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best physical facilities and most innovative curriculum will\r\n\r\nnot come to life without dedicated and competent teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully endorse the support that Mr Loh Meng See, Mr Peh\r\n\r\nChin Hua, Mr Lim Swee Say and others have given to our teachers.\r\n\r\nWe  will  take  their comments and suggestions  on  how  we  can\r\n\r\nimprove the teaching service into account.  The teacher plays  a\r\n\r\ncrucial role in nation-building.  The teacher's role goes beyond\r\n\r\nensuring  the employability of the next generation.   It  covers\r\n\r\nthe  development  of his charges in all areas described  in  the\r\n\r\nDesired Outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shape the values of their students, and instil in\r\n\r\nthem  a  strong sense of social conscience.  Teachers  are  role\r\n\r\nmodels of lifelong learning to their students.  Teaching is  not\r\n\r\nan easy job, but it is highly rewarding.  It requires people who\r\n\r\nare  caring and nurturing, those who have a sense of mission and\r\n\r\ncalling.   There  is an immense satisfaction in  moulding  young\r\n\r\nminds, shaping lives, helping and encouraging people who will go\r\n\r\non  to  help and encourage others.  It almost certainly involves\r\n\r\ntears  and heartaches, but ask any teacher, and he or  she  will\r\n\r\ntell you that it is a job that it is totally rewarding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the many demands placed on them, the vast majority\r\n\r\nof teachers like what they are doing.  The Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nrecently conducted a Teachers' Survey and I would like to  share\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  preliminary  findings  with  this  House.   As  I\r\n\r\nexpected,  the  vast majority, 83%, of teachers  indicated  that\r\n\r\nthey  like  the  type  of  work  that  they  do.   Teaching   is\r\n\r\nintrisincally  satisfying.   This  is  befitting  of  a  people-centred,  people-development  profession.   83%  indicated  that\r\n\r\ntheir  job makes good use of their abilities, and 88% feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  count on support and assistance from their colleagues\r\n\r\nwhen faced with a difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some Members in the House, Dr Tan Boon Wan, Dr Toh See\r\n\r\nKiat,  Mr  Iswaran, Mr Lim Swee Say and others have  said,  they\r\n\r\nhave heard of teachers feeling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstressed by the rapid pace of change and the amount of  work  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools.  In this past year, I visited many schools  and  I\r\n\r\nhave talked to many teachers.  Yes, there is stress and there is\r\n\r\nworry.   Our  teachers  work very hard.   Our  teachers  have  a\r\n\r\ntremendous sense of responsibility towards the young under their\r\n\r\ncharge and want to do the best for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the response of our teachers. They are\r\n\r\nconvinced  that the changes that we are making to the  education\r\n\r\nsystem  are  important and necessary.  But change is unsettling.\r\n\r\nEven  as  our  teachers  do their best to deliver  high  quality\r\n\r\neducation today, they worry about how they will continue  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir best with infusing National Education, or learning to  use\r\n\r\nIT, or dealing with more demanding parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps because we have consciously announced initiatives\r\n\r\nto all teachers way before implementing them in schools, some of\r\n\r\nour  teachers suffer from the stress of anticipating stress!   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to assure the House that it is not the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation's  intention to simply think up these initiatives  and\r\n\r\nload  them  on  to the schools.  We will guide our  schools  and\r\n\r\nteachers  each  step  of  the way.   As  I  said  earlier,  when\r\n\r\nintroducing  IT  in the demonstration schools, we  sent  experts\r\n\r\nfrom  the Ministry to work together with and guide our teachers.\r\n\r\nAnd  as  more  schools and teachers get into the IT  habit,  the\r\n\r\nscope  for shared learning and faster learning will be enlarged.\r\n\r\nIn  National  Education, we also have guided our principals  and\r\n\r\nNational   Education  coordinators  through   various   teething\r\n\r\nproblems of implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early and timely announcement of our various\r\n\r\ninitiatives  gives  principals and teachers time  to  adapt  and\r\n\r\nadjust.   For example, the IT Masterplan will reach the majority\r\n\r\nof  our  schools (two-thirds of them, or 240 of our 360 schools)\r\n\r\nonly  next  year, two years after we launched the IT Masterplan.\r\n\r\nThese   principals  and  teachers  have  two  years  to  prepare\r\n\r\nthemselves  for  this change.  Those schools and principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers who felt more ready have been those who have come in in\r\n\r\nPhase I and Phase II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is committed to providing\r\n\r\nteachers   with  the  support  for  personal  and   professional\r\n\r\ndevelopment so that they can in turn do their jobs well.  It  is\r\n\r\nuseful for me to highlight some of the key improvements we  have\r\n\r\nmade to help teachers to do their jobs better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Ministry of Education has implemented\r\n\r\na  series  of  measures to alleviate teachers' workload.   These\r\n\r\ninclude  the  posting  of school administrators  and  operations\r\n\r\nmanagers   to   perform  certain  administrative   and   support\r\n\r\nfunctions,  the streamlining of work procedures (mundane  things\r\n\r\nlike  payment  of  school fees is now done  by  GIRO,  centrally\r\n\r\nissuing  student travel passes so that teachers do not  have  to\r\n\r\nkeep  on  sticking  these things on), and leveraging  on  IT  to\r\n\r\nimprove work efficiency (like pre-printed class registers).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nreviewed  the  staffing  needs  of  schools  and  allocated   an\r\n\r\nadditional 1,000 posts.  This works out to an average  of  three\r\n\r\nposts per school.  Larger schools with more urgent needs got  up\r\n\r\nto   seven  extra  posts;  others  got  fewer;  some  got  none.\r\n\r\nPrincipals  are  free  to decide how best to  use  these  posts,\r\n\r\nwhether  to have additional teachers or other support  staff  to\r\n\r\nhelp with the administrative and other duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But getting additional posts is only the first step. We\r\n\r\nneed  to  reward our people well, and recruit and retain  enough\r\n\r\npeople to help us do the important work that we have before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, Members will recall that the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\ndid  a  major  restructuring of the teaching service,  improving\r\n\r\nsalaries  and  advancement prospects.  I like to  give  a  brief\r\n\r\nupdate  on  what  has happened since then.  Since  then,  15,285\r\n\r\nteachers  have  been  promoted to GEO1A/2A  grades,  1,766  into\r\n\r\nSenior  Education Officer grades, 454 were promoted  within  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Education  Officer grade and  95  into  and  within  the\r\n\r\nSuperscale  grades.   Approximately,  1,300  officers  will   be\r\n\r\npromoted this year.  Altogether, over 80% of teachers would have\r\n\r\nbeen promoted in these three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, we managed to recruit an average of\r\n\r\n1,900  teachers per year.  This compares with the 1,000 teachers\r\n\r\nper year we were recruiting prior to that, which was just enough\r\n\r\nto  replace those who had retired or resigned.  After accounting\r\n\r\nfor  retirements and resignations, the net increase  in  teacher\r\n\r\nstrength  over  the last two years was 1,366 in total.   We  are\r\n\r\nmaking  progress.  In this current recruitment cycle  ending  in\r\n\r\nJune, we can expect a good intake as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruitment and retention of teachers is crucial. If we\r\n\r\ncan  get a net gain of 500 teachers a year (we have 360 schools)\r\n\r\nwe  can  add one or two more teachers to every school per  year.\r\n\r\nThis  does  not  sound like a lot.  But if we can  sustain  this\r\n\r\nafter five years, every school can have 10% more teachers - 6 or\r\n\r\n7 teachers per school.  This will make a big difference and help\r\n\r\nto ease the load of our teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has the better recruitment allowed us to post more\r\n\r\nteachers to schools, it has also enabled us to let many more  go\r\n\r\non study leave to improve themselves.  Mr Hawazi and Mr Lim Swee\r\n\r\nSay  have  asked about this.  We are seizing the opportunity  of\r\n\r\nbetter  recruitment  to  make an investment  in  the  future  by\r\n\r\nallowing  more  teachers to study and improve themselves.   This\r\n\r\nyear,    386   teachers   have   been   granted   (in-principle)\r\n\r\nundergraduate  study leave, as compared to just 80  in  previous\r\n\r\nyears.  They will be emplaced appropriately when they return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more teachers in each school, better upgrading\r\n\r\nprospects and greater support given to schools and teachers,  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  more  able to improve retention rates.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  upward  trend  for the Education  Service.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nchange  things overnight, but over several years,  we  can  post\r\n\r\nmore  teachers  to  the  schools, and  that  will  make  a  real\r\n\r\ndifference  to  the workload of teachers and to the  quality  of\r\n\r\neducation that schools can deliver to our children.  Parents and\r\n\r\nthe  public  can  help  in this matter by  giving  teachers  the\r\n\r\nsupport, respect and regard due to the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call to fresh school leavers and graduates and working\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  the  passion to teach is  to  come  join  the\r\n\r\nteaching  service.  There is no cap on how many people  we  will\r\n\r\ntake in each year as long as you demonstrate the qualities which\r\n\r\nwe  look for in a good teacher.  The Ministry of Education  will\r\n\r\nprovide  the necessary training, both foundation and  in-service\r\n\r\ntraining, to help you to become a superior teacher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what can be made of any student in our education\r\n\r\nsystem  depends  primarily on the interplay  of  three  factors:\r\n\r\ncharacter   development,  motivation  and  ability.    Character\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is most important because the student  must  decide\r\n\r\nhow  he wants to use his knowledge and abilities - to serve only\r\n\r\nhimself  or to serve others, to do right under all circumstances\r\n\r\nor  only  if  he  stands  a high chance of  being  caught.   But\r\n\r\ncharacter  formation takes place almost from the time of  birth,\r\n\r\nso  that  children  in  Primary 1 comes to school  already  with\r\n\r\nvalues ingrained in them in their homes, by their parents.   Our\r\n\r\nschools  conduct moral education and civics, but  these  lessons\r\n\r\ncannot  exist  in a vacuum.  They will either be  reinforced  or\r\n\r\nthwarted by messages from home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation is important because it determines how the\r\n\r\nstudent decides to use his time, talents and his abilities.  The\r\n\r\nschool  encourages children to learn, mostly by coaching, reward\r\n\r\nand  building  self-esteem,  but  sometimes  by  punishment  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline.   At  times,  our principals  and  teachers  may  be\r\n\r\npushing  too  hard.   They  want to  do  their  best  for  their\r\n\r\nstudents.  And parents expect them to.  You will all have  heard\r\n\r\nof  parents  who complain that the teacher has not given  enough\r\n\r\nhomework, whether it is on a normal school day or over a  school\r\n\r\nholiday.   May I add that the Ministry of Education has designed\r\n\r\nthe  workbooks such that doing every single page in the workbook\r\n\r\nis  not necessary for all pupils.  Yet some parents would not be\r\n\r\nsatisfied unless the teacher has assigned the child to do  every\r\n\r\npage, and the teacher marks every page.  This is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, Dr Tan Boon Wan, Mr Iswaran, Mr Zulkifli and\r\n\r\nothers have talked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  mindset and parents' education.  I do not want to broaden\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  the  Ministry of Education to  include  teaching\r\n\r\nparents  as  well.   I  agree that self-help  groups  and  other\r\n\r\ncommunity  groups  could  introduce  parent  education  to  help\r\n\r\norientate  parents on how they can best help their  children  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation is strongly influenced by what happens at home.\r\n\r\nWhich  parent  does not believe that his child  can  do  better?\r\n\r\nWhich  parent  does  not  believe that  if  they  just  urge  or\r\n\r\nencourage  his child to work just a little harder, do  one  more\r\n\r\nexercise,  one  more worksheet, spend one more  hour,  that  the\r\n\r\nchild will get one or two more marks in his examination?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young must reach out to be the best they can be, and\r\n\r\nthey  must be encouraged and urged to do so.  But they must  not\r\n\r\nbe  pushed beyond the brink by unrealistic parental expectations\r\n\r\nand  demands.   A child who fails to achieve that which  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  him  to  achieve in  the  first  place,  will  be\r\n\r\ndemoralised and will have his self-esteem dampened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability is what schools try to bring out in the student.\r\n\r\nWe  start with the premise that every student has some talent or\r\n\r\nability.   Teachers, together with parents,  do  their  best  to\r\n\r\nidentify these talents and help the child develop them.    Every\r\n\r\nchild  is different, and we should do the best for each,  rather\r\n\r\nthan expect to make them all the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability without motivation achieves nothing. Motivation\r\n\r\nwithout  character  development is at best misguided,  at  worst\r\n\r\ndownright dangerous.  Of these three, character development  and\r\n\r\nmotivation are the most crucial, and these are the two qualities\r\n\r\nthat  can be most highly influenced by what happens at home  and\r\n\r\nby parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support Members' call for a more holistic,\r\n\r\na  more  wholesome education for our children.  Education  is  a\r\n\r\npartnership  between schools and homes.  Our  teachers  will  do\r\n\r\ntheir  best in our schools with what parents put in their hands.\r\n\r\nLet  us  each  play  our  part for the  sake  of  our  children.\r\n\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken at length about our school system today.\r\n\r\nThere  are other points, especially on higher education which  I\r\n\r\nwill  deal with at a later time before the end of this  cut.

Generally  speaking,  it  is  desirable  that\r\n\r\nchildren   with   special  educational  needs  are   given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  receive an education which is  most  suited  to\r\n\r\ntheir  disabilities.  I would like to point  out  that  disabled\r\n\r\nstudents who are able to benefit from mainstream education, such\r\n\r\nas  the  hearing  impaired,  the visually  handicapped  and  the\r\n\r\nphysically  handicapped, do and are already attending mainstream\r\n\r\nschools.  Those who are likely to benefit from attending special\r\n\r\neducation  schools  (SPED) with specially customised  programmes\r\n\r\nare encouraged to enrol in SPED schools.  These schools not only\r\n\r\ngive  them customised educational programmes, they also  provide\r\n\r\npara-medical professionals who can help in the rehabilitation of\r\n\r\nthe  children.   These include speech therapists, psychologists,\r\n\r\nphysiotherapists, social workers and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the SPED students, although not many, are able to\r\n\r\njoin   the   mainstream  schools  after  they  make  significant\r\n\r\nprogress.   Although  it  is  more expensive  to  cater  to  the\r\n\r\ndisabled in SPED schools, we will continue to encourage  parents\r\n\r\nof  disabled students to enrol their children in SPED schools so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  benefit from the special  education  that  they\r\n\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in some countries in the West, children with\r\n\r\nspecial education needs are said to be fully integrated  in  the\r\n\r\nmainstream schools.  But the fact is that many of them  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  taught  separately from the rest of the class, some  of  the\r\n\r\ntime  or  for a certain portion of the time-table, because  they\r\n\r\nrequire special assistance.  And not all the schools are able to\r\n\r\ngive these students the required\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources  or attention.  I read recently that some  parents  in\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom are demanding that their disabled children be\r\n\r\ntaken  out  of  the  mainstream schools in order   for  them  to\r\n\r\nreceive specially tailored education.   This is in the UK, after\r\n\r\nmany  years  of  integrating disabled  children  in  the  normal\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli suggested that perhaps we can set aside some\r\n\r\nclassrooms in the mainstream schools for SPED children.  We  can\r\n\r\nlook  into his suggestion on a pilot basis.  We will see whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  feasible and what kind of resources we  need  to  give\r\n\r\nthem.   But  I would like to point out from the start  that  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary    welfare   organisations   are   facing   tremendous\r\n\r\nconstraints,  because  of the shortage of trained  teachers  and\r\n\r\npara-medical  professionals.  It would be easier, in  fact,  for\r\n\r\nthem  to run the SPED schools whereby they can concentrate their\r\n\r\nresources in these places.  And they are also building  purpose-built  schools  to  suit the needs of the  different  disability\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose if disabled children are integrated in mainstream\r\n\r\nschools,  it  will enable students to learn to  live  with  each\r\n\r\nother and help each other.  However, it is a matter of balancing\r\n\r\nthe educational benefits and the social benefits to the disabled\r\n\r\nstudents.   There are already many opportunities for students to\r\n\r\ninteract and help the disabled.  I think some schools send their\r\n\r\nstudents,  mainly from the secondary levels, to visit  the  SPED\r\n\r\nschools  regularly,  some of them even on  a  weekly  basis,  to\r\n\r\nattend  and  to help the special children in music  lessons,  in\r\n\r\nswimming, in sports, in arts and crafts.  And students from  the\r\n\r\nSPED  schools  are  also  regularly invited  to  the  mainstream\r\n\r\nschools to attend National Day functions, Children's Day and  so\r\n\r\non.   So  there are plenty of opportunities for them to interact\r\n\r\nwith each other and learn to care for each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran wanted to know what more have we done for the\r\n\r\nspecial students in the mainstream schools.  As I said, many  of\r\n\r\nthe  visually impaired and hearing impaired students are already\r\n\r\nattending\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmainstream  schools.  Last year, in FY97, we  have  given  these\r\n\r\nstudents  additional resources.  Now we are giving  the  hearing\r\n\r\nimpaired students 2.6 times and the visually handicapped 3 times\r\n\r\nthe  per capita recurrent cost of secondary education.  We  have\r\n\r\nadded resource teachers for them.  For the visually handicapped,\r\n\r\nfor  example, they are given assistance with braille, assistance\r\n\r\nwith the lessons, test, examinations and so on.  For the hearing\r\n\r\nimpaired, they are taught in sign language, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest MOE initiative for children with special\r\n\r\neducational  needs in mainstream schools is with regard  to  the\r\n\r\ndyslexic and the autistic pupils.  Since the beginning of  1996,\r\n\r\nwe  have been working with the Dyslexic Association of Singapore\r\n\r\n(DAS)  to set up its learning centre at Ping Yi Primary  School,\r\n\r\nand  provide financial and physical resources to the Association\r\n\r\nto  expand  its  learning centres in other parts  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  since  the middle of last year, we have also been  offering\r\n\r\nassistance  to  a  new  voluntary  parent  group,  the  Autistic\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Singapore (AAS), which has  set  up  a  project\r\n\r\ncalled  the Reach-Me-Project for autistic children who study  in\r\n\r\nour  mainstream  schools.  We are prepared to render  even  more\r\n\r\nassistance to these two groups of high-functioning children with\r\n\r\nspecial  educational needs who are studying  in  our  mainstream\r\n\r\nschools.   Beginning  in  FY98,  we will  help  the  AAS  secure\r\n\r\nclassrooms in a functioning school and co-fund up to 90% of  the\r\n\r\none-time  renovation cost, subject to a cap of $90,000  for  the\r\n\r\nDAS  Clementi  and north zone learning centres as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nReach-Me-Project  of  the  AAS.  So we  will  help  them  secure\r\n\r\nclassrooms and renovate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will fund their recurrent cost on a one-to-one\r\n\r\nmatching  basis,  subject to a cap of  50%  of  the  per  capita\r\n\r\nrecurrent  cost of primary education.  This means MOE will  fund\r\n\r\ndyslexic  and autistic pupils in mainstream schools  up  to  1.5\r\n\r\ntimes the cost of primary education.  In addition, we will  help\r\n\r\nthem   identify  suitable  teachers  for  secondment  to   these\r\n\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-time renovation grants will cost the Government\r\n\r\n$300,000,  while the total recurrent cost to the Government  for\r\n\r\nhelping  dyslexic and autistic pupils in mainstream  schools  is\r\n\r\nestimated to be at $1.3 million per year at the steady state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also talked about the need for qualified people\r\n\r\nand  the  need  for  professional training of teachers  at  SPED\r\n\r\nschools.    There  are, right now, almost 400  teachers  and  60\r\n\r\nteacher  aides  in  the 16 SPED schools.  Of the  400  teachers,\r\n\r\nabout  300  have  received  special  education  training,  while\r\n\r\nanother   60 are currently undergoing training at the NIE.   The\r\n\r\nNIE  has  recently  upgraded its training course  to  a  diploma\r\n\r\ncourse,  and  it has shortened the amount of time  required  for\r\n\r\nthis  course,  so  that the throughput of trained  teachers  can\r\n\r\nincrease at a faster pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, there is a shortage of teachers in SPED schools.\r\n\r\nMr Iswaran is right in pointing out that one major reason is the\r\n\r\ndisparity  in the salaries as compared to teachers in mainstream\r\n\r\nschools.   But I would like to point out that the salary  scales\r\n\r\nof  teachers  and promotion guidelines are set by  the  National\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Social  Service itself.   MOE   has  seconded  some\r\n\r\nteachers  - 18 of them - to the SPED schools upon their request.\r\n\r\nTheir  salaries  are  paid for by the SPED  schools,  but  their\r\n\r\nsalaries  follow  the salary structure and promotion  guidelines\r\n\r\nfor  MOE  teachers.  Four of the principals of SPED schools  are\r\n\r\nMOE-seconded  teachers and they have been promoted  to  the  SEO\r\n\r\ngrade for principals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the teachers, as I said, the SPED schools need para-medical professionals. But there is a shortage of\r\n\r\nphysiotherapists,  speech  therapists,  music   therapists   and\r\n\r\noccupational therapists in Singapore in general.  So it is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult   for  the  SPED  schools  to  secure  such   teaching\r\n\r\nresources.   Hence I would not downplay the role of the  teacher\r\n\r\naides.    They  play  a  very important  role  in  the  schools.\r\n\r\nSpecial  education  for  children with disabilities,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  with  multiple disabilities, is a very  labour  intensive\r\n\r\nprocess.   Sometimes it calls for a one-to-one  kind of teaching\r\n\r\nrequirement.   So, in face of the shortage of trained  teachers,\r\n\r\nteaching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naides  play  a  very  important role in  providing  the  special\r\n\r\neducation required by these children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b>\r\n\r\nSir, first I would like to touch on an important point mentioned\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Zainul Abidin who reminded us of the growing expectation\r\n\r\nfor  higher education.  Indeed by the year 2000, we expect  that\r\n\r\n25%  of  each cohort would enter university, 40% will enter  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics and 25% the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).\r\n\r\nSo,  therefore,  65%  of  each  cohort  will  enter  either  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  or  ITE,  this bulging  middle  segment,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is providing amply for all those who so aspire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing opportunity for a polytechnic or ITE education\r\n\r\nis  reflected  firstly in the increased intakes into  these  two\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in  the last two years.  Between  1996  and  1998,\r\n\r\nintake  into  the  four polytechnics increased by  nearly  1,000\r\n\r\nstudents, from 15,780 to 16,800 this year.  Over the same period\r\n\r\nof  two  years, the increase in student intake into the  ITE  is\r\n\r\neven  more dramatic.  Student intake nearly doubled, from  5,988\r\n\r\nin 1996 to 11,800 expected this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, 65% of each cohort will therefore enter\r\n\r\neither the polytechnics or ITE.  Including the 25% going to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity,  we  will be providing post-secondary  and  tertiary\r\n\r\neducation  opportunities to 90% of our young people.   I  should\r\n\r\npoint  out here one important fact.  Each year, there are  1,200\r\n\r\nITE  graduates who move on to obtain a polytechnic diploma  and,\r\n\r\nsimilarly, about 1,000 polytechnic graduates go on to  obtain  a\r\n\r\ndegree  at  our  universities.  There are no  cul-de-sacs.   Our\r\n\r\neducation  system is full of bridges and ladders for  all  those\r\n\r\nwho seek them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing expectation for a polytechnic or ITE education\r\n\r\nis   not  just  by  more  students  wanting  a  place  in  these\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   As  our  economy  restructures  and   businesses\r\n\r\nrestructure,  there is an inevitable demand for new  skills  and\r\n\r\nnew knowledge.  Quite apart from this pull\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactor, many working adults themselves would wish to continue to\r\n\r\nlearn  and  to  upgrade themselves in order to  keep  themselves\r\n\r\nrelevant  in  a  changing economy.  To help raise the  education\r\n\r\nlevels   and   professional  skills  of  working   adults,   the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and ITE offer part-time continuing  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining courses specifically for them.  Currently, there are  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  41 advanced diploma courses and 7 specialist  diploma\r\n\r\npart-time  courses  offered by the polytechnics.   In  the  ITE,\r\n\r\nthere  are  also a wide-range of courses covering  the  academic\r\n\r\nareas like BEST (Basic Education Skills Training) and WISE (Work\r\n\r\nImprovement  through  Secondary Education) and  technical  areas\r\n\r\nlike  ACTS (Adult Cooperative Training Scheme) and MOST (Modular\r\n\r\nSkills Training).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enrolments of continuing education courses in the\r\n\r\npolytechnics and ITE in 1997 are 7,965 and 75,747, respectively.\r\n\r\nYou  have  heard  Mr Lim Swee Say talk about the  importance  of\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  I will add  that  nearly\r\n\r\n90%   of  the  training  places  under  SRP  will  lead  to  ITE\r\n\r\ncertification and are conducted at ITE training institutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can perhaps next address the issues raised by Mr Hawazi,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the questions that Dr Tan Boon Wan  has  raised,\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  Normal (Technical) students  and  their  recent\r\n\r\nenrolment into ITE.  Members will recall last July the fate  and\r\n\r\nwelfare of the first batch of Normal (Technical) students was  a\r\n\r\nsubject  of much discussion here.  As this was the first  batch,\r\n\r\nwe  actually  did  not know what to expect  and  like  expectant\r\n\r\nfathers, a number of MPs spoke with some anxiety on the subject.\r\n\r\nAll  expressed care and concern and encouraged them to join  ITE\r\n\r\non  completion of their Normal (Technical) course.  I would like\r\n\r\nto thank all those who have spoken on the subject.  I would also\r\n\r\nlike  to thank the media for their full support in the publicity\r\n\r\ngiven   to  ITE  and  the  encouragement  given  to  the  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical)  students and their parents urging them to  continue\r\n\r\ntheir education in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITE.   I  am happy to report that we have been extremely pleased\r\n\r\nwith the results of the enrolment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of the Normal (Technical) students who\r\n\r\ncompleted  their secondary education in December 1997 was  about\r\n\r\n20%  more than the projected annual output of Normal (Technical)\r\n\r\nschool leavers under a steady state.  This is because the  first\r\n\r\nbatch included students from the old primary school system.  Out\r\n\r\nof  a  total  of  6,740 students in the first  batch  of  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical)  stream, 5,593 or 83% of them  applied  to  ITE  for\r\n\r\ntechnical  training.   In addition, another  2,900  applications\r\n\r\nwere received from the Normal (Academic) stream.  In response to\r\n\r\nthe overwhelming number of applications, ITE had to take special\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  expand the training capacity.  A  total  of  8,846\r\n\r\ntraining  places,  comprising 6,431 full-time places  and  2,415\r\n\r\npositions  under apprenticeship programmes, were made  available\r\n\r\nto accommodate all the students.  This amounts to a 30% increase\r\n\r\ncompared with the previous year in ITE's training capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Normal (Technical) school leavers who\r\n\r\neventually took to ITE training in January 1998 was 4,918.  This\r\n\r\nrepresents  an intake rate of 73% of the GEC Normal  (Technical)\r\n\r\npool available and it exceeds the target intake of 70%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address Mr Hawazi's question on these 600 Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) students who applied but did not join ITE.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem  changed their mind and went on to do something else or  to\r\n\r\nwork.  Some decided not to join because they could not get  into\r\n\r\nthe  course  that  they want.  In fairness,  this  is  actually,\r\n\r\nproportion-wise, not a frightfully big number.   It  is  10%  of\r\n\r\nthose  who applied and I do not think that it is something which\r\n\r\nwe are terribly alarmed with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must accept that the interests of school leavers vary\r\n\r\nwidely  and  some courses, which are important  to  support  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  our  industry, may not be appealing  to  the  school\r\n\r\nleavers.   In  terms  of the number of first  choice  applicants\r\n\r\nvying  for  places in specific courses, some courses were  over-subscribed.  It is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways  possible to accommodate every first choice applicant  as\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  places in each course is planned  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  manpower  needs  of  Singapore's  economy.    It   is\r\n\r\nunavoidable that some applicants will have to be offered  places\r\n\r\nin courses not of their first choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also referred to the apprenticeship places not\r\n\r\nbeing  fully taken up.  I am told that the requirement of  a  2-year  bond  is a factor for this.  I think we have heard  enough\r\n\r\nabout bonds over the last week in this House and I shall say  no\r\n\r\nmore  on  the subject this time.  But I agree that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nselling  job,  as  Dr Tan Boon Wan has mentioned.   There  is  a\r\n\r\nselling job for courses that are less popular but, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nimportant.   ITE  had  in fact put in place  career  counselling\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  students to make informed choices  even  before\r\n\r\nthey  enrol.  This is to provide advice to parents and  students\r\n\r\nin choosing courses based on the student's aptitude, inclination\r\n\r\nand  interest, instead of just the popularity or glamour of  the\r\n\r\ncourse, or a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations made to receive the first batch of Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical)  students into ITE this January started  almost  the\r\n\r\nday  the students entered Secondary One, Normal (Technical) four\r\n\r\nyears  ago.   Over  the  last few years, ITE  has  painstakingly\r\n\r\ncarried  out a comprehensive programme of promotional activities\r\n\r\nto  share  with the students and the parents the full  range  of\r\n\r\ntraining  offered  by  ITE  and  the  career  opportunities   in\r\n\r\nindustry.  They have brought both students and parents into  the\r\n\r\nvarious  institutes  of  ITE  to get  a  good  feel  of  an  ITE\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, their efforts have been well rewarded. The\r\n\r\nfirst  batch  of Normal (Technical) students started  their  ITE\r\n\r\ntraining in January and in the last two months, the feedback  on\r\n\r\ntheir  performance has been positive.  We have the  report  that\r\n\r\nthe students are motivated and keen to learn, they are quick  in\r\n\r\npractical  hands-on training and they are adept in  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncomputers and are able to learn better through the computer mode\r\n\r\nof  instruction.   We  will continue to monitor  their  progress\r\n\r\nclosely and provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaximum   assistance  to  help  them  complete   their   courses\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.   Measures taken so far to assist  these  students\r\n\r\ninclude counselling and guidance to sustain the interest of  the\r\n\r\nstudents, use of computer-based teaching and learning materials,\r\n\r\nsimplifying  the  language used in lesson notes and  integrating\r\n\r\nmore  theories into practical lessons.  We will spare no  effort\r\n\r\nto bring the best out of our Normal (Technical) students because\r\n\r\nwe  believe that the ITE graduates that they will become are  an\r\n\r\nessential constituent of Singapore's human resource capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now go on to address Dr Toh See Kiat's question\r\n\r\non  education of returning children and what help  is  given  to\r\n\r\nthem  to settle back into our system.  In any area we can  think\r\n\r\nof,  there is no shortage of anecdotes.  But there is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the first concern of Singaporean expatriate parents is  to\r\n\r\nfind  a  school back home for their children.  It  could  be  to\r\n\r\nrejoin  a  former school, to join at Primary One or to  join  at\r\n\r\nother  levels.   The  Education Information  and  Guidance  Unit\r\n\r\n(EIGU)  was created by the Ministry in 1991.  The Unit  provides\r\n\r\nan  advisory  service  to the Singapore expatriates  on  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning the children's education in Singapore and assist them\r\n\r\nin  the  placement of their children in Singapore  schools  upon\r\n\r\ntheir  return.   The Unit of course can advise  parents  before,\r\n\r\nduring  or after their assignments.  There is no time  limit  on\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question raised by Dr Toh See Kiat is what help can\r\n\r\nbe  given to the child to settle back into the Singapore  school\r\n\r\nsystem,  especially with the demands for the mother tongue.   He\r\n\r\nasked  if exemptions can be given.  It is known policy that  all\r\n\r\nSingaporean  pupils  are required to study  an  official  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  language, Chinese, Malay or Tamil, or a non-Tamil Indian\r\n\r\nlanguage, in our primary schools.  However, pupils who have been\r\n\r\noverseas  for  a  number of years may apply for  exemption  from\r\n\r\noffering a mother tongue language at national examinations  when\r\n\r\nthey  return  to  join  Singapore  schools.   The  Ministry   is\r\n\r\nsympathetic  to  parent's  concerns and  has  been  flexible  in\r\n\r\nconsidering applications for exemption on a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase-by-case   basis.   Decisions  are  based  on   professional\r\n\r\njudgment on what can be reasonably achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, pupils rejoining mid-stream at the primary or\r\n\r\nsecondary  level and who have not had the opportunity  to  study\r\n\r\nthe  mother  tongue overseas will be considered  favourably  for\r\n\r\nthis exemption from mother tongue language at the primary level,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the PSLE, or the \"O\" level or \"N\" level, or  the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel  examination.  But the exemption is granted for  only  one\r\n\r\nexamination.  This means that the pupils who are exempted at the\r\n\r\nPSLE are expected to offer an official mother tongue language or\r\n\r\na  minority Indian language or their approved foreign  language,\r\n\r\nFrench,  German or Japanese, when they are promoted to Secondary\r\n\r\nOne.   The pupil will then offer this language at GCE \"O\"  level\r\n\r\nand at the GCE \"A\" level examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concessions are only to help the child's transition\r\n\r\nback  into  the  Singapore  school  system.   They  do  not   by\r\n\r\nthemselves   bring  about  any  improvement   in   the   child's\r\n\r\nproficiency  in the language.  The parents and the schools  must\r\n\r\nultimately provide the help and encouragement for the  child  to\r\n\r\ncatch up and improve.  Schools too exercise a certain degree  of\r\n\r\nflexibility in helping the returning pupils settle in.   As  the\r\n\r\npupils rejoin Singapore schools at different times of the school\r\n\r\nyear, parents are understandably concerned about the performance\r\n\r\nof  their  children in the school examinations.  Principals  are\r\n\r\ngiven the discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis whether a\r\n\r\nchild could be exempted from examination and/or promoted to  the\r\n\r\nnext level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What might also be helpful are our immersion programmes.\r\n\r\nArrangements  can  be made for children returning  during  their\r\n\r\nvacation to attend classes in Singapore schools to ease their re-entry  into  the system at a later date.  Singapore  expatriates\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to have their children participate in these immersion\r\n\r\nprogrammes can write to EIGU for assistance or apply directly to\r\n\r\nthe schools concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how serious really is the general problem? A study\r\n\r\namong returned pupils from overseas and parents was conducted by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry and it shows that generally pupils adjust well and\r\n\r\nquickly  to  the  situation they are in.  Existing  efforts  and\r\n\r\ninduction  by  schools  are adequate.  Pupils'  personality  and\r\n\r\nfamily   background  contribute  to  the  rate  of   adjustment.\r\n\r\nParents' main areas of concern include finding a place for their\r\n\r\nchildren in a suitable school, streaming and assessments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore parents are a resourceful lot. They use a\r\n\r\nvariety  of coping strategies, including widening the circle  of\r\n\r\nfriends,  keeping  in touch with the Singapore education  system\r\n\r\nthrough  friends  and  relatives and the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nwebsite and the use of textbooks and assessment books.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, all the help that others give can only\r\n\r\nbe  to buy time to enable the child to acclimatise and catch up.\r\n\r\nNothing can replace the help and encouragement which the parents\r\n\r\nand  the schools have to provide and, of course, the child's own\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on Quality Education.\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to declare my interest as a staff of NUS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a national attitude of \"Thinking Schools and\r\n\r\nLearning  Nation\", we need to adopt a holistic quality  approach\r\n\r\nto  education.  Although the Education Ministry has an  internal\r\n\r\nquality system, we need to develop an internationally recognised\r\n\r\nquality assurance system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve world-class standing and recognition, we must\r\n\r\nadopt  the  ISO  9000 approach to our educational  institutions.\r\n\r\nClear  quality  policies,  objectives  and  procedures  must  be\r\n\r\ndocumented to ensure that quality services are provided  in  our\r\n\r\nMinistry and schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISO 9000 quality assurance model provides a systematic\r\n\r\napproach to ensure that quality services are delivered.  It  has\r\n\r\na   structure  whereby  regular  periodic  quality  audits   are\r\n\r\nconducted.   We  should conduct external audit to ascertain  the\r\n\r\nquality of students produced.  For example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools should audit primary schools,  pre-university\r\n\r\ninstitutions  should  audit  secondary  schools,  the   tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions   auditing  the  pre-universities,   and   finally,\r\n\r\nemployers auditing our tertiary institutions.  In this  way,  we\r\n\r\ncan  always  be assured that our students are receiving  quality\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the cost of education is rising and\r\n\r\nthe  operating budget of the Ministry is tight.  But  we  should\r\n\r\nnot  compromise on the quality of education.  Thus, I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can update the House as to how he proposes to  achieve\r\n\r\nlow cost and high quality education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the Ministry\r\n\r\ncontinues to build new schools in new estates and sometimes even\r\n\r\nin the established estates.  I am certain that the schools built\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry are good schools.  However, there  can  be  no\r\n\r\ndenying the fact that some schools are better than others.  Even\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  has a ranking system for the schools.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  many  schools  have developed good  standards  and  have\r\n\r\nestablished excellent track records.  Many of these schools  are\r\n\r\neither  Government-aided  schools or SAP  schools.   Some,  like\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution,  are Government schools.   Many  of  these\r\n\r\nschools have a long tradition and established system and  strong\r\n\r\nalumni which contribute to the development of the school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that the Ministry considered tapping on these\r\n\r\nschools for their expertise when they build new schools  in  new\r\n\r\nestates.   There  is, of course, the concern  that  if  the  SAP\r\n\r\nschools or Government-aided schools are involved in establishing\r\n\r\nnew schools, the minority races may avoid SAP schools for either\r\n\r\nlanguage  or religious reasons.  And this will result in  uneven\r\n\r\ndistribution of minority races in neighbourhood schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the solution is not to prevent good schools from\r\n\r\nestablishing  their  tradition and  good  system  elsewhere  but\r\n\r\nrather  to ensure that they open up and encourage people of  all\r\n\r\nraces to join the schools.  Many of these schools have an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablished  system, a very strong school  spirit  and  a  loyal\r\n\r\nalumni which together make a strong recipe for success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In new estates, like Sengkang and Punggol, where several\r\n\r\nnew  schools can be built or accommodated, the Ministry may want\r\n\r\nto  consider allowing some of these well established schools who\r\n\r\nwant  to  share their success to set up new schools  and  manage\r\n\r\nthese  schools.   After  all,  you  want  to  provide  the  best\r\n\r\nenvironment  for our pupils and to build not only  good  schools\r\n\r\nbut  better  schools.  If we can tap on the value  systems,  the\r\n\r\nacademic record and alumni spirit of these schools, it will help\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to  establish better schools and  not  just  good\r\n\r\nschools.   The Minister has just said in his speech  earlier  on\r\n\r\nabout the importance of character, motivation and ability.   And\r\n\r\nthese  very  schools  which have these records  and  established\r\n\r\ntraditions  are  the best schools to establish  these  areas  of\r\n\r\ncharacter, motivation and ability in our school children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, I hope that the Ministry will consider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to speak\r\n\r\nin support of single session schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commendable that $150 million or 17% of development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on education in fiscal year 1998 will be  spent  on\r\n\r\nconverting  secondary schools into single  session  schools.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to propose that the Ministry go one step further  to\r\n\r\nextend single session schools to primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same reasons which apply to single session secondary\r\n\r\nschools  also  apply  to primary schools.   These  reasons  are:\r\n\r\nfirst,  students can spend the morning covering  the  curriculum\r\n\r\nand  the  afternoon  in enrichment programmes,  extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities  or  remedial  lessons.   Not  only  does  this  give\r\n\r\nstudents  a more all-rounded education, it also offers  students\r\n\r\nfrom  different  classes greater opportunities for  interaction.\r\n\r\nThis  promotes  bonding  among  students  and  helps  develop  a\r\n\r\nstronger  sense of community in the school.  Often, the learning\r\n\r\nwhich occurs outside the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclassroom  can  be  just as important as the  academic  learning\r\n\r\nwithin the classroom.  Attributes such as the give-and-take,  of\r\n\r\nbeing  a  team  player, learning to win and lose  gracefully  in\r\n\r\nsports  and  games,  are  important in the  development  of  the\r\n\r\noverall  person which the Ministry has announced as the  aim  of\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that teachers have a greater\r\n\r\nflexibility   in   arranging  their   schedules.    They   could\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on the academic syllabus in the morning  and  spend\r\n\r\nthe  afternoon in a variety of ways, such as helping the  weaker\r\n\r\nstudents or overseeing the students' enrichment programmes.  The\r\n\r\nsame would apply, of course, for afternoon school at present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that this would also benefit parents.\r\n\r\nSingle  session primary schools, by keeping children  in  school\r\n\r\nfor  a longer time, will fulfill an important component of child\r\n\r\ncare.   It will take the worry off the parents' minds, regarding\r\n\r\nwhat  the  children were doing after they finished  the  morning\r\n\r\nsession  or  before they started school in the afternoon.   This\r\n\r\nwould  be  particularly relevant in the case where both  parents\r\n\r\nwork  and  there  are no relatives or maids to  look  after  the\r\n\r\nchildren during the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, 38% of married women worked. Today, 47.5% of\r\n\r\nmarried women work.  Broadly speaking, then, nearly half of  all\r\n\r\nhouseholds in Singapore are already dual income households.   In\r\n\r\n10 years' time, it could well be that 60% of households could be\r\n\r\ndual income households.  In the eventuality that all schools are\r\n\r\nconverted  to single session schools, I have one more suggestion\r\n\r\n-  start  school one hour later at 8.30 am, instead of 7.30  am.\r\n\r\nThen,  there  will  be greater coincidence of  parents'  working\r\n\r\nhours  with  children's  school-going time.   This  will  enable\r\n\r\nparents  to spend a longer time with their school-going children\r\n\r\nin  the mornings and will take care of the child care aspects as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I urge the Ministry to consider\r\n\r\nextending single session schools to primary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on School Cluster. Sir, I\r\n\r\nmust  commend  the  Education Ministry for introducing  the  six\r\n\r\nhours  per  year  per student community service requirement  for\r\n\r\nschool   children.   This  exposure  will  definitely  inculcate\r\n\r\ncommunity service values among our students.  In fact, a further\r\n\r\nstep  will  be to encourage more principals and teachers  to  be\r\n\r\ninvolved in community work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Ministry to restructure the\r\n\r\nschool cluster management committee so that both the schools and\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations can work together for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe   community.    To  facilitate  closer  collaboration,   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  should  be headed by the advisor  of  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  or  a person appointed by the  advisor.   Members\r\n\r\nshould  include  principals, School Advisory Committee  chairmen\r\n\r\nand other appointed members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this structure, the advisor will be able to harness\r\n\r\nthe  resources of both the schools and grassroots organisations.\r\n\r\nThe  advisor will also be able to deploy staff and resources  to\r\n\r\nensure  the smooth running of the schools.  Principals, teachers\r\n\r\nand  grassroots leaders will thus have the opportunity  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether and share their experiences.  In this way, we not  only\r\n\r\ndevelop the community service value system in our students,  but\r\n\r\nalso that of our teachers and principals.  At the same time,  we\r\n\r\ncan develop a community culture in our neighbourhood schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my cut is on\r\n\r\nBoarding Schools.  There are very few schools in Singapore which\r\n\r\nhave  boarding  facilities.  Unlike  in  England,  the  boarding\r\n\r\nschool system is prevalent there.  May I suggest to the Minister\r\n\r\nto  set up boarding facilities in some of the better schools, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  to  cater  for students who  have  to  travel  long\r\n\r\ndistances to attend those schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, one of the problems in Singapore is traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion.  If large numbers of students can be housed  in  the\r\n\r\nschool compound or within walking distance of the schools, where\r\n\r\nthe boarding schools are sited, much of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion  can  be mitigated.   I  am  not  suggesting\r\n\r\nsetting up boarding schools to solve our traffic problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important reasons for setting up boarding schools\r\n\r\nare  for social and educational reasons.  When students stay  in\r\n\r\nboarding  school,  they are living in a community.   They  learn\r\n\r\ngood  social habits.  They learn to give and take.   This  means\r\n\r\nthat  they learn not to be selfish.  They learn always  to  care\r\n\r\nnot   only  for  themselves  but  take  into  consideration  the\r\n\r\ninterests of others around them.  As Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has  said,\r\n\r\nin  one  session schools the possibility of bonding between  the\r\n\r\nstudents  is  great.  I think in boarding schools,  the  bonding\r\n\r\nwould even be greater.  They also learn to be disciplined.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  do  things as they like.  They are to a  certain  extent\r\n\r\nregimented  because in boarding schools, they shall  have  fixed\r\n\r\nhours  for studying and other times for games.  I think at home,\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of discipline is less because most likely  both  the\r\n\r\nparents  are  working.   They  also learn  to  be  self-reliant,\r\n\r\ntolerant and independent.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the boarding school system in England has produced\r\n\r\ngreat  leaders,  both in government and in  politics,  and  also\r\n\r\ngreat  administrators.  It was said that the Battle of  Waterloo\r\n\r\nwas  won  at the playing field of Eton.  Sir, Eton is  a  famous\r\n\r\nEnglish  public school.  Eton is also a boarding  school.   What\r\n\r\nthe  saying  means  is  probably that in  this  type  of  school\r\n\r\nenvironment,  the qualities of leadership, courage, cooperation,\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and  physical  fitness are  inculcated.   All  these\r\n\r\nqualities probably help in the winning of the Battle of Waterloo\r\n\r\nwhere  many of the generals and leaders in the battle came from.\r\n\r\nOf  course, these qualities will also assist in helping to build\r\n\r\nmen later in their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that we should have an Eton school\r\n\r\nduplicated   in  Singapore.   But  good  boarding  schools   can\r\n\r\ninculcate in our students those extra values which a normal  day\r\n\r\nschool  would  not  be able to do so.  The ordinary  day  school\r\n\r\nlacks  the  element  of  communal living.   Communal  living  is\r\n\r\nperhaps the essence of boarding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool.

A   lot   of\r\n\r\ninsightful thinking has gone into this document and I  think  it\r\n\r\nis  a  first-class piece of work.  There is one particular  line\r\n\r\nthat  caught my attention and I would just like to read it  loud\r\n\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The foundation of a person is his value system, from which\r\n\r\nsprings his outlook on life and his goals in life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is a very important statement. It is\r\n\r\nsomething  that is worth discussing further.  With globalisation\r\n\r\nand  technology, the world is getting more and more complicated.\r\n\r\nFor  the  young Singaporeans to survive in the future, obviously\r\n\r\nyou  need to have more knowledge.  But with technology, you  can\r\n\r\nactually  have  access  to knowledge in a  just-in-time  manner.\r\n\r\nMany people say that we should not worry too much about what  we\r\n\r\nlearn  in  school  because  when  we  need  the  information  or\r\n\r\nknowledge we can always have it, when we need it.  This  is  the\r\n\r\njust-in-time concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of the value system, there is no such thing\r\n\r\nas  a  just-in-time value system.  With globalisation, the young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are now exposed to the world.  We are  seeing  all\r\n\r\nkinds of influences, bad or good, that are influencing the young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  My view is that for young Singaporeans  to  think\r\n\r\nstraight  in the future, it is very important that they  have  a\r\n\r\nstronger value foundation.  In that regard, I am very happy that\r\n\r\nvalue  system is being highlighted and given the right  emphasis\r\n\r\nin this document.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having recognised the importance of value system, the next\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  how can we do even more to inculcate  a  stronger\r\n\r\nvalue  system in our young?  Here, I would like to present  just\r\n\r\none  small  suggestion.  I believe that there is a limited  time\r\n\r\nfor  us to teach our students and whatever time we can spend  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe teaching of a value system is something we should not forgo.\r\n\r\nTake,  for  example,  the  learning of second  language  in  the\r\n\r\nschool.   I  noted  that  in our Chinese  textbook,  this  is  a\r\n\r\nphotocopy  taken  from  a Primary 6 textbook  [indicating],  the\r\n\r\narticle  is an excellent one.  It is a story about a father  and\r\n\r\nson  and the kind of love and care between them.  It is  a  very\r\n\r\nmoving  story.   But  at  the  end  of  the  lesson,  what   was\r\n\r\nhighlighted  in  the  revision section is:   what  are  the  new\r\n\r\nsentences you have learned in this lesson and what are  the  new\r\n\r\nwords you have learned in this lesson.  My humble suggestion is,\r\n\r\nwhy  not add another section, and ask the students what are  the\r\n\r\nmoral  values  they  have learned from this lesson.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat,  in so doing, by combining the learning of a language  and\r\n\r\nthe  strengthening of the value system, we can go a long way  to\r\n\r\nfurther strengthen the inculcation of a stronger value system in\r\n\r\nour young.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T.E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T.E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, after that very\r\n\r\nstirring  speech by the Minister on what the Ministry has  done,\r\n\r\nis  doing  and  will be doing for our students, I feel  somewhat\r\n\r\nlike  Oliver Twist coming back and asking for more.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nnonetheless an important subject and if the Minister  will  bear\r\n\r\nwith me, I would like to talk about pre-school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue is whether the way we teach our very young\r\n\r\nand  what  subjects  we teach them makes any difference  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a child both academically or socially.  There are\r\n\r\nat  least  three reasons why I believe that a higher quality  of\r\n\r\nearly  childhood education is beneficial and why we  should  pay\r\n\r\nattention to this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Over the last 20 years, our knowledge of how the mind works\r\n\r\nand  how  it  develops  has increased.  We  now  know  that  the\r\n\r\nstimulation  of  the  mind  at  a  very  early  age  facilitates\r\n\r\nlearning, especially of language.  It is also well accepted that\r\n\r\nthere  are  different forms of intelligence and  that  different\r\n\r\nchildren  learn in different ways.  What this research tells  us\r\n\r\nis  that  a child who is seen to be slow may simply be  a  child\r\n\r\nthat is forced into a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmode of learning that does not fit him or her.  Conversely, in a\r\n\r\nright  environment, a child's development might well be enhanced\r\n\r\nand accelerated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Over the last one or two decades, many educators have\r\n\r\npioneered  teaching  methods  to  take  into  account  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  how the mind works.  Admittedly,  some  early\r\n\r\nresearch showed that improvements to IQ scores tested at Primary\r\n\r\n1  washed  out after two or three years in primary school.   But\r\n\r\nlater  studies  have also shown that benefits can  be  sustained\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the  approach  used.   These  benefits  may   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  show up just in academic scores, but  also  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  social  benefits  such as lower  drop-out  rates  from\r\n\r\nschools or a lesser degree of trouble with the law.  The results\r\n\r\nshow  that  learning effectiveness at an early age is linked  to\r\n\r\nthe  way  we  teach the young child.  But whether or  not  these\r\n\r\nresults  can be sustained may depend on whether we are  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide the same supportive environment as the child grows up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Across all cultures, social norms or customs or\r\n\r\npractices and values are inculcated from a very early  age.   It\r\n\r\nis  true  that  formal  learning,  like  mastering  Mathematics,\r\n\r\nScience  or  Economics, can only take place when the  brain  has\r\n\r\nsufficiently   matured  and  is  capable  of  certain   abstract\r\n\r\nconstructions.   But we also cannot deny our instinctive  belief\r\n\r\nthat  habits and values and attitudes are formed not so much  by\r\n\r\nformal   instruction  alone,  but  shaped  by  early   childhood\r\n\r\nexperiences.   Indeed,  two  of  the  three  pillars  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister spoke about, character development and motivation,  are\r\n\r\nformed by the time the child enters the formal school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the approach which early childhood educators take\r\n\r\ntoday is based on the notion that the mind is not a vessel to be\r\n\r\nfilled  up but a fire to be kindled.  By creating a safe, caring\r\n\r\nbut  challenging  environment, these educators  stimulate  young\r\n\r\nchildren  to  reach out for new knowledge and not  to  wait  for\r\n\r\nknowledge to be dished out to them.  In the process of learning,\r\n\r\nthe children also build self-confidence.  And in discovering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknowledge, they also discover the sameness and differences  with\r\n\r\nother  children,  learning both acceptance and leadership;  both\r\n\r\nteamwork  and  challenge.   By  helping  children  to  build   a\r\n\r\nfoundation for learning, early childhood educators prepare  them\r\n\r\nto  become  more  self-actuating and hence more successful  when\r\n\r\nthey enter the formal school years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons and reasons given by other Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  who have spoken on the subject, I hope that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education would take a closer look at this important matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the early ages, from two to six, child care and\r\n\r\nchild development are hard to separate.  Learning is integrative\r\n\r\nand  whole life.  It cannot be separated into discrete  subjects\r\n\r\nor  periods.  The Ministry can rightly argue that child care  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  State's responsibility and should rightly be  left  to\r\n\r\nparents and market forces.  But it should play an active part in\r\n\r\na  young  child's education.  If we can more fully  realise  the\r\n\r\npotential  of our young and produce youths with a greater  sense\r\n\r\nof  social  responsibility or reduce juvenile delinquency,  then\r\n\r\nour  efforts would have been worthwhile.  Our money  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen well spent.  I realise that the education of the very young\r\n\r\nis  still a relatively new area.  There is much we need to learn\r\n\r\nand  understand  about which methods are effective  and  how  we\r\n\r\nshould go about providing better early childhood education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to make two proposals on how we can\r\n\r\nmake  progress in this area.  Firstly, I would like  to  propose\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Education set up a research and  teaching\r\n\r\ncentre  to  look into early childhood development and education.\r\n\r\nThe  centre  should gather from other countries those programmes\r\n\r\nin  early  childhood learning which have worked and  also  study\r\n\r\nthose  programmes  which have failed.  It  can  promote  greater\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  how children learn at an  early  age  and  do\r\n\r\nresearch  into  how effective learning can be  achieved  in  the\r\n\r\nearly years and sustain as the child grows up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the centre should set up or work with a number of\r\n\r\nprototype schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  gain first-hand experience and to see in practice what works\r\n\r\nand what does not in our cultural context.  Some private schools\r\n\r\nand  kindergartens who have already made a pioneering  start  in\r\n\r\nnew  learning  methods  could be brought  under  this  prototype\r\n\r\nprogramme.   MOE could provide them with funding assistance  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  take  an active role in research and development  into\r\n\r\nearly  childhood  learning and also  to  reach  out  to  a  more\r\n\r\nrepresentative  mix of children.  The funding and  staffing  for\r\n\r\nthese  two  efforts will not be large compared  to  the  overall\r\n\r\nschool programme.  But it would be well worthwhile if this would\r\n\r\nlead to a better educational foundation for our very young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not every child is a genius though many mothers may\r\n\r\nthink so.  But there is a genius in every child.  By recognising\r\n\r\nthe   importance   of  early  childhood  development   and   the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  early childhood learning,  we  can  set  this\r\n\r\ngenius free.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to touch on this\r\n\r\nsubject  of ranking of schools.  There is a saying that  if  you\r\n\r\nfeed  peanuts,  you  get  monkeys.  I am  not  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nteachers  are  monkeys.  But I am saying that  if  we  rank  the\r\n\r\nschools according to results, then we are likely to have all the\r\n\r\nteachers concentrating their efforts on producing results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that there is a junior college whose principal and\r\n\r\nschool  teachers actually responded to the call by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto promote creativity, and so on.  What they did was to try some\r\n\r\nnew   methods  of  teaching,  but  as  a  result  the   academic\r\n\r\nperformance dropped because whatever new knowledge that they had\r\n\r\npassed  on  to  the students was not tested.  As a  result,  the\r\n\r\nschool had now decided to go back to the old way of teaching.  I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Minister to consider changing the way of ranking.\r\n\r\nIf  you are talking about producing a whole person, then I think\r\n\r\nranking must reflect the criteria of the whole person.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I knew you could do it.
