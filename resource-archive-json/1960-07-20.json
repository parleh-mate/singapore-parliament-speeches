Government\r\n\r\nduring its first year of office, due regard must be\r\n\r\npaid to the limitations under which it had to work.\r\n\r\nThese  limitations were clearly and frankly stated,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  elections, in the  P.A.P.'s  Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan.  The  people were aware what they  could  and\r\n\r\ncould  not  expect of a P.A.P. Government.  It  was\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  would  operate   under   a\r\n\r\nconstitution which did not give it complete freedom\r\n\r\nand   independence  of  political  action.  It  was\r\n\r\nemphasised that Singapore was a small island,  with\r\n\r\nno natural resources and dependent upon a sensitive\r\n\r\nentrepot   trade  for  its  livelihood.   \"Existing\r\n\r\nconditions\", the plan stressed, \"are not favourable\r\n\r\nto  the immediate attainment of a socialist society\r\n\r\nand  a  fully  developed socialist society,  and  a\r\n\r\nfully   developed  socialist  economy   cannot   be\r\n\r\nachieved as long as Singapore is separated from the\r\n\r\nFederation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would no doubt have been advantageous, before\r\n\r\nan  election,  to  have-come  forward  with  lavish\r\n\r\npromises  of independence and socialism.  But  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhad  no  intention  of deceiving  the  people  into\r\n\r\nvoting  for it with promises it could not  fulfill.\r\n\r\nIt  asked the people to vote for it on the basis of\r\n\r\nwhat  it  described  as a \"not over-ambitious\"  but\r\n\r\n\"realistic\" Plan, to quote the words of  the\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan.  The  overwhelming vote  given  by  the\r\n\r\npeople to the P.A.P. is proof that its analysis and\r\n\r\nstrategy were acceptable to the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government  was not  prepared  before  the\r\n\r\nelections  to deceive the people with  promises  to\r\n\r\ndeliver  the sun moon and stars, it has  even  less\r\n\r\nreason  now to hold out false hopes. Democracy  has\r\n\r\ncollapsed   in  some  countries  in  Asia   because\r\n\r\ngovernments, in their eagerness to cling to  power,\r\n\r\nembraced  demagogy at the expense of integrity  and\r\n\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no intention of recklessly\r\n\r\nabandoning the aims and policies arrived  at  after\r\n\r\nlong   and   patient  deliberation.  A  responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  permit  itself  the  luxury  of\r\n\r\nchanging with every puff of wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correctness of the policy laid down in the\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan  has been shown by  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nunder  the  new Government, Singapore  has  enjoyed\r\n\r\ngreater  political and economic stability  than  it\r\n\r\nhas  known during the last 15 years. For the  first\r\n\r\ntime  in the Island's history the interests of  the\r\n\r\nmasses  have  been  more closely  linked  with  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  Government. The sense of  oppression,\r\n\r\nhumiliation and resentment which people experienced\r\n\r\nunder  colonial  rule  has  slowly  given  way   to\r\n\r\nfeelings of national pride and self-confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first year of office was one of\r\n\r\nreorganisation, consolidation and preparation.  It\r\n\r\nwas  taken up largely with clearing the ground  and\r\n\r\nsetting  the  course for the year  of  construction\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not wish to give the\r\n\r\nimpression  that there have not been  mistakes  and\r\n\r\nshortcomings during the past year. It is aware that\r\n\r\nsome   of  its  measures  should  have  been   more\r\n\r\ncarefully  planned and expertly executed.  In  some\r\n\r\ninstances, it moved too fast and without  preparing\r\n\r\npublic opinion adequately for the changes. Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  legislation  resulted  in  inconveniences   or\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings which could have been avoided  by\r\n\r\na    little   more   foresight,   a   little   more\r\n\r\nconsultation,   discussion  and   a   little   more\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are errors arising from zeal and\r\n\r\nimpatience  to get things done. In the coming  year\r\n\r\nthe  Government will temper zeal with understanding\r\n\r\nand its impatience by explaining more to the people\r\n\r\nthe need for certain courses of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FINANCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that a year ago the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore  faced  many  financial and  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties. There was a deficit looming on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhorizon. There was considerable uncertainty  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  stability of the political foundation  of  the\r\n\r\nState  and  this led to hesitation on the  part  of\r\n\r\npotential investors. Our two great neighbours,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya and Indonesia,  then  looked\r\n\r\nupon the events in Singapore with some reservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far-sighted policies of the Government\r\n\r\nannounced last year were firmly carried out and  in\r\n\r\n12 short months we have seen a complete reversal of\r\n\r\nposition. The State ended the year's budget with  a\r\n\r\nsmall surplus of $9 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations with Indonesia entered a stage of\r\n\r\ncordiality.  This was principally  due  to  a  more\r\n\r\nrealistic  appraisal of relations between  the  two\r\n\r\nStates.  With regard to the Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nthe  danger  then  was  that the  Federation  might\r\n\r\npursue policies which did not take into account the\r\n\r\nlegitimate interests of Singapore. This danger  was\r\n\r\nhappily averted. On major matters of financial  and\r\n\r\neconomic  policy,  the two Governments  have  taken\r\n\r\npains  to  carry out mutual consultations. Examples\r\n\r\nof  these are the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill,  the\r\n\r\nnew  Currency  Agreement, fiscal proposals  over  a\r\n\r\nbroad  field  and, last but not least, the  current\r\n\r\ntalks on the Common Commodity Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of trade and private investment, the\r\n\r\neconomic  policies  of  the Government  have  borne\r\n\r\nsubstantial   fruit.  The  last   12   months   saw\r\n\r\nconsiderable  improvement in the  volume  of  trade\r\n\r\nboth for domestic market and for the entrepot.  The\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  uncertainty and hesitation  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  private  investment was  replaced  by  a\r\n\r\nclimate  of  confidence.  Proof  of  this  was  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial   volume  of  private  investment   now\r\n\r\nseeking   permission  to  operate   in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nApplications  for  exemption  under   the   Pioneer\r\n\r\nIndustries  Ordinance alone give  a  total  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital  of  more than $101 million from  13  major\r\n\r\nconcerns. These new industries range over fields as\r\n\r\nwide  apart  as oil refining, rolling of  aluminium\r\n\r\nproducts, flour milling, sugar refining, production\r\n\r\nof  foodstuffs  such as chocolate, condensed  milk,\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be necessary to ensure that the momentum\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been achieved at the cost of much  hard\r\n\r\nwork   and   planning  should  be   sustained   and\r\n\r\nincreased.  The most important single objective  of\r\n\r\nthe  economic  policy  of  the  Government  is   to\r\n\r\nincrease the rate of gross capital formation in the\r\n\r\nState. In the past years, gross investment in  this\r\n\r\nisland  hardly exceeded 11 per cent of its national\r\n\r\nincome.  This  proportion is quite inadequate,  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  provide work for our expanding population\r\n\r\nbut  even  to  maintain our present  level  of  per\r\n\r\ncapita national income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be necessary to increase the rate of\r\n\r\ngross  investment to something like 20 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  gross national income. This will be the  prime\r\n\r\nobjective  of the Five-Year Development  Plan,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  draft of which has been prepared  and  which\r\n\r\nwill  form the basis of financial discussions  with\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of money value, it will be necessary to\r\n\r\nplough  back something like $400 million a year  in\r\n\r\ninvestment. About half of this investment will take\r\n\r\nplace  in the public sector. This will include  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of economic services such as power, water\r\n\r\nand  gas  supplies, the construction of  roads  and\r\n\r\nbridges,  improvement to the sea port  and  Airport\r\n\r\nand    the   Singapore   River,   enlargement    of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications   facilities,    provision    of\r\n\r\nindustrial   sites  and  so  forth,  as   well   as\r\n\r\ninvestment in the social services the main item  of\r\n\r\nwhich   will   be  housing,  schools  and   medical\r\n\r\nfacilities.  The proportions in which  the  demands\r\n\r\nfor economic services and social services are to be\r\n\r\nsatisfied have been provisionally estimated in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan. An assessment must  be  made  of\r\n\r\nwhat  overseas finance is available. It is expected\r\n\r\nthat  the answers to this will be known before long\r\n\r\nand  the  final copy of the Development  Plan  will\r\n\r\nthen be tabled in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater part of the money for public\r\n\r\ninvestment,  however, must be found  from  our  own\r\n\r\ndomestic resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will mean the exercise of strictest economy in\r\n\r\nannually  recurrent expenditure which provides  for\r\n\r\nthe  normal economic and social services  which  we\r\n\r\nnow  have. The aim is to provide as large a surplus\r\n\r\nas  possible  in  the annual budgets  of  both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  public  authorities  to   finance\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Industrial Expansion</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several factors which have generated confidence\r\n\r\nand   stimulated  industrial  expansion  are  worth\r\n\r\nnoting.  They  must be strengthened to  consolidate\r\n\r\nthe advances we have made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these must be a firm and stable\r\n\r\nGovernment  whose policy and actions are consistent\r\n\r\nand   predictable.  These  would  allow   long-term\r\n\r\nforecasts  to be made by private investors  with  a\r\n\r\ndegree  of assurance that their calculations  would\r\n\r\nbe right. Next there must be stability in the basic\r\n\r\nelements  of the economy. Foremost among  these  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  value  of the currency  must  be  stable\r\n\r\nbeyond  any possible doubt.

Two months later 17 Chinese\r\n\r\nand  Malay  educated pupil midwives were recruited.\r\n\r\nThe  policy  of  encouraging  non-English  educated\r\n\r\ngirls to join the Nursing Service will be pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EDUCATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past year has seen the foundations firmly\r\n\r\nlaid  of  the  three main principles on  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas based its policy on education as enunciated  in\r\n\r\nthe  Address to the Assembly at the opening of  the\r\n\r\nFirst  Session  last year. These  three  principles\r\n\r\nare, firstly, the provision of equal treatment  for\r\n\r\nthe   4   streams   of  education;  secondly,   the\r\n\r\nacceptance  of Malay as the National Language;  and\r\n\r\nthirdly, intensification of the teaching of Science\r\n\r\nand Mathematics subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with equality of treatment steps have been\r\n\r\ntaken to effect uniformity in the structure of  the\r\n\r\neducation  system  in  all  media.  The  period  of\r\n\r\nprimary education is now uniform, i.e. 6 years,  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of which time primary school pupils  will\r\n\r\ntake,  for  the first time this year, the Singapore\r\n\r\nPrimary  School Leaving Examination. The period  of\r\n\r\nSecondary  School education will also  be  uniform,\r\n\r\ni.e.  4  years, the Malay and Tamil schools  having\r\n\r\nsecondary  school classes for the first  time  this\r\n\r\nyear. The Government's aim is to have eventually  a\r\n\r\ncommon secondary school leaving examination for all\r\n\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore Examination Syndicate is to be\r\n\r\nestablished  to control and supervise  examinations\r\n\r\nfor  both  primary  and secondary  schools.  It  is\r\n\r\nintended  that  our Syndicate will  work  in  close\r\n\r\ncooperation  with  its  sister  Syndicate  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, especially in respect of  the\r\n\r\nexaminations   now  conducted  by   the   Cambridge\r\n\r\nSyndicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniformity of treatment is also being observed in\r\n\r\nthe   school   syllabuses.  In  this  respect   the\r\n\r\nEducational  Advisory  Council  has  devoted   much\r\n\r\nspecialist  knowledge, effort  and  energy  in  the\r\n\r\ncompilation of syllabuses which will be used in all\r\n\r\nschools.  The  syllabuses are entirely  Malayan  in\r\n\r\ncontent  and  will ensure that the textbook,  which\r\n\r\nwill be compiled are also Malayan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Integration</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A start has been made with integration. The Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang   and  Serangoon  Garden  Government   High\r\n\r\nSchools combine English medium schools with Chinese\r\n\r\nmedium  schools  with timetables so  arranged  that\r\n\r\nlanguage   teachers   of  the   two   streams   are\r\n\r\ninterchangeable. Next year it is proposed to extend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintegration  to  primary  schools.  The  experience\r\n\r\nacquired in these schools is being closely  studied\r\n\r\nin  the  hope that they will provide the experience\r\n\r\nfor  further  development along these lines.  On  a\r\n\r\nwider  plane,  integration  is  being  fostered  in\r\n\r\nsports and recreation by the formation of two Joint\r\n\r\nAthletic  Sports Councils covering the  four  media\r\n\r\nand responsible for arranging sports meetings which\r\n\r\nwill cut across communal barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Special position of Malays</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although maintaining parity of treatment in\r\n\r\neducation, the Government is mindful of the special\r\n\r\nposition  of the Malays, and has therefore accepted\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  providing free  education  to  all\r\n\r\nMalays who are either born in Singapore or children\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  citizens, in schools, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and the University of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>National Language</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the policy of Malay as the\r\n\r\nNational  Language,  the task of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  has been to provide training  facilities\r\n\r\nfor  the  teaching  of  the language  in  non-Malay\r\n\r\nschools.  For this, classes were organised  in  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training  College, and  to  date,  about\r\n\r\n1,400  teachers  have passed the Standard  I  Malay\r\n\r\nExamination.  About 1,800 teachers are  at  present\r\n\r\nreceiving  instruction  in  the  language   up   to\r\n\r\nStandard   II  level,  and  those  who  have   been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in Standard I are already teaching  the\r\n\r\nlanguage in primary classes. In the year ahead  the\r\n\r\nprogramme of teacher training will gather momentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the policy emphasising Science\r\n\r\nand  Mathematics, the Government has had to contend\r\n\r\nwith  limited  equipment  and  staff  shortage.  To\r\n\r\novercome the first difficulty, the Government plans\r\n\r\nto  have  a  new standard type of Secondary  School\r\n\r\nbuilding  which  will  have 4 Science  laboratories\r\n\r\ninstead   of  the  present  three.  Where   science\r\n\r\nfacilities in the older secondary school  buildings\r\n\r\nare  lacking on inadequate, increased accommodation\r\n\r\nis being planned.

Because   of   staffing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  the  schools  are  allowed   to   use\r\n\r\ngraduates  from  the  Universities  without   their\r\n\r\nwaiting for a further year at the Universities  for\r\n\r\nthe Diploma in Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>School building programme</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problems are the expansion of the\r\n\r\nschool  building programme and the teacher training\r\n\r\nprogramme to meet the annual increases in enrolment\r\n\r\nin schools. A careful survey of the increase in the\r\n\r\nschool-going population over the next 5  years  has\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out  and it is  estimated  that,  to\r\n\r\nprovide for this increase, the Government's  school\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme must be geared to  construct  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of  5  secondary schools  and  14  primary\r\n\r\nschools  each  year. In its plans  Government  will\r\n\r\nprovide  that  two  out  of  every  five  secondary\r\n\r\nschools will be devoted to technical education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Teacher Training Programme</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To staff the new schools each year it will be\r\n\r\nnecessary to increase the capacity of the Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College.  Hence  the  system  of  teacher\r\n\r\ntraining in the Teachers' Training College has been\r\n\r\nre-organised. The previous part-time and  full-time\r\n\r\ntraining  courses have given way to a new part-time\r\n\r\nin-service  system which, in content and  practice,\r\n\r\ncombines-the  best  features of  the  two  previous\r\n\r\ncourses.  There  is  also  a  new  course  at   the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training  College to provide  in-service\r\n\r\ntraining  in  education on a  part-time  basis  for\r\n\r\ngraduates  of the University of Malaya and  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Universities</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is concerned to see that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Polytechnic  and the  two  Universities,\r\n\r\nNanyang  University and the Singapore  Division  of\r\n\r\nthe  University of Malaya, are geared to serve  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the State. Nanyang University  has  been\r\n\r\npromised  equal  treatment with the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  in the matter of annual grants, subject  to\r\n\r\nits re-organisation and the maintenance of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadequate  academic standards.

A\r\n\r\nCommission   of  Inquiry  will  be   appointed   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate and make recommendations on the  proper\r\n\r\nco-ordination of vocational and technical education\r\n\r\nin   all   institutions,   governmental   or   \r\n\r\nnon-governmental  in  Singapore. A  systematisation  of\r\n\r\nvocational and technical education will provide the\r\n\r\nsinews  to  man future industries to be established\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 5,000 are now attending Post-Primary\r\n\r\nClasses  in  the English stream.

Until the Commission  of  Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto  vocational and technical education  mentioned\r\n\r\nabove  produces a plan of vocational  training  for\r\n\r\nthese  Post-Primary  Classes,  it  is  proposed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  providing them with a two-year  course  o\r\n\r\neducation based on strengthening their knowledge of\r\n\r\nlanguages  and learning the more practical  aspects\r\n\r\nof normal school subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Adult Education</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, which was\r\n\r\nestablished in April\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  year, will henceforth be responsible for  the\r\n\r\ndirection  and control of adult education  and  the\r\n\r\neradication of illiteracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CULTURE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inculcation of a Malayan loyalty and the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a  Malayan  consciousness  in  our\r\n\r\npeople  is  a  task that the P.A.P. Government  has\r\n\r\nshown  is possible, by imaginative and constructive\r\n\r\nuse  of  modern  mass media to  develop  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nloyalty and a Malayan consciousness in our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highly complex concept of Malayan culture\r\n\r\nwas  given concrete expression through the open-air\r\n\r\nconcerts - Aneka  Ragam Ra'ayat. These  concerts  not\r\n\r\nonly made thousands of ordinary people aware of the\r\n\r\nrichness  and  variety of the  cultural  wealth  at\r\n\r\ntheir   disposal  but  they  have  also  stimulated\r\n\r\ncultural activity. The enthusiastic response to the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre Fund is an encouraging sign of the\r\n\r\nconscious  search  of  the  people  for  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture.  Work on this National Theatre will  begin\r\n\r\nthis year. When completed, it should contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  further flourishing and ultimate fusion of our\r\n\r\ndiverse cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government plans to establish a National\r\n\r\nCultural  Brigade  in order to  give  positive  and\r\n\r\ncreative  impulse to Malayan art, music, drama  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  Members  of the Brigade  will  consist  of\r\n\r\nartists,  painters, musicians, dramatists  and  all\r\n\r\nthose involved in the arts and they will perform as\r\n\r\nwell  as  teach and organise dramatic, musical  and\r\n\r\ndance  groups  in  community centres  and  cultural\r\n\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year will also see the establishment of the\r\n\r\nInstitute  for National Language and  Culture.  The\r\n\r\naims and objects of the Institute have already been\r\n\r\nexplained   to   Members  of  the   Assembly.

At  the  moment  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  broadcasts four language  programme  and\r\n\r\nthough   these   have  ceased  to  be   exclusively\r\n\r\ncommunal,  they  nevertheless cater  to  particular\r\n\r\nlinguistic  groups. The National Service  would  be\r\n\r\nidentified with no particular language or  cultural\r\n\r\ngroup. It will try to reflect a Malayan outlook and\r\n\r\ncontent.

As the Five-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan,  which  has been prepared by the  Government,\r\n\r\ngets  into  stride our economy will gradually  lose\r\n\r\nits   colonial  character  by  ensuring  a  greater\r\n\r\nmeasure  of economic self-reliance. This  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  the  advent  of  an  economic  paradise.   By\r\n\r\nbroadening  our economic base we will  enhance  the\r\n\r\nchances of a better life for more of our people, in\r\n\r\nparticular  the  underprivileged  sections  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  The  necessary  conditions  for  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion   are  purposive  action  and   political\r\n\r\nstability.  These  the Government  will  strive  to\r\n\r\nprovide.
