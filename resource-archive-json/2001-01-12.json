Singapore,  why  have local  retail  pump  prices\r\n\r\nremained at such high levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to\r\n\r\nanswer Question Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> MTI's study shows that petrol\r\n\r\npump prices have moved in tandem with crude oil prices in the\r\n\r\npast, but with a time lag.  I would like to refer Members  to\r\n\r\ncharts   (Cols.  1405-1408)  1  and  2  circulated   earlier.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the fluctuation of petrol pump prices  is  also\r\n\r\nnot  as  sharp as crude oil prices, because crude oil is  not\r\n\r\nthe  only  cost  component of running a petrol  station.   In\r\n\r\nfact, the proportion of crude oil price in the pump price  is\r\n\r\nabout  20%.  Looking at the charts, we can expect pump prices\r\n\r\nto fall further if crude oil prices do not rise again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20010112/20010112-HA-0721405.gif\">Chart 1 - Crude Oil Price vs Petrol Premium (Cols 1405 - 1406)</a><br>\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20010112/20010112-HA-0721407.gif\">Chart 2 - Crude Oil Price vs Petrol Intermediate (Cols 1407 - 1408)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI has found no evidence of price fixing by the oil\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Because the industry structure is oligopolistic,\r\n\r\nand  the  supply chain is long, price movement  tends  to  be\r\n\r\nsticky and the companies prefer to compete on free gifts  and\r\n\r\nloyalty benefits.  Nevertheless, MTI is studying how  we  can\r\n\r\nintroduce  more competition into the petrol retail  business.\r\n\r\nIn   the  UK,  'white  pumpers',  which  are  petrol  pumping\r\n\r\nfacilities  annexed to supermarkets and commercial buildings,\r\n\r\nhave  brought  more  players  into  the  market.   They  have\r\n\r\ninjected more competition into the UK market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will work with the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment to study the feasibility of allowing such  \"white\r\n\r\npump\" sites,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut  without  compromising on fire safety  and  environmental\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power supply sector will be liberalised later\r\n\r\nthis  year.   There will be additional electricity  retailers\r\n\r\nbesides  Power Supply.  These new retailers can  compete  for\r\n\r\nthe  larger consumers with customised competitive electricity\r\n\r\nproducts.  Market forces will exert pressure on the retailers\r\n\r\nto   innovate,  provide  better  service  and   keep   prices\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  the Ministry of Trade and  Industry  would\r\n\r\nconsider taking other measures to stimulate competition among\r\n\r\nthe  oil  companies  in  Singapore,  such  as  introducing  a\r\n\r\ncompetition  law or supporting CASE's call for oil  companies\r\n\r\nto display their petrol prices at pylon signages?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> MTI is studying the\r\n\r\npracticality of introducing a competition law for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  can  introduce  more competition but it  can  also  cause\r\n\r\nrigidity  in certain industry categories.  So we are  looking\r\n\r\nat  the  pluses  and  minuses of such a competition  law  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and weighing the pros and cons.  For some  of  the\r\n\r\nFTAs  that we are negotiating, having a competition law  will\r\n\r\nbe a subject for negotiation also.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should require petrol pumps to\r\n\r\ndisplay  prices on pylons, I believe this is something  which\r\n\r\nis better for CASE to raise, because we should not require it\r\n\r\nby  regulation  that  they must display  their  prices  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister whether there could be possible  price\r\n\r\ncollusion  amongst the generating companies in  future  which\r\n\r\nmay influence pool prices instead?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\nsoon  be tabling legislation on the regulatory structure  for\r\n\r\nincreased competition in the power market.

In other words, it seems to be overpriced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact\r\n\r\nthat  some  companies offer discounts shows that there  is  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive dynamic at work and we should encourage more such\r\n\r\ncompetition  by informing consumers that such  discounts  are\r\n\r\navailable to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> The\r\n\r\nMinister speaks about introducing more competition.  Does his\r\n\r\nMinistry  accept that if the Ministry reduced  this  3/4-tank\r\n\r\nrule  that forbids Singaporeans getting cheaper petrol, there\r\n\r\nwould  be  much more competition and there would  be  greater\r\n\r\nincentive  for  the  petrol companies  to  bring  down  their\r\n\r\nprices?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the 3/4-tank rule addresses a completely different problem. Any\r\n\r\npetrol  retailer in Singapore is free to import crude oil  or\r\n\r\nrefined  oil from any source outside Singapore.  There  is  a\r\n\r\n3/4-tank rule because we in Singapore tax petrol at different\r\n\r\nrates from those in Malaysia.  In fact, until recently, there\r\n\r\nwas  a  subsidy of petrol prices in Malaysia.   If  we  allow\r\n\r\nmotorcars  to  bring  in full tanks from Malaysia,  this,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  gives consumers a chance to evade the taxes which  are\r\n\r\nimposed in Singapore and this would have a negative effect on\r\n\r\nour road usage policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister then saying that this\r\n\r\n3/4-tank  rule was introduced simply to get in  more  revenue\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government at the expense of Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the 3/4-tank rule was introduced to ensure the effectiveness of a\r\n\r\npolicy  designed as part of an overall programme  to  control\r\n\r\nthe use of cars and roads in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister, based on the charts, it does not seem  so\r\n\r\nmuch that the petrol pump price lags behind movement in crude\r\n\r\noil  prices.   It is just that it has been static  and  moves\r\n\r\nupwards  when  the  prices go up.  That  appears  to  be  the\r\n\r\npattern anyway.  So what would be the timeframe for any study\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry undertakes to introduce greater competition\r\n\r\nin the industry structure at the retail level?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may\r\n\r\ndraw Members' attention to the charts, it is not true that it\r\n\r\nis a straight line going upwards.  There are ups and downs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> It is not that it is a straight line\r\n\r\ngoing  upwards,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, but  more  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nrelatively less volatile line.  If I look at the chart, it is\r\n\r\nquite  evident  that it has been quite flat,  notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe movement upwards.  And the greatest movement seems to  be\r\n\r\nwhen price moves up at retail petrol pumps.  The key question\r\n\r\nis:  will  there be a timeframe for this review to  introduce\r\n\r\ngreater competition at the retail level?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our\r\n\r\nstatisticians have looked at the charts and have  not  found,\r\n\r\non  the  basis of the charts, the conclusion which Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\nhas  drawn,  that  the charts only move  up  and  are  sticky\r\n\r\ndownwards.

Changes in fuel  oil  prices  are  passed\r\n\r\nthrough  to  consumers.   If oil price  increases  after  the\r\n\r\nreview, Power Supply would have under-collected.  If, on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, oil price decreases, Power Supply would then have\r\n\r\nover-collected.  Power Supply is allowed to recover its under-collected  revenue or, alternatively, is required  to  return\r\n\r\nover-collected revenue to consumers in subsequent quarters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last tariff adjustment was made in August last year\r\n\r\nbased  on fuel oil price of US$24 per barrel.  To reduce  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  last August's tariff increase, Power  Supply  had\r\n\r\nagreed  to recover its under-collected revenue over a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod  than  the usual three months.  For large non-domestic\r\n\r\nconsumers, the collection was made over five months,  ie,  by\r\n\r\nend  of  last  year.  For residential and small  non-domestic\r\n\r\nconsumers, it was made over eight months, ie, the recovery of\r\n\r\nthe  under-collection would only be completed by  March  this\r\n\r\nyear.  If Power Supply had been allowed to recover its under-collected  revenue over the usual 3-month period, the  tariff\r\n\r\nincreases in August last year would have been much higher and\r\n\r\nmore severe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel oil prices had subsequently increased to a high of\r\n\r\nUS$28 per barrel\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  October  2000.  Fuel price averaged US$25 per  barrel  in\r\n\r\nNovember  2000 before easing to US$21 per barrel in  December\r\n\r\n2000.   As  a  result,  Power  Supply,  which  had  kept  the\r\n\r\nelectricity   tariffs  unchanged  since  August   2000,   has\r\n\r\ncontinued to under-collect.  The revenue under-collected from\r\n\r\nresidential  and small non-domestic consumers is larger  than\r\n\r\nthat  from  large non-domestic consumers because  the  tariff\r\n\r\nincrease  in August 2000 was lower for residential and  small\r\n\r\nnon-domestic  consumers.  In other words, we  had  chosen  to\r\n\r\nsmoothen the volatility over a longer period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, Power Supply had applied to raise\r\n\r\nthe  electricity tariffs further based on the high  fuel  oil\r\n\r\nprice  in  October  2000 which was US$28 per  barrel.   Power\r\n\r\nSupply  subsequently revised the tariff adjustment  with  the\r\n\r\neasing fuel price.  PUB has assessed and accepted the revised\r\n\r\nadjustment.   With  effect  from February  2001,  electricity\r\n\r\ntariffs  for large non-domestic consumers will be reduced  by\r\n\r\n0.15 cents per kilowatt hour on average.  However, in view of\r\n\r\nPower Supply's substantial under-collection from domestic and\r\n\r\nsmall  non-domestic consumers, there is still a need  for  an\r\n\r\nupward  adjustment of 1.41 cts/kwh for these consumers  until\r\n\r\nApril  this  year.  If not for the easing of fuel oil  price,\r\n\r\nthis  increase for them would have been even  more.   But  if\r\n\r\nfuel  oil  price continues to fall, electricity tariffs  will\r\n\r\neventually fall.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI wish to thank the Minister for the very detailed answer but\r\n\r\nI  have  a few queries. Firstly, will the present formula  of\r\n\r\nhaving a quarterly review be reviewed because it seems like a\r\n\r\nlong  stretch  to wait for three months to do  an  adjustment\r\n\r\nand, especially in the environment now where we are seeing  a\r\n\r\nfalling  of  oil  prices, there should  be  a  more  frequent\r\n\r\nreview?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, this formula that the Minister explained\r\n\r\nseems to be causing a lot of lumpiness in the calculation and\r\n\r\ncomputation of trying to recover the past losses.  I want  to\r\n\r\nask whether this formula can also be reviewed and whether the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment actually imputes into it a profit element for  the\r\n\r\npower  companies  because,  if  that  is  so,  it  means  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is actually protecting these companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last question is, in view of this situation, will the\r\n\r\nGovernment introduce more competition in the industry, as  he\r\n\r\nmentioned   earlier,   to  allow  for   private   electricity\r\n\r\nproducers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong has\r\n\r\nraised  a  very fundamental question of how we  overcome  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of price volatility.  The stock market goes  up  and\r\n\r\ndown,  day  by  day,  and  we  do  not  want  the  day-by-day\r\n\r\nvolatility to be passed on directly to consumers.  So we  try\r\n\r\nto  even  them out.  In the case of petrol pumps, the evening\r\n\r\nout  is  over  such  a long period that when  prices  do  not\r\n\r\nrespond immediately to price drop in crude prices, members of\r\n\r\nthe  public are upset.  But we also recognise that if we pass\r\n\r\nall  the volatility, you also create great disturbance in the\r\n\r\nmarket.  If you look at the public transport companies,  they\r\n\r\nhave fuel equalisation funds.  In theory, Power Supply can go\r\n\r\ninto  the  futures  market.  But they can also  guess  wrong.\r\n\r\nThere is no simple solution to this.  And what we are working\r\n\r\ntowards is letting the market settle the price structure.  In\r\n\r\nother words, if you are a company which is very dependent  on\r\n\r\nenergy  and you want stable electricity prices, you negotiate\r\n\r\nfor  that.   You go into a long-term contract.   If  you  are\r\n\r\ncomfortable with month-by-month volatility, then that is what\r\n\r\nyou  get.   We  will be able to do this once the  electricity\r\n\r\nmarket in Singapore is deregulated which we intend to do  for\r\n\r\nbig consumers later this year and for everybody in one or two\r\n\r\nyears' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE GENERAL HOSPITAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Hike in consultation fees for specialist-outpatient clinics)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health how does\r\n\r\nhis Ministry (i) justify the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbig  hike  of  70%  in the consultation fees for  specialist-outpatient clinics (SOCs) at the Singapore General  Hospital;\r\n\r\nand  (ii) ensure the affordability of specialist care to  the\r\n\r\nlower-income Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)\r\n\r\nwhat  is the justification for the Singapore General Hospital\r\n\r\n(SGH)  to  increase  with effect from 1st December  2000  its\r\n\r\nconsultation charges at specialist-outpatient clinics  by  as\r\n\r\nhigh  as  up  to 70%; and (b) what productivity  and  control\r\n\r\nmeasures are put in place by his Ministry to prevent, in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  spiral increases in operation costs and  charges  by\r\n\r\nSGH  and other Government-linked hospitals with no regard  to\r\n\r\nthe affordability of the average Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  can  I  be  permitted to take Question  Nos.  5  and  6\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me put the recent SGH specialist\r\n\r\noutpatient fee increases in perspective. The 70% increase  in\r\n\r\nconsultation fee applies only to private patients  on  repeat\r\n\r\nvisits  to  the  senior consultants, the  most  senior  grade\r\n\r\nspecialist in the hospital.  In absolute terms, the  increase\r\n\r\nis  from $32 to $55.  The rate of $32 before SGH's recent fee\r\n\r\nrevision  was  close to the charges of GPs and therefore  not\r\n\r\nreflective of the actual cost of specialist care rendered  by\r\n\r\na   senior  consultant.   Therefore,  the  relatively  larger\r\n\r\nincrease  is to better reflect the actual cost of  specialist\r\n\r\ncare as well as to close the fee differential for initial and\r\n\r\nrepeat visits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 70% increase in consultation fee does not apply\r\n\r\nacross-the-board.   For private patients on  initial  visits,\r\n\r\nthe  SOC consultation fees were raised by $13 to $18 and  now\r\n\r\nrange  from  $60  to $80, depending on the seniority  of  the\r\n\r\ndoctor.   This is an average increase of 30%.  If we look  at\r\n\r\nthe  total  bill size, which includes prescription and  other\r\n\r\ninvestigations  which patients are more concerned  with,  the\r\n\r\nincrease for private SOC patients is about 12%.  As the  last\r\n\r\ntime SGH revised its SOC fees was in June 1997, the recent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfee revision should therefore not be deemed excessive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While fees for healthcare services would have to be\r\n\r\nrevised  regularly, my Ministry will ensure that the cost  of\r\n\r\nsubsidised  healthcare remains affordable.   We will  provide\r\n\r\nheavy  subsidies to moderate fee increases so that healthcare\r\n\r\ncontinues  to remain accessible and affordable to the  middle\r\n\r\nand low income Singaporeans.  In this recent fee increase  by\r\n\r\nSGH,  the consultation fees for subsidised patients, for both\r\n\r\ninitial and repeat visits, were raised by $4 to $21.   So for\r\n\r\nsubsidised patients, whether they see the consultant for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  or  for  repeat visits, they  pay  $21  for  the\r\n\r\nconsultation fee.  This increase is reasonable given that the\r\n\r\nlast  time  SGH revised its subsidised SOC consultation  fees\r\n\r\nwas  way  back  in  1993.  As for the  total  bill  size  for\r\n\r\nsubsidised SOC patients, the increase was kept to about 8%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGH's fee revision is unavoidable, given the economic\r\n\r\nrecovery and the need for SGH to keep up with the increase in\r\n\r\nits  operating cost, contributed largely by manpower, medical\r\n\r\nsupplies    and   medical   equipment.    Nonetheless,    our\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals will always be mindful of the need  to\r\n\r\nmoderate the increase in healthcare cost.  As such, they have\r\n\r\nundertaken  various  productivity and cost  saving  measures,\r\n\r\nincluding  bulk  purchasing  and e-procurement  of  supplies,\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  electronic  medical  records  system  and\r\n\r\nskills   redevelopment  programmes  to  deliver   more   cost\r\n\r\neffective and efficient healthcare services to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans who still cannot afford to pay even the\r\n\r\nhighly  subsidised rates due to financial hardship, they  can\r\n\r\nalways  apply  for Medifund help. I would like  to  give  the\r\n\r\nHouse  my  assurance  that  no Singaporeans  will  be  denied\r\n\r\nessential medical care because of their inability to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he has a breakdown on the cost  of  running\r\n\r\nspecialist  outpatient  clinics,  whether  the  increases  of\r\n\r\ncharges could have been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspread out in stages and whether part of the cost could  have\r\n\r\nbeen defrayed or absorbed by the hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fee structure of\r\n\r\nour  SOCs is a little out of sync and therefore we have taken\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity  to try and re-align  it  correctly.  As  I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier, the SOC fee is structured accordingly  to\r\n\r\nwhether  you  see  a  senior  consultant,  consultant  or   a\r\n\r\nRegistrar.  So it is structured based on the seniority of the\r\n\r\npeople you see.  It is also structured on whether you see the\r\n\r\nconsultant for the first time or for repeat visits.  Based on\r\n\r\nthis  structure,  we  have a set of  fees.  For  the  private\r\n\r\npatients, the higher end of this structure will be  when  you\r\n\r\nsee  the senior consultant for the first time and that  would\r\n\r\nnow  cost $80.  If you see the Registrar for a repeat  visit,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the other end of the structure, it will  cost  you\r\n\r\n$35.  So that is the range of fees.  And to see a consultant,\r\n\r\nas  a private patient, paying this range of fees from $80  or\r\n\r\n$35,  I think, is a reasonable reflection of the actual  cost\r\n\r\nof the consultant rendering the service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a subsidised patient, we also follow this structure.\r\n\r\nBut because of the very heavy Government subsidy, we charge a\r\n\r\nsingle  rate of  $21 to see a consultant and we do not  vary,\r\n\r\nwhether by senior consultant, consultant or Registrar, and we\r\n\r\ndo not vary whether it is an initial visit or a repeat visit.\r\n\r\nSo  for  subsidised patients, every time they go to the  SOC,\r\n\r\nthe  consultation  fee  is  a  flat  $21.   But  for  private\r\n\r\npatients,  we  adopt  this structure to  better  reflect  the\r\n\r\ncosts.  For the subsidised patients, as I have explained, the\r\n\r\nfees  have  not  been revised since 1993  and  even  in  this\r\n\r\nrevision, we have raised it by only $4.  $4 over $17 is a big\r\n\r\npercentage  increase,  $1 over $17  is  a  6%  increase.   So\r\n\r\nraising  it by only $4, is already an increase of  24%.   But\r\n\r\n$21, I think Members will agree with me, is a very affordable\r\n\r\ncost  to  pay  to see a senior consultant in the restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether the reason\r\n\r\nfor  the hike in specialist outpatient clinic charges  is  to\r\n\r\naddress the cost of running such clinics\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  to  address the long waiting times?  If it is the latter,\r\n\r\ncould  other  avenues,  such  as  administrative  policy  and\r\n\r\nefficacy  improvements  be sought first  before  raising  the\r\n\r\ncharges?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is related because we are under\r\n\r\nrecovering.   Because  it is relatively  inexpensive,  people\r\n\r\nwill come to see the specialists. When a specialist's cost is\r\n\r\njust  slightly above a GP's, Singaporeans will all  troop  to\r\n\r\nsee  the  specialist instead of going to the GP.  I think  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  have  a  sensible structure  so  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferentiation in the fee structure between a specialist and\r\n\r\na  GP.   But,  at  the  same time, we know  that  costs  have\r\n\r\nincreased and in running a healthcare system, 60% of the cost\r\n\r\nis  manpower  cost, and the public sector is  losing  doctors\r\n\r\nvery   rapidly.  We  have  to  adjust  the  pay   and   other\r\n\r\nremuneration structure for the public sector doctors and that\r\n\r\ngoes  into the cost.

Our water agreements with Malaysia are\r\n\r\nfor  the  long  term.   In fact, we are  negotiating  for  an\r\n\r\nextension to the water agreements, and for an increase in the\r\n\r\nlong-term supply of Malaysian water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ensure that our water strategy is robust by\r\n\r\ndiversifying our sources. This includes both local sources as\r\n\r\nwell  as sources outside Singapore. To maximise water  yield,\r\n\r\nwe  have invested heavily in pollution control to protect our\r\n\r\nlocal  catchments.   As a result, 50% of  our  land  area  is\r\n\r\ncurrently used as catchments.  Over the next 10 years, we can\r\n\r\nincrease  this further to 65%, which will increase the  yield\r\n\r\nproportionately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also invested heavily in infrastructure to\r\n\r\ncollect  and  treat  all  water  used  in  Singapore   before\r\n\r\ndischarging  it into the sea. Because this water  is  already\r\n\r\nbeing  treated to a very high standard, it is a huge untapped\r\n\r\nsource  of fresh water for Singapore. With further treatment,\r\n\r\nmost of this water can be re-used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-use of treated water is not new. In countries\r\n\r\nwith  long  riverine  systems, upstream communities  use  the\r\n\r\nwater and discharge the used water after treatment back  into\r\n\r\nthe  river. Successive downstream communities then reuse  the\r\n\r\nwater several times, before the river finally flows into  the\r\n\r\nsea.  Examples include the Mississippi, the Thames, the Rhine\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we recycle only about 5% of our water for\r\n\r\nindustrial  use. We will do much more.  The Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment is doubling the capacity of its industrial  water\r\n\r\nplant  in Jurong to meet the needs of new industries in  Tuas\r\n\r\nand  on  Jurong  Island.  Until recently, the  constraint  to\r\n\r\ngreater  recycling  was  cost.   This,  happily,  is  falling\r\n\r\nrapidly.   New technology is producing superior  filters  and\r\n\r\nmembranes,  and this is significantly reducing  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmicro-filtration  and  reverse  osmosis.    It   has   become\r\n\r\neconomically  attractive to recycle used  water  on  a  large\r\n\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have built a demonstration plant at the Bedok\r\n\r\nWastewater  Treatment Works, to treat used  water  to  ultra-clean  standards.   It has now operated  for  more  than  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   The treated water is purer than PUB water  and  far\r\n\r\nexceeds  WHO  drinking water standards.  We  are  ramping  up\r\n\r\nproduction of this ultra-clean water, which we call  NEWater,\r\n\r\nfor  those industries which require large quantities of high-grade  water,  such as wafer fabrication plants.   Within  10\r\n\r\nyears,  NEWater to our industries can easily meet 15% of  our\r\n\r\ntotal water demand in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To diversify our water sources further, PUB will proceed\r\n\r\nwith  the  seawater desalination project.  We will install  a\r\n\r\ndesalination capacity of 30 million gallons per day by  2005.\r\n\r\nPUB  expects  to  call  tenders  for  supply  of  desalinated\r\n\r\nseawater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby the private sector in the second half of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these developments, our long-term supply of water\r\n\r\nwill be more diversified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rivers, reservoirs, drainage systems and water\r\n\r\ntreatment works should all be managed in an integrated manner\r\n\r\nto  optimize  the use of our water resources.  They  are  all\r\n\r\nparts  of the same water cycle.  The Government has therefore\r\n\r\ndecided  to  restructure  the PUB  by  merging  the  Drainage\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  Sewerage Department of ENV  with  the  Water\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  PUB.   The restructured PUB,  which  will  in\r\n\r\neffect  be  the  water authority, will be  placed  under  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment Ministry, instead of MTI.  This will take  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  1st April 2001, subject to the legislation being passed\r\n\r\nby  this House.  This will close the loop for water and allow\r\n\r\nus  to  take  full  advantage of advances in water  treatment\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will establish a new statutory board called the\r\n\r\nEnergy  Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) to take over  the\r\n\r\nregulation  of the electricity and gas industries which  come\r\n\r\nunder PUB today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I understand\r\n\r\nthat  25% of our water could be collected locally.

As with all\r\n\r\nother  registered  societies, the Falun  Buddha  Society  can\r\n\r\ncarry  out its activities as long as such activities  do  not\r\n\r\ncontravene any of our laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question by Prof. Chin, on New Year's Eve,\r\n\r\nacting  on  information  received,  the  Police  arrived   at\r\n\r\nMacRitchie  Reservoir Park.  There they observed an  assembly\r\n\r\nof  about  60 persons.  Having ascertained that the  assembly\r\n\r\nhad  gathered  without a permit, the assembly was  warned  to\r\n\r\ndisperse.   Some  of them then dispersed.   Subsequently,  15\r\n\r\npersons  were arrested by the Police for holding an  assembly\r\n\r\nwithout  a permit.  On 2nd January this year, the 15  persons\r\n\r\nwere charged in the Subordinate Courts for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noffences  under  section  4(1)(a) of  the  Miscellaneous  Act\r\n\r\n(Public  Order  and  Nuisance) (Assemblies  and  Processions)\r\n\r\nRules [holding an assembly without a permit] and section  186\r\n\r\nof  the  Penal  Code  [obstructing a public  servant  in  the\r\n\r\ndischarge of his public functions].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these matters are now pending in the Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts.

For these reasons, it will not be appropriate for\r\n\r\nme to go into further details of the cases today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I do not intend to go into the facts\r\n\r\nof  what took place at MacRitchie Reservoir.  Again, I regret\r\n\r\nit  is the Minister of State who is answering these questions\r\n\r\non  policy.  Will the Minister of State tell us, in the first\r\n\r\nplace,  what  is  wrong for members of  any  society,  be  it\r\n\r\ncultural  or  athletic society, to gather together  somewhere\r\n\r\nand  sing songs or put up messages promoting arts, sports  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  it is?

If  any group wants to meet and assemble,  they  can\r\n\r\napply  for a permit under the Miscellaneous Act (Public Order\r\n\r\nand  Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules, and indeed\r\n\r\nthese  have  been given.  On the ground, the  Police  has  to\r\n\r\nassess what is the objective and whether or not there will be\r\n\r\npotential  law  and order and breach of peace problems.   But\r\n\r\nthe  key point really is that in this event that took  place,\r\n\r\nno  application was made for a permit.  And when  the  Police\r\n\r\nwent  there, they clarified that with the group and therefore\r\n\r\nthey have breached the law.  I think that is the basic point.\r\n\r\nThey have breached the law.

However,  as\r\n\r\nparents,  we  should  be  mindful  of  the  impact  that  our\r\n\r\nexpectations have on our children's learning experiences  and\r\n\r\nstress levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong suggested that we should consider raising the\r\n\r\nteacher-to-student ratio and the amount of teaching  time  in\r\n\r\nour  schools so that students can receive more coaching  from\r\n\r\ntheir  teachers.   It  is not more time in  school  that  our\r\n\r\nstudents  need.   The  Third  International  Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience  Study  (TIMSS)  1999  found  that  the  total   time\r\n\r\nSingapore  students spend in school yearly is  close  to  the\r\n\r\ninternational average.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools currently provide adequate time and\r\n\r\nattention  to pupils to learn their academic subjects  fully.\r\n\r\nTeachers  give remedial classes to those who need  help  with\r\n\r\ntheir  school  work.   At  the primary  level,  the  Learning\r\n\r\nSupport  Programme (LSP) and the Encouraging Achievement  and\r\n\r\nBetter Learning (ENABLE) Programme give additional support to\r\n\r\npupils who are identified to be weak in language and numeracy\r\n\r\nskills, or are underachieving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On past occasions, we have received calls from some\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House that schools should in fact  do  less,\r\n\r\nand  avoid  overloading  the  students.   We  have  cut  back\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  wherever  possible,  to  provide  students   and\r\n\r\nteachers   with  time  for  a  more  well-rounded  education.\r\n\r\nCurriculum  content was reduced by 10-30% in 1999,  and  more\r\n\r\nemphasis  given to the development of critical  and  creative\r\n\r\nthinking  skills.   At  the  same  time,  we  reinforced  the\r\n\r\nimportance of co-curricular activities to develop core skills\r\n\r\nand values among our pupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools therefore offer a holistic and broad-based\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the individual.  There are parents  who  still\r\n\r\nwish  to supplement this with tuition.  This is a choice  for\r\n\r\nparents  to  make.  Parents will have to judge whether  their\r\n\r\nchildren  are overburdened and ensure that their workload  is\r\n\r\nmanageable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RETAIL TRADERS IN HDB ESTATES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry whether his Ministry has any data on how the  retail\r\n\r\ntraders are faring in the Housing and Development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoard  estates  and  if anything can be done  to  help  these\r\n\r\ntraders if they are faring poorly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, retailers in\r\n\r\nHDB  estates have seen modest improvement in sales after  the\r\n\r\nAsian  crisis.   This  is in line with the  recovery  of  the\r\n\r\noverall retail trade.  Sales of HDB retailers fell by 12%  in\r\n\r\n1998, but picked up by 1.2% in 1999 and 3.3% in the first  10\r\n\r\nmonths of 2000, lagging behind overall growth in retail sales\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance varied among retail segments and shops.\r\n\r\nWhile  shops  selling  telecommunications  equipment  enjoyed\r\n\r\nbrisk  sales, provision shops, supermarkets as well as  watch\r\n\r\nand jewellery retailers generally did not fare well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the problems faced by HDB retailers include keen\r\n\r\ncompetition,  limited  selection  of  merchandise,  lack   of\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale,  and the inability  to  utilise  modern\r\n\r\ntechnology   and   methods  of  business  management.    Many\r\n\r\nconsumers  prefer  to  shop  at larger  one-stop  malls  than\r\n\r\npatronise  smaller HDB retailers.  As a result, a  number  of\r\n\r\nsmall retailers have experienced a squeeze in margins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a short-term measure to help its shop tenants cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  increase in business costs, HDB  will  extend  its\r\n\r\nrental  rebates  for another year to 31st December  2001,  at\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the levels last year.  It will continue to  stagger\r\n\r\nthe  rental  increase  to  market levels  for  assignment  of\r\n\r\ntenancies, subletting cases and for tenants who are  renewing\r\n\r\ntheir  tenancies for the third time.  Shop lessees  can  also\r\n\r\napply  to  convert to shorter leases to reduce  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nservicing their mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, the Singapore Productivity and\r\n\r\nStandards Board (PSB) and Retail Promotion Centre (RPC)  work\r\n\r\nclosely together to help HDB shops upgrade and increase their\r\n\r\nproductivity  through various programmes.  This includes  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  franchising  and economic  groupings  to  help\r\n\r\novercome  size constraints.

All sectors enjoyed\r\n\r\nrobust   growth  except  construction,  which  continued   to\r\n\r\ncontract.   However, the performance was highly mixed  within\r\n\r\neach  sector, with some segments doing very well  and  others\r\n\r\nnot as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, although the manufacturing sector expanded\r\n\r\nby 15% in the first 11 months last year overall, this was due\r\n\r\nlargely  to the 27% growth in the electronics industry.   The\r\n\r\nfood  and  beverage,  wood and paper products,  construction-related   materials,  basic  metals,  petroleum  and   marine\r\n\r\nindustries grew by less than 4%.  These industries  accounted\r\n\r\nfor about one-fifth of manufacturing firms and jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the retail sector, although overall retail\r\n\r\nsales grew by a strong 25% (in volume terms) in the first  10\r\n\r\nmonths of last year, much of the growth came from the sale of\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicles, telecommunications equipment and  computers.\r\n\r\nSupermarkets,  provision  and sundry  shops,  and  watch  and\r\n\r\njewellery retailers experienced poorer business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the growth was uneven, those in the slow-growing\r\n\r\nsegments  did not feel the effect of the recovery.   Many  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  SMEs.  In fact, many of them asked me,  where  was\r\n\r\nthis  10.1%  growth which was put out.  The  reason  is  that\r\n\r\ngrowth  has been uneven and depending on where you  are,  you\r\n\r\nmay, in fact, feel it even more strongly or less strongly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the slowdown of the US economy, this would\r\n\r\nmoderate our GDP growth.  Most analysts currently expect  the\r\n\r\nUS  to  grow by 2.5-3% this year, down from about 5%  in  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000.   MTI projects that Singapore's GDP  growth  will\r\n\r\nslow  down accordingly to 5-7% this year.  But if there is  a\r\n\r\ncrash landing in the US, then the forecast will change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most businesses will be affected by the slower economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  but SMEs should be more vulnerable.  SMEs will  have\r\n\r\nto find ways to improve productivity, develop better products\r\n\r\nand explore new markets - not just SMEs, but all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies.

However,  during   the\r\n\r\ntransition period in June last year, Power Supply encountered\r\n\r\ndata migration problems, which affected the system operation.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in a delay in the generation of utilities bills\r\n\r\nas  well  as inaccuracies in billing amounts.  As at December\r\n\r\nlast  year, Power Supply had not completed the revamp of  its\r\n\r\ncomputerised billing system.  They tried to make improvements\r\n\r\nand  the improvements by the system implementor created  even\r\n\r\nmore  bugs.  So they had brought in a team from the  original\r\n\r\nsoftware  supplier which is SAP of Germany, a very  reputable\r\n\r\nfirm,  and  they  are  working hard to resolve  the  problem.\r\n\r\nToday, 88% of customers are receiving their monthly bills  on\r\n\r\ntime.   But this is obviously far from being good enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power Supply is required under the Electricity Supply\r\n\r\nCode  to bill its customers promptly every month.  Since July\r\n\r\nlast  year, PUB had been receiving complaints from  customers\r\n\r\nabout  the  delay in billing.  PUB took this  up  with  Power\r\n\r\nSupply immediately and directed them to take swift action  to\r\n\r\ncorrect its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbilling  system.  For breaching the Electricity Supply  Code,\r\n\r\nPUB  had  imposed a total fine of $150,000 on Power Supply  - comprising $100,000 in October for the delay in billing and a\r\n\r\nfurther  $50,000  in  December for  failure  to  resolve  its\r\n\r\nbilling  problems.  This is to send a strong signal to  Power\r\n\r\nSupply  that  we take the matter very seriously  although  it\r\n\r\nprovides no comfort to customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lessen the impact on customers, Power Supply has\r\n\r\narranged to space out bills sent to customers by at least  18\r\n\r\ndays.   The  payment schedule for these bills  was  similarly\r\n\r\nextended.  Customers would not be required to pay a lump  sum\r\n\r\nfor  the  delayed bills, if they do not wish to do so.   They\r\n\r\ncan  pay  by  instalments.  Power Supply has also  given  the\r\n\r\nassurance that utilities supply will not be disconnected  due\r\n\r\nto unpaid bills during this period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power Supply has indicated that they have overcome the\r\n\r\nteething problems of their new billing system and more  bills\r\n\r\nare   now   being   dispatched.   They   expect   significant\r\n\r\nimprovements  by  March  this year and  the  billing  process\r\n\r\nshould  be normalised by the middle of this year.

Power Supply had inherited  a\r\n\r\nmainframe  computer and, to prepare for a liberalised  energy\r\n\r\nmarket,  they  had embarked on a programme to install  a  new\r\n\r\nbilling system.  So they got SAP from Germany to provide  the\r\n\r\nsoftware  and  a  system  implementor  from  New  Zealand  to\r\n\r\noperationalise  it.   The system was tested  last  year.

We have gone back to the original software supplier\r\n\r\nand  we hope in the coming months, the problem can be solved.\r\n\r\nIt  is very unfortunate and, being a regulated monopoly,  PUB\r\n\r\nand  MTI  must  take overall responsibility for the  problems\r\n\r\nthat have been caused to consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the future?

Since  the start of operations, there  have  been  42\r\n\r\ncases  of  disruptions,  where each  disruption  exceeded  20\r\n\r\nminutes.  32 of them occurred during the first six months  of\r\n\r\noperation when the system was `bedding-in'. It is normal  for\r\n\r\nminor operational problems to occur in the initial months  of\r\n\r\noperation  of  a complicated system like the  BP  LRT.   Even\r\n\r\nthough  key members of the operational personnel had  brought\r\n\r\nalong  with  them significant experience in the  MRT  system,\r\n\r\nthey   still   had  to  gain  experience  in  operating   and\r\n\r\nmaintaining the LRT system.  I am glad to inform Members that\r\n\r\nafter  the  initial  period  of bedding-in  the  system,  the\r\n\r\navailability of the LRT has improved steadily to its  current\r\n\r\ncommendable level.  The LRT system now has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  availability of above 99.5%.  This translates to a  total\r\n\r\ndelay  of  only  6 minutes in a 20-hour daily  service.   The\r\n\r\ndelay  is not just by one car, we are talking about the delay\r\n\r\naccumulated  over all the cars in the 20-hour daily  service.\r\n\r\nThis  availability compares favourably, if  not  better  than\r\n\r\nother similar systems around the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the LRT vehicle collision that occurred on\r\n\r\n19th November, a Committee of Investigation was appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe   Land  Transport  Authority  (LTA)  to  investigate  the\r\n\r\ncollision.   The  Committee completed its investigation  last\r\n\r\nmonth.  It found that the incident was caused entirely  by  a\r\n\r\nprocedural error by the train controller.  The Committee also\r\n\r\nfound  that  the train safety system had worked as  designed.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there was no system failure.  Arising  from  this\r\n\r\nincident,  LTA has directed the operator, SLRT  Pte  Ltd,  to\r\n\r\nretrain  all  its  staff to enhance their  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem  and  procedures, and to do so on a continuing  basis.\r\n\r\nLTA  reports  that  the  company has  already  put  in  place\r\n\r\nmeasures  to tighten its operating and safety procedures,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  to raise training standards for its railway  staff.\r\n\r\nLTA  will  also  work  with the operator to  implement  other\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  further  strengthen  the  LRT  operations   and\r\n\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Teo's third question, I would like to\r\n\r\nreiterate that there was no failure or problem on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  system  hardware or software.  The system  responded  as\r\n\r\ndesigned.  When the system did not detect the particular  LRT\r\n\r\ntrain,  it  placed  an electronic shield in  the  last  known\r\n\r\nposition  of  the  vehicle.  This is  to  prevent  any  other\r\n\r\nvehicle  from  coming  into  the shielded  area  and,  hence,\r\n\r\nprevent  a collision.  The train controller had not  followed\r\n\r\nproper   procedures   when  he  reset  the   system   without\r\n\r\nestablishing the position of the lost train.  The incident on\r\n\r\n19th  November 2000 was the first time that a loss  of  train\r\n\r\ndetection  occurred.   If  the  correct  procedure  had  been\r\n\r\nfollowed,  the  automatic  train protection  feature  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem  would  have functioned as designed,  and  the  trains\r\n\r\nwould not have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncollided.   This  fundamental and key safety feature  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem has been designed to very high standards, and has been\r\n\r\nchecked and verified as working properly at all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to safety tests on the system, extensive\r\n\r\ntests  on  all  parts  of the LRT system  were  conducted  in\r\n\r\nsimulated  local  environment  conditions  prior  to   system\r\n\r\noperation.  Verification tests to ensure that the system  met\r\n\r\nsafety   criteria  were  conducted  on  such  items  as   the\r\n\r\nsignalling system, the vehicle detection system, the  vehicle\r\n\r\nand the wayside automatic train protection system.  The tests\r\n\r\nundertaken showed that all safety requirements identified  by\r\n\r\nthe  hazard  analyses were met in the Singapore  environment.\r\n\r\nThe  tests  and  the  results  were  reviewed  and  confirmed\r\n\r\nacceptable  by  an  independent  third  party  System  Safety\r\n\r\nCertification Consultant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Minister of State is it\r\n\r\nsafe  to  run  the trains when the system detects  a  missing\r\n\r\ntrain  and  what  other measures have the Ministry  taken  to\r\n\r\nensure that the LRT system is safe, besides the manual safety\r\n\r\ncheck system as proposed by SLRT recently?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, if a train is found\r\n\r\nmissing, the system will not allow the train to operate until\r\n\r\nthe  operator  resets the system.  So the  correct  procedure\r\n\r\ntherefore  is for the operator to find out where the  missing\r\n\r\ntrain  is, make sure that the missing train is accounted  for\r\n\r\nor  taken  out  of  the system before he resets  the  system.\r\n\r\nBecause  the interlocking feature and the safety  feature  of\r\n\r\nthe  system  are  such  that there will  be  automatic  train\r\n\r\nprotection and detection, prevention of collision, the  right\r\n\r\nsequencing,  and  so  on,  if  the  system  is  operated,  as\r\n\r\ndesigned, there will not be any chances of collision.  But in\r\n\r\nthis case, the operator overrode and reset the system without\r\n\r\naccounting  for  the missing train.  That  is  why  when  the\r\n\r\nsystem  did not detect any missing train after the reset,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not take the missing train into consideration.   Hence\r\n\r\nthe accident.  So this is to answer the Member's question  on\r\n\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else did LTA ask the operator to do? LTA has,\r\n\r\nbesides asking them to conduct refresher training and enhance\r\n\r\ntraining  standards, also asked SLRT to review its management\r\n\r\nstructure  to  strengthen the team in  the  area  of  railway\r\n\r\noperation  and  signalling.  What we found out  is  that  the\r\n\r\npersonnel  in the SLRT, prior to the collision,  were  mainly\r\n\r\nmaintenance  people  from MRT.  So  we  are  asking  them  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the operation aspect of the management structure.\r\n\r\nAlso,  we  have  asked  SLRT  to review  all  its  procedures\r\n\r\nrequiring  human  intervention to deal with  safety  critical\r\n\r\nfunctions  and  ensure  that these are clearly  stated,  that\r\n\r\nthere is no ambiguity, so that procedures can be followed  to\r\n\r\nthe letter, so to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would like to find out from the\r\n\r\nMinister of State how he could convince the commuter that the\r\n\r\nsystem  is  safe  if the train is physically there  and  yet,\r\n\r\nthrough  a  manual  reset,  the train  would  disappear  into\r\n\r\nvirtual  space.  How could anyone say that such a  system  is\r\n\r\ncertified safe?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the procedure, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  is  that before they reset, they will have  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  train  is accounted for.  In this case,  for  some\r\n\r\nreason, the controller had forgotten to follow the procedure,\r\n\r\nand  an  error  occurred.  It is not a software  or  hardware\r\n\r\nsystem problem.  It is a human intervention problem.  This is\r\n\r\nthe first part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part is how do we ensure that human\r\n\r\nintervention does not result in error.  Therefore,  the  SLRT\r\n\r\nhas recommended that we have a check-and-balance system.  How\r\n\r\ndo  we  have  a  check-and-balance system?  We will  have  to\r\n\r\nensure that before the controller can press the reset button,\r\n\r\nhe  must check with the shift manager.  This is one step.  So\r\n\r\nif both agree that they reset, then they will reset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are even thinking of asking the SLRT that\r\n\r\nperhaps  they should have two buttons, just like your two-key\r\n\r\nsystem.  So these are things that we can do, and will do,  in\r\n\r\norder to make sure that, procedurally, there will be no  room\r\n\r\nfor error.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, is it normal for the system to\r\n\r\ndetect  missing trains and, if the system can detect  missing\r\n\r\ntrains,  under  what kind of circumstances  will  the  system\r\n\r\nprompt that there are missing trains in the SLRT system?   So\r\n\r\nit  must  be  the software, or there must be some reason  for\r\n\r\nsome system failure somewhere, that is why the system detects\r\n\r\nmissing  trains  and that is why you need to do  this  manual\r\n\r\nreset.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, trains are detected by\r\n\r\nsensors  and these sensors are under the car and attached  to\r\n\r\nthe  track.  It could be due to contact problem or  it  could\r\n\r\nalso  be  due to foreign objects or dirt that comes into  the\r\n\r\ncontact.  So it happened that the sensor failed although,  in\r\n\r\nthis  case, there is redundancy in the sense that  there  are\r\n\r\ntwo  contacts.  But it is unlike MRT.  For the MRT, they have\r\n\r\na  long  train  and  the train has a long continuous  contact\r\n\r\nwhereas,  here, it is a single car.  So it is possible  that,\r\n\r\nunder exceptional conditions, it loses contact.  And when  it\r\n\r\nloses contact, the system is unable to detect it 100%.   When\r\n\r\nthis  happens, there must be a procedure to rectify it.  This\r\n\r\nprocedure has been put in place, but, unfortunately, in  this\r\n\r\nincident, the operator had not followed the procedure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we cannot have an automated system without the train\r\n\r\ndetection  system.  A train detection system  means  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  sensors, and sensors can fail and that  is  where\r\n\r\nhuman intervention comes in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> May I ask the Minister of\r\n\r\nState why the system does not have a safety feature that will\r\n\r\nnot  allow it to be reset until all the trains in the  system\r\n\r\nare  accounted  for?   That  will prevent  human  error  from\r\n\r\nresetting it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> If you want to start the train\r\n\r\noperation  afresh,  you  will  have  to  reset  the   system,\r\n\r\notherwise the system will just freeze because there  will  be\r\n\r\nno power to all the trains when the computer system detects a\r\n\r\nfault  and  the  trains will just freeze.  So,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nrestart  the system, you will have to reset it.

Our conclusion was that the award of 3G  licences\r\n\r\nthrough  an  auction  is  the most objective,  efficient  and\r\n\r\ntransparent   means  of  allocating  the   limited   spectrum\r\n\r\navailable.   An  auction will allocate the  spectrum  to  the\r\n\r\noperators who value it most, and this in turn would spur them\r\n\r\nto use this limited resource as efficiently as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While several countries have chosen a beauty contest for\r\n\r\nselecting  3G  operators, our assessment  is  that  making  a\r\n\r\njudgement amongst bidders for emerging technologies  such  as\r\n\r\n3G  is  entirely  subjective.  As it is still uncertain  what\r\n\r\nwould be the key 3G services, it would be very difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe  regulator  to define the service and technical  criteria\r\n\r\nfor evaluating proposals in a beauty contest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the formulation of our 3G licensing framework, IDA\r\n\r\nhas considered industry feedback and studied the 3G licensing\r\n\r\napproach  taken by other countries, from both the  operators'\r\n\r\nand   regulators'  perspectives.   Operators  will  naturally\r\n\r\nprefer  a beauty contest mechanism with minimal fees  because\r\n\r\nobtaining   the  spectrum  cheaply  will  mean  an  immediate\r\n\r\nwindfall  profit  for them.  However, the  Government  has  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility to obtain fair value for a scarce resource.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's main objective is to ensure a\r\n\r\ntransparent and fair allocation mechanism, and not simply  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  revenue.

Arising from this trip, the team  was  asked  by\r\n\r\nseveral  interested telcos, firstly, that they would like  to\r\n\r\nknow a little bit more about the auction rules and, secondly,\r\n\r\nthey  would  want to have the opportunity to comment  on  the\r\n\r\nauction  rules before they are firmed up.  As a  result,  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of  the auction rules, which has been scheduled  for\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of  January, has been delayed.  Instead  of  the\r\n\r\nfirmed-up  auction rules, it will now be auction rules  meant\r\n\r\nfor consultation with the interested parties.  We expect that\r\n\r\nthe  interested  telcos would take some  time  to  study  the\r\n\r\nauction  rules before they give us their comments.  And  once\r\n\r\nwe receive their comments, IDA would also need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  time  to study them before deciding whether or  not  to\r\n\r\namend the auction rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, IDA has factored in a 2-month period for this\r\n\r\nadditional process which was originally not expected.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  instead  of going for the auction in  February,  IDA\r\n\r\nexpects to go for the auction in April.  So the delay is  not\r\n\r\nbecause of the tentative nature of the process but because we\r\n\r\nhave had requests from interested companies to be involved in\r\n\r\nthe consultation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Prof. Toh has asked whether this would not\r\n\r\ncreate  uncertainty.   Sir, IDA is in close  touch  with  the\r\n\r\ntelcos that have expressed interest and, therefore, there  is\r\n\r\nno  uncertainty at all, because they are fully aware  of  the\r\n\r\ntime  line and they are fully aware why the schedule has been\r\n\r\nchanged from February to April.\r\n\r\n<br>1.59 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chng, we are approaching the end of\r\n\r\nQuestion time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Pursuant to Standing Order No. 21(3), Written Answers\r\n\r\nto Question Nos. 19-27 and 29 on the Order Paper are\r\n\r\nreproduced in the section, \"Oral Answers To Questions Not\r\n\r\nReached\" (Cols. 1369-1386).

The first pertains to the  tenure\r\n\r\nof  members  of  the  Council of Presidential  Advisers,  the\r\n\r\nsecond to the protection of net investment income earned from\r\n\r\nthe  past  reserves of the Government, and the third  to  the\r\n\r\ntenure of the Auditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tenure of Members of the Council of Presidential Advisers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn first to the amendment\r\n\r\npertaining  to  the  tenure  of members  of  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nPresidential Advisers or CPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article 37B(3), members of the CPA are currently\r\n\r\nappointed for a fixed term of 6 years and are eligible for re-appointments on a 6-year term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for appointing CPA members to specified,\r\n\r\nfixed  terms is to give them standing on their own once  they\r\n\r\nare  appointed.  They  are expected to  exercise  independent\r\n\r\njudgment  on  issues, rather than reflect the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nperson  who advised the President to appoint them, be it  the\r\n\r\nPresident  himself, the Prime Minister, the Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nPSC, or the Chief Justice. Hence, they have tenure in office,\r\n\r\nand cannot be removed at will by their nominators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, however, has pointed out that 6 years for\r\n\r\neach  term is a long time, especially if the CPA members  are\r\n\r\nalready  in their 70s.  Health considerations may not  permit\r\n\r\nthem  to  commit  to  serving  the  full  6-year  appointment\r\n\r\nalthough   they   may  still  be  able   to   make   valuable\r\n\r\ncontributions  for  a shorter term.  The President  suggested\r\n\r\nthat the Government consider whether re-appointments could be\r\n\r\nfor terms less than 6 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered the President's\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  Article 37(B) of the Constitution will therefore\r\n\r\nbe  amended to provide for the appointment of a member of the\r\n\r\nCPA for a tenure of 6 years on his first appointment, and re-appointment for further terms of 4 years each.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Net Investment Income</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn now to the amendment pertaining\r\n\r\nto  the  protection of net investment income (or NII)  earned\r\n\r\nfrom past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my Statement to the House on 17th August 1999, I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the Government needed time to study how  best  to\r\n\r\nprotect  NII  and  this could lead to  an  amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution. The amendment before the House now is a  result\r\n\r\nof the study.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into the amendment proper, let me quickly re-cap what is NII and what is its current Constitutional\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NII is defined as the interest and dividend income\r\n\r\nearned from investing the Government's reserves, net of  debt\r\n\r\nservicing and expenses on investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  does not include any capital gains or losses arising from\r\n\r\nthe disposal of investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Constitution, \"reserves which were not\r\n\r\naccumulated  by  the Government during its  current  term  of\r\n\r\noffice\" are protected and subjected to the President's second\r\n\r\nkey.  On  the other hand, NII, whether derived from  past  or\r\n\r\ncurrent  reserves, is accumulated during the current term  of\r\n\r\noffice of the Government and is thus not protected under  the\r\n\r\npresent Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although NII is thus clearly \"current money\" under the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the Government has carefully  studied  whether\r\n\r\npart of NII ought to be locked up, especially the NII that is\r\n\r\nderived  from past reserves. This is a complex  issue  as  we\r\n\r\nneed to project the state of the economy and the Government's\r\n\r\nbudget  position  over the long term,  and  strike  a  proper\r\n\r\nbalance  between restraining a profligate government  on  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  and  allowing  a  responsible  government  enough\r\n\r\nflexibility to operate on the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future cannot be predicted with certainty. However,\r\n\r\nwe  do  know  that an ageing population will  impose  greater\r\n\r\ndemands  on  health and social expenditures, and  reduce  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of  Singaporeans in full  employment  and  paying\r\n\r\ntaxes.  At  the same time, globalisation will  make  it  more\r\n\r\nimportant for us to attract and retain talent, businesses and\r\n\r\ninvestments. This calls for competitive tax rates,  and  will\r\n\r\nput  pressure on Government revenues. It is therefore  likely\r\n\r\nthat  over  time,  expenditures will grow more  rapidly  than\r\n\r\nrevenues.  In  the long term, we may therefore need  to  draw\r\n\r\nupon  part  of  NII  to supplement tax revenue,  although  we\r\n\r\ncannot know for sure how much of NII we will need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that so long as the Government's\r\n\r\nbudget position is healthy and in surplus, all NII should  be\r\n\r\nprotected,  since a responsible government could always  seek\r\n\r\nthe President's concurrence to draw on past reserves when the\r\n\r\nneed arises. However, we have to bear in mind that such draws\r\n\r\nmay be needed on a regular basis in future if all NII is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprotected.   To seek the President's approval  on  a  regular\r\n\r\nbasis  will  undermine the foundation  in  the  \"second  key\"\r\n\r\nsystem  as draws on past reserves should be called upon  only\r\n\r\nin exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we should not provide for too much\r\n\r\nflexibility.  Our  current budgetary  discipline  of  keeping\r\n\r\nGovernment  small  and focused on basic  public  services  is\r\n\r\nsound  and  should be continued. We cannot afford to  emulate\r\n\r\nresource  rich  countries  in  which  government's  share  of\r\n\r\nexpenditures  has  risen  as  high  as  40%  of   GDP.   Such\r\n\r\nexpenditures  are  unsustainable in the long  term  and  will\r\n\r\nultimately strangle the growth of the private sector and  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to protect, on an\r\n\r\nannual  basis, at least 50% of the NII earned from  the  past\r\n\r\nreserves  of  the  Government. NII earned  from  the  current\r\n\r\nreserves will continue to accrue to the current reserves,  in\r\n\r\nline with the principle that the government of the day should\r\n\r\nbenefit from its work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of NII will apply only to the NII earned\r\n\r\nfrom Government's own reserves. It will not apply to the  NII\r\n\r\nearned  by  statutory boards and Government-linked  companies\r\n\r\ncontained in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution. Just  as\r\n\r\nnormal   commercial  companies  have  full  access   to   the\r\n\r\ninvestment earnings from all its accumulated funds, statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and Government-linked companies should also be  given\r\n\r\naccess  to  their  NII  as part and parcel  of  their  normal\r\n\r\nincome. Locking up their NII will take away their flexibility\r\n\r\nand   responsiveness   in  making  business   and   operating\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to effect the protection of NII I have\r\n\r\njust described is set out in clause 3 of the Bill before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 142 of the Constitution will be amended to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  not less than 50% of the NII earned  from  past\r\n\r\nreserves  in  a financial year to be added to, and  protected\r\n\r\nas, past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact amount, which cannot be less than 50%, will be\r\n\r\nspecified  in  a  certificate that the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nshall  present  to  the  President after  the  close  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year. The protection will take effect from the date\r\n\r\nof  the  certificate and will be final. If a future  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance refuses to issue such a certificate for whatever\r\n\r\nreason,  50%  of  the  NII  earned from  past  reserves  will\r\n\r\nnevertheless  be  protected  when  the  Government  Financial\r\n\r\nStatements are presented to the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also puts into the Constitution a new\r\n\r\ndefinition of NII. The definition will be expanded  to  cover\r\n\r\nmore  than  what is currently defined as NII  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\nBook. NII will now include interest earned from developmental\r\n\r\nloans  given  by Government, mainly to statutory boards.  The\r\n\r\ninterest  on these loans was previously treated as  Operating\r\n\r\nRevenue,  because developmental loans were not classified  as\r\n\r\ninvestments under the Financial Procedure Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we will be protecting at least 50% of NII,\r\n\r\nexcluding interest earned from developmental loans  from  NII\r\n\r\nwould  leave  a  potential loophole.  Such interest  earnings\r\n\r\nwill therefore be included in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the amendment concerns the protection of past\r\n\r\nreserves,  albeit to tighten the protection,  Government  has\r\n\r\nbriefed   the  President  and  the  Council  of  Presidential\r\n\r\nAdvisers, who agree with the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tenure of the Auditor-General</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the third amendment. This\r\n\r\npertains to the tenure of the Auditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Article 148F of the Constitution provides for\r\n\r\nthe  Auditor-General to hold office until he attains the  age\r\n\r\nof  60  years,  regardless of when he was appointed.   Before\r\n\r\nreaching  the  retirement age, he can only  be  removed  from\r\n\r\noffice  by  the  President if he is found  to  be  unable  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  the functions of his office whether for  infirmity\r\n\r\nof body or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmind,  or for misbehaviour.  His remuneration and other terms\r\n\r\nof  service  are  also protected under the Constitution.   In\r\n\r\naddition, he is not eligible for any other appointment  as  a\r\n\r\npublic officer after stepping down as Auditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying rationale of these provisions is to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the powers and independence of the Auditor-General,\r\n\r\nso  that  he  can  carry out his duties  firmly  and  fairly,\r\n\r\nwithout fear or favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Constitutional provisions have worked so far. But\r\n\r\nmoving  forward in an environment of rapid change, they  need\r\n\r\nto  be  fine-tuned. Appointment till retirement  age  creates\r\n\r\nrigidity in the talent management process.  It does not allow\r\n\r\nfor  systematic renewal and rejuvenation of the office, which\r\n\r\nis   always  desirable,  regardless  of  the  abilities   and\r\n\r\nperformance of the incumbent.  This is particularly so as  we\r\n\r\nwant  to appoint able officers to the post of Auditor-General\r\n\r\nat  a  younger  age,  to inject new, fresh  perspectives  and\r\n\r\nupdate  the office, rather than appoint individuals  who  are\r\n\r\napproaching retirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee had informed the House of the\r\n\r\nneed  to  have  a healthy turnover of people  in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice,   especially  those  holding  top   Public   Service\r\n\r\nLeadership  jobs.  The public service needs  to  develop  and\r\n\r\nstretch  our  younger officers, giving them larger  and  more\r\n\r\nchallenging  responsibilities earlier.  Conversely,  it  also\r\n\r\nmeans  that not all officers who assume leadership  positions\r\n\r\nearly  can  stay  in  those positions  till  retirement  age.\r\n\r\nSystematic  but  judicious renewal is also desirable,  as  it\r\n\r\nwill  prevent the organisation from becoming too  settled  in\r\n\r\nits ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Secretaries and other officers holding Public\r\n\r\nService Leadership jobs are now appointed on fixed terms. The\r\n\r\nsame  should apply to the office of the Auditor-General.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  find and appoint good individuals to  the  post  of\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  and  ensure that  the  office  is  regularly\r\n\r\nrejuvenated.   \"Permanency\" of office and prolonged  exposure\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrepetitive  audit  cycles could also lull an  incumbent  into\r\n\r\ncomplacency.   In  the private sector, it is considered  good\r\n\r\npractice  to regularly rotate auditing partners, if  not  the\r\n\r\nauditing  firms,  about  once every  five  years.   The  same\r\n\r\nprinciple should apply in the audit of the Government and the\r\n\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 148F of the Constitution will therefore be\r\n\r\namended to provide for the appointment of the Auditor-General\r\n\r\nfor  a  fixed term of six years, with the possibility of  re-appointments  for  further terms of six  years  each.   As  a\r\n\r\ncorollary  to appointing the Auditor-General on  fixed  terms\r\n\r\nwhich   may  end  before  he  reaches  retirement  age,   the\r\n\r\nprohibition  of  a  person who has held  the  office  of  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  from taking up any other appointments  as  a\r\n\r\npublic  officer after leaving office will be removed.   There\r\n\r\nis no reason why we should prevent a good individual from re-joining the public service after he has finished his term  as\r\n\r\nAuditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a fixed six-year term appointment, subject to\r\n\r\nrenewal,  should  not  adversely  affect  the  organisational\r\n\r\nindependence  of  the  Auditor-General.  The  Auditor-General\r\n\r\nremains    organisationally   immune   from   any   Executive\r\n\r\ninterference  and influence in his job.  Firstly,  he  enjoys\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  tenure during his fixed term,  unlike  ordinary\r\n\r\npublic  officers  who  hold office at  the  pleasure  of  the\r\n\r\nExecutive. The Auditor-General can only be removed on grounds\r\n\r\nof  misbehaviour or inability to discharge his functions,  as\r\n\r\ndetermined by a high-level tribunal, and even then only  with\r\n\r\nthe concurrence of the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, once appointed, the Auditor-General's\r\n\r\npensionable   remuneration  and  other  terms   of   service,\r\n\r\nincluding  his pensionable status, cannot be altered  to  his\r\n\r\ndisadvantage while he remains in office.  This protection  in\r\n\r\nthe Constitution remains unchanged; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Auditor-General continues to report\r\n\r\ndirectly to the President and Parliament under the Audit Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Constitution have two  components.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  the  change to the tenure of the  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Presidential Advisers and  the  Auditor-General.\r\n\r\nThe second is the new treatment proposed by the Government of\r\n\r\nthe net investment income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the first issue on the change of\r\n\r\ntenure  of  Presidential Advisers, I would like to  voice  my\r\n\r\nsupport   that  it  is  appropriate  that  members   of   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council be appointed, firstly,  on  a  six-year\r\n\r\nterm  and thereafter to be re-appointed for further terms  of\r\n\r\nfour years each.  I agree with the shorter term of four years\r\n\r\neach  for  re-appointments.  This will enable the suitability\r\n\r\nof  these  Advisers to be reviewed over a shorter period  for\r\n\r\nfuture  renewals, after the first initial appointment of  six\r\n\r\nyears.  In fact, if we add the first six years to the further\r\n\r\nre-appointment  term  of four years, a  re-appointed  Adviser\r\n\r\nwould  have served for 10 years, and further renewal  should,\r\n\r\nof  course, be reviewed and for a shorter period.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nI support this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second point about the re-appointment of the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General, the proposal is to first appoint him on a 6-year  contract basis, and thereafter for renewal  of  another\r\n\r\nsix  years.   This is quite fair as well.  But I  do  have  a\r\n\r\nsmall  concern  about the proposal to remove the  requirement\r\n\r\nthat after his retirement in future, the Auditor-General  can\r\n\r\nnow  find other jobs, which, in some cases, may be deemed  to\r\n\r\nbe  not  so  suitable for him, since he has already  held  an\r\n\r\nesteemed  post of Auditor-General.  This point may lower  the\r\n\r\nhigh office of the Auditor-General, because he is supposed to\r\n\r\nhold  a  very  independent  view of  Government's  accounting\r\n\r\npolicies.   I  would prefer that this office be preserved  at\r\n\r\nthe highest level.  Therefore, if it can be advised that even\r\n\r\nafter his retirement, the Auditor-General should only take up\r\n\r\njobs  that would seem to pose no conflict of interest to  his\r\n\r\nearlier  job.  Therefore, on this basis, I also  support  the\r\n\r\nproposal  to  have contract appointment on a  6-year  renewal\r\n\r\nbasis for the Auditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the more important amendment is the second\r\n\r\ncomponent  with  regard to the Government's proposal  on  the\r\n\r\ntreatment  of the net investment income (NII).  One principle\r\n\r\nthat can be adopted is the treatment of the NII from a purely\r\n\r\naccounting   approach.    Under  this  approach,   interests,\r\n\r\ndividends and other investment incomes earned from  the  past\r\n\r\ncapital  or  equity  of a company (ie, in  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  account  and this will  be  the  reserves)  are\r\n\r\ntreated  as  current  account items, which  means  that  such\r\n\r\nincomes including interests earned from past capital will  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  items  in the Working Capital,  Cash  Flows  and\r\n\r\nProfit & Loss accounts of a company, and in this case of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same principle, a company that has borrowings\r\n\r\nfrom  loans that were taken in the previous years,  then  the\r\n\r\ninterest  payable in the current year is also  treated  as  a\r\n\r\ncurrent account item, and netted off the yearly income.  Sir,\r\n\r\nif this accounting principle were to be applied to the use of\r\n\r\nNII  for Government accounts, then it is clear that NII which\r\n\r\nincludes  the  interest from Government  reserves  should  be\r\n\r\nadded  in  total to the current year's income, and  therefore\r\n\r\n100%  of the NII can be used by the new Government.  On  this\r\n\r\nbasis,  if  the  past  Government has  no  reserves  and  has\r\n\r\nincurred debts for which interests are payable, then for  the\r\n\r\nnew  Government, it could be faced with a negative or deficit\r\n\r\nincome situation.  The new Government would therefore have to\r\n\r\nbear  100% of this debt interest and fund the entire interest\r\n\r\npayable  out of the present Government's current  account  of\r\n\r\nthe  year.  On this purely accounting treatment basis, it can\r\n\r\ntherefore be argued that 100% of the NII can be used  by  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government.  However, we cannot  conclude  that  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  treatment of the NII from past reserves to be  based\r\n\r\npurely on accounting principles.  From the political point of\r\n\r\nview,  it can also be argued that the entire NII earned  from\r\n\r\npast  reserves  is  income derived from the  effort  of  past\r\n\r\nGovernments  and  therefore  any  incomes  earned  from  past\r\n\r\nreserves should form part of the past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nA  new  Government which did not accumulate the past reserves\r\n\r\nshould therefore have no access to this NII.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking from these two points of views, I would agree\r\n\r\nthat  the  proposal by the Government to impose a minimum  of\r\n\r\n50% to be put into the past reserves and the remaining 50% to\r\n\r\nbe  decided  by  the present Government is a  very  fair  and\r\n\r\nreasonable  proposal.  It strikes a fine balance between  NII\r\n\r\nearned  from  old reserves of which 50% can be  retained  and\r\n\r\nallow the remaining 50% to be used by the new Government.  In\r\n\r\nsome  way, this helps to mitigate any undesirable effect that\r\n\r\nif  there is a profligate new Government that takes over  and\r\n\r\nrecklessly spends money derived from the NII, they  can  only\r\n\r\ndo  so  with 50% of the net income of the NII.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  by  having  this rule of 50%,  it  will  allow  a  new\r\n\r\nGovernment  to have some facility to use 50% of  the  NII  to\r\n\r\nhelp  stimulate the economy during a recession  or  spend  on\r\n\r\nsome  meaningful Government projects which are beneficial  to\r\n\r\nthe people.  Therefore, I support this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to use some examples to elaborate on this\r\n\r\nposition.  I think the NII issue starts when a new Government\r\n\r\nis formed after a general election.  In the first year of the\r\n\r\nnew Government, in case this Government inherited an economic\r\n\r\nsituation  that is in a recession, therefore to have  50%  of\r\n\r\nthe  NII  accessible  by this new Government  is  beneficial,\r\n\r\nbecause the money can be used to stimulate the economy or, as\r\n\r\nI  said,  to spend on good projects.  However, if the problem\r\n\r\nis  that when the new Government is formed, it is elected  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  that it promised to give a lot of give-aways  and\r\n\r\nfreebees out to the people.  Therefore, it can easily use the\r\n\r\nNII  to make a lot of unnecessary and reckless spending,  and\r\n\r\nthis  can  have  a great detrimental and ill  effect  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   So  this proposal of 50% in a way will  cap  their\r\n\r\nability  to spend recklessly.  However, in the second,  third\r\n\r\nand fourth year onwards, the Government can still draw on the\r\n\r\n50% of the NII.  In this case, it might also be able to spend\r\n\r\nthe money recklessly.  In this sense, the 50% limit on NII is\r\n\r\nquite generous for new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernments that are not responsible.  On this basis, I think\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of the second key to be exercised by the President\r\n\r\nwill be able to have some effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on to a secondary point which I wish to\r\n\r\nraise, is on the certification of the exact amount of the NII\r\n\r\nfor   the  financial  year  to  be  deemed  as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  past reserves.  The amendment, as  proposed  in\r\n\r\nArticle 142(3), states that the certification by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance \"shall be final and conclusive evidence  of  the\r\n\r\namount.\"  I wish to point out that the amendment is not clear\r\n\r\nas to the process on how the Minister will define and certify\r\n\r\nthe  final  amount.   And  if  there  are  discrepancies   or\r\n\r\ndisagreement  on  the  methodology of the  computations,  how\r\n\r\nwould the differences be resolved?  Since it has already been\r\n\r\nproposed  that  the certificate issued by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance shall be final and conclusive evidence of the amount,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to suggest that in the Government's procedures\r\n\r\nto  be  laid  down  on  the process  on  the  issue  of  this\r\n\r\ncertificate,  the  Minister for Finance will  allow  for  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General, who is an independent party, to  verify  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  statements before the Minister  signs  and  issues\r\n\r\nthis statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude by expressing my\r\n\r\nsupport  for  this Constitution of the Republic of  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  and  to  urge Members  of  this  House  to\r\n\r\nrecognise that the proposed treatment of the NII is fair  and\r\n\r\nreasonable, and therefore support it as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the proposed amendments, specifically, the\r\n\r\namendment  of  Article 142 which represents  another  prudent\r\n\r\nattempt  at protecting past reserves.  However, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  seek  the  clarification of the Minister on  two  issues.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the role of the government of the day vis-a-vis  the\r\n\r\nownership of these past reserves and, secondly, the basis for\r\n\r\ndetermining  the allocation of net investment income  between\r\n\r\ncurrent and past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to elaborate. Firstly, the role of government.\r\n\r\nSir,  I note that hitherto, the common thread running through\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntreatment of reserves and related income has been the concept\r\n\r\nof  protection or preservation or safeguarding as opposed  to\r\n\r\ngrowth or expansion.  In this context, what comes to mind  is\r\n\r\nthe  endowment fund model, ie, the government of the day will\r\n\r\nensure  the  smooth  running of the country  with  investment\r\n\r\nincome  earned  on  past  reserves  at  its  disposal.    The\r\n\r\nprincipal  is  protected  and  that  is  possibly  the   only\r\n\r\nconstraint.  Hence, the government of the day is  not  really\r\n\r\nan  agent  but  a steward and a protector.   An  agent  in  a\r\n\r\ntypical  agent/principal relationship  would  earn  fees  and\r\n\r\nperhaps even share in the profits, but this lack of ownership\r\n\r\nwould  be  inconsistent  with what an elected  government  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to do.  A good government will and can in fact  add\r\n\r\nbudget  surpluses to past reserves and rightly stake a  claim\r\n\r\nto  ownership of part of these reserves.  In many  countries,\r\n\r\nas far as I understand, there are no such constraints at all,\r\n\r\nlet  alone self imposed constraints.  Therefore, the proposed\r\n\r\ndesignation of at least 50% of net investment income to  past\r\n\r\nreserves  may  unwittingly  give rise  to  questions  on  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the government of the day and the owners\r\n\r\nof   the  past  reserves  or,  essentially,  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House on\r\n\r\nhow Singaporeans should view this relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, accretion of at least 50% of net investment\r\n\r\nincome to past reserves.  The Minister has explained in  some\r\n\r\ndetail  the basis for determining the at-least-50% allocation\r\n\r\nrule.   Although  this is derived from an  estimate  of  what\r\n\r\nfuture  budget challenges of an aging population  could  look\r\n\r\nlike, the application of numerous assumptions would mean that\r\n\r\nthere  could be an inherently huge variation to this  figure.\r\n\r\nWith  each  passing year or at least decade, presumably,  the\r\n\r\nrange  of  estimates could be narrowed.  How does one  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  future governments would not be tempted to modify  this\r\n\r\nto  their  advantage?  Conversely, if the present  Government\r\n\r\nwere  to prudently specify an amount much higher than 50%  to\r\n\r\npast reserves, future governments\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay find it a tall order to maintain the same even though the\r\n\r\nminimum is 50%.  Ultimately, would we face an allegation that\r\n\r\nthe basis is simply arbitrary?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, allow me to round up with comments on\r\n\r\nother  possible risks and implications.  As we have observed,\r\n\r\na  whole  spectrum of financial markets and instruments  have\r\n\r\nsprung  up  over the last few years.  This is  especially  so\r\n\r\nwith  hybrid products where the accounting or tax  treatments\r\n\r\ncan  only evolve as quickly as these products appear.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore likely that relevant parts of the Articles  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  may have to be amended often enough  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  no loopholes are created by the innovative use  of  new\r\n\r\nfinancial products.  At some point, the certification of what\r\n\r\nmight be considered net investment income may be unwieldy, if\r\n\r\nnot  difficult.   It  is  perhaps  worthwhile  over  time  to\r\n\r\nconsider  alternative definitions which would meet  the  same\r\n\r\nobjective of preservation of reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Constitutional\r\n\r\nAmendment  has  the effect of focusing our mind  on  the  net\r\n\r\ninvestment income (or NII), a topic which ordinarily does not\r\n\r\nattract  too much debate in this House.  In fact,  today,  it\r\n\r\nalso  does  not  attract too much debate in the  House.   The\r\n\r\nMinister has already given the technical definition of NII in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  when moving the motion.  Mrs Lim has also  asked\r\n\r\nabout  the  role  of the Government in respect  of  our  past\r\n\r\nreserves  and the NII.  At this point, Sir, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nshare with the House what is a layman's definition of NII.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the layman, NII is the investment income of our\r\n\r\ncountry's  past  budget surpluses.  It  is  equivalent  to  a\r\n\r\nretiree receiving an endowment from the cash dividends  of  a\r\n\r\nprincipal  sum managed by an investment bank.  Only  in  this\r\n\r\ncase, the Government is the custodian of these past surpluses\r\n\r\nwhich  we  all  know have been locked away and could  not  be\r\n\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mrs Lim also questioned, who contributed to these\r\n\r\npast surpluses?  They are accumulated from past budget\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsurpluses  and sales of Government assets, such as  land  and\r\n\r\nbuildings.  In one way or another, these reserves are derived\r\n\r\nfrom the sweat and labour of generations of working people in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Of  course,  we  have  a  clean  and   efficient\r\n\r\nGovernment which manages the reserves very well, allowing  it\r\n\r\nto grow and to be preserved over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when we look at the Annual Budget\r\n\r\nStatement, one would notice that the NII is below the  budget\r\n\r\nline.   In other words, the budget is presented in terms  of,\r\n\r\nfirst, revenue, followed by expenditure, then followed  by  a\r\n\r\nstatement  saying what is the surplus or deficit  of  revenue\r\n\r\nover  expenditure, then a statement giving  us  the  NII.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to surmise that this presentation, Sir,  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  cosmetic.  It reflects our Government's  philosophy  of\r\n\r\nmanaging  our  budget.  NII is not used, it  is  hardly  ever\r\n\r\nused,   unless  expenditure  exceeds  revenue,  which  rarely\r\n\r\nhappens  in  Singapore.  Therefore, this way of  presentation\r\n\r\nhas   the  effect  of  enforcing  a  discipline  within   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to strike for a balanced budget or a surplus where\r\n\r\npossible.   The rationale of many of our policies is  derived\r\n\r\nfrom  this  principle.   In  other words,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  will always try to push for a balanced budget  or  a\r\n\r\nsurplus budget, where possible, before tapping on the NII.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I chaired a Feedback Unit Dialogue\r\n\r\nsession  on major concerns of Singaporeans on the evening  of\r\n\r\n4th  January  this year.  This is the second of a  series  of\r\n\r\nsessions  to  be  organised by the Feedback  Unit.   For  the\r\n\r\nsession I chaired, the subject matter was the concerns of the\r\n\r\nsenior   citizens  in  Singapore.   50-odd  of  these  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  participated in the session. Their  major  concerns\r\n\r\nare rising cost of living and medical cost, with medical cost\r\n\r\nbeing the principal area of concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentiment of the senior citizens on health care is\r\n\r\nthat  the Government could have done more for them.   Medical\r\n\r\ncosts  are  escalating and senior citizens are burdened  with\r\n\r\nthe  brunt  of it.  Several expressed the opinion  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment does not look after the senior\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncitizens  well because they are no longer productive  members\r\n\r\nof the community.  Others say that this Government only cares\r\n\r\nabout  \"profit\".  Nonetheless, the general consensus is  that\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  have been paying taxes  all  their  working\r\n\r\nlives  and contributing to building today's Singapore.   Yet,\r\n\r\nwhen they are retired and when their need for medical care is\r\n\r\nthe greatest, the Government is miserly in dishing out social\r\n\r\nservices  and  health  care.   The  participants  called  for\r\n\r\ngreater  and more generous support by the Government.   After\r\n\r\nall,  to most Singaporeans, the Government is considered rich\r\n\r\nand  could  afford it.  At the Feedback Session,  the  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  spoke  with passion and strong  emotion.   Clearly,\r\n\r\nthese issues are very close to their hearts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One participant, Dr Jazmyn Chelliah, pointed out that\r\n\r\none  of  the key reasons why the senior citizens are  unhappy\r\n\r\nabout  health  care  is  that the Government  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nhealth  care is low, at around 1% of our GDP.  At this level,\r\n\r\nit   is  comparable  to  the  level  expended  by  low-income\r\n\r\ncountries  and  is  not  commensurate  with  the  ranking  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In other words, if we use our per capita  income,\r\n\r\nthat  ranking would put us among the top 10 countries in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   But when it comes to public health care expenditure,\r\n\r\nwe  are  being  grouped  together  with  one  of  the  poorer\r\n\r\ncountries.   She  went  on to point out that  the  percentage\r\n\r\nspent on health care in the US is about 12%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I listened to these sentiments, arguments in support\r\n\r\nof   Government  policies  popped  into  my  head.    It   is\r\n\r\ninevitable, being a PAP member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the statement that senior citizens had contributed\r\n\r\ntaxes  all  their  lives,  and  therefore  should  have  some\r\n\r\nbenefits  in their old age, my response would have been  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  budget is cash based.   Most  of  the  taxes\r\n\r\ncollected  in the current year would have already been  spent\r\n\r\nin  the  year  collected.  So the taxpayers in the  past  had\r\n\r\nalready benefited from the Government's various programmes in\r\n\r\nthe  year they paid their taxes.  So paying taxes is not like\r\n\r\nputting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsavings away for old age.  Senior citizens could not look  at\r\n\r\nthe  past  reserves as their collective savings and  as  such\r\n\r\ncould  be  tapped to fund social services for them when  they\r\n\r\nare  old.  In any event, this is already a moot point because\r\n\r\npast reserves have already been locked up by Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the statement that Government is rich and could\r\n\r\nafford  it,  my  answer  would be  to  highlight  that  again\r\n\r\nGovernment budget is based on annual revenue from  taxes  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   In  order  to pay for more  benefits  for  the\r\n\r\nelders,  we  must raise taxes on the working adults,  thereby\r\n\r\nincreasing  their  burden.  As the ratio  of  working  adults\r\n\r\nversus  retirees  deteriorates over time,  the  burden  would\r\n\r\nnaturally increase.  Now the ratio is roughly 10  to  1.   In\r\n\r\nthe future, say, year 2030, the ratio would have been 4 to 1.\r\n\r\nAdding more benefits would accelerate this and that would  be\r\n\r\nunfair to the working adults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by themselves, Sir, these arguments are logical and\r\n\r\nrational.   For a country with a balanced budget  or  even  a\r\n\r\ndeficit budget, it is true that to provide more for the  aged\r\n\r\nmeans  higher taxes for the working adults.  After  a  while,\r\n\r\nthe  tax  burden would be sky high as we could see  in  those\r\n\r\nNordic  countries.  Yet, when I started thinking  about  this\r\n\r\nConstitutional Amendment Bill, it strikes me that perhaps  if\r\n\r\nyou look at the NII and the size of the NII, maybe the senior\r\n\r\ncitizens' grouses are not entirely without basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has disclosed that in our last budget\r\n\r\nstatement, NII is 3.5% of our GDP.  To do a comparison to get\r\n\r\na better feel of the magnitude of this number, let us look at\r\n\r\nthe  Defence budget which is pegged at 5% of GDP.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  while  NII could not pay for everything MINDEF  would\r\n\r\nneed,  it  does  pay for about 70%.  On the other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education's budget, the second largest  in  our\r\n\r\nannual Government expenditure, stands at 3.7% of GDP.   Thus,\r\n\r\nNII alone could have paid for our total annual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  education, paying  everything  for  schools,\r\n\r\nuniversities,  polytechnics, ITEs, teachers,  lecturers,  the\r\n\r\nwhole works.  Sir, we are indeed talking about serious money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think one could not deny entirely\r\n\r\nthat  our  reserves  have been built up over  the  past  from\r\n\r\ncontributions of our citizens in one way or another.  And  in\r\n\r\nmy  mind,  I suggest that we could group these reserves  into\r\n\r\nthree  buckets, according to the persons who have contributed\r\n\r\nas  follows:  the first bucket contributed by working  adults\r\n\r\n(who are working adults today); the second bucket contributed\r\n\r\nby  retirees during their working life, and the third  bucket\r\n\r\ncontributed  by  those - pardon my pun - who had  kicked  the\r\n\r\nbucket.   So from each bucket, you look at, flows  an  annual\r\n\r\nNII.   We  do  not  need  to argue what percentage  of  these\r\n\r\nreserves are in each bucket.  Maybe the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\ncould  work  it out.  But I think of the money in the  bucket\r\n\r\nthat was contributed by retirees, the percentage is not zero.\r\n\r\nI  do not know the number, but definitely it is not zero.  We\r\n\r\ncould argue that we should not touch the NII flowing from the\r\n\r\nfirst bucket, the bucket of the working adults.  That belongs\r\n\r\nto  the working adults, for their future use.  We could argue\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  not touch the NII flowing  from  the  third\r\n\r\nbucket   as  these  should  be  considered  our  inheritance,\r\n\r\nheirloom for our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it beyond the realm of reasonableness if we use\r\n\r\nthe  investment income derived from the \"retirees\" bucket  to\r\n\r\ndefray the medical cost of the senior citizens who are living\r\n\r\ntoday, in particular those in the lower income group?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, Sir, if we do a mental exercise and say we\r\n\r\nearmark and use the NII from the second bucket to fund social\r\n\r\nprogrammes   and  health  care  programmes  for  the   senior\r\n\r\ncitizens,  I  would find it difficult to hew to the  argument\r\n\r\nthat  to  provide  more for the old means  higher  taxes  and\r\n\r\nheavier burden for the young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the Government is\r\n\r\nleaving no more than 50%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof the NII as revenue in the Government budget, in case it is\r\n\r\nneeded  in  the future.  Part of it would be used  to  defray\r\n\r\nmore extensive social programmes as our society ages.  In  my\r\n\r\nmind,  there  is  much scope for better  and  more  extensive\r\n\r\nmedical services, in particular for senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us revisit the health statistics mentioned by Dr\r\n\r\nChelliah.  I asked the Librarian to do a search which yielded\r\n\r\nthe   following  data  taken  there  from  World  Development\r\n\r\nIndicators  2000 [World Bank March 2000].   In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the public expenditure on health  care  from  the\r\n\r\nlatest  figures  available was 1.1% of GDP  and  the  private\r\n\r\nexpenditure was 2%, giving a total expenditure of 3.2%.  This\r\n\r\nputs us in the same bracket as those lower-income countries I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned, whose numbers were 1.2% and 2% respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the middle income countries spent 3.1% and\r\n\r\n2.6%  respectively. The high-income countries  incurred  6.2%\r\n\r\nand 3.7% respectively.  In the case of USA, it spent 6.5% and\r\n\r\n7.5%,  giving a total of 13.9% of GDP.  Dr Chelliah  was  not\r\n\r\nentirely  right but I think she has a point.  We as a  people\r\n\r\nspent  one-third  of  the amount spent by  the  middle-income\r\n\r\ncountries  and  one-sixth of the amount spent  by  the  high-income countries when it comes to public health care.   While\r\n\r\nI am not advocating matching these percentages blindly, point\r\n\r\nby  point, I think we could have done more in this particular\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that the social costs\r\n\r\nincurred  by  the Government will increase over time  as  our\r\n\r\npopulation  ages  even  at  the current  level  of  services,\r\n\r\nthereby bringing us closer, as far as the percentage  of  GDP\r\n\r\nis  concerned,  to  the  norm  of more  developed  countries.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think we could re-examine the basis of Government\r\n\r\npolicies  and perhaps, conceptually, tap part of the  NII  to\r\n\r\nbetter look after our senior citizens.  If we earmark the use\r\n\r\nof  NII  for  this  purpose,  we  could  rationalise  greater\r\n\r\nexpenditure without having to wait for the budget to go  into\r\n\r\ndeficit  before tapping the NII.  I would say that we  should\r\n\r\nsupport our senior citizens better in their old age.  After\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall,  they  are  the people who have laid the  foundation  of\r\n\r\neverything we have today in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am uncomfortable\r\n\r\nwith  the  amendment  to change the term  of  office  of  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General.  Neither am I convinced by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance's rationale on the need to make the change.  I wonder\r\n\r\nwhat has prompted the Government to change the term of office\r\n\r\nof  the  Auditor-General.  Is the Government saying that  the\r\n\r\noffice of the Auditor-General is facing a great problem?   Or\r\n\r\nis  it  that there is no public officer who wishes to be  the\r\n\r\nnext Auditor-General because of the current term of office?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the office of Auditor-General is an important\r\n\r\ninstrument  in  our  system of Government  to  check  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment accounts.  I have been reading the reports of  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  quite  regularly  and  I  am  convinced  and\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that   the  office  of  the  Auditor-General   is\r\n\r\nindependent and impartial.  The tenure of the current Auditor-General  is for life.  I believe that life tenure of such  an\r\n\r\nimportant  position  will allow the person  to  exercise  his\r\n\r\npower   without  fear  or  favour.   Whereas  a  fixed   term\r\n\r\nappointment, as is proposed now before the House, may  affect\r\n\r\nthe  person's  independent judgement as  the  person  who  is\r\n\r\nappointed as Auditor-General may have to consider whether  he\r\n\r\nwill  be reappointed again after his term of six years  ends.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  believe  the change in the tenure  of  the  Auditor-General to a fixed term would affect or even undermine public\r\n\r\nconfidence in the office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not support the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the main\r\n\r\ntopic  today  is  on  the NII, Dr Wang has raised  healthcare\r\n\r\nissues.   I will be very happy to respond to it in full  when\r\n\r\nwe  debate this during the Budget session.  But I would  like\r\n\r\nto  make  some points since it is fresh and current.   First,\r\n\r\ntotal  healthcare expenditure.  I think Dr Wang, in the  end,\r\n\r\ndid clarify that the number he used for many of the developed\r\n\r\ncountries of 6% to 7% of GDP\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non total healthcare expenditure and for the US, 12% to 14% of\r\n\r\nGDP,  should be compared like with like to Singapore's  case,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  3.2%  of  GDP,  and not  1%.   1%  represents  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's component.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that healthcare should not be\r\n\r\nmeasured  by the inputs.  It does not really matter what  you\r\n\r\nput  in.   The more important parameter should be the outcome\r\n\r\nof  what  you get for the money that you spend.  Although  we\r\n\r\nonly  spent  3.2%  of our GDP on healthcare,  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nstandard  in  Singapore is rated as good, if not better  than\r\n\r\nmany of the developed countries.  And this is done not by us,\r\n\r\nbut  by  the World Bank.  The World Bank recently ranked  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare systems around the world and it will not  surprise\r\n\r\nyou  to  know that Singapore is ranked sixth, even though  we\r\n\r\nhave  only  spent  3%  of our GDP on  healthcare.   The  USA,\r\n\r\ndespite  spending  12%  to 14% of GDP on  healthcare,  ranked\r\n\r\nquite far down, beyond 20.  In the US, there are more than 45\r\n\r\nmillion  people who are insured.  So even though  they  spent\r\n\r\n12% to 14% of GDP on healthcare, not everybody has access  to\r\n\r\nthe same healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I have given the assurance many times that\r\n\r\nif  any  MP comes across any low income Singaporean, who  has\r\n\r\ndifficulty  paying  his bill, he can  write  to  the  medical\r\n\r\nsocial  worker  in  the hospital, and  99%  of  all  Medifund\r\n\r\napplications are approved.  For the 1% which is not approved,\r\n\r\nplease feel free to write to Mr Chan Soo Sen, or myself,  and\r\n\r\nwe  will  look into the case.  So healthcare in Singapore  is\r\n\r\naccessible  to  everybody in Singapore,  and  it  is  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the particular comment about healthcare for the\r\n\r\nelderly,  despite his analogy of the three buckets,  we  have\r\n\r\nindeed  set  aside part of our old reserves in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nMedifund  for  helping low income people  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\nhealthcare  fees.   And the main users of  Medifund  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  elderly.   We  have set  aside  $700  million  in\r\n\r\nMedifund and the interest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  Medifund, which is equivalent to your NII, is  used  to\r\n\r\nfund  Medifund applications, and 99% of the applications  are\r\n\r\napproved.  Last year, we set up the Eldercare Fund  which  is\r\n\r\nspecifically targeted at the elderly, ie, those who  have  to\r\n\r\ngo  to nursing homes.  Part of the past reserves would be put\r\n\r\ninto the Eldercare Fund which would look after the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole thrust of our healthcare system is largely\r\n\r\naimed at the elderly because the younger population does  not\r\n\r\nhave   healthcare  problems.   The  bulk  of  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nproblems  arise in the last five or ten years of  your  life.\r\n\r\nAnd in the last few years, we have put in the whole framework\r\n\r\nto  look after the healthcare of our elderly.  We started off\r\n\r\nwith the community health screening.  We subsidise it heavily\r\n\r\nand  we  encourage  every elderly person  to  go  for  health\r\n\r\nscreening.   If  the  elderly are so  concerned  about  their\r\n\r\nhealthcare, I would urge them to go for healthcare screening.\r\n\r\nInstead,  today, only 20% of those we have invited turned  up\r\n\r\nfor  the health screening.  Indeed, if they are so concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  first  step  that  they should take,  to  be  personally\r\n\r\nresponsible for their health, is to turn up for their  health\r\n\r\nscreening.  Second, we have put in place the whole package to\r\n\r\nhelp  them manage their health condition.  If they go to  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics, they are subsidised 75% of the cost.  They  only\r\n\r\npay  25%  of  the bill.  This shows the very  high  level  of\r\n\r\nsupport that the Government has put in place.   We even allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  go  to  the  private sector GP,  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\nconvenient  for them, and they still enjoy the same  subsidy.\r\n\r\nAnd  every year the Government has a budget surplus,  MPs  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, including the Ministry of Health, will urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance to put in something for the elderly.   As\r\n\r\nwe  all  know,  every  time there is a  budget  surplus,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance will always put aside some  top-ups  in\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave  for  the elderly.  This has happened  on  four\r\n\r\noccasions.   And each time, we spent between $50 million  and\r\n\r\n$250 million topping up the Medisave for the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last National Day Rally, the Prime Minister put\r\n\r\nin place a scheme to pay the premiums for the elderly if they\r\n\r\nhave not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  covered under MediShield.  All they have to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nsend  a  piece of paper saying, \"I want to qualify for  these\r\n\r\ntwo years' premiums.\"  And only 65% made the application, ie,\r\n\r\nonly  65%  bothered to return the piece of paper  to  qualify\r\n\r\nthem for the two years' premiums, despite all our efforts  to\r\n\r\nencourage  them and their children to send in  the  piece  of\r\n\r\npaper.   So  I must say that we have put in place  an  entire\r\n\r\nframework  to look after the elderly.  I would like  to  urge\r\n\r\nall elderly Singaporeans not just to be concerned about their\r\n\r\nhealth but to take the first few steps to actually look after\r\n\r\ntheir health.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  had  anticipated  in the 1980s that inevitably,  sometime,\r\n\r\nsomewhere,  somebody  is  going to come  up  with  compelling\r\n\r\nreason why we should use up our reserves.  Singapore is  very\r\n\r\nrich  - I would not deny that.  Who made us rich?  The people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.   Who  led  the  people  of  Singapore?   This\r\n\r\ngovernment.   Who  will  lead it  to  perdition?   Those  who\r\n\r\nabandon  the principles that made Singapore.  You can  always\r\n\r\npresent a sentimental approach to hard cases which will touch\r\n\r\neverybody's heartstrings, and then they will lose their sense\r\n\r\nof  objectivity.   Some  child  came  from  Nepal  with  some\r\n\r\ndisease,  and they raised half a million dollars  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  sympathy generated by the publicity.  I do not deny that\r\n\r\nwe  should  have sympathy and that we should demonstrate  our\r\n\r\ncompassion.   But  when we are talking about  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the future of the children and grandchildren of\r\n\r\nthese old people, let us pause and think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One position I have continued to hold, although I am not\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, is that of Chairman of  the  Government\r\n\r\nInvestment Corporation.  The Prime Minister asked me to carry\r\n\r\non  because  he had enough to concentrate on.  Yes,  we  have\r\n\r\nover  US$100 billion invested all over the world.  The market\r\n\r\nknows that, and the market considers it carefully before they\r\n\r\nattack  the Singapore dollar.  We can be brought down to  our\r\n\r\nknees  if  they feel that you are unable to defend it.   Hong\r\n\r\nKong was in peril in 1998 when they aggressively attacked the\r\n\r\nstock market, they had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto prevent themselves from being brought down.  They attacked\r\n\r\nthe  dollar and forced interest rates up.  When the  interest\r\n\r\nrate  goes  up,  the stock market goes down.  They  sold  the\r\n\r\nstock market short, and eventually they bring Hong Kong down.\r\n\r\nSo the government bought aggressively to push the stock index\r\n\r\nup.   They taught the speculators a lesson.  That was a  high\r\n\r\nrisk  exercise  and they are still holding large  amounts  of\r\n\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they not do that in Singapore? Because relative\r\n\r\nto  our  different position they know we have quite a lot  of\r\n\r\nammunition.  And this guarantees that nobody's CPF will  ever\r\n\r\nbe brought low by depreciation of our currency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Prime Minister decided to move this\r\n\r\nConstitutional Amendment.  We have spent a long time  arguing\r\n\r\nit  in the 1980s; finally passed it after 1990, that we would\r\n\r\nnot touch the reserves.  And here comes an experienced PAP MP\r\n\r\nwho  says, \"Let us have three buckets.\"  I will tell you what\r\n\r\nwill happen.  We will all kick the bucket!  Yes, to make  the\r\n\r\nargument  attractive  he said it is 1%  for  health,  5%  for\r\n\r\ndefence.   Defence  just evaporates our  resources.   Health,\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  poor  old  people.  I  am  one  of  them.   My\r\n\r\ncolleagues are among them and the frequency with which I meet\r\n\r\nthem  in the hospital, because orthopaedic problems and X-ray\r\n\r\nscreening increase with age.  It is inevitable.  But argue it\r\n\r\nwithin  the context of the present Budget.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nhear  the Member argue why we should not spend 5% on  defence\r\n\r\nand  take away, say, 1 1/2% from defence to spend it  on  the\r\n\r\nold.   If he can make that argument, that we should cut  down\r\n\r\non defence from 5% to 3 1/2%, and, with that extra 1 1/2%, as\r\n\r\nin  the case of Florida between President-elect George W Bush\r\n\r\nand  Vice-President  Al Gore, we can  argue  about  the  most\r\n\r\nexpensive drugs for the old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we get older, it gets more and more expensive. For\r\n\r\ncars,  I  am told, with the COE, there is an optimum point  - probably  about  four  or five years - at  which  you  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  you sell the car while you can still get good  value\r\n\r\nand change to a new car, or you carry on to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe end, till 10 years, and write it off.  Well, I decided to\r\n\r\nuse  my  car  and write it off.  But can we write  off  human\r\n\r\nbeings?   We cannot.  So, there comes a time when  the  bills\r\n\r\nbecome  phenomenal.  That is the problem that  all  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  are facing.  If we were not developed, if  we  did\r\n\r\nnot  have  this health service, we would not be  facing  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  The longevity, their lifespan, would be around  65,\r\n\r\nor,  as  in  India, around 50.  There is no old age  problem.\r\n\r\nBut we have a geriatric problem, and gerontology is going  to\r\n\r\nbe, increasingly, a large part of our medical practice.  With\r\n\r\ncars,  you can say, right, we will change the engine,  change\r\n\r\nthe  axle, so we will just keep the chassis.  Then  you  have\r\n\r\ndents, wrinkles, crumples, but a new engine.  Can you do that\r\n\r\nwith a human being?  With each stage, it becomes prohibitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have put NII out of reach, out of bounds. The PAP\r\n\r\nmay  lose.  Somebody may win the elections, some party  which\r\n\r\nsays, \"Unlock it\".  Well, they will have to win two-thirds to\r\n\r\nchange the Constitution or they will be in conflict with  the\r\n\r\nPresident.   I do not say it is foolproof.  My old colleagues\r\n\r\ntold  me  I  was  trying the impossible  in  locking  up  the\r\n\r\nreserves.  So when an old experienced Member like Dr Wang Kai\r\n\r\nYuen,  says this, I am reminded of their advice to me.  Maybe\r\n\r\nit  is impossible, but I hope, because I have this chance  to\r\n\r\ntell you why I think what I think and what made me think this\r\n\r\nway to you MPs, it would not happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives us enormous confidence. It gives us that\r\n\r\nflexibility to manage our economic affairs in a way we  could\r\n\r\nnot  do  if we did not have these reserves.  Do you  want  to\r\n\r\nraid  it?   I  can find even more compelling and more  heart-rending  reasons why we should spend it.  But I suggest,  no.\r\n\r\nAt  the end of the day, whom do we owe our deepest obligation\r\n\r\nto as a government?  To the future.  Not just to the present;\r\n\r\ncertainly not to the past.  If you want to talk about  merits\r\n\r\nand what people deserve, then with every certificate or medal\r\n\r\nthat  we  give, we ought to give a huge sum either in annuity\r\n\r\nor in a capital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrant.  That is what the British used to do.  When Nelson won\r\n\r\nat  the  Battle of Trafalgar, he was made a Lord and a  large\r\n\r\npiece of land was bequeathed on him.  So you can go down  the\r\n\r\nlist  of  British history.  That is one reason why they  have\r\n\r\nall  this trouble in Ireland.  Every time the British  won  a\r\n\r\nbattle,  they  distributed large chunks of land  in  Ireland,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  their  colony, to the generals who  fought  these\r\n\r\nbattles   because,  without  those  generals  winning   those\r\n\r\nbattles, there would be no empire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the way they did it. But do not mortgage the\r\n\r\nfuture.  If you do, your children and your grandchildren will\r\n\r\npay for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking\r\n\r\nafter  the Senior Minister is an anti-climax, but  I  do  not\r\n\r\nrise to be anti anything.  I wish to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the debate on the NII, I believe that,\r\n\r\nactually,  it comes down to a question of balance.   And  the\r\n\r\nbalance is, on the one hand, you have this argument that  the\r\n\r\nNII  comes  from reserves that had been accumulated  by  past\r\n\r\ngovernments  and the income from these past reserves  should,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be  locked up accordingly.  On  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthere  can  well be an argument that the NII that  comes  out\r\n\r\nfrom  past  reserves  is  actually  managed  by  the  current\r\n\r\nGovernment.   How  much  we  get out,  as  income  from  past\r\n\r\nreserves,  is as much a question of the skill of the  current\r\n\r\nGovernment  as it is of the current Government earning  money\r\n\r\nall  by  itself  from new budget surpluses and  so  on.   The\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister has said that he is the Chairman of the  GIC\r\n\r\nand,  certainly, a lot of our NII would have  come  from  the\r\n\r\nskills that he has exercised in the management of the GIC and\r\n\r\nthe NII.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore say that, actually, the current\r\n\r\nGovernment has every right to spend every single cent of  the\r\n\r\nNII.   But  it  has exercised restraint.  And it  is  a  very\r\n\r\ncommendable  self-restraint that, in this  case,  instead  of\r\n\r\nspending all of the NII, it is saying that up to 50% would be\r\n\r\nlocked up.  I therefore support this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has also raised another issue, which,\r\n\r\nI believe, again boils\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndown  to  balance.  On the one hand, you have  this  argument\r\n\r\nthat  a person who is appointed until he retires has security\r\n\r\nof  tenure  and,  therefore, he will not be looking  for  re-appointment and doing things to get his re-appointment.    On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, I think the real question is how do we  make\r\n\r\nthis  Auditor-General independent and, if he is  independent,\r\n\r\nhe  would  not  be  looking  to  the  clock  or  to  the  new\r\n\r\nappointment he is hoping to get.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our system now, the elected President is a person\r\n\r\ndirectly elected by the electorate and, therefore, if he does\r\n\r\nnot  act  in the interests of the Singapore nation, he  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  elected.  And under this system, the Auditor-General\r\n\r\nreports to the elected President, who is also independent  of\r\n\r\nthe parties in Parliament.  I believe this is good enough  as\r\n\r\na  check-and-balance,  and I believe too  that  the  Auditor-General,  in  reporting  to  Parliament,  which  is  a  House\r\n\r\ncomposed of ruling and opposition parties, would want to  act\r\n\r\nindependently  and,  in  fact, would  want  to  preserve  his\r\n\r\nprofessional reputation as a neutral, dependable and credible\r\n\r\nAuditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess, in this case, the balance could well go either\r\n\r\nway, but perhaps six years may indeed be a little short.  The\r\n\r\nterm of a Parliament is five years and the term of an Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  is  six years.  It could possibly be  argued  that\r\n\r\nperhaps six years may be too short, perhaps it should  be  10\r\n\r\nyears,  which is two terms of Parliament, or 15 years,  which\r\n\r\nis three terms of Parliament.  Fifteen years is also arguable\r\n\r\nbecause  if  an Auditor-General comes into his  position,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have had several years of experience and he  would  be\r\n\r\nround about 45 to 50 years.  And add another 15 years to  his\r\n\r\nterm, he retires at a good old age anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, Mr Speaker, Sir, it comes down to\r\n\r\nbalance, and it is a judgement call.  Six years, 10 years, 15\r\n\r\nyears, I believe the Government has made a judgement call and\r\n\r\nwe  can wait for our time to make the judgement whether  this\r\n\r\nis a correct number or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  the  Members  who have supported  the  Amendment  Bill\r\n\r\nalthough  some  have  expressed  reservations  on  particular\r\n\r\nissues which I will touch on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee generally supports the amendment to\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution, for which I thank him.   However,  he  has\r\n\r\nraised  the  point  that,  in  the  proposed  amendment,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has the final say on the amount  of  NII\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government would lock up and, if in the event  the\r\n\r\nPresident does not agree with this, there might be  an  issue\r\n\r\nof  conflict.   I  believe that this is  unlikely  to  happen\r\n\r\nbecause  the  President has full access to  the  Government's\r\n\r\naccounts  and  these  accounts are audited  by  the  Auditor-General.   And  if  he  does  not agree  to  the  statements,\r\n\r\nincluding  the NII projections, he can raise any issues  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government  at any time.  In any case, our  proposal  is\r\n\r\nthat  we will agree with the President which items should  be\r\n\r\nincluded as NII and incorporate these into the principles for\r\n\r\nthe  protection of reserves.  So, on balance, it is  unlikely\r\n\r\nthat disputes would arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has raised several points, first of\r\n\r\nwhich is what is the role of Government and the public in the\r\n\r\nprotection   of  reserves.   I  think  the  relationship   is\r\n\r\nstraightforward.  Past reserves belong to the people, and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  merely  a  guardian  and  steward  of   these\r\n\r\nreserves.   A  good steward, in his role, is to  protect  the\r\n\r\nreserves  and  ensure  that they are available  for  spending\r\n\r\nshould  the  occasion  arise.  The reserves  should  also  be\r\n\r\nefficiently managed so that the capital sum grows over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also asked whether the figure of 50% to be\r\n\r\nprotected  was arrived at arbitrarily, because  she  believes\r\n\r\nthat  it is difficult to make accurate projections of revenue\r\n\r\nand expenditure over the long term.  And, if there should  be\r\n\r\ninaccuracies to these estimates, the figure of 50%  may  need\r\n\r\nto  be  amended over time, which would not be very desirable.\r\n\r\nI agree with her that the figure of 50% should not be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanged  too  frequently  as each  change  would  require  an\r\n\r\namendment   to   the   Constitution,   which   is   obviously\r\n\r\nundesirable.   The figure of 50% was therefore  chosen  after\r\n\r\nvery  careful  consideration  of the  Government's  long-term\r\n\r\nrevenue and expenditure estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, on the revenue side, long-term\r\n\r\nforecasts  of  operating revenue have been  fairly  reliable.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because we have a high degree of tax compliance  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Also, the Government's revenue income growth  had\r\n\r\nshown  consistent  and strong correlation  with  GDP  growth.\r\n\r\nThis means that if the Singapore economy continues to grow at\r\n\r\naround 4% to 5% over the longer term, we can be certain  that\r\n\r\nfairly  reliable estimates of operating revenue growth  would\r\n\r\nbe possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side, long-term estimates of\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  especially  development  expenditures  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  increases in health costs, are also  subject  to\r\n\r\nuncertainty.    However,  the  balance  of   other   spending\r\n\r\nrequirements of Government is much more predictable  as  they\r\n\r\nare largely under Government control.  On balance, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe believe that the longer-term forecasts of operating budget\r\n\r\nbalances should be fairly reliable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, reasonable forecasts of future NII flows are\r\n\r\nalso  fairly  reliable based on GIC's experience in  managing\r\n\r\npast  reserves in the last 20 years.  Overall, therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis concluded that no more than 50% of NII should be needed to\r\n\r\nsupplement  operating revenues in order to  finance  forecast\r\n\r\nexpenditures through the year 2010.  In fact, if  GDP  growth\r\n\r\nrates  should exceed forecasts, and prudent control continues\r\n\r\nto  be  exercised over expenditures, 50% of NII may  even  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to ensure balanced budgets through  most  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  decade of this century.  The need for making frequent\r\n\r\nchanges to the 50% figure is therefore unlikely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim is also concerned that future governments may,\r\n\r\nthrough the use of sophisticated financial instruments,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanipulate the Government's accounts to maximise NII flows so\r\n\r\nthat  they would have a larger access to it.  This is  indeed\r\n\r\npossible,  but the only way in which a profligate  government\r\n\r\ncan  increase  access  to NII is to  try  to  manipulate  the\r\n\r\ninvestments  so  that you get a larger flow of  interest  and\r\n\r\ndividend income.  If they try to do this, it will show up  in\r\n\r\nthe  accounts available to the President and his  Council  of\r\n\r\nPresidential Advisers.  Any large scale manipulation  of  our\r\n\r\nreserves to focus on buying huge amounts of, say, junk  bonds\r\n\r\nwith  high interest rates will become very obvious.  And when\r\n\r\nthis  comes  to  the  attention  of  the  President  and  his\r\n\r\nadvisers,  the  President  has  an  obligation  to  call  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to account for these changes and  if  he  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the answer, he can take the  matter  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  and to Parliament.  I think it is unlikely  that  any\r\n\r\nsignificant  manipulation can be achieved without  attracting\r\n\r\nthe President's attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has made some strong pleas for\r\n\r\nincreased social and health spending for older citizens.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Health has addressed part of his concerns but  I\r\n\r\nwould like to just point out that the use of macro statistics\r\n\r\non health expenditure is very dangerous because it depends on\r\n\r\nwhat  you mean by \"expenditure\".  I would rather, in  looking\r\n\r\nat  what  we  spend and what other countries spend,  look  at\r\n\r\nother   types   of  statistics,  such  as  life   expectancy,\r\n\r\npercentage  of  life  births,  and  other  quality  of   life\r\n\r\nstandards which we have achieved relative to other countries.\r\n\r\nThat  is  probably a better measure of how well the money  we\r\n\r\nhave  spent  on  health has achieved and, in  most  of  these\r\n\r\nmeasures, I think we stand out quite well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although what we spend looks small relative\r\n\r\nto  what  other  countries spend, what we do spend  is  spent\r\n\r\nwisely  and efficiently.  There is no doubt that spending  on\r\n\r\nhealth  and  social  costs  will  increase  rapidly  as   our\r\n\r\npopulation  ages.  In fact, it is precisely for  this  reason\r\n\r\nthat the Constitution is being amended to allow access to 50%\r\n\r\nof   NII   in   order  to  meet  increased  future   spending\r\n\r\nrequirements, primarily on health care.  The Minister for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHealth  has  also  said that we have made  a  start  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection  as the Government has created several  buckets  of\r\n\r\nfunds, ie, Medifund and the Eldercare Endowment Fund in which\r\n\r\nmonies are placed in anticipation of future requirements  for\r\n\r\nthe  elderly.   In the case of the Eldercare Endowment  Fund,\r\n\r\nthe  targeted  amount is $2.5 billion, of which $400  million\r\n\r\nhas  already  been placed.  We will continue to add  to  this\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund  in  future from budget  surpluses  and  also\r\n\r\nthrough  the NII component.  I think this covers largely  the\r\n\r\nissues which have been raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to the point raised by Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  on the term of the Auditor-General.  He says that  he\r\n\r\ndoes not support the amendment because he believes that it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Auditor-General to  be  appointed  until\r\n\r\nretirement as this gives him independence. This is  a  matter\r\n\r\nof  judgement.  We believe that 6 years plus 6  years  should\r\n\r\nprovide  him with sufficient independence and it  is  not  an\r\n\r\nuncommon practice for other large countries to also limit the\r\n\r\nterms  of the Auditor-General.  For example, Australia has  a\r\n\r\n10-year  non-renewable term; Canada also has a  10-year  non-renewable  term.  Japan has a 7-year term.  New Zealand  also\r\n\r\nhas  a  non-renewable 7-year term.  In the case of the United\r\n\r\nStates  of  America, it is a 15-year non-renewable  term.  So\r\n\r\nthere is a wide range of options open and it depends on  your\r\n\r\njudgment  on the quality of the people you appoint, and  also\r\n\r\nwhat   is  the  objective  of  appointing  people  to   these\r\n\r\npositions,  whether you want them to stay  effectively  until\r\n\r\nretirement,  which  means you have to avoid  appointing  good\r\n\r\npeople   to  these  positions  early  which  is,   I   think,\r\n\r\nundesirable. As I have explained in my speech, the reasons we\r\n\r\nhave  chosen to make these amendments are quite clear  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve they are sound and correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That the Bill be now read\r\n\r\na Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Division will be taken to ascertain that the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of  the Bill is supported by the votes of  not  less\r\n\r\nthan two-thirds of the total number of the elected Members of\r\n\r\nParliament, which is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members,  pursuant to Article 5(2) of  the  Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk will ring the Division Bells.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three minutes ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I proceed to start the electronic\r\n\r\nvoting,  Members  are reminded that they  are  to  press  the\r\n\r\nbutton  marked  \"Present\"  on their  electronic  voting  unit\r\n\r\nlocated  at their left armrest before indicating their  vote.\r\n\r\nDo not activate this button till I have asked you to commence\r\n\r\nvoting.

This fund was first announced by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  August 2000 in his National Day  Rally  speech.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister said that the Fund would be launched with\r\n\r\nan initial sum of $500 million from Government's surplus.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  built  up  over  the years  from  future  budgetary\r\n\r\nsurpluses to a target size of $5 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will be used to\r\n\r\npromote and support lifelong learning in Singapore.  It  will\r\n\r\nfinance  efforts  to  encourage  Singaporeans  to  engage  in\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning, and provide assistance and  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  them to do so.  This will help Singaporeans to meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of a knowledge-based economy and cope with the  threat\r\n\r\nof  structural  unemployment.  In particular, the  Fund  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  enhance the employability of those  who  are  lower\r\n\r\nskilled or those who come from the lower income group.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Imperative of Lifelong Learning</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of lifelong learning cannot be over-emphasised. Increasingly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknowledge   and  skills  are  becoming  the  key  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage  for  individual  workers,  companies  and   entire\r\n\r\nnations.   Today,  a CD-ROM costs less than  fifty  cents  to\r\n\r\nproduce.   But when that same CD-ROM is loaded with  exciting\r\n\r\ncomputer  game  or some very efficient office  software,  the\r\n\r\nsame  article can now be sold for $50 to more than $100.   It\r\n\r\nis  the software knowledge and skills which created the value\r\n\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the rapid pace of technological advancement also\r\n\r\nmeans  that the shelf life of knowledge and skills is getting\r\n\r\nshorter.  We need life-long learning to remain up-to-date and\r\n\r\nin possession of skills which can drive the economy forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example, Sir. The neighbourhood\r\n\r\nor  backyard mechanics that we used to go to in the past  are\r\n\r\nfacing  a  lot of competition and a dwindling customer  base.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because  the  new generation cars come  with  computer\r\n\r\nengine   management  system  and  many  other   sophisticated\r\n\r\ndevices.   The old mechanics do not know how to service  such\r\n\r\nhi-tech  gadgets in the cars.  And car-owners prefer to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  expensive cars to the agents for maintenance  and  for\r\n\r\nservicing, because the agents have trained mechanics who  can\r\n\r\ndeal with these sophisticated systems.  The mechanics of  old\r\n\r\nwho  cannot  or do not want to upgrade their skill  may  well\r\n\r\nhave  to  look for an alternative vocation. To put it simply,\r\n\r\nlifelong learning is no longer an option.  It is a necessity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, skills upgrading has a long history in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is not a recent discovery or something that we just  come\r\n\r\nupon overnight.  In fact, since 1979, the Government had been\r\n\r\nproviding  incentives for worker training through the  Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. National training initiatives, such as BEST\r\n\r\nand  WISE,  were  also introduced to help the lower  educated\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, EDB and the NTUC introduced the Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP).  This programme was expanded\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin 1998 into a full-scale nation-wide programme to help older\r\n\r\nand   lower  educated  workers  facing  retrenchment  in  the\r\n\r\naftermath  of the Asian economic crisis.  In July last  year,\r\n\r\nwe  revised the Skills Development Levy to provide more funds\r\n\r\nfor  skills  upgrading.   We also launched the  $200  million\r\n\r\nManpower  Development  Assistance  Scheme,  as  part  of  our\r\n\r\nManpower 21 action plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our job is far from over. Lifelong learning is not\r\n\r\na  one-time  effort,  but,  as the name  itself  suggests,  a\r\n\r\ncontinual  effort.   Today, we are taking  another  important\r\n\r\nstep  towards  helping  Singaporeans to  embark  on  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Establishment of the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of a Lifelong Learning Endowment\r\n\r\nFund will provide a secure and continuing stream of income to\r\n\r\nsupport our lifelong learning efforts in the years ahead.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  testimony to the Government's commitment to continuous\r\n\r\nupgrading and re-skilling of workers.  By setting aside  part\r\n\r\nof our budgetary surpluses to build up this Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund,  we are, in fact, investing  the  fruits  of\r\n\r\neconomic growth in the development of our people.  This  will\r\n\r\nhelp to sustain our competitiveness and ensure prosperity  in\r\n\r\nthe  future.  The Lifelong Learning Fund will ensure not only\r\n\r\nthe  continuity of existing manpower development  programmes,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Skills Redevelopment Programme, but also  create\r\n\r\nopportunities for new programmes to help our workers  acquire\r\n\r\nthe skills and capabilities for the knowledge economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Size of the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund will be started with an initial contribution of\r\n\r\n$500  million.   Based on the prevailing CPF Special  Account\r\n\r\ninterest rate of 4%, the initial capital sum will earn  about\r\n\r\n$20  million  a year to support lifelong learning activities.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fund reaches the target size of $5\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbillion,  we  should have about  $200 million  each  year  to\r\n\r\nsupport lifelong learning activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will study the needs of employers and\r\n\r\nworkers and develop programmes which can be supported by  the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning Fund.  More schemes will be  added  as  we\r\n\r\nbuild   up  the  capital  sum.   My  Ministry  also  welcomes\r\n\r\ninnovative  ideas and proposals from community  organisations\r\n\r\nwhich want to play a role.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>LLF Programmes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, my Ministry and the Infocomm Development\r\n\r\nAuthority have been working with organisations, such  as  the\r\n\r\nNational Library Board, People's Association, National Trades\r\n\r\nUnion Congress, the Singapore National Employers' Federation,\r\n\r\nand  also  the  self-help groups, to develop  a  National  IT\r\n\r\nLiteracy Programme.  This programme aims to help Singaporeans\r\n\r\nacquire  basic IT and Internet skills.  It will minimise  the\r\n\r\ndangers   of   a   widening  digital  divide   disadvantaging\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who lack such skills.  A pilot project  will  be\r\n\r\nlaunched   before  April  this  year.   About   5,000   adult\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  from various organisations, including  selected\r\n\r\ncompanies, the People's Association and the various self-help\r\n\r\ngroups,  are expected to participate in this pilot programme.\r\n\r\nThe  experience of the pilot project will enable us to refine\r\n\r\nthe programme for wider application later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, aside from IT, the Lifelong Learning Fund will\r\n\r\nprogressively cover other employability skills and widen  the\r\n\r\nsupply of training opportunities.  Today, we already have  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  network of community facilities spread  throughout\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This includes community clubs, self-help  groups\r\n\r\nand  many  voluntary organisations.  We will work with  these\r\n\r\ncommunity   organisations   to   bring   lifelong    learning\r\n\r\nopportunities   closer   to  the  heartlanders.    For   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  the convenience and proximity  to  home  could\r\n\r\nmake  a  big  difference in getting them to take up  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning.  Such community-based\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlearning and skills upgrading is an area which we will  study\r\n\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provisions in the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now address the key provisions\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 anticipates the setting out of the operational\r\n\r\ndate of the Bill.  The Minister for Manpower will appoint the\r\n\r\ndate at which the Act will come into operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 provide for the establishment of the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning Endowment Fund with capital money provided\r\n\r\nby  Parliament.   The  capital money can  only  be  used  for\r\n\r\ninvestments  authorised  under the  Financial  Procedure  Act\r\n\r\n(Cap. 109).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 sets out the purposes for which the income of\r\n\r\nthe  Endowment  Fund  may  be expended.   These  include  the\r\n\r\npromotion,  establishment  of  facilities  and  provision  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance  for the acquisition,  development  and\r\n\r\nupgrading of skills to enhance employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 establishes an Advisory Council to advise the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Manpower on the application of the income  from\r\n\r\nthe Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 allows expenses incurred in connection with the\r\n\r\noperation  and  administration of the Endowment  Fund  to  be\r\n\r\ndefrayed out of the income of the Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, clause 17 empowers the Minister to make\r\n\r\nregulations  for  the  purposes  of  the  Bill.   These   may\r\n\r\nprescribe the procedures for payments from the fund, criteria\r\n\r\nfor  approval of applications for the fund and the  procedure\r\n\r\nof the Advisory Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as Singapore transits into the New\r\n\r\nEconomy, lifelong learning will be a key competitive strategy\r\n\r\nfor  our success and prosperity.  We must nurture the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  lifelong  learning  to equip Singaporeans  with  relevant\r\n\r\nskills and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknowledge.    The   establishment  of  a  Lifelong   Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment Fund is an important part of this effort.  It  will\r\n\r\nprovide  concrete support to foster a new spirit of  learning\r\n\r\namong  our people.  It will enable us to embark on a learning\r\n\r\nrevolution  to  make Singapore a Learning Nation  capable  of\r\n\r\ntapping   every   opportunity  in  the  New  Economy.    More\r\n\r\nimportantly, it will enable all segments of our population to\r\n\r\nbe  engaged in lifelong learning and bring about more  active\r\n\r\nparticipation in the economy by Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for lifelong learning cannot be emphasised\r\n\r\nenough  in Singapore which depends to such an extent  on  its\r\n\r\nskilled,  educated workforce.  The setting up of an endowment\r\n\r\nfund  to actively encourage Singaporeans to pursue the skills\r\n\r\nneeded  in  an  economy  where technology  is  still  rapidly\r\n\r\nevolving  will  only  underscore the  importance  we  see  of\r\n\r\ndirecting  Singaporeans  towards  a  philosophy  of  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan to set up an endowment fund is a bold move that\r\n\r\nwill  help  a  large  number of older Singapore  workers  who\r\n\r\nmissed  the opportunity for higher education in their younger\r\n\r\ndays  and who are now saddled with low skills.  The Fund will\r\n\r\ngive  them better hope in taking up skills courses  that  can\r\n\r\nhelp enhance their employability.  Following the announcement\r\n\r\nof  the  plan  to  set up the fund by the Prime  Minister  in\r\n\r\nAugust last year, our workers and union leaders await eagerly\r\n\r\nfor  the  details.   I  am sure today's announcement  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Manpower will be welcome not only by  our  low-skilled  workers but Singapore workers in general,  including\r\n\r\nthe better educated, as well as the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund can fill a gap in\r\n\r\nexisting  assistance  programmes  like  the  SRP,  the   NTUC\r\n\r\nEducation and Training Fund and other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogrammes  supported  by the Skills Development  Fund.   The\r\n\r\nconditions   governing  the  SRP  and  SDF  limit  subsidised\r\n\r\ntraining to particular groups of employees.  In contrast, the\r\n\r\nLifelong Endowment Fund does not set any limits on the target\r\n\r\ngroups.   It  should, therefore, work alongside schemes  like\r\n\r\nSRP,  NETF and SDF, rather than duplicating the areas already\r\n\r\ncovered  by  these programmes.  While the Fund  should  widen\r\n\r\nfurther  the  training  opportunities for  older  workers  at\r\n\r\ncompany  and industry levels, it can also be even widened  to\r\n\r\nassist  training of better-skilled workers.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nurge that the Fund be made available for workers who want  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  courses  not covered by the SRP by subsidising  the\r\n\r\ncourse  fees as well as to encourage companies to send  their\r\n\r\nworkers for skills upgrading through absentee-payroll scheme,\r\n\r\nlike  the  SRP.   As  we have seen in the past  three  years,\r\n\r\nincluding  during the recession years, even  skilled  workers\r\n\r\nand   professionals  were  retrenched  as   their   companies\r\n\r\nreorganised  and  restructured.   In  the  New  Economy,  all\r\n\r\nworkers,  irrespective  of  their  skills  levels,  are   not\r\n\r\nprotected  against skills obsolescence, unless  they  upgrade\r\n\r\nand re-tool themselves.  In this case, the flexibility of the\r\n\r\nendowment  fund must be stressed.  But having  said  that,  I\r\n\r\nmust  emphasise the priority that we must give  through  this\r\n\r\nnew  Fund  in  assisting  the more  vulnerable  lower-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers to learn relevant skills to remain employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bill, an advisory council will be set\r\n\r\nup  to  advise  the  Minister on the tasks to  be  undertaken\r\n\r\nthrough  the  application of the Lifelong Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund.  It is important that this advisory council be made  up\r\n\r\nof  people who can best determine the array of skills courses\r\n\r\nwhich workers should have access to under the Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives  from  the  labour  movement   and   employer\r\n\r\norganisations should be included in the advisory council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the endowment fund also provide for\r\n\r\n\"the  promotion of the acquisition, development or  upgrading\r\n\r\nof  such  skills  and expertise\".  The inclusion  of  such  a\r\n\r\nclause  in the Bill will help to ensure that the Fund can  be\r\n\r\nused  to  provide  incentives to companies  that  promise  to\r\n\r\nemploy retrenched workers, particularly those above 40  years\r\n\r\nold,  who take up full-time SRP or SRP-like courses.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nraise  this suggestion because some older retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nface  difficulties in getting jobs suitable  with  the  newly\r\n\r\nacquired  skills  after they have completed  their  full-time\r\n\r\ncourses.   The  number of such workers is now small,  but  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  more  in  future as even older  workers  would  be\r\n\r\nretrenched and they would need the support of their employers\r\n\r\nto  gain better jobs after they have completed their courses.\r\n\r\nIt should provide the incentives to companies that offer jobs\r\n\r\nto  such  retrenched  workers on  the  condition  that  these\r\n\r\nworkers  complete their courses.  Based on NTUC's  experience\r\n\r\nworking  with  retrenched workers during  the  recession  and\r\n\r\nworking with self-help groups to help these workers under the\r\n\r\nSRP  Facilitators  Programme, I  find  that  many  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  are  motivated to upgrade their skills.   We  should\r\n\r\ntake  one more step in helping them, by giving incentives  to\r\n\r\ncompanies to hire them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also includes possible funding for\r\n\r\nresearch  and development of \"learning methods and technology\r\n\r\nto  enhance the acquisition, development or upgrading of such\r\n\r\nskills  and expertise\".  This provision will make it possible\r\n\r\nto  fund  the development of better designed modular courses;\r\n\r\ncourses  that  will  make teaching simple and  learning  fun;\r\n\r\nthose  that would not make the workers feel fearful of  being\r\n\r\nshown up as unintelligent in the classroom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Prime Minister and the Manpower\r\n\r\nMinister have mentioned the IT Literacy Programme as  one  of\r\n\r\nthose  that  would take advantage of the new Endowment  Fund.\r\n\r\nOther  than our unions and employer organisations, we  should\r\n\r\nindeed  make  the Fund accessible to grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nlike the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committee, Community  Clubs  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Councils to provide IT courses  at  the\r\n\r\nlocal community level.  But I should caution against wasteful\r\n\r\nduplication  of  having  too many  IT  centres  in  the  same\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me just conclude by stating that the\r\n\r\nsetting up of this Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is a step\r\n\r\nin  the  right  direction in helping our workers  imbibe  the\r\n\r\nculture  of  continuous learning.  This  is  a  bold  way  to\r\n\r\nsupport   our  people  against  the  pitfalls  of  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment already experienced by many developed countries.\r\n\r\nThis is a positive way to help our workers and our economy to\r\n\r\nbe  even more competitive.  We are fully aware that if we are\r\n\r\nnot  competitive, we will not be able to generate enough jobs\r\n\r\nfor  our people.  We will have unemployment.  Even if we  are\r\n\r\ncompetitive  as  an  economy, but if many  of  our  unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers  become  unemployable as  we  move  deeper  into  the\r\n\r\nKnowledge-Based  Economy,  we  will  face  the  problems   of\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment due to the mismatch  of  skills  and\r\n\r\njobs.  So this new Fund, as provided in the Bill for which it\r\n\r\nis debated today in our first sitting in this new millennium,\r\n\r\nis  a  very important vehicle which will lead Singapore  well\r\n\r\ninto the 21st century.  It could help our workers to level up\r\n\r\nin  terms  of income so that they can continue to enjoy  high\r\n\r\nquality  of  life  and  thus  maintain  social  cohesion   in\r\n\r\nSingapore in years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the European\r\n\r\nCommission made a report in November last year that within 10\r\n\r\nyears,  80% of the technology in use today will be  outdated.\r\n\r\nThis means that if nothing is done, only 20% of the workforce\r\n\r\nwill have the skills and knowledge to keep a job.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.22 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not train and upgrade workers, 80% of the\r\n\r\npresent workforce will not have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe skills and knowledge to master new technology.  This will\r\n\r\naffect  our ability to maintain full employment and meet  our\r\n\r\nsocial   objectives.   There  could  be  massive   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment accompanied by major social problems.  I am sure\r\n\r\nnone of us want to see that happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill because it will contribute to\r\n\r\nenhancing  the employability of workers, and I fully  support\r\n\r\nfull employment to be part of the economic and social agenda.\r\n\r\nEconomic  growth must also meet social objectives.  The  best\r\n\r\nsocial  safety  net any worker can expect is a  decent  good-paying job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is crafted in general terms and does not have\r\n\r\ndetails on how it works.  As the Minister has explained, most\r\n\r\nof the details will be in the form of regulations.  So I will\r\n\r\njust  speak  in general terms and hope that the Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe advisory council that will be formed will take up some of\r\n\r\nthe comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, training and learning is a shared responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe   Government,  the  employer,  the  community   and   the\r\n\r\nindividual  all  have a part to play.  The  establishment  of\r\n\r\nthis Endowment Fund should not result in the reduction of the\r\n\r\nshared  responsibility.   The aim of  lifelong  learning  and\r\n\r\ntraining  should be to contribute to the continued well-being\r\n\r\nof  everyone in our society.  We should see lifelong learning\r\n\r\nas  a  continuous  process that takes place throughout  one's\r\n\r\nworking  life.   We  should  also have  to  learn  from  real\r\n\r\nexperiences  at  work and life.  It is beyond the  occasional\r\n\r\nbut useful spurt of training in classrooms or elsewhere.   In\r\n\r\nthat  light,  I support the fund being used in  research  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  learning methods and in  the  technology  of\r\n\r\ndelivery mechanisms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best approach to ensure that future demands for\r\n\r\nskills are met is for employers to invest in training as part\r\n\r\nof  workplace  learning.  I hope this  Bill  will  not  shift\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  training  totally  to  workers   because\r\n\r\nworkers  will have access to this Fund.  Employers will  have\r\n\r\nto continue to invest in education, training\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  development of their employees.  This Fund should be  an\r\n\r\nadditional  support  for  workers complementing  the  various\r\n\r\nexisting  Government  and employers' schemes  in  place  now.\r\n\r\nThese schemes include the Skills Redevelopment Programme, the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development Fund, etc.  The objects and  applications\r\n\r\nof income of the Fund in clause 5 is crafted in language that\r\n\r\nis  so  broad that I think we need some reassurance  on  this\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the individual, lifelong learning will need an\r\n\r\nelement of self-direction and self-management.  People of all\r\n\r\nages  and  all  backgrounds  will have  to  embrace  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning,  otherwise  we  will all lose  life  skills.   Some\r\n\r\nworkers will need more support to successfully achieve  this.\r\n\r\nThe 2000 Population Census shows that older and less educated\r\n\r\nworkers  have greater risks of facing unemployment.   I  will\r\n\r\nadd that the physically disabled also need special attention.\r\n\r\nThese  people  need training most, but they  also  have  many\r\n\r\nimpediments to take up training.  The lower income group find\r\n\r\nit  difficult  to  find time to go for training.   They  earn\r\n\r\nlittle.   Their  incomes are now dropping  due  to  new  work\r\n\r\norganisation  of outsourcing and contracting.  Older  workers\r\n\r\nwho  are facing job insecurity will need to continue to  work\r\n\r\nas  they  live  longer.  These groups will  have  to  embrace\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning and I ask that special extra attention  be\r\n\r\npaid to these groups of people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a little concerned about clause 4(5) of this\r\n\r\nBill.   The clause says that any diminution in the  value  of\r\n\r\nthe  capital money has to be made good from the income of the\r\n\r\nFund.   This  could  happen  if there  are  wrong  investment\r\n\r\ndecisions  made or there is a general economic downturn.   If\r\n\r\nthere  is  a wrong investment, I do not think workers  should\r\n\r\nsuffer.   In  an  economic  downturn  particularly,  in  fact\r\n\r\nworkers  would  need  more  help and  they  would  need  more\r\n\r\ntraining.   From  this Fund itself, in an economic  downturn,\r\n\r\nthe  returns will be less.  With this reduced income,  trying\r\n\r\nto make good the capital means that workers will be affected,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers  will  suffer.  I hope that the  desire  to  maintain\r\n\r\ncapital  money  will  not  be  at  the  expense  of  workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore  extra  money will be found  when  it  is  actually\r\n\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I ask the Government to give money from the\r\n\r\nFund  to  individuals as in CPF, for use of training  in  new\r\n\r\nareas  not  provided by the employers and which  may  not  be\r\n\r\ndirectly  related  to their present job or funded  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis  idea is not new.  It was raised by many Members in this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  by my colleagues in the unions.  It is  to  start\r\n\r\nwhat  you  call a skills-save account similar to the Medisave\r\n\r\naccount  in  CPF.   This is basically for  workers  to  learn\r\n\r\ncontinuously and to live more fulfilling lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Minister of State without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State without Portfolio (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the outset, may I say that I completely\r\n\r\nsupport  what  the  Minister has said in his  Second  Reading\r\n\r\nspeech  and  I  am also in complete agreement  with  what  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues, Mr Hawazi and Mr Thomas, have said before me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries, subsidised education is given to the\r\n\r\nyoung only.  Once the young people leave school, they are  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own.  As adults, they have to find their own resources\r\n\r\nto  extend their learning.  Our system was also like this  in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  But as the Minister reminded us, we have  changed\r\n\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change came with the Skills Development Fund\r\n\r\nwhich   was  set  up  in  1979.   Then  came  various   other\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  the latest of which are the Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  and the NTUC Education and Training  Fund.   These\r\n\r\nprogrammes  work on the premise that learning does  not  stop\r\n\r\nafter  one  leaves school.  Learning is necessary  throughout\r\n\r\none's lifetime, and should be encouraged and subsidised, just\r\n\r\nas  we  encourage and subsidise our children to go to school.\r\n\r\nIt is a very fundamental\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchange in the way we should think about education, and it  is\r\n\r\na very profound change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund Bill confirms that\r\n\r\nour  Government will make lifelong learning a lasting reality\r\n\r\nfor  our  workers.  Our union leaders and members are excited\r\n\r\nabout  the possibilities it offers.  They have waited eagerly\r\n\r\nfor  the Fund to be implemented since it was announced by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister last year.  The Fund will help workers  learn\r\n\r\nnew  skills  to stay employable as the industries restructure\r\n\r\nand  business models change.  With a possible slowdown in our\r\n\r\neconomy  while the US economy takes a downturn,  it  is  even\r\n\r\nmore  urgent  for our workers to get help to  train  and  re-train.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers know, as the Minister pointed out, that\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning  is not an option but  a  necessity.   Our\r\n\r\nworkers  know that there are many opportunities for  them  to\r\n\r\nupgrade.   They know that training is important and that  the\r\n\r\ncourses  are  heavily subsidised.  Many of  the  courses  are\r\n\r\nmodular,  so  the  workers can break  up  the  training  into\r\n\r\ndifferent parts to suit their schedules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC Education and Training Fund was set up with an\r\n\r\ninitial  sum  of  $20  million.   It  has  received  so  many\r\n\r\napplications from union members for training grants  that  we\r\n\r\nhave to increase it now to $40 million.  This shows that many\r\n\r\nworkers  are keen to retrain and are actually doing something\r\n\r\nabout it for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we also hear that older workers are reluctant\r\n\r\nto  go  for  training.  Is that so?  In my  discussions  with\r\n\r\nunion leaders and members, I see that there is indeed such  a\r\n\r\nreluctance.   The  workers  agree  that  the  subsidies   are\r\n\r\ngenerous, but they think the barrier to entry is still  high.\r\n\r\nI  think  there are three basic reasons for this.  First,  is\r\n\r\nthe   loss  of  income.   Companies,  though  supportive   of\r\n\r\ntraining, will not send many workers for the longer  courses.\r\n\r\nIf the workers want to take up longer courses, they will have\r\n\r\nto  take  no pay leave, or even resign from their jobs.   The\r\n\r\nolder workers have heavier family\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommitments.  Many will feel the strain if they have to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir income for even just a few weeks.  Of course, there are\r\n\r\nclasses  conducted at night or on weekends.  But some workers\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  to  attend them because  they  will  lose  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to do overtime work to supplement their incomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, these are the workers who will benefit most from\r\n\r\nthe  training.   What the older workers  need  are  not  just\r\n\r\nsubsidised  courses,  but  also  some  help  to  cover  their\r\n\r\nhousehold expenses while they attend the courses.  Looking at\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  Sir, I am not sure whether the Lifelong  Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund  can be used to help the workers  cover  some\r\n\r\npart  of  their loss of income when they attend  courses.   I\r\n\r\nwould therefore like to ask the Minister whether the Fund can\r\n\r\nbe  used  in  this way, and if not, whether there  are  other\r\n\r\nmeans to help workers overcome this difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for their reluctance is their fear of\r\n\r\nthe  courses  themselves.  They are afraid that  they  cannot\r\n\r\nabsorb  the  lessons quickly enough, that they will  be  left\r\n\r\nbehind by their younger course mates, and that they will hold\r\n\r\nback  the classes because they are too slow.  These are  real\r\n\r\nfears.  Young people learn faster than older people, and they\r\n\r\nlearn in a different way.  Those of us who have children will\r\n\r\nhave  had enough humbling experiences learning with  them  to\r\n\r\nknow what I am talking about.  If we put 50 year olds side by\r\n\r\nside with 16 year olds in the polytechnic or ITE, we are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to get the same result from the two groups within  the\r\n\r\nsame  timeframe.  If we teach 50 year olds using a curriculum\r\n\r\ndesigned for 16 year olds, we will only discourage the  older\r\n\r\nworkers from joining the courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need is a better understanding of the\r\n\r\nmethodology to teach older adults.  We then need to structure\r\n\r\nthe  courses meant for them accordingly.  Here, the  Bill  is\r\n\r\nvery  clear.  Clause 5(2)(b) allows the Fund to  be  used  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  research or development in or of  the  learning\r\n\r\nmethods and technology to enhance the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nacquisition, development or upgrading of skills and expertise\r\n\r\nto enhance employability.  In other words, how to teach older\r\n\r\nworkers more effectively.  Or more importantly, how to design\r\n\r\ntraining so that the older workers will feel comfortable  and\r\n\r\nwill enjoy the training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of older workers, I urge the Minister to give\r\n\r\ntop priority to using the Fund for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason for reluctance to go for training and\r\n\r\nwork  in  a  new  area  is the fear of  being  penalised  for\r\n\r\nmistakes made while the worker is new to the new job.   Older\r\n\r\nworkers who are in a job for a long time gain experience  and\r\n\r\nknowledge.  They become experts in their fields.  Their peers\r\n\r\nand subordinates look up to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they retrain and enter a new area, they start from\r\n\r\nsquare  one  like  everyone else, including those  junior  to\r\n\r\nthem.  They lose status and influence, which they may not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  regain.   If  they  make  mistakes,  they  may   be\r\n\r\npenalised.   Worse  still,  if  they  cannot  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nretraining or the new job, they may become unwanted.  So some\r\n\r\nworkers  would rather stay in the old job until  it  is  made\r\n\r\nredundant,  and then move on to another company  and  do  the\r\n\r\nsame  job  all over again because they are good at that  job.\r\n\r\nThey  are afraid that their attempt to try something new  may\r\n\r\nbackfire  on them.  But the fact is if they refuse  to  learn\r\n\r\nnew skills, their industry may simply disappear and they will\r\n\r\nbe left far behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem the Fund alone cannot solve. But\r\n\r\nthere  is  a solution.  The employers must do their  part  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  training and transition easier  for  the  workers.\r\n\r\nAllow  me  to  tell  you how one factory helped  a  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers  change from using a manual process to a computerised\r\n\r\none.   It  is  a real story and it happened in  Wing  Tai,  a\r\n\r\ngarment  factory.  In the factory, a group of ladies manually\r\n\r\nlaid out paper patterns on the cloth and cut out the required\r\n\r\nshapes.   They  had  to squeeze the patterns  as  closely  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  minimise wasting of cloth and  had  to  cut  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible to keep\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  sewing  line going.  They were very good in  their  jobs\r\n\r\nbecause they were very experienced at it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, no human being can beat a computerised\r\n\r\nmachine  when it comes to squeezing patterns closely together\r\n\r\nand cutting quickly.  So the company decided to automate, and\r\n\r\nasked  the ladies to train to operate this new machine.   The\r\n\r\nladies tendered their resignation.  They would rather  go  to\r\n\r\nanother  factory  to lay out the patterns  manually  than  to\r\n\r\nlearn  how  to operate the new machine.  They were afraid  of\r\n\r\nfailure.  It was not worth their while to try.  But the  boss\r\n\r\nwas  creative.   He  told the ladies:   \"Well,  you  wish  to\r\n\r\nresign?   OK.  From now on, consider that you have  resigned,\r\n\r\nconsider that you are no more with my company.  You are  free\r\n\r\nto  go.\"  Then he told them, \"Now that you have resigned, you\r\n\r\nhave to look for a new job.  But since you have time, why not\r\n\r\ntry  out  this  machine anyway?  Every day you  turn  up  for\r\n\r\ntraining, I will pay you.  Anytime you want to give up,  just\r\n\r\ntake  your  pay and walk out.  You can do that, because  from\r\n\r\nnow  on you are not my staff.  I cannot punish you.  I cannot\r\n\r\ndo  anything to you.\"  The ladies stayed on to learn  on  the\r\n\r\nnew  machine.  After a few days, they decided not  to  resign\r\n\r\nanymore.  And in fact, they became very skilled with the  new\r\n\r\nmachine, and became far more productive than before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of the story is: Workers fear change. They\r\n\r\nfear  being  penalised.  They fear the loss  of  self-esteem.\r\n\r\nEmployers can and must help the workers remove this fear.  My\r\n\r\nmessage  to  employers  is:  Please do  not  just  blame  the\r\n\r\nworkers  for not trying.  Please make it easier for  them  to\r\n\r\ntry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a Part 2 to this Wing Tai story. Not long\r\n\r\nafter  the  company has automated their cloth  cutting,  they\r\n\r\nfound  that  the costs were still too high in Singapore.   So\r\n\r\nthey  closed  down the production line and shifted  it  to  a\r\n\r\nlower  cost  country nearby.  And the ladies had to  be  laid\r\n\r\noff.   Before  we  think that all the training  on  them  was\r\n\r\nwasted, actually there is a happy ending to this story.   The\r\n\r\nthree of them got together and started\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  own company to do garment alterations.  They  put  all\r\n\r\ntheir  previous training, knowledge and experience into  very\r\n\r\ngood  use.   And they are no longer workers; they are  bosses\r\n\r\nand  owners of their own company.  And the Wing Tai boss told\r\n\r\nme that these ladies are doing quite good business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the next moral of the story is this: Even with\r\n\r\nretraining,  the  industries  continue  to  restructure   and\r\n\r\nindustries   can  disappear.   Our  workers  must  constantly\r\n\r\nretrain,  be  prepared  to adapt and make  full  use  of  the\r\n\r\nlearning opportunities to improve their own prospects in  the\r\n\r\nchanging circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many older workers have low educational\r\n\r\nqualification.  Because they have lower education, they  have\r\n\r\nlower income.  Because they have lower income, they are  less\r\n\r\nable  to  afford a loss of income when they go for  training.\r\n\r\nBecause  they  cannot attend the training, they  remain  less\r\n\r\nqualified.  This is the \"circle of disadvantage\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is a bold and\r\n\r\nconcrete  measure that can break the circle of  disadvantage.\r\n\r\nLet  us lower the barrier of entry for training.  Let us find\r\n\r\nbetter methods to make training effective and enjoyable.  Let\r\n\r\nus  help  them  overcome their fears.  Let our older  workers\r\n\r\ngain  new  knowledge and skills that will bring  them  higher\r\n\r\nincomes.   And  with  higher incomes,  they  will  have  more\r\n\r\nsavings,  then  they can take on courses of longer  duration.\r\n\r\nAnd  then  they will acquire better knowledge, and they  will\r\n\r\nlearn  more complex skills and take on yet higher level jobs.\r\n\r\nThis is the \"circle of opportunity\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us use the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to break\r\n\r\nthe  \"circle  of disadvantage\", and turn it into  a  lifelong\r\n\r\n\"circle of opportunity\" for all our workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we all know that with money, time and  energy,\r\n\r\nmany things can be done. But\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  people often feel that they have not enough  time,  not\r\n\r\nenough money, and not enough energy, and so they could not do\r\n\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the dialogue sessions with our workers, I observe\r\n\r\nthat  many  young workers are not willing to go for  training\r\n\r\nbecause  they claim that they do not have enough time.   They\r\n\r\nwant  to  spend their time working overtime in order to  earn\r\n\r\nmore  money.  In the meantime, the middle-aged workers  would\r\n\r\nsay  that they have family commitments, and not enough money.\r\n\r\nAs  for  the older workers, they have time and money, but  no\r\n\r\nenergy  to  go for training.  On the other hand, the  workers\r\n\r\nwho  are undergoing training have money, time, and energy  to\r\n\r\nundergo all the training that they want.  So the crux of  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is the workers must understand that whether they  are\r\n\r\nold,  middle-aged or young, they do have the time, money  and\r\n\r\nenergy to undergo some training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is the\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of  the  Government's  re-affirmation  of  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of lifelong learning.  Whether you are old, young  or\r\n\r\nmiddle-aged,  you can always find time, money and  energy  to\r\n\r\nundergo some form of training.  As a matter of fact, lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning  is not a new expression that emerges with  the  New\r\n\r\nEconomy.  When we are young, we must learn.  We must keep  on\r\n\r\nlearning  for  so long as we are alive. For my generation  of\r\n\r\nChinese-educated  Singaporeans,  we  learnt  in  school   the\r\n\r\nChinese  phonetic symbols, English, computers,  Hanyu  Pinyin\r\n\r\nand  the  Internet.  So if we do not carry  on  learning  and\r\n\r\nmaking ourselves relevant to the times, we will be the losers\r\n\r\nfor the rest of our lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, successful businessmen all know that the\r\n\r\nmarketplace is like a battlefield.  They learn and adapt  the\r\n\r\nvarious  strategies from Sun Tze.  So they all learn and  win\r\n\r\nall  life long.  We must inject this spirit into the  concept\r\n\r\nof lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good that we have this Bill before us. I support\r\n\r\nthis Bill.  But there are two points I wish to raise with the\r\n\r\nMinister for his clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in this Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, the\r\n\r\nstress is on enhanced employability.  That is the emphasis  - enhanced  employability.  So the emphasis is on skills.   But\r\n\r\nthere  is no mention of the word \"knowledge\" in the Bill.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  lifelong learning should not be confined  to  the\r\n\r\nskills  level.   It should also be extended to the  knowledge\r\n\r\nlevel  so  that  when  we encourage Singaporeans  to  go  for\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning,  aside from skills enhancement,  we  also\r\n\r\nencourage  them to enhance their knowledge.  To acquire  more\r\n\r\nknowledge, we must teach people not only how to do a job  but\r\n\r\nhow to be a man.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, older people have this worry\r\n\r\nthat  after  Singapore becomes  globalised, they  would  lose\r\n\r\ntheir jobs, as there may not be jobs for them to do.  So this\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning Endowment Fund Bill is a shot in  the  arm\r\n\r\nfor  them  so that they will be able to learn more skills  to\r\n\r\nmake it easier for them to secure jobs. It is very painful to\r\n\r\nhave  the  skills  without a job.  So I  feel  that  when  we\r\n\r\nsubsidise these older people for training, we have to be more\r\n\r\nliberal with their choice of training programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the language of instruction, it should not\r\n\r\nbe confined to English only.  The Ministry of Manpower should\r\n\r\nalso have a package so that these older people would be given\r\n\r\nsome kind of special treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must teach every Singaporean not only how to do a job\r\n\r\nbut  also  how to be a man.  It has been observed that  while\r\n\r\nmost of our young people can do their job very well there are\r\n\r\nmany  who  do  not  know how to conduct themselves  properly.\r\n\r\nThey are very strong in their jobs but when they are facing a\r\n\r\ncrisis and handling human relations, marriage and parenthood,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  so strong.  We must have some programmes  for\r\n\r\nsocial  and personal cultivation to teach them how  to  be  a\r\n\r\nman.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there is no specific\r\n\r\nexplanation on the cost of setting up the infrastructure.  We\r\n\r\nknow that we are aiming at all Singaporeans, including people\r\n\r\nliving in HDB estates.  So the best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplaces would be the CCCs, the CCs and the RCs.  In order  for\r\n\r\nthese  CCs  and  RCs  to  be  able to  make  available  their\r\n\r\nfacilities,  they will have to find money.  If they  have  to\r\n\r\nraise funds for such facilities, then it would slow down  the\r\n\r\nprocess.   For  example, if a community centre  or  community\r\n\r\nclub wants to start computer classes, they will have to raise\r\n\r\nfunds  of  $10,000,  $100,000  or  whatever.   To  cater  for\r\n\r\nNational Education, all the basic infrastructure costs should\r\n\r\nbe subsidised.  I also suggest that in assessing applications\r\n\r\nfor  subsidies, they should also allow the residents to enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  benefits under the Skills Development Fund.  We all know\r\n\r\nof  the song \"We must slog in order to win\", but I think when\r\n\r\nyou  slog you may not necessarily win.  So in order  to  win,\r\n\r\nthey must have new skills and new knowledge.  They must learn\r\n\r\nnew  skills  and new knowledge so that they will be  able  to\r\n\r\nwin.  So we must learn in order to win.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, in principle, I support the\r\n\r\nBill, but I have many concerns in regard to the provisions in\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3(2), it is noted that \"The Minister shall\r\n\r\nbe  responsible for the administration of the Endowment  Fund\r\n\r\nand  that  the Fund shall be regarded as a Government  Fund\".\r\n\r\nOne  would  think  that since the Fund shall comprise  mainly\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  money  and  public  donations,  there  should  be\r\n\r\ncomplete  accountability and transparency in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Fund.  This can be achieved only if the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the  Fund  can  be  carried  out  by   an\r\n\r\nindependent  body.  As the Bill now stands, all payments  out\r\n\r\nof  the Fund is dependent only on the decision of one  man  - the  Minister - who is a PAP member.  I think that this  kind\r\n\r\nof administration of the Fund is not satisfactory.  I propose\r\n\r\nthat  it  be  administered by an independent body,  which,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest,  can comprise respectable and well-known  people  in\r\n\r\nour community without any political affiliations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of this independent body shall be to disburse\r\n\r\nthe income of the Fund\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbased entirely on merit and not on any political preferences.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I note that there is nowhere in the Bill  that\r\n\r\nsays that the income of the Endowment Fund shall be paid  out\r\n\r\nbased entirely on the merits of the applicants.  As the  Bill\r\n\r\nnow stands, what is there to stop the income of the Fund from\r\n\r\nbeing  distributed  to  only  people  who  support  the  PAP?\r\n\r\nSupporters of the opposition, I think, shall have no ghost of\r\n\r\na chance to enjoy any of the benefits of the Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Community Improvement Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee  (CIPC)  funds readily comes to  mind.   Taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney  that is controlled by the CIPC has, in the main,  only\r\n\r\nbeen  disbursed to PAP-controlled constituencies.   The  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil at Potong Pasir, which is opposition-controlled,  has\r\n\r\nnot  been given one cent of the CIPC funds, although  it  has\r\n\r\nrequested for it many times.  Similarly, my fear is that  the\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund, which is a public fund, without  independent\r\n\r\ncontrol, shall be made use of mainly for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nPAP rather than for the general good of the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5(1) states the objects for which the income of\r\n\r\nthe  Endowment Fund shall be used.  They are to benefit  only\r\n\r\n\"persons\".  I wonder why the word \"persons\" is used  and  not\r\n\r\n\"workers\".  This gives the impression that the Endowment Fund\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want to benefit the workers but rather is confined\r\n\r\nto  certain  hand-picked persons only.   The  word  \"workers\"\r\n\r\nshould be substituted for the word \"persons\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 concerns the Advisory Council. I notice that\r\n\r\nvery  little  is  said of the Advisory Council.   Nothing  is\r\n\r\nmentioned  of  its number or composition.  I hope,  like  the\r\n\r\nCIPC, the Advisory Council is not going to be packed with PAP\r\n\r\nMPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill talks about the capital money of\r\n\r\nthe  Endowment Fund but there is no mention of a fixed amount\r\n\r\nthat  is to be placed as capital in the Endowment Fund.   Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister please give an indication as to the amount to be\r\n\r\nallocated as capital for this Endowment Fund?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first I would\r\n\r\nlike  to thank Mr Hawazi and the other hon. Members who spoke\r\n\r\nin  support  of the Bill, including, I notice, Mr  Chiam  See\r\n\r\nTong,  who  expressed  his in-principle support  although  he\r\n\r\nraised several questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to thank the Members for making various\r\n\r\nsuggestions, particularly about the type of training  or  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  training and the way to deliver training  to  the\r\n\r\nolder  workers.  These are suggestions and issues which  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be  taken  into consideration  when  the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil is convened to study various proposals for the use of\r\n\r\nthe Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will respond to the various comments as they were\r\n\r\nmade.   First, Mr Hawazi suggested that the Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment   Fund  should  work  together  with   the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP) and the Skills Development Fund\r\n\r\n(SDF),  and  not  to  compete  with  them  but,  rather,   to\r\n\r\ncomplement  what is already being done through  the  SRP  and\r\n\r\nSDF.   I  agree  with him.  That is in fact the intention  of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund:  to  provide\r\n\r\nmore  resources which could be used to complement the  budget\r\n\r\nallocations  for programmes such as the Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme,  and  also to provide additional support  for  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development  Fund in providing  training  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading opportunities for workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also suggested that the Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund should provide support for CCCs or  community\r\n\r\nclubs  and maybe even Community Development Council-initiated\r\n\r\nprogrammes for skills upgrading.  I agree with him.  This  is\r\n\r\none  of the things that we will be looking into, how to  work\r\n\r\nwith  community organisations that want to play a very active\r\n\r\nrole  in  offering  skills  upgrading  opportunities  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, a project that I mentioned in my Second Reading\r\n\r\nspeech  -  the National IT Literacy Programme - is  something\r\n\r\nthat  was  conceived  along this line where  the  Government,\r\n\r\nthrough the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, would work\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntogether  with community groups to offer basic IT skills  and\r\n\r\nInternet skills training to people who lack such skills.   So\r\n\r\nwe  are  in fact going to work closely with various community\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Mr Hawazi emphasised that the priority for\r\n\r\nthe Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund should still remain with\r\n\r\nthe  lower-skilled  because this is the group  that  is  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable,  although he also mentioned that  we  should  not\r\n\r\noverlook the needs of the better-skilled, who will also  face\r\n\r\nthe danger of retrenchments in an economic downturn.  I agree\r\n\r\nwith  him.   We  will continue to focus our efforts  and  our\r\n\r\nresources  on the lower-educated, lower-skilled Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nparticularly the older workers.  For this group,  we  already\r\n\r\nhave  a  very wide range of training courses available  under\r\n\r\ndifferent   programmes,  such  as  the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme, the National Skills Recognition System,  Strategic\r\n\r\nManpower Conversion Programme, etc.  For instance, under  the\r\n\r\nSRP,  we have more than 20 industry sectors covered where  we\r\n\r\nare  actually offering training for workers in these sectors.\r\n\r\nThese include electronics, hotel, marine, telecommunications,\r\n\r\ntaxi, healthcare, insurance, cleaning and even childcare.  We\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  expand the list so  that  more  and  more\r\n\r\nindustry sectors are covered and the needs of workers in each\r\n\r\nof these sectors will be catered to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked that employers should be encouraged to put\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are at risk of being retrenched  or  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched  on  to programmes such as the  SRP  and  for  the\r\n\r\nLifelong Learning Endowment Fund to support these workers and\r\n\r\ntheir  employers.  This is, in fact, one of the ways in which\r\n\r\nwe  are  encouraging employers to take advantage or  to  make\r\n\r\nfull use of the SRP in helping workers who are vulnerable  to\r\n\r\nretrenchment.  We persuade employers, who are in the  process\r\n\r\nof  having  to  downsize,  to send  their  workers  for  such\r\n\r\ntraining  long  before they actually have to  be  retrenched,\r\n\r\nwhich means that they will be given an opportunity to acquire\r\n\r\na new skill or to upgrade\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir old skills so that it is easier for them, when it comes\r\n\r\nto  the  actual day of retrenchment, to go out there to  look\r\n\r\nfor  a  new  job.   The encouragement that  we  give  to  the\r\n\r\nemployers  is  a very substantial cash subsidy, the  absentee\r\n\r\npayroll,  while their workers are sent away for training  and\r\n\r\nwe  also  bear  up  to  almost all  of  the  training  costs,\r\n\r\ndepending on the age of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for workers who are better educated, such as\r\n\r\npolytechnic  and  university  graduates,  they  have  already\r\n\r\nenjoyed  a  headstart in the skills race,   compared  to  the\r\n\r\nolder   lower  educated  workers.  They  have  also  received\r\n\r\nsubstantial Government subsidy in their higher education,  so\r\n\r\nthey  should  therefore take a higher  responsibility  and  a\r\n\r\nhigher  proportion of the cost of upgrading their skills.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  this context, many employers are also continuing\r\n\r\nto  provide their better educated workers with employer-based\r\n\r\nupgrading  and  training.  We have  also  raised  the  skills\r\n\r\ndevelopment levy ceiling from $1,000 to $1,500 in  July  last\r\n\r\nyear and we will continue to gradually adjust this ceiling up\r\n\r\nto  $2,000.  By raising the skills development levy  ceiling,\r\n\r\nwe  are,  in  fact, enabling the Skills Development  Fund  to\r\n\r\ncollect  more  money which can then be used to  provide  more\r\n\r\ntraining opportunities.  As the ceiling has been raised  from\r\n\r\n$1,000  to  $1,500, and progressively to $2,000, we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to extend more training support and assistance to  even\r\n\r\npolytechnic  graduates who are presently  not  fully  covered\r\n\r\nunder  the  skills development levy. So there  will  be  more\r\n\r\nopportunities made available for this group of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a principle, Government's support for the higher\r\n\r\neducated group would have to be focused on specific areas  of\r\n\r\ncritical  industry and skills requirement, rather  than  just\r\n\r\nbroad-based  support, such as fee subsidy  or  allowance  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  sign up for all kinds of postgraduate  courses.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to be very selective because these are people who  have\r\n\r\nalready benefited from a high level of Government subsidy  in\r\n\r\ntheir tertiary education and for an additional upgrading to a\r\n\r\nhigher degree, we have to be very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nselective.   Only  when we are sure that  this  will  make  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  difference to our economic competitiveness  will\r\n\r\nwe be able to provide some form of support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing is that we are currently working\r\n\r\ntowards   increasing  the  capacity  or   opportunities   for\r\n\r\ncontinuing education and training for the diploma and  degree\r\n\r\nholders.   But  it  would have to be in  very  selective  and\r\n\r\neconomically  critical disciplines and courses which  can  be\r\n\r\nmade  available at our universities and polytechnics and also\r\n\r\nthe  ITE.  If you have read today's newspapers, there is also\r\n\r\na  possibility of having a fourth university.  If that  comes\r\n\r\nabout,  it would make it even easier for polytechnic  diploma\r\n\r\nholders  who  want  to upgrade themselves.   They  will  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  a fourth university, which will offer  affordable\r\n\r\ncourses  for them to upgrade.  They do not have to either  go\r\n\r\noverseas to upgrade or try to find one of the limited  places\r\n\r\nin  NUS or NTU.  Let me assure him that we will also consider\r\n\r\nhow  we  can extend the assistance to the better educated  in\r\n\r\nthis  process of lifelong learning.  But at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  we  must  have  our priority, and as  the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nhimself  stated,  the  priority  should  be  with  the  lower\r\n\r\neducated  and the less skilled workers because they  are  the\r\n\r\nmost vulnerable group now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas has expressed concern whether, with the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, it would\r\n\r\nshift the responsibility of skills upgrading and training  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and relieve the employers of their  traditional\r\n\r\nresponsibility of training their workers.  Let me assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  this  should not be the case.  I agree  that  employer-based  training is, in fact, the most important and effective\r\n\r\nform  of  skills upgrading because training provided  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers will definitely be relevant to their jobs  and  the\r\n\r\nskills  much  needed in the marketplace. We will continue  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  the importance of employer-based training  in  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes which we will develop and evolve for the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning  Endowment Fund.  I would like to  assure  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  that it is not our intention to undermine this  nexus\r\n\r\nbetween employers and employees in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nterms of training and skills upgrading, but our intention  is\r\n\r\nto  supplement and strengthen this relationship so that  more\r\n\r\nand more employers will be willing to go out of their way, if\r\n\r\nnecessary, to provide training and skills upgrading to  their\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so, the programmes that we will craft for the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning  Endowment Fund will, as  I  mentioned  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  Mr  Hawazi,  complement  the  existing   Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  programme  and  the  Manpower  Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme,  and because of the additional  resources\r\n\r\nthat  are  now  available, we will open up more opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  the workers.  In the future, when the budget allocations\r\n\r\nfor  the  Skills  Redevelopment Programme  and  the  Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment Assistance Scheme run down, we can then  use  the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning  Endowment  Fund's  stream  of  income  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to sustain this programme so that lifelong  efforts\r\n\r\nwill continue unabated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also raised a specific point concerning clause\r\n\r\n4(5)  where  it  states that if there is a reduction  in  the\r\n\r\ncapital  sum  in the Fund, then before we spend  any  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture  income, we should make good this loss.  He also  said\r\n\r\nthat  if we do so, we should not do it at the expense of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  because  of  two possible scenarios  -  a  loss  in\r\n\r\ncapital  sum can happen in case of a bad investment  decision\r\n\r\nor  in  a  general economic downturn.  I agree with him  that\r\n\r\nyes,  this is a possibility.  We cannot dismiss it.  At  some\r\n\r\npoint  in  the future, from time to time, the Endowment  Fund\r\n\r\nmight actually suffer a capital loss. Should we make good the\r\n\r\ncapital  loss  before we start to spend the  future  revenues\r\n\r\nthat  come  later on?  I think the spirit of this  clause  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  make this effort before we start  to  spend\r\n\r\nfuture revenues.  Let me explain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not make up for the losses in the capital sum,\r\n\r\nover several cycles of losses over a period of time, we could\r\n\r\nseriously  diminish the amount of capital sum  available  and\r\n\r\nfuture incomes would also diminish.  Although we understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhy in a downturn workers need more training and therefore we\r\n\r\nshould  actually spend more money and not spend less,  if  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  do  it,  we  will, in effect, be  depriving  future\r\n\r\nworkers  of  opportunities for training.  In any  event,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are going to suffer.  Once you have a diminution  in\r\n\r\nthe  capital sum and you do not make up for it, the  question\r\n\r\nis:  should  the  current group of workers suffer  or  future\r\n\r\nworkers  suffer?  Our view is that we should try as  fast  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  make up for the losses in capital and  then  we\r\n\r\nresume funding programmes so that future workers do not  have\r\n\r\nto  suffer  the  losses.  I think this is a  wiser  and  more\r\n\r\nprudent approach over the long-term because the intention  of\r\n\r\nsetting up an Endowment Fund is to make sure that there is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing stream of income, which hopefully, over the years,\r\n\r\nwill  grow  and we can continue to support lifelong  learning\r\n\r\nactivities.    If  you allow the funds to  run  down  by  not\r\n\r\nmaking  up  for any capital losses, you are diminishing  this\r\n\r\nreturn  and, in the long run, that would not be good for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about a skills-save account and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  could consider this under the Lifelong  Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund.  Let me point out that, as I have  indicated\r\n\r\nin  my  Second Reading speech, the estimated income from  the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning  Endowment Fund in the initial  years  may\r\n\r\nonly  be  $20 million to start with, and even if we  reach  a\r\n\r\ntarget  of  $5  billion,  we only  have  $200  million.   The\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning  Endowment Fund is perhaps  not  the  best\r\n\r\nmeans to go about setting up the individual learning accounts\r\n\r\nfor  the workers because if we were to distribute this amount\r\n\r\nof  money  to all the workers, we will probably end  up  with\r\n\r\neach one getting less than $200 a year which will not make an\r\n\r\nimpact.   And by distributing this resource, we  may  not  be\r\n\r\nable to focus on much needed programmes to upgrade the skills\r\n\r\nof  workers  who are most vulnerable to retrenchment.  So  we\r\n\r\nshould  actually  harness this resource to  selectively  help\r\n\r\nworkers who are in greater risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao has given us a graphic account of how\r\n\r\nworkers  see lifelong learning and the kind of problems  that\r\n\r\nthey  face.   He mentioned three points, the first  point  is\r\n\r\nthat there is an obstacle confronting workers who want to  go\r\n\r\nfor  skills  upgrading. There is this concern about  loss  of\r\n\r\nincome.    Many  of  our  skills  upgrading  programmes   are\r\n\r\ndeveloped  with this concern in mind.  If you take  the  SRP,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, we provide up to 85% absentee payroll  subsidy\r\n\r\nand  up  to 100% course fee subsidy, depending on the age  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. For older workers, we contribute more. This  is\r\n\r\nto  help  employers to put their workers up for this kind  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes and not having to bear all the costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that if a worker is unemployed, then of\r\n\r\ncourse  it  is  even more difficult for him to  go  for  such\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading because he had already lost his job and  he\r\n\r\nhas  no income. It is precisely because of this concern  that\r\n\r\nwe  have set up programmes with self-help groups like  SINDA,\r\n\r\nMENDAKI  and  CDAC  to  identify these  self-help  groups  as\r\n\r\nsurrogate   employers.   We  have   also   identified   other\r\n\r\norganisations or associations as SRP facilitators. These  are\r\n\r\npeople  who  can help the unemployed by sponsoring  them  for\r\n\r\ntraining  under  the SRP and we will then provide  them  with\r\n\r\nboth the course fee subsidy and the training allowances.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, up to now, about 7,000 low-income workers who  have\r\n\r\nlost  their jobs, particularly during the downturn  of  1998,\r\n\r\nhad  managed  to  acquire better skills, qualifications,  and\r\n\r\nalso  had  their  skills upgraded under the SRP  through  the\r\n\r\nsurrogate  employers scheme.  Under that scheme, we  actually\r\n\r\nprovide  them with training, subsidise their course  fee  and\r\n\r\nalso a training allowance up to a maximum of about $500. With\r\n\r\nthat training allowance, we could help to defray some of  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure that the unemployed worker would need  to  incur.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  provide huge allowances which would  make  it  so\r\n\r\nattractive just to become a trainee, but we can help  workers\r\n\r\nwho  are out of job with some out-of-pocket expenses, so that\r\n\r\nduring that period they would not be in too great a financial\r\n\r\ndistress.  But it still depends on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe worker making the effort to come forward, sign up for the\r\n\r\nprogramme  and  to diligently attend the training  course  to\r\n\r\nqualify for his higher skill qualification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao also talked about the special needs for\r\n\r\nthe  training of adults.  This is, in fact, one of the  areas\r\n\r\nthat the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will be looking at.\r\n\r\nWe  understand  that training adults is quite different  from\r\n\r\ntraining the school-going cohort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we started the Bukit Merah Skill Development\r\n\r\nCentre,  we  were quite conscious of this.  And  one  of  the\r\n\r\nthings  was that if you look at the training manuals used  by\r\n\r\nthe  Bukit Merah Skill Development Centre, all the prints are\r\n\r\nextra large, much bigger than you would find in any textbook.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  is simple, because older workers have difficulty\r\n\r\nreading  fine  print.  So we had to have special  instruction\r\n\r\nmanuals  printed with huge print to make it easier for  older\r\n\r\nworkers  to read.  We are, in fact, quite conscious of  this.\r\n\r\nWith  the  establishment of the Lifelong  Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund, we now have resources to even better study the training\r\n\r\nmethods that will be most suitable for older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third point is that many workers, especially the\r\n\r\nolder  workers,  fear  making mistakes  during  the  training\r\n\r\ncourses.   I think it is human nature to fear mistakes.   But\r\n\r\nif  we  do  not make the effort to learn, then we will  never\r\n\r\nmake  any  progress.  And in the course of  trying  to  learn\r\n\r\nsomething  new, from time to time, we are bound to make  some\r\n\r\nmistakes.    My   response  would  be  that  employers   must\r\n\r\nunderstand this human nature, and in the way that they manage\r\n\r\ntheir  older  workers  and  in  the  way  they  motivate  and\r\n\r\nencourage  their older workers to go for training, they  must\r\n\r\nalways  be  patient;  they  must always  be  sympathetic  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding, especially when an older worker, in the course\r\n\r\nof  training,  were  to make mistakes.  In  fact,  he  learns\r\n\r\nthrough making mistakes.  Because he has made the mistake, he\r\n\r\nlearns  not to do it again, and he will learn how to  improve\r\n\r\nhis  performance  at  work.   So  employers  should  be  more\r\n\r\nsympathetic  and  understand that  older  workers  have  this\r\n\r\nspecial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  to  upgrade.   And  in the training  course,  they  may\r\n\r\noccasionally make some mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong asked whether the Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund would also support knowledge acquisition.   I\r\n\r\nmade it quite clear in my Second Reading speech that what  we\r\n\r\nare  looking for is both knowledge and skills.  The word  may\r\n\r\nnot have appeared in the text, but I have made it quite clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  spirit is to help Singaporeans to embark  on  this\r\n\r\nlifelong  journey  to  acquire higher  knowledge  and  better\r\n\r\nskills,  so  that  we  can  be  more  competitive  and   more\r\n\r\nproficient in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to social and personal needs, I think this\r\n\r\nis  a  separate area, whether young Singaporeans grow up into\r\n\r\nbalanced,  mature  adults and know all their responsibilities\r\n\r\nand  obligations  as an adult.  This is a  separate  area  of\r\n\r\neducation.   This is something that they would have  received\r\n\r\ngood  preparation during their schooling years.  And, in some\r\n\r\ncases,  through  some other kind of social interaction,  they\r\n\r\nshould acquire such skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund's focus must be on\r\n\r\nemployability.   We must focus on skills and  knowledge  that\r\n\r\nare  relevant  to  the needs of the labour  market.   As  the\r\n\r\neconomy  transits  into a knowledge-based  economy,  we  must\r\n\r\nincreasingly focus on the skills and knowledge that can  help\r\n\r\na  worker  hold and do a productive job in such  an  economy.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that should remain our focus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong also asked how the Fund would\r\n\r\ncooperate with grassroots organisations such as the CCs,  RCs\r\n\r\nand community clubs which want to set up training facilities.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  area which we should leave it to  the  advisory\r\n\r\ncouncil  to  consider when they deliberate on  the  programme\r\n\r\nthat  should  be  supported.  There will  certainly  be  some\r\n\r\nsupport,  because  we understand that if you,  for  instance,\r\n\r\nwant  to  introduce training under the national  IT  literacy\r\n\r\nprogramme,  you,  in fact, have to invest  in  computers  and\r\n\r\nsoftwares.   You have to set up some small computer  training\r\n\r\nfacilities.  You may need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three dozen computers.  And who is going to  finance\r\n\r\nthis?   We  will  look into how, under the Lifelong  Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund,  we can jointly support such  projects.   We\r\n\r\ncould work with the community organisations to establish such\r\n\r\ntraining  centres.  But, of course, somebody  else  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  we should avoid duplication.  We should make sure  that\r\n\r\nresources are not just wastefully duplicated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I just want to add one point, as I forgot to\r\n\r\nrespond  to  Mr  Hawazi  about  the  advisory  council.   Our\r\n\r\nintention  is  to make the advisory council an  all-embracing\r\n\r\ncouncil in terms of composition.  We will bring in the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  representatives.  We will have  employers  represented\r\n\r\nthere.  We will also have community organisations represented\r\n\r\nthere.   We will have industry groups represented there  and,\r\n\r\nof course, also Government agencies that are participating in\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading  and also steering the  economy.   So,  the\r\n\r\nadvisory council will represent a very wide cross-section  of\r\n\r\ninterests and concerns in the labour market and the  type  of\r\n\r\nskills that are required by the labour market.  In this  way,\r\n\r\nwe  can have good feedback, good effective evaluation of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  should  be  supported  under  the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to add another point at this juncture. We\r\n\r\nalso   welcome  proposals  and  initiatives  from   community\r\n\r\norganisations that want to come forward to join  us  in  this\r\n\r\neffort  to  reach  out to Singaporeans  in  helping  them  to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that leaves only Mr Chiam who queried why is it\r\n\r\nthat  only the Minister is responsible for the administration\r\n\r\nof  the Fund and not some independent organisation.  This  is\r\n\r\nan  Endowment  Fund set up by the Government specifically  to\r\n\r\nprovide  resources  for  training and  skills  upgrading  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   The Ministry of Manpower is  responsible  for\r\n\r\nmanpower  development.   That is why  the  responsibility  is\r\n\r\nplaced with the Ministry of Manpower and the Minister is made\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresponsible for the administration of the Fund.  It does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that the Minister himself is going to individually sign\r\n\r\nevery  cheque or approve every single payment.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nwill have, of course, under the normal operation, to delegate\r\n\r\nthe  duties that will set up the administration framework  to\r\n\r\nmonitor the returns and disbursements of all the money  under\r\n\r\nthe  Fund.   I  think  this is no different  from  the  other\r\n\r\nendowment funds, whether it is Edusave or MediFund, or as  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Hng  Kiang  mentioned earlier, the  Eldercare  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund.  This is a fairly standard provision.  So I do not  see\r\n\r\nwhy  he  should object to it.  This is actually  Government's\r\n\r\nbudget surplus.  So the Government has to be responsible  for\r\n\r\nit, as a trustee for the members of the public, the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants an independent body to administer and disburse\r\n\r\nthe  Fund.  Why is that necessary?  The Fund, of course, will\r\n\r\nbe  audited  and  proper  accounts  will  be  provided.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance will be the first to want to know if,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Fund  has  not  been properly  administered,  and\r\n\r\nsomebody  will  be held responsible.  In this case,  if  that\r\n\r\nhappens, the Minister for Manpower will be held responsible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expressed his concern that the Fund should only\r\n\r\nsupport activities on merit, because he talked about the Fund\r\n\r\ndisbursing  payments  to individuals  or  persons.   He  even\r\n\r\nobjected  to  the word \"person\".  A person can be  a  worker.\r\n\r\nWhat do you call somebody who is unemployed?  Is he a worker?\r\n\r\nHow  about  a  housewife  who  wants  to  go  back  into  the\r\n\r\nworkforce?  Do you call her a worker too?  Sir, I think he is\r\n\r\nbecoming  too narrow if he says that we should only  use  the\r\n\r\nword \"worker\" and not \"person\".  The word \"person\" is a wider\r\n\r\nterm.  From my perspective, it appropriately covers everybody\r\n\r\nwho  needs  training  in order to help  him  to  enhance  his\r\n\r\nemployability.  I am looking at housewives, for instance, who\r\n\r\nhave  left the job market for 10 years and now want to return\r\n\r\nto  work,  but  they need some training and new skills  which\r\n\r\nthey did not have.  So should we include or exclude them?  By\r\n\r\nhis definition, if we were to say that the Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund has got to be focused on workers,  then  this\r\n\r\ngroup  will not be eligible.  Is that good?  I do  not  think\r\n\r\nso.  I think we should extend support to women who want to re-enter  the workforce.  So the choice of the word by the legal\r\n\r\ndraftsman is quite appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained the advisory council. We\r\n\r\nintend to bring in people from the different sectors, so that\r\n\r\nwe  get  a  very  good and comprehensive feedback,  and  also\r\n\r\nobjective  evaluation.   The funds are  mostly  going  to  be\r\n\r\ndisbursed by way of support for specific programmes.  Let  me\r\n\r\nassure  all  Members that good ideas will not be  overlooked.\r\n\r\nIf  Members have any specific ideas about how they and  their\r\n\r\ncommunity organisations can play a part in promoting lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning  and  provide  their constituents  with  more  skill\r\n\r\nupgrading opportunities, please put your ideas to us  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  them examined by the Lifelong Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund  advisory council.   And if the idea is sound,  we  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely help you to put these ideas to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Mr Chiam missed my Second Reading speech,\r\n\r\nbecause he asked about the amount of the capital money.   The\r\n\r\nBill  does  not say anything about the actual  sum,  but  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, in his National Day Rally speech last  year,\r\n\r\nsaid   that  the  Fund  will  be  started  with  an   initial\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  $500 million from the Government,  and  the\r\n\r\nobjective  is to build it up over the years - of course,  the\r\n\r\ngood years when we have budget surpluses - to a target amount\r\n\r\nof   $5  billion.   The  expected  revenue  from  $5  billion\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund should be about $200 million.   And  I  think\r\n\r\nwith  $200  million,  we  can do quite  a  lot  in  terms  of\r\n\r\npromoting and supporting lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I have answered the\r\n\r\nquestions that have been raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year \"2000\" will be changed\r\n\r\nto \"2001\", as indicated in the Order Paper Supplement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 17 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CIVIL LIST</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil\r\n\r\nList and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule\r\n\r\nto that Act be varied by deleting the figure \"$1,757,700\", in\r\n\r\nthe second column and substituting the figure \"$2,232,000\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that an additional provision of $474,300\r\n\r\nbe  supported  for the Privy Purse under Class I expenditure.\r\n\r\nThis  represents  27% over the Privy Purse's budgeted  FY2000\r\n\r\nprovision of $1,757,700.

To this end, we are putting in place  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive,     diverse    and     pervasive     broadband\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  One key measure was the  mandating  of  open\r\n\r\naccess in our ADSL network. This allows more than one service\r\n\r\nprovider  to use the same copper infrastructure. Open  access\r\n\r\nhas  attracted  new  broadband ADSL  service  providers  like\r\n\r\nStarHub and Pacific Internet to offer broadband services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further open up new channels for broadband access, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  issuing  Fixed Wireless Broadband and  3G  wireless\r\n\r\nlicences in 2001.

That said, we are prepared to  work  with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant agencies in Indonesia to \"match make\" Indonesian and\r\n\r\nSingapore  investors and SMEs. The idea is for the Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  inform  us  of the sectors  where  there  are\r\n\r\npossible  investment  opportunities and  forward  a  list  of\r\n\r\npotential   Indonesian  partners.  We  can  then   facilitate\r\n\r\nmatching  these Indonesian companies and interested Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of the question:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S$1.2 billion economic assistance package will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be made available to Indonesia. The  package  is\r\n\r\nintrinsically  sound,  and there  have  been  some  cases  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   In   March  2000,  the  Government  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nInvestment   Corporation  participated  in  an  international\r\n\r\nconsortium,  led  by  Cycle  and  Carriage  (Singapore),   by\r\n\r\ninvesting US$76 million in Astra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foreign investors, however, make decisions based on\r\n\r\ncommercial considerations. Feedback from Singapore  companies\r\n\r\nand  financial institutions indicate that the general take-up\r\n\r\nrate  of the package is unlikely to improve until and  unless\r\n\r\nthe  domestic  political and economic situation in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nstabilises  and investor confidence returns.  Moreover,  with\r\n\r\ncountries  in Northeast Asia adopting aggressive policies  to\r\n\r\nattract  investments, investors will naturally  gravitate  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the economic package, we will continue to\r\n\r\nbuild  on our economic cooperation with Indonesia for  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit.  In January 1999, the West Natuna Gas Agreement  was\r\n\r\nconcluded  between  Singapore's Sembawang  Gas  Pte  Ltd  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  state-oil  company,  Pertamina.  This  deal   is\r\n\r\nexpected  to generate earnings of US$8 billion over 22  years\r\n\r\nand create employment for many Indonesians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NUMBER OF PERSONS HANGED</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

The third quarter Economic Survey\r\n\r\nof 2000 indicated that the sector has contracted by only 1.3%\r\n\r\nas  compared  to a decline of 14.2% in the third  quarter  of\r\n\r\n1999.   Despite the improved performance of the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  over the recent quarters, the construction industry\r\n\r\nis  still  sluggish. As a result, the employment in the  near\r\n\r\nfuture  is unlikely to grow.  In fact, overall employment  is\r\n\r\nprojected  to  decline in absolute numbers over  the  next  5\r\n\r\nyears.  This is partly due to efforts to reduce the number of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  in  the  construction  industry.   The  C21\r\n\r\nblueprint had recommended reduction of the man-year\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nentitlement (MYE) to 70% of the level in 1999 by 2005 and  to\r\n\r\n50%  in  2010, or earlier if practicable.  Based  on  a  more\r\n\r\ncautious  economic outlook for the sector, and  the  move  to\r\n\r\nreduce  MYE to raise productivity, the overall employment  in\r\n\r\nthe construction sector is likely to continue to decline over\r\n\r\nthe  next  5  years.  The decline in overall employment  will\r\n\r\nmainly  affect the low skilled workers (eg general  workers),\r\n\r\nmost of whom are foreign workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the decline in overall employment for the\r\n\r\nconstruction sector, some jobs will still be in demand in the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.  Manpower demand is projected to  grow\r\n\r\nfor   those   with   degree,   diploma   and   post-secondary\r\n\r\nqualifications.  In terms of manpower demand by  occupations,\r\n\r\nprofessionals, associated professionals and skilled craftsmen\r\n\r\nwill  emerge  as  the  fastest  growing  occupations  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  Specifically,  at  the  professional\r\n\r\nlevel,  the  jobs  in  demand include  project  managers  and\r\n\r\nengineers;  for  the associate professionals,  these  include\r\n\r\nforemen,  site supervisors and project coordinators;  as  for\r\n\r\nthe  skilled craftsmen, these include bricklayers, plasterers\r\n\r\nand carpenters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Efforts to Upgrade the Construction Workforce</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction 21 Blueprint also recognises the need\r\n\r\nto  upgrade the skills level of the construction workforce in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It has recommended a number of measures to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  professionalism in the industry and upgrade  the  skills\r\n\r\nlevel of construction workforce.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to raising professionalism, institutions of\r\n\r\nhigher learning will be introducing new modules and enhancing\r\n\r\nthe  tertiary curriculum for construction-related  fields  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  multi-disciplinary skills and strengthen cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween    professionals.    Professional    bodies,    trade\r\n\r\nassociations and the Construction Industry Training Institute\r\n\r\n(CITI) have continuing professional and technical development\r\n\r\nprogrammes  including harnessing Information Technology;  the\r\n\r\ndesign-and-build concepts; and buildable designs.   C21  also\r\n\r\nrecommended   making   Continuing  Professional   Development\r\n\r\nProgrammes  mandatory  for the renewal  of  professional  and\r\n\r\ntrade  membership.  The  Board  of  Architects,  Professional\r\n\r\nEngineers Board and the Construction Industry Joint Committee\r\n\r\n(CIJC) are taking steps to implement continuing education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To upgrade the skills of construction workers, BCA works\r\n\r\nclosely  with the industry to train construction workers  and\r\n\r\nreviews  training curriculum regularly to respond to industry\r\n\r\nneeds.  Since  1999,  BCA has also progressively  raised  the\r\n\r\nskill requirements for foreign construction workers who  come\r\n\r\nto work in Singapore.  Early last year, it included the trade-related  knowledge requirement for skilled  workers.  Arising\r\n\r\nfrom  these measures, the new construction workers that  come\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  to  work are generally of  higher  skills  and\r\n\r\nbetter  educated. There is also a proposal for multi-skilling\r\n\r\nrequirements  for  the construction workers.   MOM  has  also\r\n\r\nintroduced   the   100%   Basic  Skills   Certificate   (BSC)\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  construction workers  from  non-traditional\r\n\r\nsources.   As  a  result of such efforts, the  proportion  of\r\n\r\nforeign construction workers certified at SEC level is 65% as\r\n\r\nat November 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also put in place incentives to\r\n\r\nupgrade the skills of local workers. Local workers pay  lower\r\n\r\ntest fees at CITI for most of the main trades.  Employers can\r\n\r\nalso  enjoy  subsidies from the Skills  Development  Fund  of\r\n\r\nbetween 50% and 80% on the fees of many courses in CITI, such\r\n\r\nas  courses in \"Safety Construction Supervision\" and  \"Mobile\r\n\r\nCrane Operations\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conduct of Construction Skills Training Courses</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, construction-related training was carried\r\n\r\nout  by  the former VITB, which has been transformed  to  the\r\n\r\npresent ITE. In 1984, it was decided that a separate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstruction training institution be set up under the  former\r\n\r\nCIDB  so that a wide range of training and testing programmes\r\n\r\ncan  be  provided  to  meet  the needs  of  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry at one single location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Agency responsible for the construction industry,\r\n\r\nBCA  has the primary responsibility of training and upgrading\r\n\r\nthe  skills  of  construction  workforce  in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nConstruction Industry Training Institute (CITI), the training\r\n\r\narm  of BCA, has been responding to the training needs of the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.  However, BCA recognises that it alone\r\n\r\ncould  not provide all the training needs of the construction\r\n\r\nindustry. Hence, training is also carried out by the industry\r\n\r\nthrough  the Testing Centres in Singapore authorised  by  BCA\r\n\r\nand   other  training  institutions.  The  polytechnics  also\r\n\r\nprovide  training for the construction supervisors  and  sub-professionals. For foreign workers, most of them are  trained\r\n\r\nat  the  source  countries before  they  are  tested  at  the\r\n\r\nOverseas Testing Centres. Although construction training  and\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading  is a primary responsibility  of  BCA,  BCA\r\n\r\nsupports ITE conducting construction skills training  courses\r\n\r\nif ITE should decide to resume this activity again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NEW/RESALE FLATS SOLD</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment (a) how many new flats (breakdown by  flat  type)\r\n\r\nwere  sold  over  the  last  3 years;  (b)  how  many  resale\r\n\r\ntransactions (breakdown by flat type) were processed over the\r\n\r\n3 years; and (c) what are the pro-family policies or measures\r\n\r\ntaken by the Ministry to encourage Singaporeans to stay  near\r\n\r\ntheir relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The number of new flats sold in the last 3\r\n\r\nyears  in FY97, FY98 and FY99 were 33,300, 34,700 and  28,700\r\n\r\nrespectively.

For instance,\r\n\r\nsites  chosen for such use should not cause traffic  problems\r\n\r\nin  the  area  and  hence, it should not be  sited  at  major\r\n\r\ntraffic junctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, petrol station sites are confined mainly to\r\n\r\nareas  which are zoned Transport Facility in the Master Plan.\r\n\r\nMND/URA will be working with MTI to study the feasibility  of\r\n\r\nallowing more petrol pump facilities on suitable sites  which\r\n\r\nmeet fire safety and environmental requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What  are  the tender prices for land of petrol  kiosks from 1991 to 2000?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has released for sale 19 land parcels for petrol\r\n\r\nkiosks  development since 1991.

In 1999, two  sites\r\n\r\nwere  offered  for  sale but the response was  poor  and  the\r\n\r\ntender prices were well below the market value as assessed by\r\n\r\nthe Chief Valuer.

Petrol kiosks  can  be\r\n\r\nlocated  along expressways if the siting does not  compromise\r\n\r\nthe efficient operation of the expressways and the safety  of\r\n\r\nthe  public.   Hence,  they are commonly  found  along  rural\r\n\r\nexpressways in other countries. The expressways in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  actually  urban  expressways  with  close  intervals  of\r\n\r\ntraffic  interchanges, and they carry a very high  volume  of\r\n\r\nfast moving traffic.  The siting of a petrol kiosk along  our\r\n\r\nexpressways is likely to create traffic weaving problems  and\r\n\r\nhence,  compromise the safe and efficient  operation  of  our\r\n\r\nexpressway   system.   Therefore,  this  is  not  encouraged.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  there  is already sufficient provision  of  kiosks\r\n\r\nalong major arterial roads to meet the need of our motorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LOCAL FIRMS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  (a) what are the key initiatives implemented  to\r\n\r\nnurture local firms in the construction industry to be world-class  companies; (b) what are the benchmarks to monitor  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  these firms; and (c) whether there are  further\r\n\r\nplans  to strengthen the capabilities of local firms  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an open economy where both local and\r\n\r\nforeign  contractors  compete for our construction  projects.\r\n\r\nThis is also in accordance with our WTO obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of large foreign firms has provided the\r\n\r\ncompetitive pressure for local firms to upgrade and level  up\r\n\r\nover  the years. Many of the firms which were once family-run\r\n\r\nare  now  managed by professionally trained personnel.   Many\r\n\r\nare also listed on the stock exchange.  In terms of the types\r\n\r\nof  work,  our local firms are gaining expertise  which  were\r\n\r\npreviously  the  domain of the foreign  contractors.  Several\r\n\r\nlocal  firms  can  now build with precast components  and  be\r\n\r\ncompetitive   and  innovative  in  winning   projects   using\r\n\r\nbuildable design and method of construction. The local  civil\r\n\r\nengineering  contractors are also winning contracts  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of vehicular fly-overs and bridges. In the  area\r\n\r\nof  exports,  Singapore construction firms secured  over  S$1\r\n\r\nbillion  worth  of contracts each year in the region,  except\r\n\r\nduring the years of the Asian economic crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Singapore's small size of the construction\r\n\r\nindustry,  we  have  to  be realistic about  nurturing  local\r\n\r\nconstruction firms to be world-class companies.   While  most\r\n\r\nwould  probably not be able to achieve world class  standard,\r\n\r\nthey  can still attain high standards of project delivery and\r\n\r\nable to compete for projects in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) had\r\n\r\nimplemented  several initiatives to upgrade the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.  Generally, our local firms had responded  well  to\r\n\r\nthe initiatives. These include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Raising the work quality of the industry through\r\n\r\nthe  Construction  Quality Assessment  Scheme  (CONQUAS)  and\r\n\r\nincentives such as the Bonus Scheme for Construction Quality.\r\n\r\nAll  BCA registered G6 to G8 contractors must also attain ISO\r\n\r\n9000 certification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Raising the productivity levels of the industry\r\n\r\nthrough  implementing buildable designs and promoting Design-and-Build arrangements for greater efficiency and integration\r\n\r\nof the designer and builder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Upgrading technology and Research and Development.\r\n\r\nA  $10  million  fund  managed by BCA has  been  obtained  to\r\n\r\nfinance   R&D   of  innovative  construction   products   and\r\n\r\nprocesses.  A $10 million Industry Productivity fund has also\r\n\r\nbeen  made  available  to  raise the general  capability  and\r\n\r\nproductivity  of  the construction industry. Other  incentive\r\n\r\nschemes  to  help firms in capability building and technology\r\n\r\nupgrading include the Investment Allowance Scheme, Innovation\r\n\r\nDevelopment Scheme and Local Enterprise Technical  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Giving recognition to firms which had demonstrated\r\n\r\nleadership, innovation and sustained efforts in adopting best\r\n\r\npractices  through  the BCA Construction  Excellence  Awards,\r\n\r\nBest Buildable Design Awards and the new Construction 21 Best\r\n\r\nPractice  Awards.

In\r\n\r\naddition,  as  size and financial strength are  necessary  to\r\n\r\nenable  construction firms to take on large projects, BCA  is\r\n\r\nlooking  into the following areas which can help local  firms\r\n\r\nto build size:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Revamping the BCA Registry of Contractors by\r\n\r\nraising   the  registration  criteria  for  the  contractors.\r\n\r\nContractors  will  have  to  meet  more  stringent  turnover,\r\n\r\nfinancial  strength, track records and professional  manpower\r\n\r\nrequirement   criteria  to  be  registered  at  the   various\r\n\r\nfinancial grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
