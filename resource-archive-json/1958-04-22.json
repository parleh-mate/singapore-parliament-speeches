It was Government's original intention\r\n\r\nin  1952 to build two trade schools similar to the\r\n\r\nBalestier Road Junior Trade School. In late  1953,\r\n\r\nGovernment approved the creation of a new post  of\r\n\r\nAssistant  Director of Education  (Technical)  and\r\n\r\naccepted the idea of the building of a Polytechnic\r\n\r\nwhich  would  provide technical education  at  the\r\n\r\nhighest level. The Assistant Director of Education\r\n\r\n(Technical) on arrival in the Colony in late 1954,\r\n\r\nreviewed the situation in view of the need  for  a\r\n\r\nbridge   between  the  primary  school   and   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic not provided by the trade schools, and\r\n\r\nadvised  the setting up of two secondary technical\r\n\r\nschools  in  place  of  the  proposed  two   trade\r\n\r\nschools.

The   Board   has   full\r\n\r\nresponsibility for prescribing the rate of charges\r\n\r\nto  be  made in respect of the telephone services,\r\n\r\nand  Government  has no intention  of  introducing\r\n\r\namending legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the telephone charges are the\r\n\r\nfirst  in  Singapore for 35 years  and  have  been\r\n\r\nrendered  necessary by the rise  in  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nequipment,  of  labour  and,  above  all,  of  the\r\n\r\nfinance  necessary  to meet the increasing  demand\r\n\r\nfor  new  lines. In the last two years, the  Board\r\n\r\nhas  provided an additional 7,500 exchange  lines,\r\n\r\nthat  is  a  33  per  cent increase,  and  current\r\n\r\nexpansion  is running at the rate of 450  lines  a\r\n\r\nmonth.

The first session began  on  29th\r\n\r\nAugust, 1956, and much has happened since then.  1\r\n\r\nneed  not recount all the events which took  place\r\n\r\nbut there is one which I find it necessary to draw\r\n\r\nattention to because the threat is still  with  us\r\n\r\nalthough  much  diminished in venom.  I  refer  to\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities and the  Government's  firm\r\n\r\naction  against  such elements.  The  Government's\r\n\r\nstand  is  again reiterated in that  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's Speech which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government will continue its vigilance in\r\n\r\ncountering  Communist infiltration and sub-version\r\n\r\nand  will not hesitate to take whatever steps  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to counter this threat to the livelihood\r\n\r\nand well-being of the citizens of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will soon be entering a new era in our\r\n\r\npolitical  evolution. The new  constitution  which\r\n\r\nthe All-Party delegation brought back to Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon  last  year in accordance with the  mandate\r\n\r\nentrusted to the delegation by this Assembly  will\r\n\r\nbe   brought  into  operation  with  the   General\r\n\r\nElection.  This new constitution is an  honourable\r\n\r\nand  satisfying discharge of the mandate  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  This record, Sir, would not be  correct\r\n\r\nif  I  did  not  mention that there was  one  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  who is now no longer with us, who felt  so\r\n\r\nheartsick  that he resigned and issued a challenge\r\n\r\nto  a  by-election against another Member  who  in\r\n\r\nhonouring  his  acceptance  of  the  challenge  so\r\n\r\nboldly  thrown out at him resigned,  contested  in\r\n\r\nthe by-election on the matter in dispute, received\r\n\r\nthe  support  of his electorate and is  now  still\r\n\r\nwith  us.  The  Member  who issued  the  challenge\r\n\r\nresigned,  did not contest in the by-election  and\r\n\r\ndeclared that he was giving up politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Constitution, Sir, is a challenge to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore who, I am confident, will rise\r\n\r\nto  the occasion and uphold the democratic form of\r\n\r\ngovernment. This new Constitution opens the way to\r\n\r\na  richer  prize,  a prize worth capturing.  Hence\r\n\r\nsubversive elements are mustering their forces and\r\n\r\nendeavouring  to open up new fronts,  having  lost\r\n\r\nthe  old  fronts through Government's firm action,\r\n\r\nby  finding  stooges from among  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to prostitute themselves for  their  own\r\n\r\nends, or who are so blinded by their own evil that\r\n\r\nthey unwittingly lend themselves to be made use of\r\n\r\nby these evil forces to the detriment of the well-being  of  the  citizens  of  Singapore.  In   any\r\n\r\ncommunity one is bound to find such persons, and I\r\n\r\nhope  and  pray that their eyes will be opened  in\r\n\r\ntime  to the fact that they are playing with  fire\r\n\r\nwhich will surely destroy them in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, the new Constitution is a\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  the  citizens  of  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is pledged to wipe out the destructive\r\n\r\nforces  in  our  midst,  and  there  can   be   no\r\n\r\nrelaxation in our vigilance; but this fight can be\r\n\r\nhampered if the citizens of Singapore do not guard\r\n\r\nthemselves    against   evil    and    destructive\r\n\r\npropaganda. During the last session the Government\r\n\r\nhad  an  uphill fight against the evil  propaganda\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  being disseminated by subversive elements and\r\n\r\nswallowed  by  gullible  people  who  should  have\r\n\r\nthought  better. This Government  was  accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing   against  Chinese  education  and   Chinese\r\n\r\nculture.  The  Government's  primary  duty  is  to\r\n\r\nprotect the well-being of the citizens, and in the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  this sacred duty  we  had  to  take\r\n\r\naction against certain Chinese middle schools  and\r\n\r\nhad  to  detain under the Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance a number of students from these\r\n\r\nschools,  because their subversive  activities  in\r\n\r\nthese  schools were a grave threat  to  the  well-being  not only of their fellow-students but  also\r\n\r\nof Singapore. It is from the student body that the\r\n\r\nfuture  leaders of Singapore will  arise,  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  put on the right  track  while  in\r\n\r\nschool  to  become worthy citizens,  their  future\r\n\r\nwill be blighted, their outlook will be distorted,\r\n\r\nand  they will be a liability instead of an  asset\r\n\r\nto  the  country.  This action of  the  Government\r\n\r\ntaken  in  the best interests of the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore was twisted by disruptive forces for the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  gullible  people  as  an   action\r\n\r\nagainst Chinese education and Chinese culture. Let\r\n\r\nus examine the Government's education policy based\r\n\r\non the All-Party Report. For the first time in the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  Singapore, Chinese education  has  an\r\n\r\nequal  place. Teachers in Chinese schools are  put\r\n\r\nat  par  with  teachers in English  schools,  thus\r\n\r\nreceiving  large  increases in  their  emoluments.\r\n\r\nThis  year the Government is spending $15  million\r\n\r\non  Chinese  education. This,  Sir,  we  claim  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a proud record. In the short space of  two\r\n\r\nyears we have done more for Chinese education than\r\n\r\nall the previous administrations put together, and\r\n\r\nvery  much  more than governments in  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  having Chinese populations.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nfear any contradiction on this. I have offered  to\r\n\r\nsend  a  small  group  of  students  from  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools   on   a   visit  to  these   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  and even to the Chinese  mainland,  to\r\n\r\nsee  for themselves. I have received a good number\r\n\r\nof  applications  and these are at  present  being\r\n\r\nconsidered, and arrangements will be made to  send\r\n\r\na  group  on  the  tour during the  August  school\r\n\r\nvacation. This is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's  answer  to  the  evil  forces  which\r\n\r\npreach  and  misguide people to foolishly  believe\r\n\r\nthat this Government is against Chinese education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University, Sir, was recently\r\n\r\nofficially  opened by the Governor. I have  stated\r\n\r\non  several occasions during, the past few  months\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  will  give  recognition  to\r\n\r\nNanyang University degrees, but before this can be\r\n\r\ndone, it has been proposed to appoint a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Scholars to advise on recognition, thus giving\r\n\r\nweight  to  such  recognition. The  delay  in  the\r\n\r\nappointment of this Commission has been due to the\r\n\r\nattitude of the Nanyang University authorities.  A\r\n\r\nhappy  change,  Sir,  has  now  taken  place,  and\r\n\r\nproposals  for a Commission of Scholars to  advise\r\n\r\non  recognition are going forward. When  this  has\r\n\r\nbeen resolved, the Government will grant financial\r\n\r\naid  if  required,  thereby helping  to  make  the\r\n\r\nNanyang University an institution of high learning\r\n\r\nof  which we can all be proud. Can anyone honestly\r\n\r\nand truthfully say that this Government is against\r\n\r\nChinese  education?  For the  first  time  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of Singapore we have a multilingual  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and will soon have multilingual  District\r\n\r\nCouncils  and a multilingual Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese language is given due place in debates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  these Councils and in the Legislature. And the\r\n\r\ngates of this august Assembly are thrown wide open\r\n\r\nby  our citizenship laws, under which some 300,000\r\n\r\nChinese  who  were  not  born  in  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nregistered as citizens. Their names will appear on\r\n\r\nelectoral   rolls  for  the  forthcoming   general\r\n\r\nelections, and I look forward to seeing candidates\r\n\r\nfielded  from  among  this group.  Thus,  Chinese-speaking  Chinese and China-born Chinese who  have\r\n\r\nbecome  citizens of Singapore enjoy for the  first\r\n\r\ntime  the same rights and privileges as all  other\r\n\r\ncitizens.  I do not, Sir, for a moment doubt  that\r\n\r\nin  enjoying these rights and privileges they will\r\n\r\nnot  forget  that  they too have  responsibilities\r\n\r\ntowards the State of Singapore which will soon  be\r\n\r\nbrought into being under the new Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are actions on the part of the Government\r\n\r\nsuch as I have recounted against Chinese education\r\n\r\nand Chinese culture? Oh, citizens of Singapore, be\r\n\r\nnot  bluffed again! Listen not to evil propaganda!\r\n\r\nGuard  against  this  and  let  us  march  forward\r\n\r\ntogether,  and  fight subversive forces  and  rout\r\n\r\nthem!  Rout  them out and make this  Singapore  of\r\n\r\nours a happier and a better land to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess, Sir, that we would have lost our\r\n\r\nfight  last session against subversive forces  had\r\n\r\nwe  not been endowed with the Marshall law  by  my\r\n\r\npredecessor. I refer to the Preservation of Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance. The people of Singapore should\r\n\r\nbe   grateful,  as  this  Government   is   indeed\r\n\r\ngrateful,  to  him for introducing  this  Marshall\r\n\r\nlaw, which is a very effective weapon against  the\r\n\r\nrampages  of  the  Communists  and  their  fellow-travellers.  This Marshall law emanated  from  the\r\n\r\nmind  of  a  man  who was most vehemently  against\r\n\r\nCommunism, and among his other achievements,  this\r\n\r\nis  the  most  outstanding one when he  was  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.  My  colleagues and I  thank  him,  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  thank him, and above all the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore thank him too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, a few words about our relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation of Malaya. I quote from  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's Speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government is happy to record the continued\r\n\r\ncordial  relationship which  it  enjoys  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government takes the stand that union with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation is inevitable, and will direct its\r\n\r\nenergies towards creating a climate and conditions\r\n\r\nconducive to such a union.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>Sir,  the  Federation Prime Minister, Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman,  is  a  man  of  great  understanding  and\r\n\r\nappreciation of the ties between Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. The  two  territories  are\r\n\r\ninter-dependent.  One cannot prosper  without  the\r\n\r\nother.  Any threat to the economic well-being  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  one  is a threat  to  the  other.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore hope and pray that the causeway\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  bridges the hopes and aspirations  of  true\r\n\r\nMalayans  will not be turned into a real political\r\n\r\nbarrier detrimental to both territories. And  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  directing its energies  to  seeing\r\n\r\nthat this does not happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Governor's Speech there is this\r\n\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government intends to recommend to the\r\n\r\nAssembly  the holding of elections for an enlarged\r\n\r\nAssembly under the new Constitution as soon as  it\r\n\r\nis  practically possible to do so. The  time-table\r\n\r\nwill  depend  on the preparation and enactment  of\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  constitutional  instruments   and\r\n\r\nlegislation  as  well as any measures  which  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  may decide to adopt in order to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  electoral  procedure. The Government  intends\r\n\r\nthat   the  agreement  with  the  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  the  form  of  the  constitutional\r\n\r\ninstruments  should  be  made  by  the   All-Party\r\n\r\ndelegation  which took part in the  Constitutional\r\n\r\ndiscussion last year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, questions have been asked at this sitting on\r\n\r\nthe constitutional instruments, the date of coming\r\n\r\ninto  effect of the new Constitution, the proposed\r\n\r\ntrip  to  London, and the Member  for  Changi  has\r\n\r\nasked  Government's  view on the  introduction  of\r\n\r\nlegislation for compulsory voting although he  had\r\n\r\nvery  much  earlier tabled a motion in support  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting - Motion No. 9 on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\nAll  these questions, Sir, have been answered this\r\n\r\nmorning and the motion will be debated at its  due\r\n\r\ntime.  The answers which I have given to questions\r\n\r\non the draft Constitution need not be amplified. I\r\n\r\nwould like, however, to say a few words more about\r\n\r\nthe  London trip. I hope to receive before the end\r\n\r\nof  this month from the Colonial Office the  draft\r\n\r\nConstitution  so  that copies  can  be  handed  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  All-Party delegation  for  their\r\n\r\nstudy.  I  will  call meetings  of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\ndelegation  so that we can sort out our  ideas  on\r\n\r\nthe matter before proceeding to London to finalise\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional instruments.  The  discussions\r\n\r\nwill  begin  in  London  on  12th  May,  and   the\r\n\r\ndelegation  will  be  the  guests  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Government to whom I wish  to  record  my\r\n\r\nthanks  for  this  hospitality.  I  am  sure  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  agree  with me  that  the  quickest\r\n\r\npossible  way of finalising the draft Constitution\r\n\r\nis by discussions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naround   the   table   and   not   by   protracted\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  or telegraphic communication.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of the London trip is clear, and yet there\r\n\r\nare dishonest politicians who try to read into  it\r\n\r\nmotives  that are manifestly false.  I  have  been\r\n\r\naccused of wanting to reach an understanding  with\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial  Office to appoint me  as  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  under the new Constitution.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  agreement reached in London with the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  bars  the  appointment as Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara of any person who is closely connected with\r\n\r\npolitics. How can I ever be, I wonder?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been accused, Sir, of trying to seek\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  approval to  extend  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution so that I can continue  to  be  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister. What utter falsehood. The job  of  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister was thrust upon me in June 1956 at a time\r\n\r\nof  crisis.  I  did not want it, but  duty  to  my\r\n\r\ncountry  and  service to the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ndemanded that I should take it up. The carrying of\r\n\r\ntwo  jobs - that of Chief Minister and  of  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and Welfare - is a heavy one  and  my\r\n\r\nhealth  has suffered in consequence, and the  only\r\n\r\nsustaining factor in my job - my two jobs - is that  I\r\n\r\nam  serving my country to the best of my  ability,\r\n\r\nand  in the discharge of this duty, Sir, there  is\r\n\r\nno sacrifice great enough or noble enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now turn to compulsory voting. This\r\n\r\nis  the subject which has caused much gnashing  of\r\n\r\nteeth and tearing of hair by some politicians  and\r\n\r\nerstwhile  friends. As Motion No. 9 on  the  Order\r\n\r\nPaper on compulsory voting is still to be debated,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  propose to say much  on  this  subject\r\n\r\nalthough  it  has a bearing on that  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's Speech which refers to the date of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections. However, I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nhere  and  now  that it was at one of  the  civics\r\n\r\ncourses  that the view was expressed, not  by  me,\r\n\r\nthat  compulsory voting would be a good thing  for\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. This was given publicity\r\n\r\nin  the  Press and it brought forth comments  from\r\n\r\nindividuals and organisations and representations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto    the    Government   from    certain\r\n\r\norganisations.   I   met   representatives    from\r\n\r\norganisations that had made representations to me.\r\n\r\nI  informed the meeting that if compulsory  voting\r\n\r\nwas  introduced  at this stage, it  would  mean  a\r\n\r\ndelay in the general elections, but certainly  not\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  life  of the Rendel  Constitution.  A\r\n\r\nreport  of this meeting appeared in last  Sunday's\r\n\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have touched only on the more important\r\n\r\naspects  of  the Governor's Speech  as  these  are\r\n\r\nuppermost in the minds of hon. Members. I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose  to take up the time of hon. Members  much\r\n\r\nlonger  by  elaborating  on  what  the  Government\r\n\r\nproposes  to  do during this last session.  All  I\r\n\r\nneed  say is that we are continuing with our four-year  programme. We believe we have done much  and\r\n\r\nare  still doing more for the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand when we appear before them at election time we\r\n\r\nshall   go   forward  with  confidence  and   with\r\n\r\nsatisfaction that we have not failed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is now the pleasure and the privilege of\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  of the opposition to unleash  their\r\n\r\ncriticisms. We will face them. Indeed we thrive on\r\n\r\nthem. Let us all on both sides of the House in the\r\n\r\nfight  that  may  develop in the  course  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate not lose sight that the fight ahead  of  us\r\n\r\nis a crucial fight for democracy in Singapore. Let\r\n\r\nus  go  into the election arena, fight  hard,  but\r\n\r\nfight  wisely,  so  that  subversive  forces  with\r\n\r\ndemocratic  organisations as their front  may  not\r\n\r\nsucceed in stealing away the prize which the  All-Party  delegation brought back last year. May  all\r\n\r\nsubversive  forces  perish in  this  attempt!  May\r\n\r\ndemocracy  flourish in the new State of Singapore.\r\n\r\nMajulah Singapura!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I second the motion, Sir, reserving my right to speak at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.53 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

So,  placed as they are  on  this  narrow\r\n\r\nledge, I hope the hon. Member for Changi will  not\r\n\r\nknock over my notes with his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only criticism which I would offer of the\r\n\r\nspeech is, on the whole, that I consider it to  be\r\n\r\na  little airy-fairy and unspecific; otherwise  it\r\n\r\nis  the  type of speech one might expect  to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  a  Conservative or Liberal Government  which\r\n\r\nworks  in  a  well-established welfare state.  The\r\n\r\nopening paragraphs refer mostly to historic facts,\r\n\r\nthough  one sentence stands out like a  beacon.  I\r\n\r\nrefer to the sentence which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore exists because of its trade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>Because  of this very fact which surely  everybody\r\n\r\nrecognises, I myself feel fairly optimistic  about\r\n\r\nthe  future  of  this  great port,  and  I  cannot\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  any Party would try to  wreck  that\r\n\r\ntrade.  Such  a  Party would  have  a  very  short\r\n\r\nexistence.   I   suppose  there  is   always   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of a Party getting into  power  which\r\n\r\nmight  be  intent only on creating  chaos,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  unlikely. Again, of  course,  we  might\r\n\r\nexpect  to  hear  the old tune about  blaming  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists, and the rights of the workers,  with\r\n\r\nthose  wearying  and repetitive emphases  on  that\r\n\r\nvery  subject - as if there were only two  types  of\r\n\r\nmen - workers and non-workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> There are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> The former, of course, being the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

However, that is merely  in\r\n\r\npassing,  Sir, I personally have always  disliked\r\n\r\nthe  term \"worker\" as such. When I was a young man\r\n\r\nwe  used  to talk about the \"working classes\"  and\r\n\r\nthe  \"working  man\". Somehow those  terms  sounded\r\n\r\nless sinister than \"worker\"; \"worker\" suggests  to\r\n\r\nme  the beehive or the ant-heap where the will  of\r\n\r\nthe  inmates  is entirely subjugated  to  that  of\r\n\r\ntheir  leaders;  but  whatever  Party  comes  into\r\n\r\npower, Sir, I have no doubt that it will be to the\r\n\r\nchagrin  of the other side, and one can only  hope\r\n\r\nthat the confidence expressed in the final passage\r\n\r\nof  His  Excellency's Speech - that he is \"confident\r\n\r\nthat  when  General Elections are held the  people\r\n\r\nand  the  new citizens of this island will express\r\n\r\nin  definite  and unmistakable terms their  desire\r\n\r\nfor  a  stable Government\" and so on - will  not  be\r\n\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am endeavouring to touch on one or two things\r\n\r\nthat the Chief Minister did not particularly refer\r\n\r\nto  in  his speech - I am not dealing with education\r\n\r\nor anything of that nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally believe that the establishment of\r\n\r\nsecondary industries in this island can never  and\r\n\r\nwill  never take the place of the entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nThere are plently of people here, even in what the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has just called this august  body,\r\n\r\nwho  believe  that  the  enormous  and  phenomenal\r\n\r\ngrowth   of   population  presents  no  particular\r\n\r\nproblem.  They  seem to think that  jobs  will  be\r\n\r\nfound for them here, in Johore or in Jupiter,  but\r\n\r\nI personally am not so sanguine about that, and it\r\n\r\nis therefore refreshing to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government recognises the need to offer\r\n\r\nincentive  to capital investment in the industrial\r\n\r\nfield in the initial stages and with this in  view\r\n\r\nis  now  preparing `pioneer industry' legislation.\r\n\r\nGovernment  Departments have been  instructed  and\r\n\r\nsubsidised  Boards  have been  requested  to  give\r\n\r\npreference to locally manufactured articles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>That, Sir, is a splendid statement and I hope that\r\n\r\nevery  Party  will  include  in  its  banner   the\r\n\r\ndevice - \"Encourage capital investment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still touching on this line of country, I was\r\n\r\nmost interested to hear that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is the Government's intention to reorganise\r\n\r\nand  strengthen  the  industrial  section  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Commerce  and  Industry   and   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  the present Industrial  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard actively assisting in the promotion of large\r\n\r\nscale industries is being studied.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>This  is  good news. I have a lot of time for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Commerce and Industry. As a  business\r\n\r\nman, I take a great interest in its functions  and\r\n\r\nI  am  most interested to learn, as I am sure  the\r\n\r\nwhole business community will be, that it is being\r\n\r\nreorganised and strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Industrial Promotion Board, I think it\r\n\r\nis high time that this pilot scheme developed into\r\n\r\nsomething   bigger.  I  am  quite   certain   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  offer  assistance  to  industry\r\n\r\nwhich would be both helpful and profitable. A lead\r\n\r\nactually by Government in this matter might induce\r\n\r\nsome  local  tycoons who have so far  not  greatly\r\n\r\ninterested  themselves in industry to invest  some\r\n\r\nof their surplus capital in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing with the Governor's Speech, we have\r\n\r\nanother of those cogent and brief statements:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government will continue to do everything in\r\n\r\nits power to encourage entrepot trade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>That,  I  think, is a splendid thing too.  Let  us\r\n\r\ntrade  with everybody, no matter who they are,  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  they can buy from us and we can sell  to\r\n\r\nthem. Sir, everybody knows that the coffers of the\r\n\r\nrich  land  to  the south of us  are  very  nearly\r\n\r\nempty,  but  they have goods to sell  and  we  can\r\n\r\nsupply them with their needs. Let us at least from\r\n\r\nthis  end  endeavour to iron out any  difficulties\r\n\r\nthat may stand in the way of that trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, is on the question of banking\r\n\r\nlegislation. Those of us who have read the  Report\r\n\r\nby   Mr  G.  M.  Watson  and  Sir  Sydney  Caine,\r\n\r\nfamiliarly  known as the Watson-Caine Report,  are\r\n\r\naware  that it included draft banking legislation.\r\n\r\nMost  bankers  in this city are agreed  that  this\r\n\r\nlegislation   would   have  to   be   considerably\r\n\r\nmodified.   The  Colony  banks - and   I   make   no\r\n\r\ndistinction between the branches of big overseas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporations and indigenous banks - understand\r\n\r\ntheir   business   quite   well   and   are   very\r\n\r\nconservatively  run. None of their depositors  has\r\n\r\never   had   an  anxious  moment.  It  is   hoped,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that the proposed legislation will  not\r\n\r\nbe  unduly burdensome, but I agree that, with  the\r\n\r\npassing  of  the  colonial regime, legislation  to\r\n\r\nsupervise  the licensing, control and  supervision\r\n\r\nof banks in this city is highly desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of the discussions between this\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Government of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya  on  the subject of central banking  which,\r\n\r\naccording to the Governor's Speech, is continuing,\r\n\r\nis  anxiously  awaited by the business  community.\r\n\r\nThe  advent  of  a  central bank  is  inextricably\r\n\r\nlinked up with the future of this currency and the\r\n\r\npledge that the Government has given \"not to  make\r\n\r\nany  arrangement which might undermine  confidence\r\n\r\nin  the currency in use in Singapore or jeopardise\r\n\r\nits  stability\"  is, to my mind,  the  outstanding\r\n\r\nstatement in the speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to dwell on all the fine\r\n\r\nthings the Government intends to do. The Ministers\r\n\r\nof  the  Labour  Front  Coaliton  Government  have\r\n\r\nlearned  quite a lot in the last three  years  and\r\n\r\nthey  know  very  well  what causes  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nprosper.  I  do not quarrel with their  programme.\r\n\r\nThe  \"unworkable\" Rendel Constitution  has  worked\r\n\r\nsurprisingly well for three years - three  memorable\r\n\r\nyears  in  which Singapore has not stood still  at\r\n\r\nall  but  has grown and developed greatly - and  now\r\n\r\nthere  seems  to be a fair chance  of  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution running its full four-year course!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the P.R.O.'s translation, the\r\n\r\nopening  sentence of the editorial of  the  Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu of 17th April reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Speech of the British Governor of Singapore\r\n\r\nat the opening of the Legislative Assembly meeting\r\n\r\nlast  Wednesday was actually prepared by the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   Mr   Lim  Yew  Hock.

But, it is more  than\r\n\r\njust  empty seats which made the Governor's Speech\r\n\r\nsound  so hollow. I wondered on that day how  many\r\n\r\nempty hearts there were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give the M.C.S. and the expatriate civil\r\n\r\nservice one bouquet today. They are very good  for\r\n\r\nthe  stiff upper lip. The thing that impressed  me\r\n\r\nmost  about the Governor's Speech was his bouncing\r\n\r\ndemeanour, and his joyful confidence, which I hope\r\n\r\nis justified by the confidential appraisal that he\r\n\r\nmust  have of the overall situation of the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront Coalition Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, Sir, I can only say\r\n\r\nthat  the mandate from heaven has passed from  the\r\n\r\nhands of the Labour Front Coalition Government. We\r\n\r\ndid  not  come  to this Assembly to hear  all  the\r\n\r\npiddling  little things that the Government  hoped\r\n\r\nto  enact  in its last few months of office.  What\r\n\r\neverybody  wanted to know was when are they  going\r\n\r\nto hold the elections. When are we going to have a\r\n\r\nnew  Government under a new constitution. On these\r\n\r\nimportant  subjects,  the  Speech  was  singularly\r\n\r\nsilent. It is the art of equivocation. All it says\r\n\r\nis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Government intends that the agreement with\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  form  of  the constitutional  instruments\r\n\r\nshould  be made by the All-Party delegation  which\r\n\r\ntook  part  in the Constitutional discussion  last\r\n\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>It  can  mean  anything according to the  way  one\r\n\r\nchooses to construe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every Member in this House, if he were to\r\n\r\nget  a dose of some truth drug that would make him\r\n\r\ntell  the  whole truth and nothing but the  truth,\r\n\r\nwould  say  that what occupies him most  is,  what\r\n\r\nnow?  Will  I come back to this Chamber?  And,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   most  worried  of  them  all   are   the\r\n\r\nIndependents.   Hence  the  enormous   number   of\r\n\r\nQuestions  filed  today by the Independents.  They\r\n\r\nmust  find a bus or some vehicle before  they  can\r\n\r\nfind  themselves back. The Labour  Front  and  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists have been so shattered  by  the\r\n\r\nevents  of  the  last  few  months,  events  which\r\n\r\nanybody  could  have told them were  coming,  that\r\n\r\nthey have not quite recovered their balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to ask both the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Government and the Liberal-Socialists Party\r\n\r\nis  this:  do  they  want early elections  now?  I\r\n\r\nremember  so vividly the taunts of the Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) about the Government\r\n\r\nopposite being undemocratic and that the time  had\r\n\r\ncome  for  early  elections. Even the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong), during the  debate\r\n\r\nover  citizenship, insisted that there  should  be\r\n\r\nearly  elections. Now we know from the legislative\r\n\r\nprogramme that the Government has planned, and the\r\n\r\nconferences that it has planned for 1959, that  it\r\n\r\nhas  every intention of going on for its full term\r\n\r\nof office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question is: what will happen after the\r\n\r\nDistrict Council elections some time in the middle\r\n\r\nof this year? It is not possible for us to pretend\r\n\r\nthat   this  Assembly  meets  today  in  the  same\r\n\r\ncircumstances as when it met in December last year\r\n\r\nbefore the City Council elections. And it is  idle\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  pretend  that the situation  will  be\r\n\r\nunchanged  by the results of the District  Council\r\n\r\nelections.  The  ex-Chief  Minister  (Mr  D.   S.\r\n\r\nMarshall) has suggested that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon   trip   is   intended   to   enable    his\r\n\r\nsuccessor - his  one-time  articled   clerk   -   (I\r\n\r\nunderstand he gets little joy in calling  him  Dr\r\n\r\nLim)  to arrange with Mr Lennox-Boyd to be a Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara, and to have  the  constitution\r\n\r\nextended  for two years. I would like to tell  the\r\n\r\nex-Chief Minister that he should not give ideas to\r\n\r\nhis  old colleagues because they may actually take\r\n\r\nthe cue, except that with the P.A.P. participation\r\n\r\nin  the last talks and our being in this Assembly,\r\n\r\nthey  are unlikely ever to succeed. But the  truth\r\n\r\nis  that  early elections or no depends,  does  it\r\n\r\nnot, upon the chances of an electoral victory  for\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Coalition Parties? That simply is\r\n\r\nthe  whole  position. If they  had  won  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  elections as we wanted them to win - indeed\r\n\r\nwe did-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> -then there would have been more\r\n\r\nbounce  in  them. We might well be on the  way  to\r\n\r\nhaving  elections  in August,  perhaps  September.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  partly  because  of  the  lack  of\r\n\r\norganisation, and also partly because certain Left-wing  elements wanted to destroy the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nand  used the Workers Party for this purpose,  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front suffered a catastrophic defeat.  Now\r\n\r\neven  the District Council elections will  not  be\r\n\r\nheld,  in  the words of the Governor,  \"until  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  this year\". Originally, I believe,  it\r\n\r\nwas scheduled for March. Now I say this advisedly:\r\n\r\nwe  are prepared to have the elections at any time\r\n\r\nbecause we know that we will win them, be it  this\r\n\r\nyear or next year. And I say frankly to the Labour\r\n\r\nFront,  \"There will be no magic formula  that  you\r\n\r\ncan  concoct  that can bring back  the  secret  of\r\n\r\nvictory  other than hard work; that has  not  been\r\n\r\ndone,  the propaganda battle has been lost.  Those\r\n\r\nare the hard facts of life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing should be made clear: this issue of the\r\n\r\nearly  elections  is completely  unconnected  with\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting.  I  know  that  the   ex-Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  was somewhat agitated at the thought  of\r\n\r\nearly elections being postponed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindefinitely  on  account  of   compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting. He is renowned for many qualities but  one\r\n\r\nof  them  is  not clear thinking. Early  elections\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to do with compulsory voting. I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister two questions and, if he  were\r\n\r\nhonest,  he  would  give me a  reply  which  would\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  what I said. If today all  the  laws\r\n\r\nintroducing compulsory voting had been passed  and\r\n\r\nthe constitution were ready, would he have general\r\n\r\nelections  when  he knows that  he  is  likely  to\r\n\r\nsuffer defeat? The answer is no, is it not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You are answering it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Put it in another way: if\r\n\r\nthere  were no need for compulsory voting laws  to\r\n\r\nbe  passed  and the constitution is  ready,  would\r\n\r\nthere be elections when he knows he is going to be\r\n\r\ndefeated? The answer again is no. And therefore if\r\n\r\nit  were not the excuse of compulsory voting there\r\n\r\nwould  be some other excuse. What is important  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  question  of  compulsory  voting  or  no\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting, but the new  constitution.  We\r\n\r\nagreed  to a constitution for full internal  self-government. We know that a draft - or at  least  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister has admitted it as some kind  of  a\r\n\r\ndraft which is not really a draft - has arrived  and\r\n\r\nthat   he  has  circulated  bits  of  it  to   the\r\n\r\ndepartments concerned. We have not received a copy\r\n\r\nof it although he admitted that we are entitled to\r\n\r\nit. Further, he wants to bring the delegation back\r\n\r\nto London to settle the draft. Now, Sir, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  considerable  press speculation  on  it.  It\r\n\r\nmight  well  be  that  some  of  the  leaks   were\r\n\r\nofficially  inspired,  that  there  will  now   be\r\n\r\nwritten  into the constitution a number of  things\r\n\r\nwhich  were not discussed at all, such  as  making\r\n\r\nthe   civil  service  sacrosanct,  preventing  the\r\n\r\nallowances  as distinct from the salaries  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants from coming under the  control  of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislature and the Government, building  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission into the  constitution,\r\n\r\nmaking these allowances permanent or consolidating\r\n\r\nthem into basic salaries, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state my Party stand very clearly\r\n\r\non this matter. Nothing goes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the constitution with our consent other than\r\n\r\nthat  which we agreed we would take in  London,  a\r\n\r\nconstitution   giving  us  full   internal   self-government,  that  is,  the  right  to   run   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  within  Singapore  with  no   let   or\r\n\r\nhindrance, constitutional or otherwise. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that the armour-plating complex - if all  this\r\n\r\nrumour happens to be true, and I have more than  a\r\n\r\nfair suspicion that a great deal of it may well be\r\n\r\ntrue - can save the situation. It is utterly foolish\r\n\r\nand  stupid  to  believe  that  you  can  make   a\r\n\r\nconstitution such that you tie up the hands of the\r\n\r\nexecutive and paralyse it at the will of the civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Hon. the Chief Minister rightly\r\n\r\npointed out, it was we who justified what  we  did\r\n\r\nin  London  last year, if he cannot hit Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall  himself, then we do not mind  his  using\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. for that purpose. We have a right more\r\n\r\nthan  any other Party to see that what we defended\r\n\r\nis  what we will get and nothing less. As for  his\r\n\r\ntrip  to London, we will not be party to this trip\r\n\r\nuntil  we have first received a draft copy of  the\r\n\r\nconstitution  for our study, and our agreement  to\r\n\r\nit. If there are any parts of the constitution  to\r\n\r\nwhich   we  cannot  agree,  then  there  must   be\r\n\r\nagreement  between  the  Parties  to  delete  such\r\n\r\npassages    from   the   draft.   Otherwise    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for this new constitution will rest\r\n\r\non  those  who  will participate in bringing  back\r\n\r\nsomething less than what we originally agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not really concerned today with what the\r\n\r\nLabour Front will or will not do for its last year\r\n\r\nof  office. Those of us who have had the privilege\r\n\r\nof a front-seat view of what has been happening in\r\n\r\nthe last three years should think clearly and find\r\n\r\nout  why  it  failed. I say this with no  rancour.\r\n\r\nThey  did  not expect to govern. For more  than  a\r\n\r\nyear,  they  did  not govern. And then  when  they\r\n\r\ntried  to  govern, the position was too far  gone.\r\n\r\nThey  were inept, and they got themselves  into  a\r\n\r\nmess.  That  briefly  sums up the  situation.  The\r\n\r\nfirst thing they lacked - and we are reminded of  it\r\n\r\ntoday in the morning press\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- is   sufficient  integrity  and  drive   in   its\r\n\r\nleadership  to give it the cohesion  required  for\r\n\r\nthe leadership of any movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park (Mr A. R. Lazarous),\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon  Eng),\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kampong Kapor (Mr Seah Peng Chuan)\r\n\r\nwho  is  absent - former  Labour  Front  Members - are\r\n\r\nthrowing  enormous stones at the Government  today\r\n\r\nbecause, for multifarious reasons, the spoils were\r\n\r\nnot  shared  with them. The ex-Chief  Minister  is\r\n\r\nrunning  around,  it appears,  with  a  \"hammer\",\r\n\r\nlarge  as life, prepared to knock anybody  who  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  a position to knock back, and challenging\r\n\r\nall  and  sundry.  But he is wiser  now;  he  only\r\n\r\nchallenges those whom he knows will not accept the\r\n\r\nchallenge. It is a sad commentary that the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  never grew up from what it was - a collection\r\n\r\nof  individuals who got together to run  a  Party,\r\n\r\ngot   the  surprise  of  their  lives  when   they\r\n\r\nunexpectedly   won   the  elections   and   became\r\n\r\nMinisters.  They  got an even bigger  surprise  of\r\n\r\ntheir  lives when they opened Pandora's Box and  a\r\n\r\njack-in-the-box  bounced up  at  them.  They  have\r\n\r\nnever quite recovered from the shock of it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sight of Assistant Ministers boring\r\n\r\nholes in a sinking ship to make sure that it sinks\r\n\r\nfaster  is a pathetic one, and this is not because\r\n\r\nAssistant   Ministers  have  a  habit  of   buying\r\n\r\nrefrigerators  with $925 cash,  a  practice  which\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers, or those who  aspire  to  be\r\n\r\nsuch,  should  never adopt. But for  an  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister  to  call  a  meeting  and  condemn  your\r\n\r\nGovernment  for not fulfilling the promises  which\r\n\r\nthey themselves made, and they themselves have not\r\n\r\ncarried out, I think takes the cake-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I leave it to  those  who  have\r\n\r\nread  the  morning papers to judge for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe  Labour  Front leadership must be sanguine  in\r\n\r\nthe  extreme if they believe that with  leadership\r\n\r\nmaterial  of  that calibre they  can  survive  the\r\n\r\nstresses and strains which must inevitably be  put\r\n\r\non   any  government  taking  office  within   the\r\n\r\nframework of the Rendel Constitution, and with the\r\n\r\npolitical situation in Singapore as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard the Hon. the Chief Minister today\r\n\r\ncomplain bitterly that he had been misrepresented,\r\n\r\nthat  he  was really not anti-Chinese culture  and\r\n\r\nnot  anti-Chinese education. He said that  it  was\r\n\r\nthe  wicked people who made it appear that it  was\r\n\r\nso.  But what did he expect? If he carries out  an\r\n\r\nanti-subversive purge, does he expect to find  his\r\n\r\nvictims all docilely waiting to be picked up? Does\r\n\r\nhe  not  expect them to fight back?  Does  he  not\r\n\r\nexpect that part of the fight is the presentation - that  he  was  not  just anti the  Chinese  middle\r\n\r\nschool  boys and girls whom he wanted to pick  up,\r\n\r\nbut  anti-Chinese culture, anti-Chinese education?\r\n\r\nIs  he so innocent? Did he not anticipate that the\r\n\r\nmoves  he  was making meant that it  could  be  so\r\n\r\nconstrued - unless he was very careful to  see  that\r\n\r\nit  could  not - that the Right would take advantage\r\n\r\nof the situation, and that his Government would be\r\n\r\npushed  to  the Right? I have heard  nothing  more\r\n\r\ndamning  of the Labour Front Government than  when\r\n\r\nthe  nominated Member Mr Sutherland this  morning\r\n\r\nstood  up and said with so much condescension  and\r\n\r\npatronage, that it was not a bad speech at all-the\r\n\r\nsort  of  thing one expects of a Liberal  sort  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  or a Conservative sort of  government.\r\n\r\nThat  from a colonial banker just about  puts  the\r\n\r\nseal of death on any political party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us face the facts. That is what has happened.\r\n\r\nWittingly  or  unwittingly, he moved  against  the C.P.  Left  and  allowed himself to be  manoeuvred\r\n\r\ninto  a  position where he makes speeches  at  the\r\n\r\nopening ceremonies of American insurance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies, gets himself mixed up with\r\n\r\nbankers who praise him and his Government as being\r\n\r\nLiberal and Conservative. Eventually he finds that\r\n\r\nhe is no longer crusading on the Left, which might\r\n\r\nhave  been  his  original  intention  but  fellow-travelling with the reactionary Right to which  he\r\n\r\nwas  finally drawn. And he must know that this  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  politics  of  the pre-Rendel  days  when\r\n\r\npeople  had  pretty little speeches  prepared  for\r\n\r\nthem,  and  showed  them to  Colonial  Secretaries\r\n\r\nbefore  they made them in the Chamber so that  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Secretaries could prepare their replies.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a tough business. Power is being  fought\r\n\r\nfor - power  to control the lives of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   power  to  shape  and  unshape   the\r\n\r\nsociety.  One  of the most inept things  that  any\r\n\r\npolitician can do - and I had always thought that at\r\n\r\nleast  the Member for Havelock (Dr Lim Yew  Hock)\r\n\r\nwas  a  skilful politician, who has survived first\r\n\r\nbeing  nominated, then being elected into  a  pre-Rendel  Legislature,  then after  sitting  on  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitutional Commission getting  himself\r\n\r\nelected into the Rendel Legislature, I should have\r\n\r\nthought   that   he  would  have  had   sufficient\r\n\r\npolitical  aptitude - was to come  to  this  Chamber\r\n\r\nthis  morning and repeat all the rumours that have\r\n\r\nbeen   circulating  against  him,  thereby  giving\r\n\r\ncredence to them. Any book on propaganda will tell\r\n\r\nhim  that  the last thing you should  do  about  a\r\n\r\nrumour is to repeat it - worse still, repeat it  and\r\n\r\nthen deny it. Today he repeated the rumour that he\r\n\r\nwas     anti-Chinese     culture,     anti-Chinese\r\n\r\ncivilisation.  He  repeated  the  rumour  that  he\r\n\r\nwanted   to   extend  the  life  of   the   Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution. He repeated the rumour that  he  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  settle with Mr Lennox-Boyd to  be  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara. Why such ineptitude?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the final reason, in my view, why this\r\n\r\nGovernment  has failed and will fail, despite  all\r\n\r\nthe  flourish at the end of the Governor's Speech,\r\n\r\nis  because it has not the capacity to govern.  It\r\n\r\nhad  the civil service run the Government for  it.\r\n\r\nIt  is  an open secret, is it not, that there  are\r\n\r\nwhat is commonly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknown   in   the  civil  service  as   \"PL.   D.W.\r\n\r\nMinisters\".  I am told that the \"PL.\"  stands  for\r\n\r\n\"Please\"   and  \"D.W.\"  for  \"Deal   With\".   When\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants send up enormous  bunches  of\r\n\r\nfiles  to  harass Ministers who already find  that\r\n\r\ntheir  constituents are bothering them  more  than\r\n\r\nthey  expected, with an urgent note at the  botton\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do? Shall we do (a), (b), (c), (d),\r\n\r\n(e)  or (j)\", the Minister puts at the bottom \"PL.\r\n\r\nD.  W.\"  and they go back to be \"dealt with\".  The\r\n\r\nLabour  Front will fail as much because it  lacked\r\n\r\nthe  political aptitude, as well as the  political\r\n\r\ntouch  which  one  could not  expect  of  a  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  The  only thing that  saves  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  from total rot is because there are a  few,\r\n\r\nalthough  very  few, individuals  with  sufficient\r\n\r\nintegrity  and the will to resist a  complete  rot\r\n\r\nfrom  setting  in. But for that, they  would  have\r\n\r\ngone beyond redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said, not as an idle boast, that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will win the elections if they  were  held\r\n\r\ntomorrow,   or  next  year,  short  of   something\r\n\r\ncatastrophic  happening or something very  foolish\r\n\r\nthat  we do. And we will win them, apart from  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  having  a  better  organisation  and\r\n\r\nhaving better personnel, because the other Parties\r\n\r\ndo  not  attempt to understand the  meaning  of  a\r\n\r\nsocial  revolution. Have they not ceased to wonder\r\n\r\nwhy  in  the  last four months the Government  was\r\n\r\njust  swept aside and the attention of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  was focussed on the  City  Council?\r\n\r\nWhy?  Because it had captured the hearts and minds\r\n\r\nof  the workers. [Interruption.] Yes, workers! Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland  does not believe that  men  should  be\r\n\r\ncalled  workers. He thinks that there is  no  such\r\n\r\nthing  as workers. He believes in a working class.\r\n\r\nWell, that is a more Marxist way of putting it and\r\n\r\naccording  to  the Marxists - and I think  they  are\r\n\r\nquite  right in this - there are two types:  workers\r\n\r\nand those who live off workers-drones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> What are you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It rather saddens  me  to  hear\r\n\r\nthat he will be leaving us soon. To think that one\r\n\r\nshould  miss a bayonet target for practice  before\r\n\r\nthe  time is up is a matter for regret. But I also\r\n\r\nwondered how much harm he was doing to the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Government and the colonial system  by  his\r\n\r\nmost untimely interjections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish unduly to demoralise the Government\r\n\r\nbut  let  them ask themselves. Why is it that  the\r\n\r\nLorong  3  fire  had  a public  response  and  the\r\n\r\nspontaneous  goodwill flowing in  which  no  other\r\n\r\nfire in the past had evoked. True, this is an All-Party effort. This is just by way of illustration.\r\n\r\nFor  the first time they begin to understand  that\r\n\r\nthese  magnificent  institutions  like  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil, which they had viewed as institutions  of\r\n\r\nbureaucracy and petty oppression could  be  turned\r\n\r\ninto  public  institutions for  their  protection,\r\n\r\nwelfare  and  benefit. Albeit,  they  needed  some\r\n\r\ncolourful  gesture like throwing out the  mace  to\r\n\r\ndrive the lesson home. But that is the lesson  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front must learn if they want to know  what\r\n\r\nis  going on, and have a chance to compete at all.\r\n\r\nThe  Labour Front leader in the City Council said - as it was reported in the last few days and with a \r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  silent praise  from  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage  press - \"Oh well, let's have the Mayor  of\r\n\r\nPenang  here but let's have none of this  nonsense\r\n\r\nabout,  `Down  with colonialism  and  all  that,'\"\r\n\r\nbecause obviously by implication, his Party is not\r\n\r\nin  favour  of  it. For the first time,  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  is going to mean something to the people.\r\n\r\nIf  we - this year or next year - we are prepared  for\r\n\r\nit any time, - cannot do the same transmutation for\r\n\r\nthe  institutions  of  Government  and  make  them\r\n\r\nbecome   symbols  of  the  people's   rights   and\r\n\r\nprivileges   instead   of  symbols   of   colonial\r\n\r\nbureaucracy and oppression, then at the end of our\r\n\r\nfive-year  term of office, we will be out  on  our\r\n\r\nheels and deserve to perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in pursuit of a social revolution, never pay\r\n\r\nthe  slightest  attention to the  present  English\r\n\r\nlanguage    press.   Praise   from   them    means\r\n\r\ndestruction.  Decide what you have to  do,  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  is  right and press on. The more  they  howl\r\n\r\nagainst you, the more you can be certain that  you\r\n\r\nare  on the right track. For that reason, I  would\r\n\r\nlike to say this for the benefit of the expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers in the City Council. We have the  courage\r\n\r\nand  the  will,  to  govern. We expect  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice including the civil servants of the  local\r\n\r\nGovernment to obey us and do our bidding. If  they\r\n\r\nfoolishly choose to enter the political arena  and\r\n\r\njoin political issue with us, as the President  of\r\n\r\ntheir expatriate association sought to do, writing\r\n\r\nletters to the press saying that the P.A.P. policy\r\n\r\nis going to bring chaos and the whole City Council\r\n\r\nto a halt, then they must expect that they are not\r\n\r\njust  fighting  the Mayor and twelve  Councillors.\r\n\r\nThey are fighting the whole of the P.A.P. Although\r\n\r\nwe  may be in the minority in the City Council, at\r\n\r\nthe  latest  by the end of one year,  it  is  this\r\n\r\nChamber  which will determine what happens  there.\r\n\r\nAny participation by civil servants who oppose  or\r\n\r\nsabotage the political policy of a Party which  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the  constitutional right  to  govern  will\r\n\r\nbring swift and certain retribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is briefly, why the P.A.P. has not\r\n\r\nfailed.  I do not say that if or when we form  the\r\n\r\nGovernment we will succeed where the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nfailed.  But  we  will  certainly  make  a  better\r\n\r\neffort,  and we have this one great advantage.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen Pandora's Box opened and now know  what\r\n\r\nis  inside.  Whoever  forms the  next  Government,\r\n\r\nshould  give this bouquet to the departing  Labour\r\n\r\nFront Government. They charted a minefield.

It is a very foolish and\r\n\r\nunprofitable business. The ex-Chief Minister tried\r\n\r\nit;  he  ceased to be the Chief Minister. He  came\r\n\r\nback  as  the  Member for Cairnhill and  tried  it\r\n\r\nagain;  he  ceased to be the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\nWe  told  the City Council workers that  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil could stand an extra 20 cents per day  per\r\n\r\nworker. The Labour Front and the Lib-Socs who were\r\n\r\nthere for years and years and never gave them even\r\n\r\nfive  cents  more said, \"Double you;  make  it  40\r\n\r\ncents.\"  We  still  said  20  cents  and  we  were\r\n\r\noutvoted.  But in the end it is they who  will  be\r\n\r\noutvoted. We said, \"Prepare for essential services\r\n\r\nto  go  on  in  case  of a strike.\"  The  Liberal-Socialists said, -the Member for Tanglin (Mr John\r\n\r\nEde)  may  not know what is going on in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, and he may not be aware that his  cinemas\r\n\r\nmay close down without electricity - \"Do not prepare\r\n\r\nfor  it.\" And the Straits Times in order to do  us\r\n\r\nharm said, \"P.A.P. are strike breakers.\"!

M.\r\n\r\nJumabhoy)  who said some time ago that  those  who\r\n\r\nscared  away  capital investment in  this  country\r\n\r\nwere \"irresponsible\" politicians. Sir, there is no\r\n\r\nbetter  word than that. All of us including myself\r\n\r\nare  irresponsible politicians in  that  we  never\r\n\r\ngave the people of Singapore a clear-cut policy on\r\n\r\nMerdeka  and we now find that we are to have  only\r\n\r\ninternal self-government. We say that Socialism is\r\n\r\nbest  for  our country and we say that as entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  is  so essential, we must try to  encourage\r\n\r\nmore capital investment. But are we doing that? We\r\n\r\nare  discouraging capital. Sir, I think it is high\r\n\r\ntime  to  consider the dangers which lie ahead  as\r\n\r\nthe  entrepot  trade has been on the  decline  for\r\n\r\nmany  months. Employment is decreasing day by  day\r\n\r\nand   the   possibility  of  a  merger  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  is  getting  further   and\r\n\r\nfurther  away.  These are the  three  main  issues\r\n\r\nwhich we should all try to solve and not the blah,\r\n\r\nblah  political talks. May I ask, \"Has  any  trade\r\n\r\nunion  leader or any champion of the labourers  or\r\n\r\nany adviser to trade union workers in this country\r\n\r\never  said,  `Look, chum, if you want to  increase\r\n\r\nyour living standards and your wages, you must try\r\n\r\nat the same time to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  the  industrial output.'?\"  It  must  be\r\n\r\nexplained  to the workers that by their increasing\r\n\r\nthe   industrial   output  they   are   indirectly\r\n\r\nincreasing  the national income. The irresponsible\r\n\r\npoliticians and irresponsible trade union advisers\r\n\r\nonly  know  how to win votes.

They are irresponsible and corrupted.  They\r\n\r\nuse  Her  Majesty's  power  to  threaten  innocent\r\n\r\npeople. I think it is high time to check that. Why\r\n\r\ncannot the Chief Secretary try to get advice  from\r\n\r\nHongkong, to recruit more Chinese into the  police\r\n\r\nforce,   to  recruit  more  intelligent,  educated\r\n\r\ndetectives?  If  Hongkong  can  do  it,  why   not\r\n\r\nSingapore?   It   is  high   time   to   have   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding and friendly police force. You  must\r\n\r\nadmit that not only the language barrier, not only\r\n\r\nthe  custom or the tradition barrier, but also the\r\n\r\nwhole  set-up is made of rock. It is not  made  of\r\n\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to touch on is the\r\n\r\nimportation of publications. Just now the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  said that the  people  blame  his\r\n\r\nGovernment for being against Chinese education and\r\n\r\nagainst  Chinese culture. I think he deserves  it.\r\n\r\nMaybe  he  should  throw the blame  on  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary. The Chief Secretary is very  unfair  on\r\n\r\nthis  question. I have a lot of books sent  to  me\r\n\r\nfrom  Hongkong and sometimes from China. Some  are\r\n\r\npurely   pictorial  magazines  and  some   Chinese\r\n\r\nfiction.  But  always I have a chit saying,  \"This\r\n\r\npublication  is  being  kept  in  custody  by  the\r\n\r\nChinese Secretariat. If you want to claim it under\r\n\r\nsection  so  and so of such and such an Ordinance,\r\n\r\nyou can; otherwise it will not be released.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the Sin Pao, Sir, they have banned\r\n\r\nit.  Maybe  the Government have all  the  evidence\r\n\r\nagainst  it of which I am not aware. But,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  know  how many Hongkong sexy yellow newspapers\r\n\r\nhave been imported into the colony. Sir, the local\r\n\r\nmosquito papers live on fabricating a lot of  sexy\r\n\r\nstories  and  printing  nude  pictures,  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment just simply ignore them. Naturally  the\r\n\r\nyoung  and  inexperienced Chinese school  boys  or\r\n\r\nteachers  will be misled by them. Sir, we  do  not\r\n\r\nlike  such poisonous and undesirable publications.\r\n\r\nThe  Government not only banned the Sin  Pao,  but\r\n\r\nthey  brought its editors to court. Naturally this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  branded  as  not  being  able   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  Chinese  culture. Therefore  they  are\r\n\r\nanti-Chinese culture. Although they know that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  intellectuals are against yellow culture,\r\n\r\nyet  they  allow yellow pamphlets,  magazines  and\r\n\r\nnewspapers published abroad to come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the last point, Sir, why do the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not boldly say, \"We want to  carry  on\r\n\r\nwith this Government until 1959. We want to finish\r\n\r\nthe  term.\"?  Why do the Government not  say,  \"We\r\n\r\nsupport compulsory voting.\"? Why do the Government\r\n\r\nnot  say,  \"We have a lot of things to do,  so  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  carry on another few months.\"?  But  now\r\n\r\nthey  say  the  delay  is  because  of  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting.  Without compulsory voting, they say  they\r\n\r\ncan  fulfil  their  promise to  hold  the  general\r\n\r\nelection  in August or September. I challenge  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister to be so bold as to say  that  the\r\n\r\npostponing of the general elections to  next  year\r\n\r\nhas  nothing to do with compulsory voting. He must\r\n\r\nnot  mislead  the public into believing  that  his\r\n\r\nGovernment is sincere and determined to  have  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections in September, but this damn fool\r\n\r\nMember for Changi introduced-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is well aware that  its  term  of\r\n\r\noffice  is nearing its end and that elections  are\r\n\r\naround   the   corner - though  the  Government   is\r\n\r\nreluctant to tell us how big that corner is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Excellency's speech begins with casual\r\n\r\nreferences   to  the  forthcoming   Assembly   and\r\n\r\nDistrict Council elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ends with a not so casual reference to the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections  and  to  the  time  when  this\r\n\r\nGovernment will have \"to lay down its office.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention these facts because I think it will\r\n\r\nhelp  us  to understand a little more clearly  all\r\n\r\nthe  fine and praiseworthy sentiments which appear\r\n\r\nbetween  the opening and closing passages  of  the\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appears in between is a shop-window display\r\n\r\nfor  the election season to remind the people that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is prepared to do  in  the  fourth\r\n\r\nyear of its office what it could have done in  the\r\n\r\nthree years that went before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, Sir, the programme appears a little\r\n\r\ncrowded. The Government is going to combat  crime,\r\n\r\ngangsterism and secret society thugs. It is  going\r\n\r\nto  carry  out a survey of the Colony's industrial\r\n\r\npotential  and  markets. It is  going  to  promote\r\n\r\nlargescale  industries. It is going  to  encourage\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade and tourism. It is going  to  grow\r\n\r\nmore  food  and promote rural development.  It  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give every child the chance  to  get  a\r\n\r\nprimary education up to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nage  of  14.  There are going to be more  schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals  and houses - in fact, more of everything.\r\n\r\nIt is going to introduce a social insurance scheme\r\n\r\nbased on the Caine and Brocklehurst Reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not exhaust the list of good things to\r\n\r\ncome  but  all these are going to be done  in  the\r\n\r\nnext few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, Sir, the fourth year is going to be\r\n\r\nremembered  as a year of promise and a far  busier\r\n\r\nyear than all the other three years put together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may even leave the Government little time to\r\n\r\nthink  about  or prepare for the District  Council\r\n\r\nand Assembly elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bothers me is why the Government has waited\r\n\r\nuntil  the  last  few months of  its  life  before\r\n\r\ntrying to start its social revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government's programme is to be fully\r\n\r\nimplemented, it will involve great changes to  our\r\n\r\nsocial and economic structure. It may be that  all\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government intends to do is  merely  to\r\n\r\npass  a  number of Bills proposing this  and  that\r\n\r\nchange - a paper social revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, the Government pledges itself,\r\n\r\nto use its own words, \"to safeguard the welfare of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, to raise their level  of\r\n\r\nliving  and  to  use  this  last  Session  towards\r\n\r\nachieving these ends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it had more time at its disposal than\r\n\r\nit actually has, it can only redeem this pledge by\r\n\r\nfighting  those  who  have a  vested  interest  in\r\n\r\npreserving the present order of things. It must be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  plan its economy which means  seeing\r\n\r\nthat   there  is  a  greater  control   over   the\r\n\r\nactivities of private enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its programme means finding the money to finance\r\n\r\nthese things. This means increased taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet all these years the Government has been\r\n\r\nreluctant to do these things, much to the  delight\r\n\r\nof  the  Liberal-Socialists  who  like  socialism,\r\n\r\nprovided  the wealthy remain wealthy and there  is\r\n\r\nno  interference by Government with the  financial\r\n\r\nactivities of the wealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's programme therefore means\r\n\r\nnothing,  because  it is a harmless  film  trailer\r\n\r\npromising  \"stupendous\", \"colossal\"  and  \"mighty\"\r\n\r\nthings  which will eventually prove to be  nothing\r\n\r\nof the sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough to say that you are going to do\r\n\r\nthis  or  that during the few months left  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. A government which really wants to  do\r\n\r\nthese  things  must have the will and  courage  to\r\n\r\nmeet the fierce opposition of vested interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent events in the City Council are examples of\r\n\r\nhow  local  reactionaries and expatriate officials\r\n\r\nof  the  City  Council will join  hands  to  fight\r\n\r\nprogress where it hurts their privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Labour Front will do no more than\r\n\r\ndeclare  their  pious intentions in these  things.\r\n\r\nThere  may  be a few people who mean well  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front. But it requires more than just a few\r\n\r\nwell-meaning types to make the social revolution a\r\n\r\nreality. That is the tragedy of the Labour  Front.\r\n\r\nToo  many  bad  types,  too  few  good  ones.  The\r\n\r\nultimate  result  is a foregone  conclusion.  They\r\n\r\nhave my sympathies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing the speeches from the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar and the Member for Changi, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know where I am. I hear of the Right. I  hear\r\n\r\nof the Left. And now I hear of the Left within the\r\n\r\nRight, or the Right within the Left. As far  as  I\r\n\r\nam  aware, we have the Rightists and we  have  the\r\n\r\nLeftists. But now I come to know that there  is  a\r\n\r\nRight  within the Left. What that means, I  really\r\n\r\ncannot  understand. Now who belongs to this  class\r\n\r\nof  people? The old saying goes: \"Whoever the  cap\r\n\r\nfits,  let  him  wear it.\" The Malays  say:  Siapa\r\n\r\nmakan chilli rasa pedas. (Those who eat the chilli\r\n\r\nwill  feel hot.) Really I would like to  know  who\r\n\r\nbelong to this category of people - who are in  fact\r\n\r\nthe Right within the Left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these speeches, instead of concentrating\r\n\r\non  the  Governor's Speech, are  more  or  less  a\r\n\r\nchallenge   to   every  Member  in  this   House - a\r\n\r\nchallenge issued by the leader of the P.A.P., the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar. He says  that  whoever\r\n\r\ndare  go  against the P.A.P. in the  next  general\r\n\r\nelections  will collapse. It would appear  to  me,\r\n\r\nSir,   from  what  he  says,  that  no  Party   or\r\n\r\nIndependent  should go against the P.A.P. in  the\r\n\r\nelections - that  the Labour Front should  not  take\r\n\r\npart;  neither should the Liberal-Socialists  take\r\n\r\npart.  If  the P.A.P. contest the elections  alone\r\n\r\nand  have  a walkover in all divisions, then  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  will have nothing but 51 P.A.P. Members.\r\n\r\nThen  where is the Opposition? Where is the chance\r\n\r\nof  opposition? Is this a challenge to everyone of\r\n\r\nus  here? After this challenge, Sir, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  know  how many of the present Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  are prepared to come forward and fight  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections.  The Member  for  Changi  says\r\n\r\nthere is only one hero in Singapore, and he is the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar. So if there  is  anyone\r\n\r\nwho  is prepared to accept that challenge,  he  is\r\n\r\nmore of a hero than the hero himself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every candidate who stands for election\r\n\r\ncertainly  looks forward to winning. The  Liberal-Socialists fielded candidates in all the divisions\r\n\r\nfor  the  City  Council elections.  What  was  the\r\n\r\nresult?  They gained only a few seats. The  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  was  also  confident of  winning  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  elections. What was the result? They  had\r\n\r\nonly  three or four seats. How can we predict that\r\n\r\nwe  are sure of winning the elections? Let me  see\r\n\r\nwhether  that prediction of the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  will come true. If the prediction does  not\r\n\r\ncome  true,  I wonder what will be the consequence\r\n\r\nfor  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  since  he  has\r\n\r\nboasted  that his Party will come into power.  Let\r\n\r\nall   of  us  stand  for  the  elections  to   the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly. Let us hope  for  a  stable\r\n\r\ngovernment, irrespective of which Party comes  in,\r\n\r\nrather  than  boast that it is the  Leftist  Party\r\n\r\nthat  will  come into power. Unfortunately  within\r\n\r\nthat  Leftist Party there is a Right. So where  is\r\n\r\nthe Leftist Party, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Governor's Speech, I will read\r\n\r\nthis paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore exists because of its trade. Under the\r\n\r\nnew  Constitution the Government of the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  acting with the assent of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  power  to  initiate  and  conduct\r\n\r\nmatters  concerning  trade and cultural  relations\r\n\r\nwith other countries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is it necessary that we should have the\r\n\r\nassent  of the United Kingdom Government regarding\r\n\r\ntrade?  Are  we not going to have self-government?\r\n\r\nIf  we are going to have self-government cannot we\r\n\r\nconsider  ourselves  fit to decide  on  our  trade\r\n\r\nrelations? Singapore is a free trading  port  and,\r\n\r\nas  such, we should certainly be allowed to decide\r\n\r\non  our trading relations with anybody we want  if\r\n\r\nit  is  in the interests and for the good  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was not a member of the delegation that\r\n\r\nwent  to  the constitutional talks. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  this  clause was included  in  the  draft\r\n\r\nconstitution or not. If it was there, then I  have\r\n\r\nvery  little to say, because it was agreed by  the\r\n\r\nAll-Party delegation of this House. If it was  not\r\n\r\nthere,  I hope that the next delegation to  London\r\n\r\n(the Chief Minister says it will be going soon)\r\n\r\nwill see that this clause is not in it and that we\r\n\r\nhave a free hand to decide on our trade relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the political Parties in this\r\n\r\nAssembly want to kill the Liberal-Socialist Party.\r\n\r\nEvery  time a Member stands up, he says,  \"Let  us\r\n\r\nkill  the  Liberal-Socialist Party\", because  that\r\n\r\nParty is accused of being a capitalist Party. So I\r\n\r\nam  of the opinion that, by including that clause,\r\n\r\nyou  will, in the first instance, kill trade,  and\r\n\r\nif  you kill trade, you will kill capital, and  by\r\n\r\nkilling  capital,  you will  indirectly  kill  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists - and   I   hope   the   Liberal-Socialists will wake up to that issue!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point is the mention of cordial\r\n\r\nrelations with the Government of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya. This is what the Governor said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Again, since the Second Session of this\r\n\r\nAssembly, the Federation of Malaya has emerged  as\r\n\r\na  sovereign independent state. The Government  is\r\n\r\nhappy to record the continued cordial relationship\r\n\r\nwhich  it  enjoys  with  the  Government  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>Sir, the Chief Minister has said this morning that\r\n\r\nhe  has  not  received  any  indication  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  regarding  travel   passes\r\n\r\nacross   the   causeway.  Now   if   this   should\r\n\r\nmaterialise,  then  it  is going  to  be  serious,\r\n\r\nbecause   it  is  going  to  affect  that  cordial\r\n\r\nrelationship  which the Governor has mentioned.  I\r\n\r\nonly  hope that it will not materialise, but  from\r\n\r\nthe  publicity that has been given  in  the  local\r\n\r\nPress,  I  think  it will. Now  with  the  cordial\r\n\r\nrelationship  not between the two Governments  but\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Prime Minister of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya   and  the  Chief  Minister  of  Singapore - because they have had cordial relations and drinks\r\n\r\ntogether - I hope the Chief Minister will  carefully\r\n\r\nlook  into this question of travel passes and  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  Federation of Malaya  does  not  impose\r\n\r\nthem,  so  as to maintain the cordial relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and the Federation.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  this  morning has said that  one  cannot\r\n\r\nexist  without the other. Neither can one  prosper\r\n\r\nwithout the other. Sir, if it is his view that one\r\n\r\ncannot  exist or prosper without the  other,  then\r\n\r\nlet travel over the causeway be free. There should\r\n\r\nbe  no  bar.  Then we will have, in  fact,  actual\r\n\r\ncordial relationship between the two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the general elections, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi is right. Whether we  hold  the\r\n\r\nelections this year or next year, the question  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting  does  not  come  in.  If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is serious in having early elections, I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure it could set up the  machinery  to\r\n\r\nmeet the deadline. Now, the Governor in his speech\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government intends to recommend to the\r\n\r\nAssembly  the holding of elections for an enlarged\r\n\r\nAssembly under the new Constitution as soon as  it\r\n\r\nis practically possible to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\"As  soon as it is practically possible to do so.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a vague term, Sir! How long will this be? One\r\n\r\nyear,  two years, or three years? Whether you  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to delay the elections, or whether you  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have early elections, there must  be  a\r\n\r\ntarget  date, and if there is one, then Government\r\n\r\ncan  work  towards it. Without a target date,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  give any amount of  excuses.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar has said  this  morning\r\n\r\nthat any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount  of  excuses can be given if the Government\r\n\r\nwants  to  carry on. If the Government is serious,\r\n\r\nlet  it name that target date and let it not  hold\r\n\r\nthe  public in suspense. Every Member on this side\r\n\r\nof the House has asked for an early election and I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that  we  are all  keen  to  have  early\r\n\r\nelections.  But the Government has said  no,  just\r\n\r\nbecause   of  compulsory  voting.  Let  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting  be  one  issue  and  early  elections   be\r\n\r\nanother. As the Member for Changi has said, if the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot have early elections,  then  let\r\n\r\nit  come out boldly and say, \"We cannot have them,\r\n\r\nnot  because of compulsory voting, but because  we\r\n\r\ncannot  complete  our  machinery  to  have   early\r\n\r\nelections  this  year.\" But whatever  may  be  the\r\n\r\nreason,  Sir, I still say that there should  be  a\r\n\r\ntarget  date  for us to aim at. Without  a  target\r\n\r\ndate  you cannot aim at anything, and without  any\r\n\r\naim you get nowhere. Where can you get to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.
