This will ensure that the meat sold in the wet markets\r\n\r\nis safe and hygienic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stallholders selling pork in wet markets will have to\r\n\r\ninstall  display  chillers by 1st November 1999.  Those  selling\r\n\r\npoultry have one year to put in their display chillers and those\r\n\r\nselling mutton and beef 18 months to do likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stallholders will have to buy the display chillers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  The  cost  of the chiller, at  between  $3,000  and\r\n\r\n$6,000,  is  not exorbitant. The investment in a  chiller  is  a\r\n\r\nbusiness decision that stallholders need to make if they wish to\r\n\r\nremain in the business of selling meat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, three finance companies have informed my Ministry\r\n\r\nthat they are prepared to offer loans of between 80% and 95%  of\r\n\r\nthe  cost of the chillers, with repayment over one to four years\r\n\r\nand interest rates of between 3.5% and 4% per annum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four suppliers of chillers have also agreed to allow\r\n\r\ninterest-free instalment payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government on its part will spend some $6.5 million to\r\n\r\nupgrade  electricity  supply in the wet markets  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nchillers to operate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  if  ENV  would assist those meat sellers  in  our  wet\r\n\r\nmarkets who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave financial difficulties to retrofit and install the chillers\r\n\r\nin their stalls?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I mentioned just now, those\r\n\r\nstallholders who are facing difficulties paying for the chillers\r\n\r\ncan  obtain  loans to buy the chillers.  They can get  the  loan\r\n\r\nfrom  the  finance companies and, as I mentioned,  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies   are  prepared  to  offer  4-year  loans  at   fairly\r\n\r\nattractive interest rates of 3.5% to 4%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> In such circumstances, would the Minister\r\n\r\nconsider installing the chillers for them and allowing  them  to\r\n\r\npay by instalments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it is best for the stallholders to\r\n\r\ndecide  which  particular  chiller  best  meets  their  business\r\n\r\nvolume.  If they are prepared to pay by instalments, they  might\r\n\r\nas  well  get  the  loans directly from the  finance  companies.\r\n\r\nAssuming  they get a bigger chiller which costs $6,000 and  they\r\n\r\npay  over  four  years  or 50 repayments, I  think  the  monthly\r\n\r\ninstalment is very affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Could the Minister\r\n\r\ngive  some  ballpark figures of the cost of the chiller  or  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  instalments vis-a-vis the monthly rental or the average\r\n\r\nincome of these stallholders?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it depends very much on the size\r\n\r\nof  the chiller and the length of the repayment period that they\r\n\r\nopt  for.   If  you  take a smaller chiller  which  costs  about\r\n\r\n$3,000,  and divide it by three years, it is $1,000  a  year  or\r\n\r\nabout  $100 a month.   Some of the stallholders sell up to about\r\n\r\n10 pigs a day which would fetch them a turnover of about $3,500.\r\n\r\nIn  terms of the cost per month versus the turnover, I think the\r\n\r\ncost comprises a very small percentage of the turnover.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, that is a percentage of the\r\n\r\nturnover.  What about the percentage of the income?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we do not know exactly how much\r\n\r\nthe hawkers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake.   But my assumption is that the profit level must be quite\r\n\r\nattractive  because  there are about 1,000 stallholders  selling\r\n\r\npork  in  Singapore and the fact that already  107  stallholders\r\n\r\nhave  placed their orders for the chillers shows that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  decision which they are prepared to take and make  and\r\n\r\nthe purchase of the chillers still makes the business of selling\r\n\r\npork a very viable and attractive one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  a  serious question whether he would start a  campaign\r\n\r\nfor people to eat more vegetables and fish?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in my other hat, as the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health,  in  fact,  that is what we have  been  doing,  ie,\r\n\r\nencouraging  Singaporeans  to live  a  healthy  lifestyle  which\r\n\r\nincludes  having  a  well-balanced diet.  This  means  not  just\r\n\r\nhaving meat but also having a healthy spread of other items like\r\n\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhy  the  stallholders must install chillers now and not before,\r\n\r\nand  could  chillers solve the problem of Japanese  Encephalitis\r\n\r\n(JE)?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in fact, the plan to move to the\r\n\r\ncold  chain has been in discussion for quite some time  and  the\r\n\r\nrecent  episode of JE and the Nipah virus highlighted  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  speed up this plan.  Why do we need to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nchilled  meat and the cold chain system?  Under the old  system,\r\n\r\nthe  animals were slaughtered and they were straightaway brought\r\n\r\nto  the markets, which means there was very little time for  the\r\n\r\nproper analysis to be carried out as to whether that pig was  in\r\n\r\nany  way infected.  By having the chilled meat system, it allows\r\n\r\nthe  abattoirs  to  hold on to the meat after slaughter  and  it\r\n\r\nensures  that the blood and the internal organs can be  properly\r\n\r\nanalysed.  By having the chilled meat system we will in fact  be\r\n\r\nin  a  better position to assure Singaporeans that the meat that\r\n\r\nthey buy from the markets is well inspected and found to be free\r\n\r\nof diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> What this really means is that in a way\r\n\r\nconsumers  have no choice in the matter.  Is it not possible  to\r\n\r\nleave this as a matter of choice?  In other words, for those who\r\n\r\nwant chillers to be installed, by all means install chillers and\r\n\r\nthe basis of that is a possible improvement in health; for those\r\n\r\nwho want to continue to eat fresh meat,  allow them to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, once the meat is chilled it is\r\n\r\nproper and best to sell it as chilled.  The reason is that  when\r\n\r\nthe meat is chilled and left in the open, especially in our very\r\n\r\nhumid environment, a lot of moisture forms on the meat and  that\r\n\r\nactually speeds up deterioration of the meat.  So we must ensure\r\n\r\nthat the meat remains chilled up to the point of sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DETECTION OF NIPAH VIRUS IN SHEEP AND DOGS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Steps to monitor development)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Gerard Ee -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

Currently,\r\n\r\nlittle is known about the new Nipah virus.  Experts from the  US\r\n\r\nCenter  of  Disease  Control and Prevention,  Atlanta,  and  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  Animal  Health Laboratories are still  investigating\r\n\r\nthe  cases  in  Malaysia and carrying out more  studies  on  the\r\n\r\nnature and epidemiology of the Nipah virus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been recent reports of Nipah virus\r\n\r\ninfection in dogs and goats in Malaysia, there is no risk of the\r\n\r\nspread  of the Nipah virus to Singapore via animal hosts.   This\r\n\r\nis because PPD has imposed a ban on the import of all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmammals,  including  goats and dogs, from  Malaysia  since  19th\r\n\r\nMarch  1999.

PPD will not lift this ban until it is  confident\r\n\r\nthat  the  import  of animals will not pose a danger  to  public\r\n\r\nhealth.   PPD  and the Customs Department have also  stepped  up\r\n\r\nsurveillance  to  prevent smuggling of  meat  and  animals  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, PPD is also monitoring closely the situation\r\n\r\nand  developments in Malaysia, especially the recent  occurrence\r\n\r\nof  the  Nipah virus in Johor.

Sir, in March this year, during\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  debate,  Prof. Chin and Mr Chay  Wai  Chuen  raised\r\n\r\nsimilar queries about the penalties for ERP violations. Most ERP\r\n\r\nviolations arise from motorists either inserting their Cashcards\r\n\r\nimproperly, or forgetting to insert their Cashcards,  or  having\r\n\r\ninsufficient balances in their Cashcards.  As it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  motorists  to  evade detection under  the  ERP  system,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  agrees  that such violations are  not  due  to  wilful\r\n\r\ndisregard for our rules but to forgetfulness or carelessness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then informed the House that the Land Transport Authority\r\n\r\n(LTA)  was  working out a scheme to allow motorists  who  commit\r\n\r\nthese   ERP   violations  to  pay  the  ERP   charges   and   an\r\n\r\nadministrative  surcharge.   I am pleased to announce  that  the\r\n\r\nLTA has finalised the details of this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the revised system, motorists who forget to insert\r\n\r\ntheir  Cashcards  into the IUs or have insufficient  balance  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Cashcards  when  passing through ERP  gantries,  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  pay the applicable ERP fee plus an  administrative\r\n\r\nsurcharge within two weeks of the violation.  The administrative\r\n\r\nsurcharge is currently set at $10. The LTA will send a letter to\r\n\r\nthe  motorist informing him of the violation, and requesting him\r\n\r\nto  pay up the charges within two weeks.  If he does not  do  so\r\n\r\nwithin the 2-week period, he will then have to pay a composition\r\n\r\nfine of $70.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will announce implementation details of this scheme\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Neo's suggestion on a monthly or 6-monthly invoice, my Ministry had considered such a central\r\n\r\nbilling  system for the collection of ERP charges and violations\r\n\r\nwhen the ERP system was first designed but opted for the present\r\n\r\nsmart-card  system for several reasons.  This  is  because   the\r\n\r\nsmart-card  system  does away with the  need  for  an  expensive\r\n\r\ncentral  accounting billing operation. It also  makes  motorists\r\n\r\nmore  conscious  of  the cost of motoring as  the  deduction  is\r\n\r\nimmediate each time the vehicle passes under a gantry.  Finally,\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent   system  using  Cashcards  also  safeguards  individual\r\n\r\nprivacy  as  details  of  movements of motorists  would  not  be\r\n\r\nmonitored.   Nevertheless,  we  will  continue  to  monitor  the\r\n\r\nsituation and refine the system as and when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether the current defaulters are still liable for the\r\n\r\ncomposition fine or they will be treated under the new scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in order for the new scheme to come\r\n\r\ninto   operation,  changes  will  have  to  be   made   to   the\r\n\r\nadministrative  system and that will take some time.   LTA  will\r\n\r\nrequire  some more time before it can implement the system.   So\r\n\r\ncurrent defaulters under the scheme would continue to be treated\r\n\r\naccording to the present administrative regime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister about the administrative charge of $10?  Could  he\r\n\r\nenlighten   the   House  as  to  what  is  it  for   that   this\r\n\r\nadministrative charge is levied?  Is it for sending a notice  to\r\n\r\nthe owner of the car?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as the name suggests, the\r\n\r\nadministrative charge is to cover all the costs related  to  the\r\n\r\nadministration of this new scheme which include the tracking  of\r\n\r\nthe  offences, making sure that the motorists who do not pay the\r\n\r\nERP charge do so within the two weeks and if they do not, making\r\n\r\nsure that they are issued the composition fine of $70.  All this\r\n\r\ninvolves  administration, manpower, computer time  and  it  also\r\n\r\ninvolves  the setting up of a total framework to make sure  that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  violation scheme is not abused.  After all, the purpose\r\n\r\nof  this scheme is to make sure that motorists do use the system\r\n\r\nas  it is intended, which is to have an IU installed, to have  a\r\n\r\nvalid  CashCard  inserted and to make  sure  that  each  time  a\r\n\r\nmotorist  uses  an ERP-controlled road, he pays the  fee.   More\r\n\r\nthan 99% of people do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater to the small group of people who forget to do so,\r\n\r\nwe  have  amended the system, according to feedback from Members\r\n\r\nof this House.  We agree that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  the ERP system, nobody can escape.  Unlike the old system\r\n\r\nwhere people had to put up a disc, and some who did not put up a\r\n\r\ndisc  were  not people who forgot to do so, but were people  who\r\n\r\nwere  out  to cheat the system.  And that was when a composition\r\n\r\nfine  was imposed.  Under the ERP system, such a situation  does\r\n\r\nnot  occur, because every motorist who passes through the gantry\r\n\r\nwill  be detected.  So, on that basis, we have decided to change\r\n\r\nthe system, and I hope motorists will continue to use the system\r\n\r\nas  it  is intended.  But if they do not for whatever reason   - forgetfulness, carelessness or whatever  -   they are not overly\r\n\r\npenalised, as it were.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am thankful to the Minister for the\r\n\r\nlengthy  reply  he has given, but I regret it  does  not  really\r\n\r\nanswer my question.  Would he set out specifically what is  this\r\n\r\nadministration for which $10 appears to be the  just punishment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not know where the hon. Member got\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  a  punishment from.  I have just gone  through  a\r\n\r\nlengthy reply to the Member of the House to explain to him  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not regard this as an offence.  We regard this  as  non-payment of a fee.  We wish to collect that fee and therefore  we\r\n\r\nhave  to go through this exercise.  The process of going through\r\n\r\nthat  exercise incurs expenses and manpower, and the charge  for\r\n\r\nthis  expense and manpower is, at the moment, $10.  It could  go\r\n\r\nup, if the cost of administration goes up.  But as far as we are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  at  this  stage,  we  are  recovering  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nadministration, plus the ERP fee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, would the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain why he finds it fit to levy a $70 compound fine when the\r\n\r\ncurrent fine, I believe, is $30?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, if the letter asking for payment is\r\n\r\nsent  out and if within two weeks,  no reply is given,  that  is\r\n\r\ntantamount to an offence.  For such an offence, a levy of $70 is\r\n\r\ndeemed  to be the charge.

Together with the\r\n\r\nVehicle  Quota  System, they keep our roads flowing  freely,  so\r\n\r\nthat  goods  and  people do not get stuck in traffic  jams.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, and this is in response to Mr Tay's question,  the\r\n\r\nERP  has  had a positive impact on business, not only in  direct\r\n\r\ncash terms but also in terms of faster travel times that lead to\r\n\r\noverall  lowering of transport costs.  This ultimately helps  us\r\n\r\nto  maintain  our competitiveness as an efficient  international\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, logistics and business centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our vehicle population expands, in order to cater to\r\n\r\ngrowing demands from business and to meet the aspirations of our\r\n\r\npeople,  the  challenge to keep congestion at  bay  will  become\r\n\r\nincreasingly more difficult.  Our choices are limited.   We  can\r\n\r\nbuild  more  roads,  but  we will have  to  sacrifice  land  for\r\n\r\nhousing,  schools, industries and recreation.  This  is  not  an\r\n\r\noption  for  most  Singaporeans.  We can  restrain  car  growth.\r\n\r\nAgain,  this  is  not  an  option  if  we  are  to  give   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and those who can afford their chance to own a car.\r\n\r\nFinally,  we can manage the traffic on our roads, by encouraging\r\n\r\nbetter  use of our limited road space through ERP.  This is  the\r\n\r\npreferred option.\r\n\r\nWith ERP, motorists are more careful about using their vehicles.\r\n\r\nThey  have  several choices.  Do they have to drive?   Can  they\r\n\r\ntake  a  bus  or  train?  Can they share a car with  friends  or\r\n\r\ncolleagues? Or can they switch their travel to a less  congested\r\n\r\ntime?  If they really need to drive at peak hours, they are free\r\n\r\nto  do  so, and in return for a small fee, they enjoy a smoother\r\n\r\nand faster ride.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with ERP and ALS has been positive. In\r\n\r\n1975,  when  road  pricing was first introduced,  total  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation  was 280,000.  Today, it is 680,000, an  increase  of\r\n\r\nalmost  150%.   Over  the  same period,  our  road  network  has\r\n\r\nincreased by 44%.  Trips made by public transport has gone up by\r\n\r\nabout  90%.   The bottom line is that while cars have increased,\r\n\r\nour  roads are still free-flowing because more people are  using\r\n\r\npublic transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, pockets of congestion are appearing in areas\r\n\r\noutside  the CBD and along the expressways.  Moreover, they  are\r\n\r\nspreading  from the morning to the evening peak hours  as  well.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not surprising as our vehicle population is continuing\r\n\r\nto expand faster than our road capacity.  That is why we need to\r\n\r\nexpand the ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA will shortly announce the exact locations of the\r\n\r\nfirst  seven  gantries to be implemented on 1st September  1999.\r\n\r\nOther  gantries  will be considered when the traffic  conditions\r\n\r\ndemand them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai asked about the rates that will be charged at these\r\n\r\ngantries.  They will only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  fixed closer to the date of implementation, ie, in September\r\n\r\n1999, based on the prevailing traffic conditions then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked about lowering charges for commercial\r\n\r\nvehicles.  When ERP was introduced last year, the Government, as\r\n\r\npromised, lowered  the cost of vehicle ownership.  Up-front  and\r\n\r\nannual  ownership  taxes  such as Customs  Duties,  Registration\r\n\r\nFees,   Additional   Registration  Fees  and   road   tax   were\r\n\r\nsignificantly   reduced.   The  majority  of   vehicle   owners,\r\n\r\nincluding  owners  of  commercial vehicles, enjoyed  substantial\r\n\r\nsavings in annual road tax, ranging from about $280 per year for\r\n\r\ncars to as much as $2,000 per year for commercial vehicles.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  all  vehicle owners were given a road tax  rebate  of\r\n\r\n$200 per PCU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also helped businesses to adjust to ERP by phasing\r\n\r\nin   the  charges  for  commercial  vehicles  over  four  years.\r\n\r\nCurrently, commercial vehicles pay only a quarter of their  full\r\n\r\nERP  rates,  except for the CTE, where they pay half  the  rate.\r\n\r\nWhether  it  is quarter or half, this is still much  lower  than\r\n\r\nwhat they were paying under the manual road pricing scheme.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  owners of commercial vehicles will save about $63 million\r\n\r\nin the first year of ERP implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked for a comparison between the ERP and the\r\n\r\nmanual  Area Licensing Scheme (ALS).  With ERP, traffic  is  now\r\n\r\nbetter  spread  out with charges corresponding more  closely  to\r\n\r\ntraffic  conditions. Travel speeds in the Restricted  Zone  (RZ)\r\n\r\nrange  from 20 to 30 km per hour and on the expressways  between\r\n\r\n45  and  65  km  per  hour.   At these  speeds,  the  roads  and\r\n\r\nexpressways are carrying close to their designed capacity  while\r\n\r\nremaining congestion free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERP rates are also lower than the corresponding ALS fees.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the ALS fee for cars was $3.00 during peak periods\r\n\r\nand $2.00 during off-peak periods. Now, with ERP, the Restricted\r\n\r\nZone  rates range from $1.00 to $2.50.  And on Saturdays, it  is\r\n\r\nnow free entry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government revenue from ERP today is about 60% of the\r\n\r\nrevenue under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  manual  ALS/RPS  schemes.  This  is  expected  to  decrease\r\n\r\nfurther following the last rate adjustment in April 1999,  which\r\n\r\nsaw  the  lifting of ERP on Saturdays and reductions in  charges\r\n\r\nfor  some  time periods in the RZ and on one of the Expressways.\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates clearly that ERP is a traffic management tool,\r\n\r\nnot  a  revenue-generating instrument.  The objective of ERP,  I\r\n\r\nrepeat  again, is to keep our roads congestion free  and  smooth\r\n\r\nflowing  while allowing our vehicle population to increase.   In\r\n\r\nso  doing,  it helps to maintain Singapore as an attractive  and\r\n\r\nefficient place to live in and do business in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that the ERP\r\n\r\nsystem  has  led to an overall lowering of transport  costs  and\r\n\r\nthat  Government revenue has decreased to 60% of that under  the\r\n\r\nALS  scheme.  However, we do not know from the consumers'  point\r\n\r\nof  view, in other words, the motorists' point of view,  whether\r\n\r\nit  has  actually  taken  them  a longer  time  to  reach  their\r\n\r\ndestinations  because  of travelling on alternative  routes,  or\r\n\r\nthat  they  actually had to rearrange their  time  schedules  in\r\n\r\norder  to have a reduction in terms of price.  Therefore, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  know that from the motorists'  point  of  view\r\n\r\nthere  is  an overall reduction in terms of all sorts of  costs,\r\n\r\nincluding time.  Would the Minister therefore consider  doing  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  to  find  out  from motorists  how  they  have  actually\r\n\r\nadjusted  their traffic patterns and whether they have saved  in\r\n\r\nterms not only of cost but also in terms of time travelled?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the purpose of the ERP is not just to\r\n\r\nspread  the  traffic.  If we take it from the point of  view  of\r\n\r\nwhat Dr Lee mentioned where people are just avoiding the traffic\r\n\r\njams  alone,  I think that in itself is not going to  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   The  purpose of this exercise is to offer  more  than\r\n\r\njust  that  option.   There  are other  options  involved  which\r\n\r\ninclude  -  and this is most important  -  either a forgoing  of\r\n\r\ntrips  because  the  trips are not necessary  or  a  shift  from\r\n\r\nprivate to public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not done a comprehensive survey because we have\r\n\r\njust started to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimplement the system.  Such a survey will be part of the overall\r\n\r\nstrategic traffic studies that are done on a regular basis,  and\r\n\r\nthese  figures will come out.  But the overall impact of ERP  as\r\n\r\nfar  as direct Government revenue is concerned is that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  reduction.   In  other words,  motorists  are  actually\r\n\r\nkeeping  40%  of  the money.  What do they do with  this  money?\r\n\r\nWhether they decide to keep it and to travel longer distance  or\r\n\r\nthey  decide to keep it and use it for public transport or  they\r\n\r\ndecide to share a car with their colleagues and split the  cost,\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  not  know at the moment.  But we have  given  them\r\n\r\nseveral  choices.  It is up to them.  And if they  believe  that\r\n\r\ntheir time is not worth the money that they need to spend to pay\r\n\r\nERP  or  if  they  believe that a train is more comfortable  and\r\n\r\nfaster, which in some cases it is, that is also their choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCHOLARSHIPS BY PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>AND STATUTORY BOARDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Abolition of awards)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Prime Minister whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  abolish awarding scholarships  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission and statutory boards and, if so, when.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCHOLARS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Breaking of service bonds)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether\r\n\r\nhe  will  provide statistics on the number of local and overseas\r\n\r\nuniversity  scholars  who had broken their  service  bonds  upon\r\n\r\ngraduation;  (b) whether the Government considers it  worthwhile\r\n\r\nand  practical  to issue study loans without any  service  bonds\r\n\r\nattached  to achieve their manpower planning purposes;  and  (c)\r\n\r\nwhether study loans as an alternative to Government scholarships\r\n\r\nwill  be  affordable for lower-income families wishing  to  send\r\n\r\nchildren to better universities abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I\r\n\r\ntake Question Nos. 8 and 9 together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As the Prime Minister stated on 24th\r\n\r\nApril   1999,  the  Government  does  not  intend   to   abolish\r\n\r\nscholarships,  or  to replace them with study loans  for  bright\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore's future progress and success, it is crucial\r\n\r\nfor the civil service and statutory boards to attract their fair\r\n\r\nshare  of talent. This will ensure continued strong and  capable\r\n\r\npublic  sector leadership.  Scholars are a vital source of  such\r\n\r\npublic   sector  talent.   This  is  so  not  only  for  premier\r\n\r\nscholarships  like the President's Scholarship, SAF  and  Police\r\n\r\nOverseas Scholarship or OMS Scholarship, but also the many other\r\n\r\nscholarships  offered by the civil service, SAF,  and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.   Many  Government-linked  companies  have  also   found\r\n\r\nscholarships  a  good  way  to  attract  talent  to  join  their\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the scholarship schemes have worked well. Only a\r\n\r\nvery  small  number of PSC scholars (1% of local  scholars,  and\r\n\r\n0.2%  of  overseas scholars) break their bonds  before  starting\r\n\r\nwork.   Most  adapt  well to their working environment  and  new\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  The agencies administering  the  scholarships\r\n\r\nexercise flexibility in deploying scholars, taking into  account\r\n\r\nthe   individuals'  interests  and  aptitudes  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\norganisations'  needs.   They  take  pains  to   make   scholars\r\n\r\nunderstand  that in return for the opportunity to study  in  top\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  they  have  a  legal  and  moral  obligation   to\r\n\r\ncontribute  something back to society.  Scholars have  risen  to\r\n\r\nbecome  Permanent  Secretaries, CEOs  of  statutory  boards  and\r\n\r\nsenior SAF and Police officers.  Some have entered politics,  to\r\n\r\nbecome MPs and Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No student is compelled to take up a scholarship, and thus\r\n\r\nbe  bonded  to  serve  the Government.   Every  Singaporean  who\r\n\r\nqualifies  for  admission  is already assured  of  a  university\r\n\r\neducation in NUS and NTU,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  if  he  cannot afford to pay the already highly subsidised\r\n\r\nfees.  Students should only apply for undergraduate scholarships\r\n\r\nprovided they want to pursue a course for which scholarships are\r\n\r\navailable,  accept the terms and objectives of  the  scholarship\r\n\r\nscheme,  and are ready to commit themselves to a public  service\r\n\r\ncareer. Those who are not yet certain of their minds are  better\r\n\r\noff  studying on their own, or if necessary taking a study loan.\r\n\r\nThen  they are free to choose their university course, and defer\r\n\r\nthe choice of career until after graduation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks already offer study loans at market rates. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  justify offering  study  loans  with  public\r\n\r\nfunds,   especially  at  subsidised  rates,  to  study   abroad.\r\n\r\nTaxpayers'  money must be used only for national  interest,  and\r\n\r\nnot  for an individual's self-fulfilment.  Students taking loans\r\n\r\nto  study abroad have no legal or moral obligation to return  to\r\n\r\nserve the sponsoring organisation.  Some may even feel that they\r\n\r\nhave  no moral obligation to return to serve Singapore.   If  we\r\n\r\nreplace  scholarships with study loans, we will  end  up  losing\r\n\r\nmany of our top students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and the statutory boards will therefore\r\n\r\ncontinue  offering scholarships for courses of  study  in  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  the  State needs talent and expertise.  We will regularly\r\n\r\nreview  the  terms of the scholarship schemes, as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nmanagement   of  scholars  during  and  after  their  university\r\n\r\ncourses,  to  ensure that these continue to meet our objectives,\r\n\r\nand  to  keep up to date with changing circumstances.   We  will\r\n\r\nalso strive to recruit more talent from other sources, including\r\n\r\nable  students  who  did  not  take  a  scholarship  to  go   to\r\n\r\nuniversity, and mid-career executives who have made  their  mark\r\n\r\nin the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Would the Minister give his view\r\n\r\nregarding  Dr Tony Tan's comment on the practice of safeguarding\r\n\r\nor  \"cold-storaging\"  job vacancies for scholarship  holders  as\r\n\r\nbeing too rigid?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is an obligation which the\r\n\r\norganisation  which  gives the scholarship  takes  upon  itself.\r\n\r\nWhen you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngive a scholarship, you must also bear in mind that the scholars\r\n\r\nare going to come back in three or four years' time and you will\r\n\r\nhave to decide where you are going to deploy him and how you are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  use him.  This is not just slave labour.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  has been educated, whom you have invested  in,  and\r\n\r\nwhom you have a responsibility to deploy to best purpose.  It is\r\n\r\nnot  a  light obligation, but it is one which the public service\r\n\r\nhas taken on and, I think, has been able to fulfill in the areas\r\n\r\nwhere it needs this talent.  The point is that a scholarship  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  a one-way obligation.  The organisation awarding  the\r\n\r\nscholarship takes on an obligation to look after the scholar and\r\n\r\nto  deploy  him  and  use him fruitfully, and  the  scholar  who\r\n\r\nreceives  the scholarship receives the benefit because  he  gets\r\n\r\nhis  education and, at the same time, he takes on an  obligation\r\n\r\nto come back and give his best to the organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether there are cases  where\r\n\r\nour   eligible   students   have  refused   scholarships,   say,\r\n\r\nPresident's  scholarship,  because  they  find  that  they  have\r\n\r\nadequate  resources  and do not depend on Government  to  pursue\r\n\r\nfurther studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Yes, there are.

And there have been cases of students who have said,\r\n\r\n\"No,  thank  you very much.  We don't want the bond.\"   Not  all\r\n\r\nthese  students are from affluent families.  I have heard  even,\r\n\r\nin  one  case, a taxi-driver's son, who said, \"No, I won't  take\r\n\r\nthe  scholarship.

And the PSC alone  gives\r\n\r\nabout  150 to 200 scholarships a year.  But it will increasingly\r\n\r\nbecome a problem.  We are in a different situation now from  the\r\n\r\ntime  when  I took a scholarship in 1971, when nearly  my  whole\r\n\r\nclass   went   to  university  on  scholarships,   and   without\r\n\r\nscholarships, could not have gone to university, much less study\r\n\r\nabroad.

And so the  students\r\n\r\nsometimes  feel that, \"Wow!  I am a valuable talent.   There  is\r\n\r\nsuch  enormous demand for my capabilities.\", which  may  not  be\r\n\r\nborne out in later life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to continue to attract good people in, and I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  over a period of time, we will  have  to  make  a\r\n\r\ngreater   effort  to  attract  in  people  who  did   not   take\r\n\r\nscholarships  but  who  have  the  talent,  who  have  gone   to\r\n\r\nuniversities on their own, who may have spent some time working,\r\n\r\nand now want a change.  We must bring them in, whether it is for\r\n\r\na  few years on contract or on a permanent change of career,  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  greater flow-in from graduating students and  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  MAS, for example, has brought in quite a number\r\n\r\nof  people  from  the  private sector,  mid-careers,  some  from\r\n\r\nacademia,  from  universities.  And we  have  found  it  a  very\r\n\r\nfruitful experience, because the interaction between the  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  in  the  organisation  who  have  the  experience  and\r\n\r\ninstitutional memory of how things are done and why, as well  as\r\n\r\nthe  people  who  have come in without that long experience  but\r\n\r\nwith a different perspective from the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, has been good for both sides and good  for  the\r\n\r\norganisation.  We need more organisations to do that.  But it is\r\n\r\neasier for some than for others.  It is very difficult to  bring\r\n\r\nin  a civilian mid-career and make him a colonel or a general in\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.  It may be easier with banking or with urban planning,\r\n\r\nor even with administration.  But we have to work harder.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Will the DPM consider giving scholars\r\n\r\nthe  option  of pursuing post-graduate studies immediately  upon\r\n\r\ngraduation  from their undergraduate studies?  Because  this  is\r\n\r\none  potential  deterrent for them taking up  the  scholarships,\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  to  come back to serve before  pursuing  post-graduate studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> There is some flexibility in this.\r\n\r\nPSC often allows scholars to do Masters degrees immediately as a\r\n\r\ncontinuation of their undergraduate course.  For PhDs, they  are\r\n\r\nmore  selective, but it is not a blanket no.  It really  depends\r\n\r\nwhere we think you can be valuable and whether this fits in with\r\n\r\nour  career plans for you.  If you go on an academic scholarship\r\n\r\nfrom  the  university, then, of course, you go on to a  PhD  and\r\n\r\ncome back to a teaching career.  If you go into a scholarship to\r\n\r\nserve  in the SAF, and you say, \"I want to go on and spend three\r\n\r\nyears doing a PhD.\", I think the SAF will legitimately ask, \"How\r\n\r\ndoes this help you to serve me better?  Or will it only make you\r\n\r\nmore  reluctant and more difficult to fit into the  organisation\r\n\r\nafter  you complete your PhD, and therefore we would have to  be\r\n\r\nmore  careful in making decisions?\"  But even then, we have  had\r\n\r\nSAF scholars who have taken no-pay leave, after working for some\r\n\r\nyears,  and gone and done PhDs.  One of them is now the  CEO  of\r\n\r\nthe URA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it has been done. But the education is for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  enhancing your ability to contribute to Singapore.  If it is\r\n\r\npurely  self-fulfilment, then it is something which you have  to\r\n\r\nlook after on your own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Register of assets)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

There is no need to introduce such a register.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's proposal for public disclosure of Members'\r\n\r\nassets  is not new.  He had raised the subject in this House  on\r\n\r\ntwo  occasions, in 1981 and 1985.  The then Prime  Minister,  Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan  Yew, gave a full answer to this issue.  It  had  also\r\n\r\nbeen raised on other occasions by some other Members like Dr Lee\r\n\r\nSiew Choh and Mr Chiam See Tong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall repeat the two reasons why having Members of\r\n\r\nParliament declare their assets publicly is not practical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the proposal cannot guarantee clean and uncorrupt\r\n\r\npractices.   An MP who is corrupt will not list his assets  from\r\n\r\ncorrupt  gains in his declaration of his assets.  Unless  he  is\r\n\r\nstupid,  he  will  not flaunt his corrupt gains by  ostentatious\r\n\r\nliving or keeping them in his name in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government has done is to require every Minister\r\n\r\nand  office-bearer to file a declaration of his assets with  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  at the beginning of his term  of  office.   The\r\n\r\ndeclarations  are  then  shown  to  the  President.   These  are\r\n\r\nrequirements under the Code of Conduct for Ministers and Office-Holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Prime Minister requires all PAP\r\n\r\nbackbenchers,  though  they  are not  in  charge  of  Government\r\n\r\npolicies or Ministries, to declare their assets to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an allegation of corruption is made against an office-holder, or an MP, his declaration will be available for\r\n\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can have any number of laws, regulations and\r\n\r\ndeclarations to curb corruption but ultimately it depends on the\r\n\r\nreputation and integrity of the Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand its commitment to tackle corruption effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why we do not favour a public register is\r\n\r\nthat  allowing public access to Members' declarations of  assets\r\n\r\nwill  encroach  upon  their personal  privacy.   It  is  already\r\n\r\ndifficult enough to persuade able and talented men and women  to\r\n\r\ncome  forward  and  stand for election without subjecting  their\r\n\r\nprivate  affairs to close scrutiny.  To require their and  their\r\n\r\nfamily members' personal assets to be publicly known is to  make\r\n\r\nit  more  difficult for able people to come forward to serve  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether transparency\r\n\r\nis  one of the essential attributes of an honest government  and\r\n\r\nthis  Government wastes no time in talking about  being  a  good\r\n\r\nhonest Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Certainly.

Prying into the personal  affairs  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  or  the  MP  is  not  one  of  the  subjects   of\r\n\r\ntransparency.   It  is  completely  transparent  to  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister what his Ministers or office holders possess.

Tay</b> asked the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  why  the fires and haze from Indonesia  persist  to\r\n\r\naffect  Singapore  and what improvements can  be  expected  from\r\n\r\nrecent discussions within ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the short spells of hazy\r\n\r\nconditions  we  experienced over the last two  months  were  the\r\n\r\nresult  of logging and plantation fires in central Sumatra.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that the fires persist indicates that ground fire fighting\r\n\r\nmeasures  and enforcement in Indonesia are not effective  enough\r\n\r\neven  though  we  had alerted the Indonesian  authorities  about\r\n\r\nthese fires.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent fires in Sumatra were not extensive,\r\n\r\nnonetheless,  we  were still affected by smoke haze  because  of\r\n\r\nwinds  blowing  in our direction. The weather forecast  for  the\r\n\r\nrest  of the year shows that the normal dry season would set  in\r\n\r\nbut  we  do not expect a El Nino drought situation like that  of\r\n\r\n1997.   Unless  fire  fighting  and  enforcement  measures   are\r\n\r\neffective  in Indonesia, we would have to expect some hazy  days\r\n\r\nwith air quality in the moderate zone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last month's Sixth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Haze in\r\n\r\nBrunei,  Indonesia acknowledged that enforcement against illegal\r\n\r\nburning  activities is lacking and would be difficult under  the\r\n\r\ncurrent political and economic climate. Their efforts were  also\r\n\r\nhampered  by lack of a clear organisational structure to  tackle\r\n\r\nforest fire issues and lack of funding.  The Indonesian Minister\r\n\r\nfor  the Environment has assured us of his ministry's commitment\r\n\r\nto control such fires and has agreed to use the fires in Sumatra\r\n\r\nas a test case to show their resolve in addressing the fires and\r\n\r\nhaze problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Brunei meeting, Indonesia agreed to adopt a zero\r\n\r\nburning  policy and initiate dialogue with plantation owners  to\r\n\r\npromote  zero  burning practices, starting  with  a  seminar  in\r\n\r\nJakarta  in  June.  Indonesia also agreed to  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\npresumption  clause  in their law to deal  with  landowners  for\r\n\r\nillegal burning found on their land. This \"presumption of guilt\"\r\n\r\npolicy,  successfully  practised in Malaysia  and  Brunei,  will\r\n\r\ncompel a plantation owner to prove that any fire on his land was\r\n\r\nnot  his  doing and that he had taken all necessary  actions  to\r\n\r\nprevent or stop it. We hope that Indonesia will succeed in these\r\n\r\nefforts  and mobilise the necessary resources to put  out  fires\r\n\r\nand take firm enforcement actions against any culprit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers are meeting again in July to take stock of\r\n\r\nthe progress made on the part of Indonesia. We will continue  to\r\n\r\nwork  closely with our ASEAN neighbours, international  agencies\r\n\r\nand  donor  countries on programmes that would  help  strengthen\r\n\r\nIndonesia's ability to deal with this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S.

Serious cases of breach of\r\n\r\ndiscipline are infrequent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, since 1995, the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\nimplemented  what  we call the Behaviour Tracking  and  Analysis\r\n\r\n(BETA)  system.

For primary schools, misdemeanours\r\n\r\nsuch  as  not  doing assignments and disruptive  behaviour,  and\r\n\r\nattendance-related offences, constitute 84% of all the  recorded\r\n\r\noffences.

However, the  incidence  of\r\n\r\nsmoking has risen from 14 per 1,000 pupils over the three years,\r\n\r\nthat is, 1995-1997, to 19 per 1,000 pupils in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall offence rate for boys has remained stable over\r\n\r\nthe  years, but a worrying trend is the increasing offence  rate\r\n\r\nfor  girls in our secondary schools. Though lower than the  male\r\n\r\noffence rates, the female offence rates have increased by 6%  to\r\n\r\n9%  per year over the last four years, going up from 300 in 1995\r\n\r\nto 456 in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee chaired by the Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nEducation,  Dr Aline Wong, was set up in May last year  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the discipline situation among our girls in schools.   The\r\n\r\ncommittee is finalising its recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On measures to address discipline issue in our schools,\r\n\r\nSir, the Ministry's philosophy in this matter is that to care is\r\n\r\nto  discipline.   Schools  by  and  large  take  a  whole-person\r\n\r\napproach  to discipline.  They have many programmes and  support\r\n\r\nstructures  to help promote discipline. Besides the creation  of\r\n\r\nthe  posts  of Discipline Master, Head/Pupil Welfare  and,  most\r\n\r\nrecently,  Operations  Manager,  there  is  also  the  Voluntary\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary Scheme where teachers assume the mantle  of\r\n\r\nlaw  enforcement  officers to help reinforce an  orderly  school\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers have been equipped with basic counselling skills\r\n\r\nand  many  spend  much  time counselling errant  students.  Such\r\n\r\nefforts are complemented by programmes like life skills and peer\r\n\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We have achieved our high standard of\r\n\r\npublic health by investing wisely in environmental\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, conducting public education, and enforcing\r\n\r\nstrictly the environmental laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, our population has become more aware of the\r\n\r\nneed  to protect the environment.  However, there are still some\r\n\r\nwho, despite our campaigns and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nurging, persist in acting irresponsibly.  They litter and  dirty\r\n\r\npublic   places,   indiscriminately   discard   their   unwanted\r\n\r\npossessions  or  waste, and sometimes do  great  damage  to  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we live in a very densely populated country, our living\r\n\r\nenvironment can deteriorate very quickly if we are not  careful.\r\n\r\nWe cannot tolerate irresponsible acts that damage or pollute our\r\n\r\nenvironment.  While we continue to educate the public,  we  must\r\n\r\nalso  ensure  that  we have penalties that will  strongly  deter\r\n\r\nthose who continue to act irresponsibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore becomes more built up, construction activities\r\n\r\nare increasingly located nearer to existing residential estates.\r\n\r\nA  construction  site, if not managed carefully,  can  become  a\r\n\r\nsource  of  nuisance and even public health hazards to residents\r\n\r\nand  workers  living  and  working  nearby.   A  better-educated\r\n\r\npopulation  also  expects a higher standard of  housekeeping  in\r\n\r\nconstruction sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors must therefore take appropriate steps to\r\n\r\nminimise   nuisance  to  residents.   The  Bill   will   require\r\n\r\ncontractors   of   construction  sites   to   engage   qualified\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Control Officers (ECOs) to  help  them  keep  the\r\n\r\nsites clean and free of nuisance or public health hazards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Environmental Public Health\r\n\r\nAct  will  allow my Ministry to better address these  and  other\r\n\r\nemerging concerns on environmental public health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments and new\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Illegal Dumping</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal dumping of waste, mainly from construction sites,\r\n\r\nis  becoming  a major problem and has to be checked immediately.\r\n\r\nNot  only  is it happening more often, the culprits are  getting\r\n\r\nbolder  too.  Whereas in the past, they used to dump  the  waste\r\n\r\nonly in remote parts of Singapore, they are now daring enough to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndump  even  in  built-up areas.  The indications  are  that  the\r\n\r\nillegal  dumping  activities are now more  organised,  and  much\r\n\r\nlarger in scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they normally operate late at night, and in\r\n\r\ndeserted  areas,  it is not easy to catch the offenders  in  the\r\n\r\nact.   But  when we do, we must duly punish them with  penalties\r\n\r\nthat  adequately  fit the crime.  This will be achieved  in  the\r\n\r\namendments before us in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for the Court to grant the application\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Public Prosecutor for a vehicle to be  forfeited,\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  proven that the vehicle has been used for  illegal\r\n\r\ndumping.   Clause 5 increases the maximum fine to  $50,000  from\r\n\r\nthe  existing  $10,000,  for the first conviction.   Second  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent  convictions  will  result  in  a  maximum  fine   of\r\n\r\n$100,000, and imprisonment for a term of not less than one month\r\n\r\nand not more than 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 empowers the Commissioner of Public Health to\r\n\r\ncall  up for questioning any person suspected to be involved  in\r\n\r\nillegal  dumping,  or in the operation of an unlicensed  dumping\r\n\r\nground.   This  will  empower ENV officers to  conduct  thorough\r\n\r\ninvestigations and bring the offending parties to court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Operating an Illegal Dump Site</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent any person from attempting to operate an illegal\r\n\r\ndump  site under the guise of operating a waste recycling plant,\r\n\r\nclause  2  has  included \"recycling plant\" in the definition  of\r\n\r\n\"disposal  facility\".   This  will enable  the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Health to license all recycling plants under section  23\r\n\r\n(1) of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 8, any person found operating an illegal\r\n\r\ndisposal  site  can be fined up to $50,000 or imprisoned  for  a\r\n\r\nterm  not  exceeding 12 months or both for the first conviction.\r\n\r\nFor  the second and subsequent convictions, the penalties are  a\r\n\r\nfine  of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding\r\n\r\n12 months or both.  The previous maximum penalties were a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n$10,000  fine  or 12 months imprisonment or both, for  first  or\r\n\r\nsubsequent convictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Littering</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a Corrective Works Order (CWO) for littering\r\n\r\noffences  is issued in lieu of a fine.  The number of  littering\r\n\r\ncases  has been increasing in recent years and so has the number\r\n\r\nof  repeat  offenders,  some of whom had  done  corrective  work\r\n\r\npreviously.  The CWO, on its own, is therefore not a  sufficient\r\n\r\ndeterrent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Littering is an anti-social habit, one that should not be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  give  up.   It  is fundamentally  a  question  of\r\n\r\nattitude.   We  have  had decades of public education,  and  the\r\n\r\nmajority    of    Singaporeans   have   responded    favourably.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is a hardcore minority who are  indifferent\r\n\r\nto  littering, and who need to be deterred by heavier penalties.\r\n\r\nUnder clauses 5, 6 and 7, the penalties for littering have  been\r\n\r\nrevised as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the CWO may now be imposed by the Court in addition to\r\n\r\nfines, instead of only in lieu of;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the maximum duration for CWO is increased from 3 hours\r\n\r\nto  12  hours. Offenders can now be made to perform CWO on  more\r\n\r\nthan one day; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) while the maximum fine for the first and second\r\n\r\nconvictions  remain unchanged at $1,000 and $2,000 respectively,\r\n\r\nthe  maximum fine for the third and subsequent convictions  will\r\n\r\nbe increased to $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 makes it an offence to discard or abandon any\r\n\r\nfurniture, any deregistered vehicles or any other bulky items in\r\n\r\nany public place.  The penalties will be a maximum fine of\r\n\r\n$5,000 for the first conviction and $10,000 or 3 months' jail or\r\n\r\nboth for the second or subsequent convictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Environmental Control Officers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the provision for the appointment of\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Control Officers.  Poor housekeeping and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanagement of construction work-sites have often given  rise  to\r\n\r\npublic  health  hazards, such as the breeding of mosquitoes  and\r\n\r\nflies,  rodent infestation, disease outbreaks, earth  littering,\r\n\r\ndust nuisance and noise pollution.  With construction sites  now\r\n\r\nlocated  increasingly closer to residential  areas,  contractors\r\n\r\nmust actively ensure that their site activities do not give rise\r\n\r\nto public health problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 will require the occupier of any construction\r\n\r\nsite  with  construction projects worth more  than  a  specified\r\n\r\nvalue  to engage qualified Environmental Control Officers (ECOs)\r\n\r\non  a  full-time or part-time basis.  The role of the ECO is  to\r\n\r\nhelp  plan  and  monitor environmental control measures  on  the\r\n\r\nsite.   My  Ministry  will register and certify  such  qualified\r\n\r\npersons  after  they have attended a prescribed training  course\r\n\r\nand pass the pre-requisite examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current pool of safety officers, currently certified by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Manpower, may expand their expertise to include\r\n\r\nenvironmental  management.   They  will  need  to  undergo   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  training and be certified as ECOs.  In  this  way,  a\r\n\r\ncontractor  needs to only employ one officer on site to  perform\r\n\r\nthe  dual  role  of  safety control and  environmental  control.\r\n\r\nSuitably  qualified persons who are not currently registered  as\r\n\r\nsafety  officers can also become ECOs.  My Ministry will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  will  be sufficient numbers of ECOs  to  serve  the\r\n\r\nindustry when we launch the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Recycling Burial Plots</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Commissioner to order the exhumation\r\n\r\nof graves for the purposes of reusing the grave plots for future\r\n\r\nburials.  This is necessary as we have very limited burial land.\r\n\r\nWithout   this  measure,  the  existing  burial  land  will   be\r\n\r\ncompletely exhausted within 14 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore continues to develop and progress, our\r\n\r\npeoples' expectations of their living environment will increase.\r\n\r\nThe  challenge of safeguarding our environment and public health\r\n\r\ncan be successfully met only with the cooperation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neveryone in Singapore.  My Ministry will continue to educate the\r\n\r\npublic,  and  actively  seek  their understanding,  support  and\r\n\r\ncooperation.   At the same time, we will deter the recalcitrants\r\n\r\nwith  penalties  that  are  more  appropriate  to  the  offences\r\n\r\ncommitted.  This Bill will enable my Ministry to deal  with  new\r\n\r\npublic health problems more effectively, and help keep Singapore\r\n\r\nclean and green.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According\r\n\r\nto  information  given by the Ministry of  the  Environment,  in\r\n\r\n1998,  a  total  of  8,652 summonses were issued  for  littering\r\n\r\noffences.   Compared to the 5,152 summonses in 1997,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen an increase of almost 3,500. In 1998, there were about  580\r\n\r\npeople  who  were served with the CWO as opposed to the  376  in\r\n\r\n1997.   If these figures are in reference to the  shares market,\r\n\r\nmany people would have made a lot of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, there are so many people who are flouting the law.\r\n\r\nThis  is a very disturbing trend.  This will undermine our image\r\n\r\nand  reputation as one of the cleanest cities in the world.  The\r\n\r\nMinister has introduced this Amendment Bill to enhance the  fine\r\n\r\nand  increase the number of hours for the Corrective Work Orders\r\n\r\n(CWO).  I think this is very timely.  I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we want to have a more effective way to\r\n\r\nmaintain  Singapore's  reputation  as  the  most  beautiful  and\r\n\r\ncleanest city in the world, enhancing the penalties is just  one\r\n\r\nof  the  ways, albeit an important and effective way.   However,\r\n\r\nwe  should  also  enhance our educational efforts  so  that  our\r\n\r\npeople  will learn to keep our environment clean.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto make a few suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, education in the schools. Our National Education\r\n\r\nhas   already  achieved  some  good  results.   Otherwise,   our\r\n\r\nenvironment  would  have been worse and more people  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen   fined.   Through  education  in  the  schools,  we   have\r\n\r\ninculcated in our students the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcept  of  keeping  our environment clean.   The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation should enhance its efforts in this direction  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  younger generation of citizens will make consistent efforts\r\n\r\nto  keep  Singapore clean.  However, I feel that we should  have\r\n\r\nmore creative ways to educate our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. On one occasion a couple of\r\n\r\nmonths ago, while I was standing at the roadside waiting for  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders to drive me to a function,  I saw  two  young\r\n\r\nchildren, presumably a sister and a brother, crossing the  road.\r\n\r\nThe  younger brother was kicking an empty can.  The elder sister\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Why don't you pick up the empty tin instead of kicking it\r\n\r\naround?\"   The younger brother said, \"I did not throw  it.   Why\r\n\r\nshould I pick it up?\"  Although it was suggested that the  empty\r\n\r\ntin  be  picked up, the children did not do so.  In the end,  it\r\n\r\nwas the Member of Parliament who picked up the tin and threw  it\r\n\r\ninto the rubbish bin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should start teaching our children about\r\n\r\nenvironmental  protection from young.  In our younger  days,  we\r\n\r\nhad  lessons  in  civics.  We were told to  use  our  hands  and\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  some gotong royong campaigns.  We  should  also\r\n\r\neducate  our  students not only to refrain from  littering,  but\r\n\r\nalso  to help pick up the litter and dispose of it in the proper\r\n\r\nmanner.  Then, Singapore will become an even  cleaner city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the food centres. We all know that nowadays\r\n\r\nmany families have their lunches and dinners in the food centres\r\n\r\nbecause  both husband and wife are working and have no  time  to\r\n\r\ncook for the family.  I think the hygiene and cleanliness of the\r\n\r\nfood centres is very important.  But very often, we observe that\r\n\r\nin the food centres, the stallholders would collect their plates\r\n\r\nand  money,  and with a swipe of the cloth, push  all  the  food\r\n\r\nremains on to the ground.  I think this is a very bad habit, and\r\n\r\ntheir hygiene standard is still very unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we could have a National Food Centre Cleanliness\r\n\r\nContest, where  the three cleanest food centres in Singapore  be\r\n\r\npicked  and  awarded.   I think through this  effort,  we  could\r\n\r\nencourage  the  stallholders  to pay  more  attention  to  their\r\n\r\nhygiene   and  cleanliness,  and  thereby  creating   a   better\r\n\r\nenvironment for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, foreign workers. At present, in Singapore, we\r\n\r\nhave  a  few  hundred thousands of foreign workers in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  needs  in the construction  and  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsectors.    We  have  foreign  workers  coming  from   Thailand,\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   Philippines,  China  and  India.   They  came   from\r\n\r\ndifferent  cultural  backgrounds.  Perhaps they  have  different\r\n\r\nhabits and different standards of hygiene in their countries.  I\r\n\r\noften see in some HDB worksites these foreign workers eating  at\r\n\r\nthe void decks of the nearby HDB flats, and leaving behind empty\r\n\r\ncontainers and empty tins on the ground after they had  finished\r\n\r\neating.   They said the food leftovers were for the  stray  dogs\r\n\r\nand  cats, and they love them.  This would certainly cause  some\r\n\r\nhealth hazard to the residents there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that all contractors should take up the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of educating the foreign workers.   I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthis  is not the mistake of the workers themselves.  It is  just\r\n\r\nthe  habits that they have inherited from their own country.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should educate them in order to make them  understand\r\n\r\nthat  these old habits of theirs are not to be tolerated in  our\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, junk mail. The Town Councils have employed\r\n\r\ncleaners  to  clean up the common areas in our HDB estates,  and\r\n\r\nthe standard of cleanliness has generally improved.  However, we\r\n\r\nstill find that there are a lot of junk mails being thrown about\r\n\r\nnear  the letter boxes.  I have taken some photographs.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee that at noon time and at about 5.00 pm, the area at the lift\r\n\r\nlobby  near the letter boxes was very clean. But by 6  pm,  that\r\n\r\narea  was  heavily littered with a lot of junk mails, commercial\r\n\r\nhandbills and leaflets.  We have about 8,000 blocks of HDB flats\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  If we want to clear up all these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njunk  mails from HDB flats, it would cost about $1 per block  of\r\n\r\nflats.   So, we have to spend $8,000 a day, $240,000 a month  or\r\n\r\n$2.88 million a year.  This is indeed a huge sum of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps these companies which distribute or send out these\r\n\r\nhandbills and leaflets should go around the HDB estates and  see\r\n\r\nfor themselves how wasteful it is to send out all these leaflets\r\n\r\nwhich  end  up  as litters on the floor.  Meanwhile,   the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  should   improve the design of the  letter  boxes.   I\r\n\r\nsincerely  hope that if these companies want to advertise,  they\r\n\r\nshould do it through other means, rather than dumping all  these\r\n\r\nleaflets  into the letter boxes of residents, causing a  lot  of\r\n\r\nlittering problems, and a lot of money to clean them up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as raised by Mr Heng Chiang Meng in Parliament\r\n\r\nlast  year,  we should look into the possibility of  authorising\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the  public  to  help  enforce  the  regulations.\r\n\r\nRecently,  I visited Gulangyu in the Fujian province.   On  this\r\n\r\nisland, there are no vehicles and it is a pollution free island.\r\n\r\nWhen  I was there, I noticed that many senior citizens, who were\r\n\r\nwearing  some red banners on their bodies, issuing summonses  to\r\n\r\nanyone  who  littered,  and  even  collecting  fines  from   the\r\n\r\noffenders on-the-spot.  I think this is a very effective way  of\r\n\r\ncontrolling the environment.  On the one hand, we can  keep  the\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens and retirees occupied, and let them  earn  some\r\n\r\nmoney for themselves, and on the other hand, they could take  up\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility to make sure that no one litters.  If anyone\r\n\r\nshould  litter, they are authorised to issue summonses to  these\r\n\r\npeople  and also to fine them on the spot.  I feel that this  is\r\n\r\nmore  effective than our present practice whereby a  summons  is\r\n\r\nissued  and  the CWO executed a few months after an offence  has\r\n\r\nbeen  committed.    I think the on-the-spot  fine  may  be  more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will consider my proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me thank Mr Ang for his support\r\n\r\nof the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made some very good suggestions. His point is that\r\n\r\nwhilst  enhanced  penalties are important, it  is  also  equally\r\n\r\nimportant for us to educate the public, especially the students.\r\n\r\nI  totally  agree with him.  In fact, that is what we have  been\r\n\r\ndoing  all along.  The schools have been very active in  passing\r\n\r\non the message to the students.  I see it in my daughters.  They\r\n\r\ncome  back with all kinds of messages.  I think the message does\r\n\r\nsink in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the campaigns that we grew up with, like the Use Your\r\n\r\nHands  Campaign and all that, we can review them again.  I  will\r\n\r\nask  my  staff to contact their counterparts in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  to see what else we can do to make that message  more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to hawker centres, I share his concerns\r\n\r\ntoo  about the cleanliness of hawker centres and hawker  stalls,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  why we have come up with the grading system  for  the\r\n\r\nindividual  hawker  stalls.  But his idea of having  a  cleanest\r\n\r\nfood  centre  competition in order to encourage the entire  food\r\n\r\ncentre to be kept clean, I think, is a good suggestion.  I  will\r\n\r\nask  my staff to consider this as part of the programme for this\r\n\r\nyear's Clean and Green Campaign.  And we will get in touch  with\r\n\r\nMr Ang on his proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to foreign workers, yes, this is a matter of\r\n\r\nconcern  to  us as well.  I am glad to inform Mr  Ang  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  we  have  been reaching out to the foreign  workers.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  publishes pamphlets in different languages,  in  Thai,\r\n\r\nFilipino,  which  is  usually the  Tagalog  language.   We  have\r\n\r\npamphlets in the various languages and we distribute them at the\r\n\r\nvarious  worksites as well.  Last year, we held  exhibitions  on\r\n\r\nthe environment at over 200 construction sites.  This will be  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  activity and we will try to get more contractors  to\r\n\r\ncome  on  board and work with us in educating the  workers  that\r\n\r\nthey have employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to junk mail, yes, it is a common problem\r\n\r\nthroughout the whole of Singapore.  Like Mr Ang, I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhy the companies waste money printing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose leaflets which they know are going to be thrown away.  The\r\n\r\nchallenge is for the Town Councils to evolve a system which will\r\n\r\nenable  the junk mail to be disposed by the residents in a  very\r\n\r\nefficient  manner  without having to throw  them  all  over  the\r\n\r\nfloor.   I think some of the Town Councils have come up  with  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  idea  where they install a rubbish trough  right  in\r\n\r\nfront  of the letter boxes, so that when the residents take  out\r\n\r\nthe  mail and they find that it is junk mail, they just drop  it\r\n\r\ndown  into  the trough and therefore do not end up dirtying  the\r\n\r\nwhole void deck.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his last suggestion to empower senior citizens to\r\n\r\nissue summonses and fines on the spot, I think it is a bit of  a\r\n\r\ndrastic  change  for us.  But I like his idea  of  getting  more\r\n\r\npeople  to be involved in this effort to deter littering and  to\r\n\r\neducate  the  public.   I will ask my staff  to  work  with  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  to  see how we  can  get  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  more involved in this process and, hopefully,  by\r\n\r\nhaving  more eyes and more hands on the ground, we will be  able\r\n\r\nto reduce this problem of littering in our housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  -  [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND TITLES (STRATA) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, this Bill was referred to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  The Report of the Select Committee was presented  to\r\n\r\nthe House on 19th April 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee received 46 representations which\r\n\r\nreflected  a  good cross section of views.  They  were  from  39\r\n\r\nindividuals,  one  management  corporation,  two  en  bloc  sale\r\n\r\ncommittees and four organisations.  The four organisations  were\r\n\r\nthe Association of Property and Facility Managers, the School of\r\n\r\nBuilding   and  Real  Estate  of  the  National  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Law  Society of Singapore,  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute of Surveyors and Valuers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee, however, did not limit itself to the\r\n\r\nviews  put  forth by the representors but also considered  views\r\n\r\nexpressed  in this House during the Second Reading  debate.  The\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  has accepted several useful  suggestions  and\r\n\r\nincorporated them in the amended Bill which is before the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full explanations for the various amendments are set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  Select Committee's Report.  Therefore,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nintend  to repeat all that is extensively set out in the  Report\r\n\r\nwhich Members would have read.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I propose to do is to highlight only some of the\r\n\r\nchanges  made  by the Select Committee as well as  some  of  the\r\n\r\nissues considered by the Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the issue as to whether to vary the 90% / 80%\r\n\r\nmajority share value consent level.  The Committee heard diverse\r\n\r\nand  sometimes diametrically opposing views on this issue.  Some\r\n\r\nfelt  that  90%  /  80% consent level should be  made  stricter.\r\n\r\nOthers  were  in favour of a more liberal, lower  level  consent\r\n\r\nrequirement, especially for older buildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has decided to keep the present\r\n\r\napproach in the Bill, ie, the 90% consent level for developments\r\n\r\nless  than 10 years and 80% for developments 10 years or  older.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  it  should be left to market forces and  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  will determine if an en-bloc sale is economically viable.\r\n\r\nThe  90%  /  80%  level  linked to  the  10  years  age  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment was considered a reasonable criterion.  The  consent\r\n\r\nlevel should be pegged to the age of the development as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  is more likely that older developments will be sub-optimally\r\n\r\nutilised and have higher repair bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue concerns developments with 10 or fewer\r\n\r\nunits.  The Bill originally had excluded developments with 10 or\r\n\r\nfewer units.  It was thought that it may not be possible in some\r\n\r\nof  these cases to designate a clear 90% / 80% majority  because\r\n\r\nof  the  small number of units in these developments, eg,  in  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment with four units of equal shares, three  out  of  the\r\n\r\nfour owners would account for only 75% of the share values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representor proposed that the Minister or the Strata\r\n\r\nTitles Board be empowered to decide on a case by case basis if a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  could qualify for en-bloc sale.   Others  suggested\r\n\r\nlowering  the consent level to 70% or allowing a sale  if  there\r\n\r\nwere  not  more  than one or two objecting unit owners  of  such\r\n\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has decided to make a change so that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  owners of developments with  10  or  fewer  units\r\n\r\nshould also be able to apply to the Board provided they can meet\r\n\r\nthe  specified  consent  level  of  90%  /  80%.   However,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  did  not  think  that this consent  level  should  be\r\n\r\nlowered  as it would not be fair to the minority owners of  such\r\n\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these developments which have 10 or fewer units are\r\n\r\nold or have large areas which are under-utilised, thus rendering\r\n\r\nthem suitable for redevelopment.  In fact, as at September 1998,\r\n\r\ndevelopments with 10 or fewer units account for nearly  half  of\r\n\r\nall  strata  developments in Singapore.   Of  the  2,272  strata\r\n\r\ndevelopments which are freehold or close to 999 years,  47%  are\r\n\r\ndevelopments with 10 or fewer units.  These developments account\r\n\r\nfor  7% of the total number of units and about 80 hectares (10%)\r\n\r\nof  the  land area.  Requiring unanimous decision will frustrate\r\n\r\nen-bloc redevelopment of these developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue concerns whether it should be the High Court\r\n\r\nor the Strata\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTitles  Board  which  should hear objections,  and  whether  the\r\n\r\napproach  and guidelines in the Bill for en bloc sale should  be\r\n\r\nmade  clearer  as well as expressly stated in the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs during the Second Reading debate as well as\r\n\r\nsome representors during the Select Committee hearings felt that\r\n\r\nthe  High Court and not the Strata Titles Board should hear  en-bloc  cases.   In the Select Committee hearings it became  clear\r\n\r\nthat  some  representors had taken this view because  they  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the general guidelines in the Bill were too broad or  gave\r\n\r\ninsufficient  guidance  on  how the Board  will  decide  on  the\r\n\r\nobjections  of the minority.  Some representors also  felt  that\r\n\r\neven  if no objections are raised, the Board should in any  case\r\n\r\nreview the application to see if it should be approved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee felt that the Strata Titles Board and not the\r\n\r\nCourts  would be the appropriate body to hear objections because\r\n\r\nthe objections would almost invariably be non-legal issues which\r\n\r\nlend themselves more to mediation or counselling rather than  to\r\n\r\nadjudication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Committee agreed with the view expressed on the\r\n\r\nneed for greater clarity of the approach of the Board in dealing\r\n\r\nwith   objections.   The  Select  Committee  also  agreed   with\r\n\r\nrepresentors  on  the need to spell out in  greater  detail  the\r\n\r\nfactors  which  the Board will take into account.   Accordingly,\r\n\r\nseveral important changes have been made:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, even where there is no objection, the Board must\r\n\r\nreview  every  application to the Board for  en  bloc  sale  and\r\n\r\nsatisfy  itself  that the transaction is in good  faith  and  at\r\n\r\narm's  length, taking into account the sale proceeds, the method\r\n\r\nof  distributing the sale proceeds and the relationship  of  the\r\n\r\npurchaser to any of the unit owners.  The Board must also ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the sale and purchase agreement does not compel a minority\r\n\r\nowner to be part of a joint venture agreement with the developer\r\n\r\nof  the  land.   This  will address concerns  expressed  on  the\r\n\r\nsafeguarding of the interests of the minority owners;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where objections have been raised, the Board\r\n\r\nwill, where relevant, mediate.  Where mediation on objections of\r\n\r\na  personal or non-pecuniary nature fails, the Board cannot stop\r\n\r\nthe  sale  from  proceeding unless the Board is  satisfied,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  that the minority owner will suffer a loss,  that  is,\r\n\r\nthe  purchase price which he will receive is less than the price\r\n\r\nhe  paid  for his unit, including all allowable deductions;  the\r\n\r\npurchase  price  also  which a minority owner  receives  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  for  him to discharge a mortgage or  charge  on  his\r\n\r\nunit;  the Board can also refuse if the minority owner is forced\r\n\r\nto   be   part   of   a   joint  venture  agreement   with   the\r\n\r\npurchaser/developer; or if the Board is satisfied that the  sale\r\n\r\nis  not in good faith or at arm's length taking into account the\r\n\r\nsale proceeds, method of distributing the sale proceeds and  the\r\n\r\nrelationship of the purchaser to any of the unit owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding on a case, the Board will not impose its own\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions on the parties.  If the Board feels  that\r\n\r\nthe  price is too low or the method of distribution of the  sale\r\n\r\nproceeds  is  not  equitable, it will order that  the  sale  not\r\n\r\nproceed.  The majority owners must then address the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me add that when the revised approach of the Board\r\n\r\nas  I  have  outlined just now was clarified to the representors\r\n\r\nwho  spoke  on this issue, most of them agreed that  the  Board,\r\n\r\nrather  than  the court, would be the more appropriate  body  to\r\n\r\nmediate  and hear en bloc cases.  One representor felt that  the\r\n\r\nBoard  would  then  be  performing a  function  which  was  more\r\n\r\nadministrative than judicial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue was the setting out in greater detail the\r\n\r\nprocedure  for service of notice on all the owners of units  and\r\n\r\nother interested parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has accepted the representors' views\r\n\r\nthat  the  procedure for giving notice to the owners  and  other\r\n\r\ninterested  parties should be made much clearer, as well  as  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the Bill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nitself.  As a result, many changes have been made, including the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the requirement that there should be convened at least\r\n\r\none  general  meeting  to discuss the en bloc  sale  before  the\r\n\r\nmajority owners can apply to the Board;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) advertisement in all the four language newspapers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) service of notice of the sale to all the owners, the\r\n\r\nmortgagees  and  chargees  and  the  management  corporation  by\r\n\r\nregistered  post and by leaving a copy under the  main  door  of\r\n\r\nevery unit;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) affixing a copy of the notice to the door or gate of a\r\n\r\nminority owner;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) affixing a copy of the notice to a conspicuous part of\r\n\r\neach building in the development; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) filing a copy of the application to the Board with the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Titles  and Deeds for notification  on  the  land\r\n\r\nregister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue concerns the role of the Board with regard to\r\n\r\nmatters  of  compensation payable to the lessee  of  a  minority\r\n\r\nowner's unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of representors felt that the Board should decide\r\n\r\non the compensation payable to the lessee of a minority owner in\r\n\r\norder  to expedite and facilitate an en bloc sale.  The minority\r\n\r\nowner  may  be  unable to agree with his lessee on the  latter's\r\n\r\ncompensation.  The Committee agreed that the Board can determine\r\n\r\nthe  amount of compensation payable to the lessee of a  minority\r\n\r\nowner  on  the latter's request.  The Board, however,  will  not\r\n\r\ndecide  on  the  compensation payable  to  the  lessees  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  owners,  as the majority owners must  make  their  own\r\n\r\narrangements  with their lessees before they commit  to  the  en\r\n\r\nbloc sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representor suggested that the Bill should stipulate\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  amount of compensation payable  to  obviate  cases\r\n\r\nwhere   lessees   demand  an  unreasonable  compensation.    The\r\n\r\nCommittee felt that it is difficult now to decide on the maximum\r\n\r\ncompensation.  This is a matter on which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Board could formulate some guidelines when this issue first\r\n\r\narises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a question on the composition of the Board to\r\n\r\nenable it to deal with en-bloc sale cases.  A number of MPs  and\r\n\r\nrepresentors felt that the Board should have more panel  members\r\n\r\ndrawn  from a wider range of relevant occupation groups so  that\r\n\r\nit  can  effectively perform its enlarged functions.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee has amended the Bill in several ways:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to increase the number of members on the Board's panel\r\n\r\nfrom a proposed 24 to a maximum of 30;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to appoint up to three Deputy Presidents instead of\r\n\r\nthe proposed two Deputy Presidents; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to give the President of the Board power, where\r\n\r\nnecessary, to appoint four instead of two panel members to  form\r\n\r\na  Board of five or three persons headed by the President  or  a\r\n\r\nDeputy President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, let me say that the Select Committee\r\n\r\ncertainly benefited from the suggestions and views given by  the\r\n\r\nrepresentors,  some  of whom were experts  in  their  respective\r\n\r\nfields.   I  believe that the changes which are now incorporated\r\n\r\nin the Bill will improve the legislation and help it achieve its\r\n\r\nobjectives more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nright of ownership of land in Singapore is no longer sacrosanct.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  have  the  Land Acquisition  Act  which  allows  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to compulsorily acquire land for general development\r\n\r\nwhich, amongst other things, could mean that the Government  can\r\n\r\ntake your land and plant a few roadside trees on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have the amendment to the Land Titles (Strata) Act\r\n\r\nwhere under the law, the majority of subsidiary proprietors  can\r\n\r\nvote  to sell the whole development.  It would appear that there\r\n\r\nis no longer any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npermanency of residence in Singapore.  I wonder how this kind of\r\n\r\nsituation  squares  up with the call by the Government  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore a better home.  To me, a home is a place where you can\r\n\r\nlive  in  comfort for as long as you like, and not to be  tossed\r\n\r\nout against your wishes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spoken my feelings in regard to the amendments\r\n\r\nin the Bill, I would like now to make some comments on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the Bill and agree that the minority subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietors'  interest must be protected.  There  should  be  no\r\n\r\nconflict  of interest and of collusion in the en bloc  sale.   I\r\n\r\nthink  section  84A(1) is fair.  I agree that there  must  be  a\r\n\r\nmajority  of 90% or 80% share value consent level before  an  en\r\n\r\nbloc  sale can be carried out for a building less than 10  years\r\n\r\nold  and  more  than  10  years old respectively.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment shall stick to this majority of share values and  not\r\n\r\nlower  the percentages to allow en-bloc sale.  It is right  that\r\n\r\nthe Strata Titles Board should not take an interventionist role.\r\n\r\nIn  this respect, I note that the issue of distribution  of  the\r\n\r\nproceeds of sale is still largely unresolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 84A(1) requires that there must be an in-principle\r\n\r\nsale  and purchase agreement which specifies the proposed method\r\n\r\nof  distribution  of the sale proceeds.  I  would  like  now  to\r\n\r\npropose  that  the  compensation prices for each  unit  must  be\r\n\r\ndetermined  by taking the average price of two valuation  prices\r\n\r\nof  recognised  valuers.  Anyway, I note that when  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndispute,  the  provisions in the Bill  require  the  parties  to\r\n\r\nmediate and the Board has powers to call for a valuation report.\r\n\r\nIn  the  courts where there are disputes concerning the division\r\n\r\nof  proceeds  of  sale  of properties, for example,  in  divorce\r\n\r\ncases,  valuation reports are inevitably called for.  Presently,\r\n\r\nI believe that the suggested way for the division of proceeds of\r\n\r\nsale  is by the quantum of share values.  In my view, that  form\r\n\r\nof  distribution  of  proceeds of sale by share  values  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  The share value pegged to a unit or flat is  tied\r\n\r\nto  the  land  which the block or blocks of flats or  shops  are\r\n\r\nbuilt.  Theoretically, should the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuilding be destroyed, each of the subsidiary proprietors  would\r\n\r\nstill  own  a  portion of the land proportionate  to  his  share\r\n\r\nvalue.   The  share value of each flat or unit is  not  directly\r\n\r\nlinked  to  the  market  value of  the  flat.   Each  subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietor  should be compensated based upon the open  value  of\r\n\r\nhis  property.   The worth of a residential unit compared  to  a\r\n\r\nsimilar size flat, in my view, should be on the open market sale\r\n\r\nand  amongst  the  factors by which it is  determined,  ie,  its\r\n\r\nposition, the view it commands, whether it is sited in a  sunset\r\n\r\nposition,  and so forth.  As for a commercial unit of a  similar\r\n\r\nsize,  its commercial worth depends largely on where it is sited\r\n\r\nin  the  building.  A shop that is placed at the road  front  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  worth more than one which is tucked away  in  a  fine\r\n\r\ncorner of a building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the amendment already gives power to the Board to\r\n\r\ncall  for a valuation report under section 84A(4), why not  make\r\n\r\nit   mandatory  for  the  parties  to  decide  on  the  mode  of\r\n\r\ndistribution and incorporate it into the in-principle  sale  and\r\n\r\npurchase  agreement?  The mode of distribution can be  based  on\r\n\r\nthe average price of two valuation reports aforesaid.  This will\r\n\r\nstop  any  dispute  right  from  the  start  on  the  issue   of\r\n\r\ndistribution,  thus saving cost and time.  I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould consider this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out to me that under the Fourth Schedule,\r\n\r\nsubsidiary proprietors can only take a vote for en-bloc sale  in\r\n\r\nan  extraordinary meeting.  Would the Minister consider amending\r\n\r\nclause  1(a)  in  the Fourth Schedule to include Annual  General\r\n\r\nMeeting.   If  that amendment is made, the first  line  of  that\r\n\r\nclause 1(a) would then read, \"consider the collective sale at an\r\n\r\nannual   general  meeting  or  extraordinary  meeting  held   in\r\n\r\naccordance with the Act\".  I hope the Minister has no  objection\r\n\r\nto this proposal because sometimes it is difficult to convene an\r\n\r\nEOGM.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity.   Sir, may I declare my  interest.   I  am  a\r\n\r\nmember of the Strata Titles Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee received 46 representations. The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  given  the  breakdown.   They  were  very  useful\r\n\r\nrepresentations and I am glad that the Government has sent  this\r\n\r\nBill  to a Select Committee.  The public input has improved  and\r\n\r\nthe  Committee has agreed to many changes which the Minister has\r\n\r\ndealt with. These changes are to be welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my only concern is that all the 46 representors who\r\n\r\nwrote  to the Select Committee were in the English Language.   I\r\n\r\nthink  a  message  could be sent to the public  at  large  that,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  advertisements in the newspapers,  representations\r\n\r\nhave  not  been made in any of the four languages.  It would  be\r\n\r\nuseful  for  non-English  educated Singaporeans  to  give  their\r\n\r\ninput.  I am glad that the Minister has agreed to go beyond  the\r\n\r\npractice of the High Court where the advertisement only  appears\r\n\r\nin two languages.  We have advertisements in four languages.   I\r\n\r\nwelcome this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a proposal for the Minister. The Board members\r\n\r\nare going to be increased from 24 to 30.  Since we are going  to\r\n\r\ndeal  largely  with the value of the property, may  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider appointing more valuers and some community\r\n\r\nleaders  to  this panel.  I am also glad that from two,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to have four and effectively, we either have three or five\r\n\r\nmembers.   The  discretion  lies with the  President  or  Deputy\r\n\r\nPresident.  This is most welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My learned friend, Mr Chiam, spoke about the sanctity of\r\n\r\nland.   I  beg to differ.  My philosophy has been that,  had  we\r\n\r\nstuck  to  the old English concept, Singapore could  never  have\r\n\r\nmade  progress.   We are a country of limited land  size.   But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, we must see that our laws are framed in such a way\r\n\r\nthat  the  individual rights are protected when  a  property  is\r\n\r\nacquired.  In this particular case, no property is going  to  be\r\n\r\nacquired.  The owners themselves are going to agree or  disagree\r\n\r\nwhether they are going to have the proposed development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other important factor which the House is aware is\r\n\r\nthe mediatory role of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Board.   I  can assure the House that, since I  joined  the\r\n\r\nBoard,  I  have seen more often than not the cases are  resolved\r\n\r\nthrough mediation.  And I am glad that the Select Committee  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  have the Strata Titles Board instead  of  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt.   It  would be cheaper and it would also not  strain  the\r\n\r\nresources of the High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill has also specified the role of\r\n\r\nthe  Board.  Hence, it would be easier for the Board  to  follow\r\n\r\ncertain  guidelines  that have been laid.   The  Board  will  of\r\n\r\ncourse  have to see the value of the property.  The  Board  will\r\n\r\nalso  see  that  the sale is at arm's length.  It  is  fair  and\r\n\r\nequitable  as it is specified in paragraph 47 of the  Report  by\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee.  The Board will review a case \"(regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether there is an objection) to see whether on the face of\r\n\r\nthe  application it is satisfied that the transaction is in good\r\n\r\nfaith  and at arm's length, after taking into account  the  sale\r\n\r\nproceeds,  method  of  distributing the sale  proceeds  and  the\r\n\r\nrelationship of purchaser to any of the owners.\"  This is a very\r\n\r\nimportant safeguard which the Bill has introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to consider, when appointing\r\n\r\nthe  members,  as I have said earlier, that there is  a  broader\r\n\r\nrepresentation  so  that  public  confidence  would  always   be\r\n\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I spoke on the Bill at the Second\r\n\r\nReading  and  expressed  concerns in  four  areas.   First,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  public  interest as  opposed  to  private  profit.\r\n\r\nSecond,  the different balance between private property and  the\r\n\r\nidea  of communal property or communal living, which is a phrase\r\n\r\nused by the Minister of State in the Second Reading.  Third, the\r\n\r\nsafeguards in the Bill, as it was then.  Fourth, it leaves these\r\n\r\nsafeguards to the Strata Titles Board, rather than the court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not repeat these points I have made previously. I\r\n\r\nshall  attempt  to  look at the recommendations  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Some of the concerns that I have expressed and other\r\n\r\nMPs  have expressed have been addressed by the Select Committee.\r\n\r\nThey have gone\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough  a  lot  of  work  and I think they  have  put  in  more\r\n\r\nsafeguards.  This should be acknowledged and people should  feel\r\n\r\nslightly more assured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still, Sir, I think there are some concerns to be\r\n\r\nraised.   In raising these concerns, I am particularly conscious\r\n\r\nof  the fact that at the same sitting when we are debating  this\r\n\r\nBill, we will also debate the Singapore 21 Report and the motion\r\n\r\nthat this House endorses the vision of Singapore 21 as the basis\r\n\r\nfor  strengthening the heartware of Singapore.  I  mention  this\r\n\r\nbecause  Singapore  21  asks  us to consider  the  heartware  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and, as part of the heartware, to make Singapore  our\r\n\r\nhome, our best home.  Singapore 21 also asks us to consider that\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean matters.  We will of course have occasion  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the  Singapore 21 Report and the motion in full  later.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident to me at least that some of these ideas may be\r\n\r\nin tension with some of the ideas in the present Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, let me clarify that I recognise the difference\r\n\r\nbetween public good and the importance that public good must  be\r\n\r\nplaced  over private good.  But I want to distinguish the public\r\n\r\ngood  from  the  present Bill.  Public good,  Sir,  that  people\r\n\r\nunderstand, and I think the Member for Potong Pasir,  Mr  Chiam,\r\n\r\nalluded  to, is highways, infrastructure, public facilities  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole populace.  Public good is also having Singapore  with\r\n\r\nno slums.  But, Sir, while the Bill may indirectly give a higher\r\n\r\ndensity  and  utilisation of land, the  primary  driving  factor\r\n\r\nbehind  this  Bill will not be public good in the sense  I  have\r\n\r\ndefined  it,  but  rather,  private profit.   And  that  is  the\r\n\r\nessential  starting point in recognising the difference  between\r\n\r\nthe  Land Acquisition Act, which Mr Chiam referred to,  and  the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill.   Under the Land Acquisition Act,  I  think  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans accept that if a house has to be taken  from  them,\r\n\r\nor  part of a garden has to be taken from them for public  good,\r\n\r\nthey will accept.  This Bill, however, is different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first idea is Singapore as home. Sir, I have to ask:\r\n\r\ndoes it strengthen the idea of Singapore as home if we can point\r\n\r\nnot to the city skyline as a whole or to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPadang  in  the  heart of city, but to our own individual  home?\r\n\r\nDoes  it strengthen our commitment to Singapore when we  can  do\r\n\r\nthat?   I believe it does.  Consequently, Sir, I must also  ask:\r\n\r\ndoes  it  weaken the idea of Singapore as home if, as this  Bill\r\n\r\nallows, other people can force us to sell our homes against  our\r\n\r\nchoice?  Sir, I am particularly disturbed by paragraph 17 of the\r\n\r\nReport  by  the  Select Committee.  Perhaps, the  Committee  was\r\n\r\nconcerned more about legal rules and the definition of the work,\r\n\r\nas  much of the Committee's Report makes it clear that they were\r\n\r\nnot  aimed  at  dealing with the major principles of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nrather the greater details.  But paragraph 17 says that it  does\r\n\r\nnot  recognise the difference between owner-occupiers and  those\r\n\r\nwho hold property as investment.  That is to say, it refuses  to\r\n\r\nsee  the difference between people who see their houses as homes\r\n\r\nand  people  who  see  their houses as cash  earning  profit  or\r\n\r\nholding its value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the idea of Singapore as home seriously, I think\r\n\r\nthat  while  legal matters must of course be legal  matters,  we\r\n\r\nmust  increasingly take these non-legal, non-economic  but  very\r\n\r\nreal  issues  into consideration.  And I would  urge  that  this\r\n\r\nHouse  considers  this when we think about the  impact  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.   The  other element I mentioned of  -  that Singapore  21\r\n\r\nmay  be  in  tension with the present Bill  -  is the idea  that\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean matters.  Normally the majority should prevail\r\n\r\nbut  an  individual  or a minority must have certain  rights  or\r\n\r\nplace  under  the  sun which cannot be taken from  them  by  the\r\n\r\nmajority.  Is private property one of these rights?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I must clarify that condominium living is\r\n\r\nnot  communal  living.   As  pointed  out  in  the  Report  very\r\n\r\ncarefully, one part of condominium living is communal, one  part\r\n\r\nis  common property, ie, the share value that accumulates to the\r\n\r\ncondominium in terms of the carpark, the facilities, the  common\r\n\r\nareas.  But another part is completely private, and this is  the\r\n\r\nactual delineated airspace or ground space that belongs to  that\r\n\r\none owner, that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis,  the person's home.  No one can come through the door unless\r\n\r\nthat  person says, \"Yes, you can come in.\"  This is not, in that\r\n\r\nsense,  like  communal property.  This is private  property  and\r\n\r\nwhen  we  change  this  law, we change the  meaning  of  private\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been made of the so-called oppression of the\r\n\r\nminority, both in the Report and in the Second Reading.  I agree\r\n\r\nwith this.  No single person or small number should frustrate  a\r\n\r\nbasically  good  deal  for no good reasons.   However,  I  would\r\n\r\ncaution  that this should not be overstated.  No one is  stopped\r\n\r\nfrom  selling  his house under the existing law.  The  right  to\r\n\r\nbuy,  sell  and alienate is preserved.  What is stopped  by  the\r\n\r\npresent  law is that one cannot do an en-bloc sale.  I can  sell\r\n\r\nmy  house,  but  I  cannot  sell my house  in  conjunction  with\r\n\r\neveryone else, including those who did not wish to sell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving then to a different balance. This must be\r\n\r\nrecognised.   And  I am not saying this balance  is  necessarily\r\n\r\nwrong, though I think it is. Others may disagree, but the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  has done a good job in bringing together  people  who\r\n\r\ndisagree with the Bill as well as agree.  I am not the person to\r\n\r\ntell  the whole of Singapore what the balance should be.  But  I\r\n\r\nwish that, with the passage of this Bill, people do see that  we\r\n\r\nare  moving  to a different balance and that brings  me  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion of safeguards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report installs profit as the safeguard and the Strata\r\n\r\nTitles Board (STB) as the guardian.  This is a step forward.  In\r\n\r\nthe  original Bill, there was no question of this.  Now, we have\r\n\r\nthe  safeguard that where there is no profit or only  an  actual\r\n\r\nloss,  then  the deal will not go through.  Bur we have  to  ask\r\n\r\nourselves:  is this still sufficient?  What if there is  only  a\r\n\r\nmarginal  profit?  Among the papers that were submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, some spoke of very high profits, 30%-50%.  But\r\n\r\nit  is  possible since prices have come off, that  people  might\r\n\r\nmake 5% or 1% if they had bought at the top of the market.  What\r\n\r\nof  them, as compared to the neighbours who have made much more?\r\n\r\nWill there be equity in this sense between those who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  bought  at  different prices?  Is there even  transparency\r\n\r\nwhen  I purchase a house, to know how much my neighbour has paid\r\n\r\nfor it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the non-monetary but real factors must be borne\r\n\r\nin mind - location, closest to family, cost of moving, condition\r\n\r\nof  the  house,  whether  you have  paid  a  lot  of  money  for\r\n\r\nrenovation.  All these, as far as I understand from  the  Report\r\n\r\nof  the Select Committee, are still not taken into account.  Let\r\n\r\nme  then  paint a concrete but hypothetical picture and ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister for clarification.  If I see a widow in her 60s or  70s\r\n\r\nliving now alone in a flat, it is a familiar neighbourhood, near\r\n\r\nher  family, the sale may proceed but it gives her only a  small\r\n\r\nprofit,  can  the existing safeguards save this widow  from  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience  of  having  to move  at  an  old  age?   Can  the\r\n\r\nguardian,  the  Strata Titles Board, save this  widow  from  her\r\n\r\nsituation?  I would like the Minister to explain this to us.  As\r\n\r\nfar as I see it, it cannot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the safeguard as regards the developer's blocking\r\n\r\nvote.   Many  of  the papers focus on the issue  of  developers'\r\n\r\npractice,  ie,  some of them retain units or  transfer  them  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own holding companies.  Then they have a sizeable  block,\r\n\r\nthat  given the requirements of 80% or 90% agreement,  they  can\r\n\r\neither frustrate the deal or try to push the deal, so it goes to\r\n\r\nthem  to  redevelop.   If I could ask the  Minister  to  explain\r\n\r\nwhether   this  question  has  been  addressed  by  the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.   It  seems to me that we cannot take care,  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Minister here, of every situation in writing this Bill.\r\n\r\nBut  we can provide general guidelines, general principles,  and\r\n\r\nentrust this to a particular person to administer case by case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, this is entrusted to the Courts\r\n\r\nunder general principles of equity.  The Bill seems to me to  be\r\n\r\ndifferent.   It seems to be empowering a different  person,  the\r\n\r\nStrata  Titles Board, and telling it not to look at  these  non-economic  but  sometimes very real matters.  I would  have  been\r\n\r\nmuch more comfortable with the Bill if the Select\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCommittee  had  recommended even simple wordings  such  as,  \"to\r\n\r\nconsider  extenuating  circumstance  of  families  and  of   the\r\n\r\nelderly\",  and to look at individual cases in this light.   With\r\n\r\nthis, may I ask the Minister's clarifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the three speakers for their\r\n\r\ncomments  on  the  Bill.  Both Mr Chiam and Mr Simon  Tay  began\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches by restating their positions during  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of  the  Bill  about  the sanctity  of  the  home,  the\r\n\r\nimportance of property ownership and so on.  I have two ways  of\r\n\r\ndealing  with  it.  One is to go again into all the explanations\r\n\r\nand justifications which had been made by the Minister of State,\r\n\r\nAssoc.  Prof. Ho Peng Kee.  But that is not the purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nThird  Reading.  The purpose of the Third Reading is  really  to\r\n\r\nexamine  the  changes which had been recommended by  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  not  to have another full-scale  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nissues  or questions of principle which had been fully canvassed\r\n\r\nand  debated in the Second Reading.  Much as I am tempted to  go\r\n\r\ninto  details on the points raised by Mr Chiam and Mr Simon Tay,\r\n\r\nI  will not go into them except to recapitulate the points which\r\n\r\nhad been very cogently put forward by my colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nof State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that, for those who oppose the very\r\n\r\nprinciple  of the Bill  -  and the principle of the Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  law to move away from unanimous requirement   -   I\r\n\r\nrecognise they have their reasons to do so.  If you oppose  that\r\n\r\nbasic principle, then of course, you must oppose the rest of the\r\n\r\nBill.   But  if  you agree with the fundamental  principle  that\r\n\r\nunanimous  requirement should be changed to something less  than\r\n\r\nunanimous, then you have to deal with a host of questions.  What\r\n\r\nshould  be  the majority consent level, if it is not  unanimous?\r\n\r\nShould  it  be  pegged to the age of the development,  and  what\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  age of the development?  How do you  deal  with\r\n\r\nobjections,  financial  and  pecuniary,  as  well  as  emotional\r\n\r\nobjections?  What should be the institutional mechanism to  deal\r\n\r\nwith this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as amended by the Select Committee, addresses\r\n\r\nthese  issues  consequent to the principle  to  move  away  from\r\n\r\nunanimous requirement.  We can have a divergence of views on all\r\n\r\nthese consequential matters because it will not be honest for me\r\n\r\nto  say  that there is a perfect or correct answer  to  each  of\r\n\r\nthese  solutions.   It  calls  for  a  judgement.   Government's\r\n\r\nresponse, as now modified by the Select Committee, is to  arrive\r\n\r\nat  what we think is a reasonable and practical approach to work\r\n\r\nout this regime for facilitating en-bloc sales.  It is really  a\r\n\r\nfacilitating  process.   It need not be the  Government  or  the\r\n\r\nStrata Titles Board directing or instructing that such and  such\r\n\r\na  development should now proceed with en-bloc sale.  The regime\r\n\r\nis  really  to  leave it as much as possible  to  those  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment to decide for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have this key feature, ie, 90%/80% consent\r\n\r\nrequirement pegged to the age of the building, ie, 10  years  or\r\n\r\nless  and  10  years  or  more, coupled with  the  institutional\r\n\r\nmechanism of the Strata Titles Board rather than the Courts  for\r\n\r\nthe  reasons which are spelt out in the Bill.  And the  role  of\r\n\r\nthe  Strata  Titles  Board is, again, that of  facilitating  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  as  an avenue for mediating when there are  objections\r\n\r\nand  the  situation and the type of objections are imponderable.\r\n\r\nSome  examples were given but those are not the only ones.   The\r\n\r\nBoard  will be taking a non-interventionist approach but  we  do\r\n\r\nspell out a few of the categories where the Board expresses  its\r\n\r\ndisapproval.  But apart from that, the Board will really take  a\r\n\r\nmediating role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read the Select Committee's Report, the papers which\r\n\r\nhad  been presented and the discussions which the Committee  had\r\n\r\nwith  many of the representors, it will be evident that this  is\r\n\r\nnot  a clear-cut issue of the majority imposing its will on  the\r\n\r\nminority.  We have a very good illustration which was brought to\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of  the  Committee where  actually  it  was  the\r\n\r\nunreasonableness of the minority.  You had an en-bloc sale which\r\n\r\nwas frustrated by a couple who were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndivorcing  and  each  party to the divorce  wanted  to  get  the\r\n\r\nmaximum out of the proposal of the en-bloc sale and the majority\r\n\r\nof  the committee decided to overcome this by coughing out  from\r\n\r\ntheir  own pockets to meet the demands of one of the parties  to\r\n\r\nthe  divorce.  So it is not so clear-cut that this is  really  a\r\n\r\nminority being run roughshod by a majority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have a point made in the Second Reading and\r\n\r\nrepeated  now,  about this question of the home, the  heartware,\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  and  so  on.  We pointed out  during  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading that you have to distinguish between landed property and\r\n\r\nthe  concept of strata title development.  Mr Simon Tay referred\r\n\r\nto actual delineated ground space.  In strata title, there is no\r\n\r\ndelineation of the subsidiary proprietor's identifiable plot  of\r\n\r\nland.   There  is no such thing.  You have, in common  with  the\r\n\r\nother subsidiary proprietors, a certain share value of the  land\r\n\r\narea as well as a share value of all the common properties,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  we  talk about common properties, it covers a whole  range\r\n\r\nfrom  carparks, the pool, the garden, lifts, corridors, external\r\n\r\nwalls,  columns,  roads, drainage, sewerage and  gas  pipes  and\r\n\r\nelectric  cables  serving  the  development.   So  there  is   a\r\n\r\ndistinction.  When we talk about strata titles, the  concept  is\r\n\r\ndifferent.   You  are having an identifiable airspace  but  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  land and other common properties, you  have  common\r\n\r\nownership  together with the rest of the subsidiary  proprietors\r\n\r\naccording to the share values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you read the Select Committee's Report, many\r\n\r\nof the representors agreed with me, in fact, all agreed with me,\r\n\r\nwhen  I  put  it to them that, in the end, it is a  question  of\r\n\r\nbalance.   The minority can say he has a right not  to  alienate\r\n\r\nbut  the majority also has a right to alienate.  So, how do  you\r\n\r\nbalance  these  two?  I think Mr Simon Tay  wants  to  take  the\r\n\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Thank you, Mr Minister. You said that the\r\n\r\nminority  has the right not to alienate, but the majority  wants\r\n\r\nthe  right  to alienate.  They still have the right to alienate,\r\n\r\nbut they must only alienate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  own  property, their own share value.  They never  had  a\r\n\r\nright to alienate theirs and their neighbour's property.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, if you look at the existing scheme,\r\n\r\nunder  section  78,  it  is possible for an  applicant  or  some\r\n\r\napplicants to go to the court and get a court order even  though\r\n\r\nyou  do  not have 100% consent to achieve exactly what the  Bill\r\n\r\nachieves,  except that the Bill now provides a more facilitating\r\n\r\nmethod  of achieving this result.  So it is not a question  that\r\n\r\nit  was  impossible  for  a subsidiary proprietor  or  group  of\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  proprietors where there is no unanimous consent  not\r\n\r\nto  have en-bloc sale.  It is possible.  What we are doing  here\r\n\r\nis  to recognise the frustrations and difficulties, to recognise\r\n\r\nin  land  scarce Singapore, this will enable optimum utilisation\r\n\r\nof  land.   Is it or is it not desirable to make this move?   So\r\n\r\nthat is the fundamental question which has been addressed in the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading debate.  The Third Reading here is to discuss the\r\n\r\nimprovements which have been made by the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Chiam said that he agrees with the approach\r\n\r\nwhere the Strata Titles Board will pay attention to factors such\r\n\r\nas  is  there collusion, is there conflict of interest?  And  he\r\n\r\ntherefore  is in agreement with that approach.  He  also  agrees\r\n\r\nwith the approach of not taking an interventionist approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His main point was about the distribution of proceeds, and\r\n\r\nhere  we have a difference of views.  Mr Chiam's approach  would\r\n\r\nbe, first, for the Board itself to decide on the distribution of\r\n\r\nproceeds.   Secondly, in conferring the power to  the  Board  to\r\n\r\ndecide, he also has a proposal which is that it should not be by\r\n\r\nshare values, but by open market value, take the average of  two\r\n\r\nvaluation reports.  I say we have a difference of views, because\r\n\r\nthe  Government's approach as well as the approach taken by  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee is that it is best to leave it to the  parties\r\n\r\nto come up with their own arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we take that approach? Because the factors that\r\n\r\nwill have to be taken into account can be very diverse, and Mr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay  has alluded to that.  If you read the  Report,  some\r\n\r\neven  talk  about customs, superstitions, feng shui and  so  on.\r\n\r\nHow  does one quantify this at the level of Strata Titles  Board\r\n\r\nor  by  the courts, if it were to go to the courts?  Then  there\r\n\r\nare  emotional factors.  There was this problem of  a  divorcing\r\n\r\ncouple.  How do we have objective criteria to work this  into  a\r\n\r\ndecision?  So, it is best to leave it to the proponents  of  the\r\n\r\nen-bloc sale to negotiate and try their best to accommodate  the\r\n\r\nobjections  of the minority, and the objections of the  minority\r\n\r\ncan  be  based  on  numerous pecuniary as well as  non-pecuniary\r\n\r\nmatters.  Mr Simon Tay pointed out that there may be a  case  of\r\n\r\nsomeone who recently bought the flat and spent a lot of money in\r\n\r\nrenovations.   So  it can be quite a complicated  business.   It\r\n\r\nmight  be  best  to leave it to the parties to come  up  with  a\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the methods of distribution of proceeds and whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  fair or not, his point that the Strata  Titles  Board\r\n\r\nought to take into cognizance his suggestion, I think they  will\r\n\r\ndo  so.  But please bear in mind that the Board is not going  to\r\n\r\nimpose its terms and conditions.  It will really leave it to the\r\n\r\nproponents of the application for en-bloc sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's other point was to change the Fourth Schedule so\r\n\r\nthat instead of an Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM), it  can\r\n\r\nbe  an Annual General Meeting.  Let me explain why we have  made\r\n\r\nan amendment to provide for Extraordinary General Meeting.  This\r\n\r\nwas  a  change  made by the Select Committee after hearing  many\r\n\r\nrepresentors.  The concern of the representors was  that  if  we\r\n\r\ndid  not  have a general meeting  -  let us leave aside for  the\r\n\r\nmoment  Extraordinary General Meeting or Annual General  Meeting\r\n\r\n-   they  felt  that  individual owners can  be  pressurised  by\r\n\r\nvarious  kinds  of  representations.   So  the  thrust  of  this\r\n\r\namendment  is transparency.  Have a general meeting.   The  next\r\n\r\nquestion is: why Extraordinary General Meeting?  I think  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  to have an Extraordinary General Meeting so that it  can\r\n\r\nbe  a  special meeting.  There can be no doubt in anyone's  mind\r\n\r\nthat it is called for a special purpose.  To have an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nen-bloc sale proposal is indeed a very significant step.  So  it\r\n\r\nshould be delinked from the Annual General Meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken note of his point that it is very difficult to\r\n\r\nconvene an EOGM, but perhaps that itself may be a good reason to\r\n\r\nhave  an  EOGM, because, do not forget, to have  a  90%  or  80%\r\n\r\nrequirement  is not going to be easy in any case.   So  I  would\r\n\r\ncommend keeping the Extraordinary General Meeting requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai made some suggestions as to the future\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  the  Strata  Titles  Board.   In  view  of  the\r\n\r\namendments for its enlargement, whether we could draw in  people\r\n\r\nfrom other professions and community leaders.  I shall give this\r\n\r\nsome  thought in consultation with the President of  the  Strata\r\n\r\nTitles Board whose views will have to be solicited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with a specific point that Mr Simon Tay raised.\r\n\r\nHe  talked  about paragraph 17 of the Report.  I  think  he  has\r\n\r\nmissed  the  point.  This should not be read  as  the  Committee\r\n\r\ndisregarding primacy over home ownership as opposed to those who\r\n\r\nare not having the unit for their home.  Basically, paragraph 17\r\n\r\ndealt with the proposal by some who argued that when calculating\r\n\r\nthe  voting rights, a higher weightage be given to those  owners\r\n\r\nwho  are living in their own homes.  The first problem that  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee had with that is you immediately would have  an\r\n\r\ninconsistency  with  the whole structure of  the  Strata  Titles\r\n\r\nBoard where for all other matters concerning maintenance, funds,\r\n\r\nsinking funds, decisions on whether you are going to spend  half\r\n\r\na  million dollars on repairing the swimming pool or putting  in\r\n\r\nnew  lifts,  all those decisions are based on share values,  and\r\n\r\nnot  whether  you  are  staying there or  not.   So  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee decided it is better to keep to that basic approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, you may not be living there, but why should you\r\n\r\nhave  a  lesser voting right on such important decisions than  a\r\n\r\nperson who is living there?  So what if you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave rented it out?  You might have allowed your son or daughter-in-law to stay there.  So should you have a lesser voting right?\r\n\r\nI  think  Mr Simon Tay has completely missed the thrust of  that\r\n\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his point that individuals must have rights, I have\r\n\r\nalready  alluded to it.  This Bill is about balancing of rights,\r\n\r\nbalancing the interest of the minority whose viewpoint is to  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded,  who  feel  that  they  should  not  be  forced  to\r\n\r\nalienate,  as  well as the interest of the majority  who  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand why their interest to alienate should be frustrated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to his final point about emotional factors, the\r\n\r\napproach  taken by the Board is not to adjudicate and decide  on\r\n\r\nthese matters.  We should leave it to the parties, whether it is\r\n\r\nthe  emotional aspect of an elderly lady or widow or some  other\r\n\r\nemotional  aspects.   These  cases  are  so  numerous   and   so\r\n\r\nimponderable that it will not be possible for the Strata  Titles\r\n\r\nBoard  to  decide on.  But it can mediate, it can recommend,  it\r\n\r\ncan  suggest.  But in the end, it should be a decision  left  to\r\n\r\nthe parties to decide.  Whether individuals or developers own  a\r\n\r\nlarge chunk of the voting rights, if they own 25%-30%, then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, they may meet the requirements of the Bill, and then the\r\n\r\ningredients for en-bloc sale will proceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered most of the questions, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TREASURY BILLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of\r\n\r\nthe   Local  Treasury  Bills  Act  (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised\r\n\r\nto  borrow,  by  the  issue of Treasury Bills  in  Singapore,  a\r\n\r\nrevolving  sum not exceeding fifteen thousand million  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollars (S$15,000,000,000).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 25th May 1995, Parliament resolved, in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  section  3 of the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter  167),\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister be authorised to borrow,  by  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nTreasury  bills  in  Singapore, a  sum  not  exceeding  S$10,000\r\n\r\nmillion.  This limit is applicable to the outstanding amount  of\r\n\r\nTreasury bills.  As of 1st April 1999, the outstanding amount of\r\n\r\nTreasury bills issued is S$8,940 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for the current limit to be raised. More\r\n\r\nTreasury  bills need to be issued to meet market demand  and  to\r\n\r\nmop  up excess liquidity in the banking system, where necessary.\r\n\r\nThe  Monetary Authority of Singapore will be gradually  stepping\r\n\r\nup  Treasury  bill issues to support capital market  development\r\n\r\nefforts.   With the proposed increase in Treasury bill issuance,\r\n\r\nthe annual debt servicing cost on outstanding Treasury bills  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  increase  from  about  S$200  million  per   annum\r\n\r\ncurrently,  to  about S$260 million per annum  in  FY2003.   The\r\n\r\nearnings  from  foreign reserves acquired,  when  the  S$  funds\r\n\r\nwithdrawn through issue of Treasury bills are recycled  back  to\r\n\r\nthe market, are expected to more than offset this interest cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed, therefore, that the current ceiling for\r\n\r\nborrowing  by Treasury bills of S$10,000 million, be  raised  by\r\n\r\nanother S$5,000 million to a total of S$15,000 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to enable the Government to issue\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury Bills up to a total amount not exceeding  S$15,000\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of\r\n\r\nthe   Local  Treasury  Bills  Act  (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised\r\n\r\nto  borrow,  by  the  issue of Treasury Bills  in  Singapore,  a\r\n\r\nrevolving  sum not exceeding fifteen thousand million  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollars (S$15,000,000,000).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT SECURITIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 11(1) of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  Securities  Act  (Chapter  121A,  1993  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised\r\n\r\nto borrow, by the issue of Government Securities in Singapore, a\r\n\r\nfurther  sum  not  exceeding  one hundred  and  twenty  thousand\r\n\r\nmillion Singapore dollars (S$120,000,000,000), thereby in  total\r\n\r\na  sum  not  exceeding two hundred and twenty  thousand  million\r\n\r\nSingapore dollars (S$220,000,000,000).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 19th March 1992, Parliament resolved, in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  section 11(1) of the Government Securities Act 1992,  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister be authorised to borrow, by the issue of Government\r\n\r\nsecurities in Singapore, a sum not exceeding S$100,000  million.\r\n\r\nPresently,   there  remains  only  about  S$2,100   million   of\r\n\r\nGovernment securities left unissued.

The remaining  35%\r\n\r\nor  S$42,000 million of Government securities will be issued  to\r\n\r\nenable  financial institutions such as banks, finance  companies\r\n\r\nand  insurance companies to meet requirements for liquid assets,\r\n\r\nand  to  meet  the  demand  from  financial  institutions,  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers and others for investment purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned increase in supply of Singapore Government\r\n\r\nsecurities  over the next five years or more will  increase  the\r\n\r\navailability of Singapore Government bonds to add liquidity  and\r\n\r\ndepth to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket,  and help to establish a benchmark Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nbond  yield  curve  for the pricing of other  bond  and  capital\r\n\r\nmarket  instruments.  A more vibrant capital market in Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  a  larger  pool  of fixed income origination  and  trading\r\n\r\r\nskills, diversity of borrowers and a broader investor base, will\r\n\r\nenhance Singapore's status as a financial centre.  There will be\r\n\r\nspin-off  benefits through increased activities in  the  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange, swap, repurchase and derivative markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in issues of Singapore Government\r\n\r\nsecurities  to  both the general market and  CPF  Board,  it  is\r\n\r\nestimated  that  the annual debt servicing costs on  outstanding\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  bonds will increase  from  about  S$3,000\r\n\r\nmillion per year currently, to about S$5,300 million per year in\r\n\r\nFY  2003.  However, the earnings from foreign reserves acquired,\r\n\r\nwhen   the  S$  funds  withdrawn  through  issue  of  Government\r\n\r\nsecurities are recycled back to the market, are expected to more\r\n\r\nthan offset this interest cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority of Parliament is therefore sought to raise\r\n\r\nthe  ceiling  for  borrowing through  the  issue  of  Government\r\n\r\nsecurities  by  a  further sum of S$120,000 million.  This  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the  ceiling from the current S$100,000 million  to  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of S$220,000 million.  This ceiling is applicable to  the\r\n\r\ncumulative total of all Government securities issued, regardless\r\n\r\nof whether they have been redeemed or are still outstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 11(1) of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  Securities  Act  (Chapter  121A,  1993  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised\r\n\r\nto borrow, by the issue of Government Securities in Singapore, a\r\n\r\nfurther  sum  not  exceeding  one hundred  and  twenty  thousand\r\n\r\nmillion Singapore dollars (S$120,000,000,000), thereby in  total\r\n\r\na  sum  not  exceeding two hundred and twenty  thousand  million\r\n\r\nSingapore dollars (S$220,000,000,000).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Its task:  to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nheartware of Singapore and to develop a consensus on the kind of\r\n\r\nsociety  which Singaporeans want for the future.  The  Singapore 21\r\n\r\nCommittee has completed its work and released its report  on 24th\r\n\r\nApril 1999.  Copies of the report have been circulated  to\r\n\r\nMembers of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Need For A New Vision</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are standing at the threshold of a new millennium, one\r\n\r\nwhich  will be characterised by change and uncertainty.   Beyond\r\n\r\nthe  formidable  task  of  competing  in  the  global  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy,  there  will be challenges on many other  fronts.   The\r\n\r\npervasiveness of the Internet and the growing mobility of people\r\n\r\nwill  bring  a  global elite closer together,  but  threaten  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  gap separating them from those within  their  own\r\n\r\nsocieties  who  are less able to cope with these changes.   This\r\n\r\ncould lead to social tension.  And those who think that conflict\r\n\r\nis  a  thing of the past, need only look at Kosovo today  to  be\r\n\r\nreminded of the possible dangers.  Singapore will not be  spared\r\n\r\nfrom these challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a world, political stability, social cohesion, and\r\n\r\nthe  values  and commitment of our people will be  of  paramount\r\n\r\nimportance.  Together, they make up the \"heartware\"  which  will\r\n\r\ndetermine if we can meet the challenges ahead - whether  we  can\r\n\r\nmuster our people to defend the country, whether we can mobilise\r\n\r\nour businessmen and workers to meet economic challenges, whether\r\n\r\nwe  can  encourage  our  people to take  care  of  one  another.\r\n\r\nHeartware  will determine our national resilience in a  changing\r\n\r\nworld.   It will determine the tone of our communities  and  the\r\n\r\nquality of every Singaporean's life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we build the heartware? Singapore is changing. By\r\n\r\nthe  year  2030, one in four Singaporeans will be  aged  60  and\r\n\r\nabove.   Their commitment and hard work built modern  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTheir  collective needs and concerns in their golden years  will\r\n\r\nhave  a significant impact on the Singapore of the future.   The\r\n\r\nyoung will be better educated, more informed and well travelled.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be more independent and inquiring.  They  will  also\r\n\r\nwant  a  bigger  role in shaping the things  that  affect  their\r\n\r\nlives.   To build the heartware, we will have to develop  a  new\r\n\r\nvision  for Singapore, based on the aspirations of Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nand  the society that they want for the future.  A vision, which\r\n\r\nwill  take  into account, our material, intellectual, emotional,\r\n\r\nand social needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Making of Singapore 21</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past one and a half years, the Singapore 21\r\n\r\nCommittee, and its five subject committees, consulted some 6,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans through seminars, focus group discussions, surveys,\r\n\r\ne-mail  and other exchanges.  These Singaporeans come  from  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life.  They include teachers, students,  businessmen,\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  workers,  volunteers in  welfare  organisations,\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders  and many others.  The  discussions  revolved\r\n\r\naround the challenges that Singaporeans will face and the dreams\r\n\r\nthat  they have as individuals, families, communities and  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.   To  facilitate  discussion and  emphasise  that  tough\r\n\r\nchoices  may have to be made, the challenges were structured  as\r\n\r\nfive apparent dilemmas.  And these were:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A Less Stressful Life vs Retaining the Drive;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Needs of Senior Citizens vs Aspirations of the\r\n\r\nYoung;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Attracting Talent vs Looking After Singaporeans;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Internationalisation/Regionalisation vs Singapore as\r\n\r\nHome; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Consultation and Consensus vs Decisiveness and Quick\r\n\r\nAction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the discussions, and the many internal deliberations,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore 21 Committee has identified five key ideas, which\r\n\r\ntogether  form  the  Singapore  21  vision.   These  five  ideas\r\n\r\nrepresent  what Singaporeans collectively desire for the  future\r\n\r\nof Singapore. Let me go through each of the ideas briefly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Five Key Ideas</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Every Singaporean Matters. The Singapore of the\r\n\r\nfuture  must  be  one  where  people  matter  not  only  in  the\r\n\r\ncollective  sense,  but  also at the  individual  level.   Every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  is important.  Every Singaporean has a contribution\r\n\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, Singaporeans must set their own\r\n\r\ngoals  and strive to be the best that they can be.  They  should\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nembrace  the spirit of lifelong learning.  At the community  and\r\n\r\nsocietal  level,  the definition of success  should  be  widened\r\n\r\nbeyond  academic and material achievements.  Anyone  trying  his\r\n\r\nbest  and  contributing to the nation, whether in  traditionally\r\n\r\nrecognised fields such as business, medicine and law,  or  other\r\n\r\nareas  like  sports,  entertainment  and  the  arts  should   be\r\n\r\napplauded and encouraged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second idea is Strong Families as Our Foundation and\r\n\r\nOur Future.  The family has been the cornerstone of our society.\r\n\r\nStrong  families  have enabled our children  to  grow  up  in  a\r\n\r\nnurturing  environment and ensured that  the  elderly  are  well\r\n\r\nlooked  after and enjoy dignity and respect.  It is through  the\r\n\r\nfamily  that  values are passed on from one  generation  to  the\r\n\r\nnext.  It is within the warm embrace of strong families that the\r\n\r\nneeds  and  aspirations  of  both the  young  and  the  old  are\r\n\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 survey has shown that Singapore families\r\n\r\nare  generally  sound.  However, they are also under  increasing\r\n\r\nstress.   Families are getting smaller.  The number  of  working\r\n\r\nadults  per  elderly person is shrinking.  In most  cases,  both\r\n\r\nparents  have  demanding jobs and have  little  time  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  What should we do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct response lies not in transferring the family's\r\n\r\nrole  to  another institution, but in strengthening  the  family\r\n\r\nunit  itself.  At the individual level, Singaporeans  must  take\r\n\r\ntime  to  nurture  their own families.   At  the  community  and\r\n\r\nnational  levels,  support must be provided  for  families.   If\r\n\r\npriorities have to be re-assessed and some sacrifices made, they\r\n\r\nshould be done.  As we prepare to meet the challenges ahead, the\r\n\r\nfamily  unit will be an integral part of the solution.   It  is,\r\n\r\nand must remain, the fundamental building block of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third component of the Singapore 21 vision is\r\n\r\nOpportunities  for  All.  The vision is for Singapore  to  be  a\r\n\r\nplace of opportunity for all, both Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  foreigners; a cosmopolitan city where people come  together\r\n\r\nand  spark  new  ideas and opportunities; at the  same  time,  a\r\n\r\ncountry  committed to helping its citizens realise their fullest\r\n\r\npotential;  and a spirited society, where those who  have  tried\r\n\r\nbut did not succeed are encouraged to try again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent Straits Times survey, most Singaporeans agree\r\n\r\nthat   having   foreign  talent  is  good  for   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as foreign talent will generate new  opportunities\r\n\r\nand  add  to  our  economy's competitiveness.  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to accept the need for foreign talent at the  rational\r\n\r\nlevel.   The  next  step is for us to similarly  accept  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  at  the emotional level.  At the personal and  community\r\n\r\nlevels,  Singaporeans  should not  feel  threatened  by  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  but  should  welcome those  who  come  to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to our development.  Most of us have recent immigrant\r\n\r\nroots ourselves.  And those who come to Singapore, who share our\r\n\r\ndreams  and are committed to our vision, we should embrace  them\r\n\r\nas citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth idea is The Singapore Heartbeat. In an\r\n\r\nincreasingly   borderless   world,   it   is   imperative   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have a strong sense of belonging to Singapore  and\r\n\r\nshare a common vision.  Singaporeans must feel passionately that\r\n\r\nSingapore is where we belong, where our roots are and where  our\r\n\r\nfuture  lies.  Wherever we may be around the world,  our  hearts\r\n\r\nmust  beat  in tune with our fellow Singaporeans, with  whom  we\r\n\r\nshare a mutual responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the idea of Active Citizens who Make the\r\n\r\nDifference.   The  Singapore 21 survey found  that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwant  to  be involved and consulted on issues that affect  their\r\n\r\nlives.  This is an encouraging sign.  In an increasingly complex\r\n\r\nworld,  no  one, including the Government, has all the  answers.\r\n\r\nGreater involvement of the people will lead to better solutions.\r\n\r\nIt  will  also result in greater ownership of the final decision\r\n\r\nand outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond giving their views on public policies and\r\n\r\nissues, Singaporeans must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  involved  in  creating the kind of  society  we  want  for\r\n\r\nourselves  and our children.  Participation need not be  at  the\r\n\r\nnational  level  on  weighty national issues. Participation  can\r\n\r\nmake  a big difference, perhaps make the biggest difference,  at\r\n\r\nthe   grassroots  level  to  themselves  and  to  their   fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Where possible, Singaporeans  should  be  active\r\n\r\ncitizens   who   take   ownership  of  problems   within   their\r\n\r\nneighbourhood, community and society.  By offering feedback  and\r\n\r\nideas,  Singaporeans have a greater sense of  participation  and\r\n\r\nownership, by becoming actively involved in putting their  ideas\r\n\r\nto  work,  they  share in the responsibility  for  the  outcome.\r\n\r\nActive  citizens will form a people sector that will  complement\r\n\r\nthe   public  sector  and  the  private  sector  in  a   dynamic\r\n\r\npartnership.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have just described are the five\r\n\r\nkey ideas that make up the Singapore 21 vision.  Singapore 21 is\r\n\r\nnot  the Government's concept on what Singaporeans should do  in\r\n\r\nthe  next century.  It is what Singaporeans collectively  desire\r\n\r\nfor  the future.  The five key ideas are not \"good to haves\" but\r\n\r\nessential  ingredients in building the heartware of our  nation.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot  be achieved overnight, nor will they  be  easy  to\r\n\r\nachieve.   But we must strive towards them because the Singapore\r\n\r\n21  vision will be crucial to Singapore's continued survival and\r\n\r\nsuccess in the new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing and articulating the Singapore 21 vision, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  Committee  has drawn upon  the  combined  wisdom,\r\n\r\nexperience and aspirations of many Singaporeans.  The  Committee\r\n\r\nwould  like  to thank all of them for their participation.   The\r\n\r\nendorsement of the Singapore 21 Vision by this House will enable\r\n\r\nus   to  move  into  the  next  and  more  difficult  phase   of\r\n\r\nimplementation.  This will require the unified response  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  -  the public sector, the private sector  and  the\r\n\r\npeople sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, instead of continuing to make a long\r\n\r\nexposition on what\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  is, I think it is more important to give  Members\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to come forward and say for themselves what they\r\n\r\nfeel Singapore should be in the 21st century.  I look forward to\r\n\r\nsupport from Members of this House for this vision. And  I  look\r\n\r\nforward to hearing your ideas on how we can realise this vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1 - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE 21</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  register my whole-hearted support for the motion standing in\r\n\r\nthe name of the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As both the Prime Minister and the Chairman have stressed,\r\n\r\nSingapore   21   is  not  the  Government's  concept   of   what\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should do in the next century.  Neither  is  it  an\r\n\r\neconomic  blueprint.   It is what some 6,000  Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nexpressed as the Singapore they want for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has elaborated, Singapore 21 highlights\r\n\r\nfive key ideas which initially appear to be so obvious.  But are\r\n\r\nthey really that obvious?  Are these key ideas merely motherhood\r\n\r\nstatements?  I believe the acid test is the extent to  which  we\r\n\r\napply  these evergreen ideas as guiding principles for our lives\r\n\r\nas an individual, as a society and as a country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many may ask what is the relevance of Singapore 21 to\r\n\r\nthe crisis.  Is Singapore 21 a vision that can be discussed only\r\n\r\nwhen buoyant economic times allow us\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  luxury?  No, it should be a set of guiding principles that\r\n\r\nwe  adopt  regardless of the economic situation.  I believe  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  is to consistently live by these principles  and  not\r\n\r\njust during a crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we do not start from a zero base and the Singapore\r\n\r\n21 spirit is already being felt.  Allow me, Sir, to elaborate on\r\n\r\nhow  directly  relevant  this is to  the  current  crisis.   The\r\n\r\nrecession  from  the regional turmoil has injected  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nreality  to  the  vision.  Our response as a people  illustrates\r\n\r\nbeautifully  how  ideas  and concepts  can  be  translated  into\r\n\r\npractice and demonstrates the extent to which we relate to  each\r\n\r\nother, our community and Singapore at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the crisis has evoked a sense of national pride\r\n\r\nand  collective  will.  Sir, the cost-cutting measures  were  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  driven by the Government but they relied heavily on  each\r\n\r\nand  every  Singaporean's conviction and will to, firstly,  bear\r\n\r\nsome  pain in order to regain our competitiveness and, secondly,\r\n\r\nto contribute towards Singapore's ability to progress beyond the\r\n\r\ncrisis by agreeing to be reskilled and upgraded.  Of course,  we\r\n\r\nare  not  out of the regional woods yet but a nation of mentally\r\n\r\nprepared  and willing Singaporeans is a necessary and meaningful\r\n\r\nprerequisite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the crisis has heightened our sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards each other.  The people sector comprising\r\n\r\nmany  self-help,  voluntary  and  community  organisations   are\r\n\r\nalready in full swing, reaching out to Singaporeans in need in a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  ways.   For  example,  many  Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  are  already  assisting  retrenched  workers  in   job\r\n\r\nsearches  while  others help out with basic essentials  such  as\r\n\r\nmeals and groceries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently, on May Day, some 60,000 Singaporeans under\r\n\r\nthe  `Love Singapore' banner, walked to raise funds for some  24\r\n\r\ncharities  as  the  crisis has made fund  raising  a  challenge.\r\n\r\nThis, to me, is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmoving tribute to how when the going gets tough, the tough  goes\r\n\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the crisis has caused us to revisit the values we\r\n\r\nknow  so  well.   Sir, many a family is facing the  pressure  of\r\n\r\ncoping   with  the  crisis,  particularly  if  there  has   been\r\n\r\nretrenchment or prolonged unemployment.  Family members  tighten\r\n\r\ntheir belts in a collective effort to reduce household expenses.\r\n\r\nFrequently,  extended  family members  chip  in  with  financial\r\n\r\nassistance and, more importantly, moral support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly touched by a retiree's response to how\r\n\r\nhe reacted to his son's plight when the latter had to settle for\r\n\r\na  less-paying job.  He reassured his son that, firstly, he  was\r\n\r\nwilling to forgo his monthly allowance, and, that secondly,  his\r\n\r\nrespect and love for his son remained the same as long as he had\r\n\r\ntried his best.  This thoughtful father is prepared to adapt  to\r\n\r\nchanging circumstances and has done a great deal to relieve  his\r\n\r\nson's stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even without the crisis, most Singaporeans already\r\n\r\nexperience  a  certain  amount  of  stress  brought  on  by  the\r\n\r\nincreasingly  competitive global marketplace and  fast  changing\r\n\r\ntechnology.   As  we  know, stress is not necessarily  bad.   An\r\n\r\nathlete  will  be  quick  to tell you  that  without  subjecting\r\n\r\nhimself  to  punishing  goals, he would not  be  able  to  break\r\n\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the causes of stress can be traced to a narrow\r\n\r\ndefinition of success.  How often do we subconsciously  look  at\r\n\r\nothers  through  glasses that count in dollars  or  through  the\r\n\r\nhouses  that  they own?  As a society, our history has  revolved\r\n\r\naround  building  a vibrant economy in a short period  of  time,\r\n\r\nthus  leading  to  a  lot of emphasis on economic  and  material\r\n\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, we have unwittingly defined success very\r\n\r\nnarrowly,  only  by  good grades if you are a  student  and  the\r\n\r\nability to make a lot of money if you are a working adult.  This\r\n\r\nnarrow  definition of success in turn affects our self-worth  or\r\n\r\nself-esteem.  And low self-esteem will lead\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nus  to  think  that  we  do not matter to our  family,  friends,\r\n\r\ncommunity or even country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that children can easily feel unworthy.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  it  is one thing for parents to  encourage  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to work hard for good academic results; it is  another\r\n\r\nto condemn them because they are not as bright as their cousins.\r\n\r\nAt  one  focus group discussion which my Subject Committee  had,\r\n\r\nalthough there was consensus that society as a whole must  widen\r\n\r\nthe  notion  of  success,  there was  some  resignation  to  the\r\n\r\ninability to change collective mindsets.  I believe this is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  a  campaign  can  address,  although  obviously,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can help influence and change mindsets.   It  really\r\n\r\nbegins  in  each  and every one of us as we are  the  collective\r\n\r\njudge  of  how we view each other.  Mindset changes may  take  a\r\n\r\nlong  time  but raising awareness to the need for  a  change  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely a good starting point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the close of my speech where I would like\r\n\r\nto  urge  all  Singaporeans to assume collective  ownership  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the Singapore 21 movement.  For it is when we\r\n\r\nfeel   responsible  for  our  own  destinies  that,  with   some\r\n\r\nfacilitation  by  the Government, we can hope  to  remain  truly\r\n\r\ncohesive as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, let me speak on the\r\n\r\ntopic  \"Every Singaporean Matters\".  In an age of globalisation,\r\n\r\nwhere  nations face tremendous pressures from outside, there  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  tremendous transference of values that we, as  a  young\r\n\r\nnation, have to contend with.  The debate that we face today  on\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of the Singapore 21 Committee  is  crucial\r\n\r\nbecause  we  need to prepare now for the future.  I commend  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 Committee and all participants of the  discussions\r\n\r\norganised  by  the Committee for coming up with  this  document.\r\n\r\nWhat we have before us is not just a collection of views of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee, but the collective wisdom of many, many more  people,\r\n\r\nabout 6,000 in all, who care about the development and future of\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise therefore to support this motion. The\r\n\r\nrecommendations put forth raise further questions on how we  can\r\n\r\nobtain the best future for Singaporeans, transcending all levels\r\n\r\nand  across all boundaries that separate us as individuals.  The\r\n\r\npreparations  we  make  today  are  our  legacy  to   the   next\r\n\r\ngeneration, and with the steps we take now, we must ensure  that\r\n\r\nfuture  generations  applaud our actions in  ensuring  not  only\r\n\r\ntheir survival but also their prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range and complexity of issues arising from a world\r\n\r\nwithout  borders impose challenges that require us to  form  new\r\n\r\nattitudes  as  we are forced to address issues - issues  brought\r\n\r\nabout  through the transference of outside values, that we never\r\n\r\nhad  to  face  before.   This is the cost of  progression  to  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  industry, a progression that  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nensure us a place in the international economy and community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the call for foreign talent echoing through the past\r\n\r\nfew  years,  especially in the past few months,  at  a  time  of\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis,  some  of our people  have  been  afraid  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would be marginalised in the Government's  bid  to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign talent.  We should not take lightly the  recent\r\n\r\nemotions  raised by this spectre which came bubbling up  to  the\r\n\r\nsurface when Singaporeans were losing jobs.  I appreciate  their\r\n\r\nconcerns.  Somewhere, if our people do not understand, then  the\r\n\r\nmessage  put out has gone astray, so we have to give our  vision\r\n\r\ngreater clarity and transparency, and areas of friction have  to\r\n\r\nbe addressed.  We have to answer difficult questions; what do we\r\n\r\nmean  by foreign talent, should remunerations of foreigners  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of equal talent differ, are the goodies provided to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign  talent also available for Singaporean  talent,\r\n\r\nwhat  kinds of foreign talent do we need, are controls in  place\r\n\r\nto  ensure that \"riff-raff\" of the world are sifted out and what\r\n\r\nare these controls.  These are just a few of the questions which\r\n\r\nneed to be clarified.  In the end, the phrase \"Every Singaporean\r\n\r\nMatters\" must be believed by the people because we can only rely\r\n\r\non ourselves to make sure that we matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is quite easy to ask questions and raise concern but\r\n\r\nit  is  not easy to find the solutions.  On the issue of foreign\r\n\r\ntalent,  we  have to help Singaporeans see the big picture  too.\r\n\r\nTo  start  with, the number of foreign workers is controlled  by\r\n\r\nthe quota system.  So, the majority of workers in Singapore will\r\n\r\nalways  be Singaporeans.  Foreign talents are brought in not  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of Singaporeans.  Instead, we need foreign  talents\r\n\r\nto  help  enhance our competitiveness and competitive  edge  and\r\n\r\ncreate even more jobs for Singaporeans.  I suppose we need to do\r\n\r\na  little bit more work to convince Singaporeans that we do need\r\n\r\nto welcome foreign talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what our labour movement is doing, together with the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the employers federation,  is  to  help  create\r\n\r\nskills  among  Singapore workers, especially the  older  workers\r\n\r\nwith  low  skills,  so  that they remain relevant  and  able  to\r\n\r\nfunction in the knowledge-based economy.  To me, this is how our\r\n\r\nsociety  tries to meet the needs and protect the basic interests\r\n\r\nof  the  older Singaporean workers, for the best welfare we  can\r\n\r\nextend to our fellow Singaporeans is to create jobs for them and\r\n\r\nenhance  their  employability.  In this respect, I  applaud  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's decision, announced by the Prime Minister on Labour\r\n\r\nDay,  to give more funds to NTUC's Education and Training  Funds\r\n\r\n(ETF)  and  Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)  so  that  more\r\n\r\nSingaporean   workers   can   benefit   from   skills   training\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Sir, it shows that we do care for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans are to believe that each and every one of\r\n\r\nthem  matters, then the voice of each sector of society must  be\r\n\r\nheard and taken seriously by society and by the Government.   We\r\n\r\nmust be respectful of each other and each sector of the society,\r\n\r\nrespect  for  them  as  being  a  group  of  intelligent  fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens.  If we mean to tell people that they matter, they must\r\n\r\nbe  informed  first before certain actions that can affect  them\r\n\r\nare  taken.  Take SingNet's scanning of the vulnerability of the\r\n\r\ncomputers of its 200,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nInternet  subscribers without first telling them  about  it.   I\r\n\r\nappreciate  SingNet's explanation, but somehow,  there  is  this\r\n\r\nfeeling  that customers should be the last to know.   Sir,  this\r\n\r\nmust change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then take the case of Tampines Town Council's decision to\r\n\r\ncharge  $300 per session to a group of women who exercise weekly\r\n\r\nat  a  public  park in Tampines.  If the town council  needs  to\r\n\r\ncharge a fee to cover some maintenance costs, it should consider\r\n\r\na  reasonable fee.  And if it is true that the town council  had\r\n\r\nwanted to charge as much as $300 per session to the group of 40,\r\n\r\nthen  I think it is much too much.  I believe there is no racial\r\n\r\nundertone here.  And there should not be any such thing.  But we\r\n\r\nare  talking about people in the age group and racial background\r\n\r\nwho  are most vulnerable to the heart and related illnesses, who\r\n\r\nneed  to  exercise,  and should be encouraged  to  do  so.   The\r\n\r\nResidents' Committee of the area can help them organise  better,\r\n\r\nand  these  such  groups need to be told of their responsibility\r\n\r\nand  obligations  in  using  public  places  like  the  park  in\r\n\r\nTampines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether the Straits Times has sensationalised the\r\n\r\nmatter or not, it is something that must be ironed out.  What we\r\n\r\nneed  to  do is therefore to include, and not to exclude people.\r\n\r\nIt  will help make our people feel that they do matter,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  serious about strengthening family and social cohesion.   I\r\n\r\ncan  only read out the reaction of a 16-year old youth  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter  to remind ourselves of the need of not losing  sight  of\r\n\r\nthe  big picture.  Mr Safarudin Abdul Rahman was quoted  by  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times to have said, \"Relax-lah, this is an  open  space\r\n\r\nfor  public use.  What's this talk about one people, one nation,\r\n\r\none Singapore?\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as recommended by the report, we have to widen our\r\n\r\ndefinition of success but how we are going to do that has yet to\r\n\r\nbe  looked at.  One of the crucial areas where social change can\r\n\r\noccur is in our schools because it is there that we prepare  our\r\n\r\nchildren  to  become  the citizens of tomorrow.   Our  education\r\n\r\nsystem   has   been  geared  towards  examinations   and   paper\r\n\r\nqualifications and, therefore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsociety sees paper qualifications as the ultimate measurement of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   How  are we going to change this?   This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant question.  We are going in the right direction when we\r\n\r\nstart  to  look into making project work one of the requirements\r\n\r\nof  university  admission.   We can go  further  by  looking  at\r\n\r\nintroducing  project  work  and open book  examinations  at  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels of streaming.  These encourage more  thinking,\r\n\r\nanalysis  and creativity than the kind of examinations  we  have\r\n\r\ntoday which only encourage rote learning and a blinkered vision.\r\n\r\nWe  have to look into the best teaching methods in the world and\r\n\r\nwork this into the training of our teachers.  We could also look\r\n\r\ninto  giving our teachers wider exposure in different styles  of\r\n\r\nteaching  by  exchange  programmes  with  schools  in  different\r\n\r\ncountries.  At the same time, it provides our teachers  with  an\r\n\r\ninternational  outlook that they pass on to  the  students  they\r\n\r\nteach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also look into increasing the number of and\r\n\r\nimproving  the  standards of specialty  schools  that  we  have.\r\n\r\nSingapore has the potential to become the regional hub for  fine\r\n\r\narts because of our centrality in the region and because we have\r\n\r\nthe  resources  to  ensure  quality  education,  facilities  and\r\n\r\nfacilitators.  We can talk about Government financial support to\r\n\r\nset up facilities, to pay world-class lecturers and to subsidise\r\n\r\ngenius  but this kind of aid will never be able to achieve  what\r\n\r\nit  has  set  out  to do.  All the money in the world  will  not\r\n\r\npersuade  Singapore and that each and every one of them  matters\r\n\r\nin  the blueprint of Singaporean achievement.  What is crucially\r\n\r\nneeded  is  acceptance,  acceptance  of  Singaporeans  that  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.  We recognise only those who have made it in terms of\r\n\r\nfinancial  gains or reputation and all the recognition  that  we\r\n\r\ngive to those who excel also gives rise to a sense of failure in\r\n\r\nthe rest.  What makes a musician successful to Singapore society\r\n\r\n-   only   when   he   is  recognised  as   a   great   musician\r\n\r\ninternationally.  Are the other Singaporean musicians  failures?\r\n\r\nHave they not succeeded in their own terms?  We cannot be afraid\r\n\r\nthat  if we stop the continual praising of those who have become\r\n\r\nthe best internationally, that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrest of Singapore will stop striving to be the best!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other level, the self worth of any individual can be\r\n\r\nstrengthened  by  his family.  To have strong family  bonds  can\r\n\r\nensure  an  individual's success in any field and his confidence\r\n\r\nto  take different paths in his life.  Failure can only be  felt\r\n\r\nwithin when your family designates you a failure, but this  will\r\n\r\nnever happen in strong families that recognise the worth of each\r\n\r\nfamily member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lynchpin of any strong family normally revolves around\r\n\r\nthe  woman, perhaps contrary to the belief of society.   In  the\r\n\r\nroles of wife, mother and daughter which sometimes occur at  the\r\n\r\nsame time or in different phases, women determine whether family\r\n\r\nholds together through each period of stress.  Much more has  to\r\n\r\nbe  done  to assist women in the workplace.  It is not only  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of flexible working arrangements for women.   There\r\n\r\nhas  also  got  to be a change in the way our society  looks  at\r\n\r\nwomen who work.  Women are sidelined in their careers once  they\r\n\r\ndemand   flexible  working  arrangements,  as   if   these   are\r\n\r\nintolerable conditions to be imposed on the company.  This  goes\r\n\r\nto  the  roots  of the way our society is structured.   I  think\r\n\r\nprobably  it  is time for us to look into how we  look  at  this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at our older workers, we have extended the\r\n\r\nretirement  age to 62, as our people live longer and  in  better\r\n\r\nhealth.  We also need to find ways and means to allow our  older\r\n\r\nworkers to continue working with dignity and self-respect.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should look at other ways of persuading companies  to\r\n\r\nkeep their senior employees beyond the mandatory retirement  age\r\n\r\nof  62.  One way is perhaps to look at reducing company tax with\r\n\r\nevery such worker whom the company continues to employ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, overall, when we look at the achievements of\r\n\r\nSingapore, we have developed most in the economic realm.  Though\r\n\r\nthe Government has done everything possible to ensure that these\r\n\r\nachievements profit every citizen, it remains a fact  that  some\r\n\r\nhave succeeded\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetter  than others, and that there is a marginalised sector  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  society  which  has not  integrated.   What  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  in  economic  terms must now be  supported  by  social\r\n\r\nintegration and cohesiveness, especially when we are faced  with\r\n\r\nthe homogenizing effect of globalisation.  It is from the values\r\n\r\nof our society that we define ourselves as a nation, rather than\r\n\r\nan economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity to clarify some of the points that were made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  just now.  I do so because I do not want this  issue  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  life  of its own, especially when the facts  are  quite\r\n\r\ncontrary to what has been reported in the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very good story, sensational in many respects and,\r\n\r\nin fact, if it were true, then I think it would lend credence to\r\n\r\nthe views of some people that some parts of Government are still\r\n\r\nvery  bureaucratic  and  very unreasonable.   But  let  me  give\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House the facts, and then we can take  it  from\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC. The festival\r\n\r\npark in question is in my constituency and, therefore, I think I\r\n\r\nam  in a very good position to give Members the facts.  First of\r\n\r\nall,  the  group in question has been exercising in the festival\r\n\r\npark  for  the last two years with no problems, no payments,  no\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  So the question of payment of any amount  does  not\r\n\r\narise  at all.  So, what happened?  Two weeks ago, there  was  a\r\n\r\nletter of complaint that reached the Residents' Committee.   The\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committee had to act on that complaint  because  the\r\n\r\nresident complained that when she wanted to join that group, she\r\n\r\nwas  not  allowed  to  do so.  The Chairman  of  the  Residents'\r\n\r\nCommittee together with other members then approached the  group\r\n\r\nin  question, asked for clarification, suggested that they  join\r\n\r\ntogether.   There was an exchange of words, I believe, arguments\r\n\r\nensued, heated words were exchanged, and they parted without any\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was kept informed of the situation. My worry, frankly,\r\n\r\nwas because the group in question was a group of Malay women.  I\r\n\r\nwanted  to  make sure that the group would be able  to  continue\r\n\r\nwith  their  activities in a way that does not exclude  anybody.\r\n\r\nSo when the group met me about two weeks ago, after the incident\r\n\r\nwith  the RC, I suggested to the group that they should register\r\n\r\ntheir  intention to use the park with the Town Council, so  that\r\n\r\nwe  are able to make sure that the park is properly managed  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no clash of activities.  I also told  the  group\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  free  to  use the park without  any  charge  on\r\n\r\ncondition  that they allow members who wish to join them  to  do\r\n\r\nso.   I have heard nothing more from the group, until I saw  the\r\n\r\nreport in the Straits Times which took me entirely by surprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Obviously, the group must have been unhappy\r\n\r\nwith  their altercation with the RC and went to the press.   The\r\n\r\npress  asked  a  few  questions of the Town Council.   The  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil  answered a few questions, such as, \"Do people  have  to\r\n\r\npay  to  use  the  park?  Do people have to pay  to  use  public\r\n\r\nfacilities?\"   The answer is \"Yes\".  \"How much do they  have  to\r\n\r\npay?\"  Amounts that range from $10 all the way to $300, if it is\r\n\r\na very elaborate affair like a wedding.  Lo and behold, a report\r\n\r\ncomes out that you either pay or go away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this was a very serious matter which was of great\r\n\r\nconcern  to all of us.  First, because we do not want to exclude\r\n\r\nanybody.   But, second, we want to make sure that the facilities\r\n\r\nin  the  constituency are available for use  by  all  residents.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the residents are paying conservancy fees to the Town\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the  Town  Council  has  to  make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nfacilities are properly used.  But it is a municipal matter.  It\r\n\r\nis  not a big issue.  And we thought we had resolved the matter.\r\n\r\nUntil  it became a big issue because the issue now is a question\r\n\r\nof  paying $300 or go away.  There was never any question  about\r\n\r\npayment.  There was never any question about asking the group to\r\n\r\ngo  away.   All  that  was  asked was  to  make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of the group are regularised and that the  residents\r\n\r\nare allowed to join in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has become an issue that has caught a lot of people's\r\n\r\nattention.   It has become an issue ranging from whether  people\r\n\r\nshould  pay  to  use  public facilities, to  why  one  group  is\r\n\r\ndiscriminated  against.  I think it should not be  an  issue  in\r\n\r\nthis  debate, and this is the reason why I would like to clarify\r\n\r\nthis  point.   It  is a municipal issue which should  have  been\r\n\r\nresolved.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the reporters and\r\n\r\nthe newspaper in question decided to blow it up and turn it into\r\n\r\na big issue.  The facts I have put before this House are what is\r\n\r\nknown  to  me.  Unfortunately, it may have stopped a good  story\r\n\r\nfrom  being written.  I have made the clarification  twice.   On\r\n\r\nSunday,  I  made this clarification.  A small report  came  out.\r\n\r\nSome  of  you may have missed it, but the newspaper  decided  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  with  another  story today.   I  have  made  another\r\n\r\nclarification this afternoon to the reporter.  Since  Mr  Hawazi\r\n\r\nhas raised it, I am making another clarification, and I will see\r\n\r\nwhat  happens  tomorrow.  But let us not get distracted  from  a\r\n\r\nserious  issue before this House, which is a debate on Singapore\r\n\r\n21  which talks about what Singaporeans want Singapore to be  in\r\n\r\nthe next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall\r\n\r\nfocus  my speech on national issues and stay away from municipal\r\n\r\nissues!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the Committee's efforts in charting\r\n\r\na  new  paradigm  -  to secure Singapore's success in  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.  In particular, I am happy to note that there has  been\r\n\r\nan  extensive  consultation  process  across  a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\nindividuals and institutions.  Indeed, this goes to strengthen a\r\n\r\nkey  element  of  our success thus far, and  that  is  consensus\r\n\r\nbuilding.  It is important as we move into the  information  age\r\n\r\nin  the new millennium, that we not only continue but also widen\r\n\r\nour  net  for  feedback gathering in this  spirit  of  consensus\r\n\r\nbuilding.  This will ensure that Singaporeans can both feel  and\r\n\r\nplay  a  direct  part in the future of our  country.   It  makes\r\n\r\nSingaporeans responsible for their destiny, and strengthens  our\r\n\r\ncohesiveness and unity as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed heartening to note that the S21 Committee has\r\n\r\ncontinued  to stress the value of strong families as foundations\r\n\r\nfor  our  future  success.   This  has  been  the  hallmark  and\r\n\r\nunderlying strength of our society since independence.  With the\r\n\r\nrapid  progress and modernization permeating through our society\r\n\r\ntoday,  it is critical that the family should continue to  be  a\r\n\r\nsource  of  strength, and that we do not go  down  the  path  of\r\n\r\nunbridled   individualism  leading  to  social  alienation   and\r\n\r\ndislocation of individuals, as is happening in other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains a source of concern that the rapid and fast-changing Singapore society today, with its many stresses and\r\n\r\nburdens  on  the  individual, has led to  fragmentation  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily unit over the years.  Now, we are striving to refocus the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  success  in  terms of  economic  well-being  and\r\n\r\nmaterial wealth.  We are extending it to other enviable pursuits\r\n\r\nlike   job   satisfaction,  the  arts,  culture  and   community\r\n\r\nactivities.  We are also encouraging Singaporeans to embrace the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy  (KBE),  and  to  engage  in  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning,   develop  an  interest  and  participate   in   civic\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of all these, it is timely to remind\r\n\r\nourselves that we have to continue to uphold the pre-eminence of\r\n\r\nthe  role  of  Asian family values, even as we  move  towards  a\r\n\r\nradical   transformation  of  our  societal  values  in  future.\r\n\r\nPositive  values such as filial piety, respect for  our  elders,\r\n\r\nethics,  honesty, integrity and nuclear families should continue\r\n\r\nto  play  a  significant  role in our  lifestyles  in  the  next\r\n\r\nmillennium.   The  basic building block of our  society  has  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  the  family  and  not  the  individual.    The\r\n\r\nindividual  can grow and express himself in the KBE environment,\r\n\r\nbut  only as far as the bonds of family, the community  and  the\r\n\r\nnation remain intact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that all the goals that form part of the S21\r\n\r\nReport  are  necessary  for  our  future  success  in  the  next\r\n\r\nmillennium.   My question is: is what we have laid  out  in  the\r\n\r\nReport enough to enshrine the family as the fundamental unit  of\r\n\r\nour society and secure the primacy of our family based\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvalues?  Indeed, one of the recommendations in the Report,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government could encourage flexible work arrangements, such\r\n\r\nas part-time work, working from the home and job sharing deserve\r\n\r\nmore  emphasis.   As the biggest employer in Singapore,  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should lead the way.  I would like  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat the Government consider introducing flexible work hours, or\r\n\r\neven  a  5-day work week in certain non-critical public services\r\n\r\nin  the  next  millennium.  This would also serve  to  encourage\r\n\r\nemployers  in  the private sector to follow suit and  to  change\r\n\r\ntheir  reward  and remuneration system to one of efficiency  and\r\n\r\nproductivity,  as  opposed to time spent in the  office,  as  is\r\n\r\ncurrently the arrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More flexible working hours or a 5-day work week has not\r\n\r\nimpeded the productivity of USA, for example, which is currently\r\n\r\nthe most productive nation in the world.  It has served well  to\r\n\r\npresent  the individuals there the opportunities to  spend  more\r\n\r\ntime  pursuing  civic and community activities,  engage  in  KBE\r\n\r\nactivities through continuing education, and develop interest in\r\n\r\narts  and culture.  More importantly, for Singapore in the  next\r\n\r\ncentury,  it  would allow more opportunity for  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nspend  time  with their family such as for leisure  pursuits  to\r\n\r\nbuild up intergenerational bonds.  I would like to suggest  that\r\n\r\nalthough  this  concept of a 5-day work week may be  radical  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, it would tie in and allow for the gradual achievement\r\n\r\nof  the  goals in the S21 Report, which as a package involves  a\r\n\r\nseries   of   changes  in  mindset,  personal   evaluation   and\r\n\r\nlifestyles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am conscious of the fact that Singaporeans have been\r\n\r\nconditioned  for many years to think of success in economic  and\r\n\r\nmaterial terms, and also to look to the Government to solve most\r\n\r\nof their problems.  This has led to a curious paradox that there\r\n\r\nis  a \"dependency effect\" where the general population generally\r\n\r\nexpects the Government to step in to solve problems at both  the\r\n\r\npersonal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  the social levels.  I am certain that every Member of  this\r\n\r\nHouse   would   have   encountered  this  in  their   experience\r\n\r\ninteracting with residents.  And it is ironic that at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  these residents also complain that the Government is  too\r\n\r\nnannying and interventionist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore timely to encourage Singaporeans, as\r\n\r\nreflected  in the Report, to take responsibility and  pride  for\r\n\r\ntheir  lives  and  their community.  It is  also  worthwhile  to\r\n\r\nstress  and  encourage a culture that allows  for  greater  risk\r\n\r\ntaking.  Instead of just recommending that society gives  second\r\n\r\nchances,  and  be more tolerant of failure, I believe  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   could  also  play  a  greater  role   than   merely\r\n\r\nencouraging Singaporeans to pursue alternative interests in  the\r\n\r\narts or sports.  The Government and the civil service could give\r\n\r\ngreater   recognition  for  mature  degrees   when   considering\r\n\r\nemployment,  for example, and also consider revising  bankruptcy\r\n\r\nlaws to make it easier for an individual to turn failure into  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.   As an example, an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley  who\r\n\r\nhas had many failures is not viewed as a failure but indeed as a\r\n\r\nvery  experienced person, as he has had accumulated a wealth  of\r\n\r\nfailures    and   experience.    In   addition,   to   encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship in Singapore, the Government could also  review\r\n\r\nthe  prohibition  of registering offices or  businesses  in  HDB\r\n\r\ndwellings,  so  as  to  allow  for wider  proliferation  of  KBE\r\n\r\nbusiness  activities, and greater opportunities for families  to\r\n\r\ninteract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore of the 21st century, we can easily\r\n\r\nenvisage that a large proportion of our citizens would be living\r\n\r\nabroad  at  any  one time.  They could be away  on  business  or\r\n\r\nposted  overseas as our companies regionalise or even globalise.\r\n\r\nThey  could  be pursuing academic studies or even be on  holiday\r\n\r\nabroad.   They could have retired and choose to reside overseas.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would be highly mobile in the  next  century.   In\r\n\r\norder to make Singapore the home where the family, community and\r\n\r\nsocietal  bonds are meaningful to these people and to  encourage\r\n\r\nthem wherever they are to have the heartbeat of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  have  to allow for greater civic  and  community\r\n\r\nparticipation  at  all levels.  The spirit of inclusiveness  and\r\n\r\nconsensus  building that created this report has to be  extended\r\n\r\nto  those living abroad.  In time we may even consider reviewing\r\n\r\nour  immigration policy to allow Singaporeans who had previously\r\n\r\nleft  to  return  home, as they may then identify  and  want  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to Singapore's continued success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the recommendations of this Report.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  am  somewhat concerned that  there  is  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nconcrete  implementation strategies.  Although there is argument\r\n\r\nthat  society will only move as fast as it is ready to do so,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the Government's role to nurture society  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction is significant.  In this respect,  I  therefore\r\n\r\nrecommend  that  the  Government consider commissioning  a  full\r\n\r\nreview  of how the recommendations of this Report can be adopted\r\n\r\nand  implemented  by the civil service and the  many  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  and  the  Community Development Councils  as  well  as\r\n\r\nthrough  the private sector.  This will ensure that we  can  put\r\n\r\nour  first  foot  forward  in the door towards  the  success  of\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 when the new millennium starts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah\r\n\r\nTarmugi):   Mr  Speaker, Sir, at the Committee of Supply  debate\r\n\r\nearlier this year, I had outlined to Members of the House  three\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  thrusts that my Ministry would  pursue  to  build\r\n\r\nsocial  capital  for the future.  To recap,  we  will  intensify\r\n\r\nefforts  to build strong and stable families.  The S21 reaffirms\r\n\r\nour  belief that the family is a fundamental building  block  of\r\n\r\nour  society.  My Ministry is fully committed to this philosophy\r\n\r\nand   vision.   Second,  we  must  anticipate  and  address  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of  our  ageing  population.   And  third,  we  must\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  social service sector as part of  the  national\r\n\r\neffort to build a dynamic and vibrant people sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>MCD's Commitment to S21</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five Key Ideas developed by the Singapore 21 Committee\r\n\r\nwill give my Ministry fresh impetus in these three\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nareas  of  focus.   Collectively, the five  Ideas  articulate  a\r\n\r\nconcrete  yet  robust  vision of the kind of  society  that  our\r\n\r\npolicies  must strive to realise.  Indeed, many of my Ministry's\r\n\r\ncore functions are aligned with what S21 seeks to achieve.   Our\r\n\r\nrehabilitation programmes for juvenile offenders, the protection\r\n\r\nwe  give  to  victims of family violence, and the assistance  we\r\n\r\nprovide  to the less able and less fortunate members of society,\r\n\r\nall  support the idea that Every Singaporean Matters.  The basis\r\n\r\nfor  this  assistance has been that everyone deserves  a  second\r\n\r\nchance  and  should  be helped to become a responsible  citizen,\r\n\r\ncontributing to our nation.  The guiding philosophy remains that\r\n\r\npeople should be helped to help themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, MCD has, over the years, forged a close\r\n\r\npartnership  with  voluntary  welfare  organisations,  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups,  religious  organisations and other  civic  groups  that\r\n\r\nprovide  social services.  Many are involved in the  running  of\r\n\r\nwelfare homes, halfway houses, family service centres, day  care\r\n\r\ncentres  for  the  young  and  old,  and  other  social  service\r\n\r\nfacilities.  They serve their fellow Singaporeans tirelessly and\r\n\r\nselflessly, regardless of race, language or religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with the people sector also suggests that\r\n\r\nwhen  the community and the Government work in close partnership\r\n\r\nto  serve  the community, we reach more individuals and families\r\n\r\nbetter  than either party could on its own.  Services  would  be\r\n\r\nprovided  with  greater  compassion and be  more  meaningful  to\r\n\r\nrecipients.    However,  this  partnership  has  not   developed\r\n\r\novernight.   It  requires  a  high  level  of  co-operation  and\r\n\r\ncollaboration  on  both sides and a mutual  respect  honed  over\r\n\r\ntime.   It  also demands a common vision and a shared commitment\r\n\r\namong a wide spectrum of civic groups from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is committed to developing and\r\n\r\nstrengthening  new  partnerships with  the  people  sector.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve that this is important not just because we rely  on  the\r\n\r\npeople  sector to provide core social services, but also because\r\n\r\nthe people sector is an important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narena  to  bond  Singaporeans and to shape  a  sense  of  shared\r\n\r\nresponsibility and ownership for our collective welfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>MCD's S21 Initiatives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of this year, my Ministry will launch three\r\n\r\ninitiatives to signal our commitment to making the S21 Vision  a\r\n\r\nreality.   First, in the area of developing active  citizenship,\r\n\r\nwe  will  spearhead  the establishment of  a  national  body  to\r\n\r\npromote  volunteerism  as  a  way of  life  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nNational Volunteer Centre as it is tentatively called will be  a\r\n\r\npromotional and resource centre for individuals and corporations\r\n\r\nwho want to be part of the volunteer movement in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nCentre  will  work  with  volunteer activists  to  involve  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in community and social service,  and  enable  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  play  a  more direct role in  serving  the  public\r\n\r\nthrough a bottom-up process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the area of strengthening families, MCD will\r\n\r\nhold  a  series of public forums in June and July this  year  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the findings of the recently completed National  Survey\r\n\r\non the Family.  Through these forums, we hope to generate public\r\n\r\ninterest  and discussion on family issues close to the heart  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and in the process, identify policy  measures  and\r\n\r\nspecific programmes that will help to make the Singapore  family\r\n\r\nstronger and fulfil its care responsibilities better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the elderly front, we will launch a Stakeholder\r\n\r\nConsultation Programme to tap on the views of service  providers\r\n\r\nand key partners serving the elderly population.  This programme\r\n\r\nwill  help  to  ensure  a thorough and comprehensive  review  of\r\n\r\neldercare services and will form an integral part of the Elderly\r\n\r\nServices  Masterplan review the Ministry will  be  carrying  out\r\n\r\nlater this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, we can expect the people sector to grow\r\n\r\nin the years to come\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas   a  greater  diversity  of  civic  organisations  come  into\r\n\r\nexistence.   Each  of these new civic organisations  will  bring\r\n\r\nwith them their unique identities - their own raison d'etre, and\r\n\r\ntheir  own  strengths.  With increasing numbers, we should  also\r\n\r\nexpect  a  more  diverse and more vibrant people  sector.   This\r\n\r\ndiversity need not be viewed with alarm or alacrity as  long  as\r\n\r\nwe  are  united by a common national vision.  Instead, we should\r\n\r\nsee  this  as  the maturing of Singapore society and  a  growing\r\n\r\ndesire on the part of Singaporeans to contribute to their  wider\r\n\r\ncommunities.  By harnessing the resources of the people  sector,\r\n\r\nand  by  forging new partnerships with the new pairs of  Helping\r\n\r\nHands, I am confident that we can build a stronger, more vibrant\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said  that  we are on  the  threshold  of  a  new\r\n\r\nmillennium.   We  are  indeed a new generation  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nforging  into that millennium into a bold new future of our  own\r\n\r\nmaking.   It is an exciting prospect and the first step in  this\r\n\r\nlong  journey  has  begun with the release of the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nreport.   In reality, it is the report of not just the Committee\r\n\r\nbut  of the thousands of Singaporeans who have contributed their\r\n\r\nviews.   It  is  a  well-thought-out vision,  and  deserves  the\r\n\r\nunwavering  support and commitment of all of  us  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut  the report is only a sketch outline which needs filling up.\r\n\r\nThis  may  be  why  some  people  have  unfairly  called  it  \"a\r\n\r\ncollection of motherhood statements\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For acronym loving Singaporeans, the report begins aptly\r\n\r\nwith  an acronym - \"KBE\".  Pre-independence, it would have stood\r\n\r\nfor  \"Knight  of  the British Empire\".  In the  early  years  of\r\n\r\nindependence,  it could have stood for \"Kneel before  you  eat\".\r\n\r\nMany  Singaporeans were so poor they did not  know  where  their\r\n\r\nnext  meal would come from.  And they could only kneel and pray,\r\n\r\nor  beg.   In  later  years it probably  stood  for  \"Kiasu  but\r\n\r\nefficient\".   Not all of us are proud of these antecedents.   In\r\n\r\nthe new millennium, we want \"KBE\" to stand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  something dignified, grand and meaningful.  The report says\r\n\r\nit  stands for \"Knowledge-based Economy\".  I hope it stands  for\r\n\r\n\"Kindness blossoming everywhere\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindness and graciousness are two very rare commodities in\r\n\r\nany modern urban society.  They are rare because the practice of\r\n\r\nit  has  been forgotten.  City life is stressful, lonely, quick-paced  and  cold.   City life is to be endured  because  of  the\r\n\r\nmaterial benefits it brings to the family.  But city life in the\r\n\r\nend  is  dehumanising.   The  city  inhabitant  is  a  faceless,\r\n\r\nanonymous  digit  in the crowd.  He lives only for  himself  and\r\n\r\nensures  that whatever he does is to guarantee the  survival  of\r\n\r\nhis  family  and  his kin and himself.  In such an  environment,\r\n\r\nkindness  and graciousness do not grow.  In such an environment,\r\n\r\nthe  buffet tables get swiped clean two minutes after  they  are\r\n\r\nlaid  out  but mountains of wasted food are left to  be  cleared\r\n\r\nlater.   Queues are for jumping, free textbooks are for grabbing\r\n\r\nand waiters and maids are for venting out the frustrations.   It\r\n\r\nis  a  heartless and compassionless society and  nothing  to  be\r\n\r\nproud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nick of time comes this report, this vision - before\r\n\r\nour  community becomes too much like the ugly, urban  society  I\r\n\r\nhave  just  described.  A knowledge-based economy is  one  which\r\n\r\nvalues  everyone and gives everyone a role and a place,  a  name\r\n\r\nand  a  face, kindness and grace.  In a knowledge-based economy,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  job  that is despised.  Even the humble  cleaning\r\n\r\nworker,  the  waiter,  the  plumber  and  the  taxi  driver  are\r\n\r\nknowledge workers, not just the IT men.  Prime Minister  Goh  in\r\n\r\nhis  May  Day Rally speech three days ago has already  mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  cleaner  and the taxi driver.  Today, let  me  mention  the\r\n\r\nplumber and the waiter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the plumber. He is a mere plumber if all he can do\r\n\r\nis to tighten a faucet.  That we all can do.  Hence, we get very\r\n\r\nincensed  when we call the plumber into our homes  for  what  we\r\n\r\nthink is an emergency and he charges us $100 for tightening  the\r\n\r\ntap.  The plumber is a knowledge worker, however, if he is able\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  ascertain the whole cause of the so-called emergency on  the\r\n\r\ntelephone  and  give  good  advice without  home  visit  to  the\r\n\r\nhouseholder who really has only to tighten the tap.  The plumber\r\n\r\nis  a knowledge worker if he not only looks at the dripping  tap\r\n\r\nbut is able to give the householder some tips on what she can do\r\n\r\nin  future  to  prevent a recurrence of her  problem.   In  many\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries, such knowledge worker plumbers can earn  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  university professors and no one could  quibble  about\r\n\r\ntheir  fees.   The  S21  message must be  therefore  that  these\r\n\r\nplumbers  and  anybody  like that are as highly  valued  as  the\r\n\r\nscholar and the PhD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the waiter. In our society, tradition and social\r\n\r\nhistory  have  always put the waiter down at the bottom  of  the\r\n\r\nhierarchy  of workers.  The waiter holds a low image of  himself\r\n\r\nand  quickly  hops away to another job, even if it  is  a  lower\r\n\r\npaying  job, when he can.  It does not help that the  restaurant\r\n\r\nowner  who employs him uses him as an excuse to make more money.\r\n\r\nHow  so?  I refer to the often questioned but never objected  to\r\n\r\npractice  of  putting peanuts and pickles in front of  you  even\r\n\r\nthough  you  did  not  ask for it and to charge  you  exorbitant\r\n\r\nprices thereafter.  I refer too to the practice of the so-called\r\n\r\n\"service   charge\",  a  compulsory  10%  charge  on  your   bill\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether any real service has been rendered.  And\r\n\r\nall  these charges are supposed to go to the waiter, but  seldom\r\n\r\nend up in his pocket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knowledge worker waiter deserves good pay. The ordinary\r\n\r\nwaiter  who  waits  listlessly should be paid  a  minimum.   The\r\n\r\nknowledge  worker,  however, who helps his  customer  to  choose\r\n\r\ndishes which suit his pocket and taste, who is able to tell what\r\n\r\ningredients  are in the dishes he serves, who can indicate  what\r\n\r\nsauce goes with what meat and what tea or wine with what meal  - that  waiter should be handsomely paid.  For that to happen,  we\r\n\r\nmust do away with the service charge and hidden charges like the\r\n\r\npeanut  and  pickle  payments.  Nobody who gets  paid  the  same\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  what he knows and does is  ever  going  to  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to build up his knowledge and improve himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.34 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a developing nation, we need to strive to do excellently\r\n\r\nin  everything we do - whether it be waiting at tables,  turning\r\n\r\ntaps,  teaching,  nursing or governing.  We need  to  constantly\r\n\r\nremind ourselves not to slacken when we work or others will take\r\n\r\nour  places.  Our workforce has been ranked number  one  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  for 19 years consecutively not without reason.   Yet,  we\r\n\r\nknow that work is not the be-all and end-all of human existence.\r\n\r\nOur  workers  are not simply cogs in a well-lubricated  economic\r\n\r\nwheel.   Man does not live by bread alone.  We have seen to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of recreational facilities, theatres, sports  stadiums\r\n\r\nand  entertainment centres for the worker to use in his  leisure\r\n\r\nhours.   These  are  not enough if he has no  time  for  leisure\r\n\r\neither because he works too long since he has to earn enough  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the family going, or because the work week is unduly long.\r\n\r\nThese are not enough too if the costs of the facilities and  the\r\n\r\npleasure  spots are too high.  There is a need for us  to  build\r\n\r\nmore  and  better facilities for our residents and to constantly\r\n\r\nupgrade and improve them instead of letting these facilities run\r\n\r\ndown  to obsolescence.  Of course, we cannot have our population\r\n\r\ngo  soft and interested only in working less and playing all the\r\n\r\ntime.  A proper balance between working hard and playing hard is\r\n\r\nneeded.  And here, I support Mr Chew's earlier call that  it  is\r\n\r\ntime  to  review  the  51/2-day work week and  the  11-day  only\r\n\r\nnational holidays - policies we adopted when we were fighting to\r\n\r\nestablish ourselves in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more free time, our people can relax and improve the\r\n\r\nquality  of  their family lives and families will  be  stronger.\r\n\r\nThere will be healthier workers and less money spent on sickness\r\n\r\nand  disease.   With more free time, there will be  more  active\r\n\r\ncitizens.   Volunteers will be more forthcoming to help  out  in\r\n\r\nthe  charitable,  grassroots, community and civic  organisations\r\n\r\nthat we have.  In developing the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  sector, more civic involvement and greater participation\r\n\r\nof  the  citizenry (and that includes corporate citizens)  -  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  realise  that time and energies are limited.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  we  need  to pass the message  that  everyone  can\r\n\r\ncontribute,  however little he thinks his talents  or  resources\r\n\r\nare.   We also need to expand the definition of what is a worthy\r\n\r\ncause.   Many people do not find it difficult to volunteer  time\r\n\r\nand  effort  or  donate  money  to charitable  causes  like  the\r\n\r\nNational  Kidney  Foundation  or the  Singapore  Cancer  Society\r\n\r\nbecause these are what I call \"natural charities\" which  tug  at\r\n\r\nthe  heart.  But for society to function, there are other causes\r\n\r\nwhich  require workers and monetary support too.  There are  the\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committees which work to build bonds and  friendship\r\n\r\namongst neighbours; and the community centre workers who  labour\r\n\r\nto  provide inexpensive leisure and cultural programmes for  the\r\n\r\npopulace.   Indeed,  there  are also  the  people  who  are  our\r\n\r\nwatchdogs to ensure that we vigilantly upkeep the quality of our\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  nature reserves, the safety of  our  food  and\r\n\r\nconsumer  items,  the protection of consumers from  manipulative\r\n\r\nmarketeers and investment con-men.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can Government do to promote the people sector and\r\n\r\nencourage these meaningful civil groups?  There we have  lessons\r\n\r\nto  be  drawn  from  our very efficient and capable  network  of\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations.  How did we build this up so  quickly\r\n\r\nand  so well?  More generous Government funding is a key factor.\r\n\r\nMore recognition for the workers is another and this recognition\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have  to  take  the form of material  benefits.   The\r\n\r\nConsumers' Association of Singapore, which I head, is a case  in\r\n\r\npoint.  Every year, the Government gives us a grant capped at 13\r\n\r\ncents per head of population.  And in practice, this comes up to\r\n\r\nless  than  $500,000 a year.  Three quarters  of  this  go  into\r\n\r\nsalaries.   There is very little left to do the actual  work  of\r\n\r\ncost  monitoring and consumer protection, even  though  we  have\r\n\r\nvery  strong support from the NTUC, the unions and co-operatives\r\n\r\non  this matter.  I have asked for more from the Government.   I\r\n\r\nhave a formula based on consumer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspending index and I hope that this can be done.  Of course, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has  been  very generous  in  offering  CASE  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  grant  of one to one match.  But in  the  two  years\r\n\r\nsince that generous offer, we have hardly raised more than  half\r\n\r\na  million  dollars.  In a good year, it is already hard  enough\r\n\r\nfor  heart-tugging charities to raise money.   But  in  the  two\r\n\r\nyears  or  so,  we  have  raised little partly  because  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.  It will take forever at this rate to raise the\r\n\r\n$5  million we need to match the $10 million endowment fund that\r\n\r\nwe have planned for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to my last point and with that I will end.\r\n\r\nFund   raising   is  an  important  activity  for   many   civic\r\n\r\norganisations.   We  cannot depend solely on the  Government  to\r\n\r\nfund  these  activities of course, or to ask the  Government  to\r\n\r\nhelp  these  plans  work.   Ultimately,  we  need  an  army   of\r\n\r\nvolunteers and responsible businessmen who will gladly give some\r\n\r\nof  their time and resources to help make sure that the thriving\r\n\r\nmarket  economy  we  have  does not slide  unwittingly  into  an\r\n\r\nexploitative  and  lubricious one,  where  the  wolves  and  the\r\n\r\nheinous  are  always  lurking to sell  you  useless  gadgets  or\r\n\r\nostrich  eggs  (or perhaps buy shares off you) at  a  ridiculous\r\n\r\ndiscount because they play on your vulnerabilities.  I  call  on\r\n\r\nmy  fellow  Singaporeans to answer the call to come  forward  to\r\n\r\nmake  their lives count.  At the end of life, it is not how much\r\n\r\nyou  have  earned  that  counts, but how  many  lives  you  have\r\n\r\nimpacted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  speak in support of the motion standing in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As first impressions go, one of the very first must be the\r\n\r\nattractive  cover - showing four young children.  We can  deduce\r\n\r\nfrom  this  that it must be a long-term plan.   We  do  not  see\r\n\r\npictures   of  skyscrappers,  MRT  trains  and  ultra  high-tech\r\n\r\nfactories - we can deduce from this that the Committee  was  not\r\n\r\nlooking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninto the economic well-being of Singapore.  It presupposes it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we look at the title \"Together, we make the difference\",\r\n\r\nthe  two bigger words are \"We Make\" - suggesting that the future\r\n\r\nis  in  our hands; it is up to us to put in the effort.   As  we\r\n\r\nturn  to  the inside covers, we find hundreds of names  -  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  contributor matters, and deserves  acknowledgement.\r\n\r\nNo  contributor  too unimportant, no idea too insignificant,  no\r\n\r\nstone  too  small  to leave unturned.  It is a heartening  first\r\n\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as reports go, it is a slim volume, yet it says a lot.\r\n\r\nIt  is  said to be a compass, not a blueprint, and yet, it  does\r\n\r\nnot look like a simple compass, pointing in all directions.   It\r\n\r\npoints  in  a  certain  direction - that of  a  Great  Singapore\r\n\r\nSociety.   This  social compass contains  five  values  that  we\r\n\r\nshould support, values that have already been elaborated  on  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.   These values are in addition  to  the  ones  we\r\n\r\nalready  have,  ie,  meritocracy, strong and  clean  government,\r\n\r\nracial and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea that \"Every Singaporean matters\" together\r\n\r\nwith  the  idea of the \"active citizen\" are likely  to  be  much\r\n\r\ndiscussed - for they require a change to the current mindset  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, including those in the public sector.  For example,\r\n\r\none suggestion is to look at \"success\" more broadly from the one\r\n\r\nbased  on academic and material achievements.  According to  the\r\n\r\nview  of the Committee, \"there is no job too low that excellence\r\n\r\ncannot  dignify\".   Embracing  this  idea  would  lower  stress,\r\n\r\nincrease   self-worth  and  presumably,  make  for   a   happier\r\n\r\nindividual.   The  dilemma  between a less  stressful  life  and\r\n\r\nretaining  the  drive is partly resolved  by  this  means.   You\r\n\r\nshould  drive  only  as  far as your  abilities  can  take  you.\r\n\r\nFailure, it is suggested, is an option - and an opportunity must\r\n\r\nbe  given  for  trying again.  Not only must second  chances  be\r\n\r\nprovided for the new generation of technopreneurs, we must  also\r\n\r\nprovide  second chances to workers - to retrain, to be put  into\r\n\r\nnew jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message is particularly important. But it is not easy\r\n\r\nto   deliver.   Not  only  must  the  people  be  convinced  for\r\n\r\nthemselves, it must also extend to their aspirations  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  Several years ago, a concerned parent came to see  me\r\n\r\nbringing in tow his daughter who, despite her excellent  grades,\r\n\r\nwas  not  offered a place in the Law Faculty.   They  wanted  to\r\n\r\nappeal.  Every time I asked the daughter why she wanted to  read\r\n\r\nlaw,  the father interrupted, and gave many reasons.  It got  to\r\n\r\nsuch a stage that I asked the father for permission to speak  to\r\n\r\nthe  daughter  alone.  Without her father present, the  daughter\r\n\r\nspoke eloquently - on why we should not offer her a place -  she\r\n\r\nwas  more interested in Art and Design.  But her father  thought\r\n\r\nthat  there should be a lawyer in the family, having had a  hard\r\n\r\ntime  with  lawyers in the course of his business  dealings.   I\r\n\r\nthen  told  the father that, unfortunately, the appeal  was  not\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recounted this incident to show that the task of changing\r\n\r\nthe mindset is likely to be an onerous one.  And that much of it\r\n\r\nmay  lie  with  parents' aspirations of  what  they  want  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  be.   So  it is likely to  be  a  major  exercise,\r\n\r\nprobably  taking  a  couple of generations for  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nadjust to this new idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee rightly points out that the lead to be taken\r\n\r\nby  the Government is critical.  The curriculum, the scholarship\r\n\r\nschemes, the resources to cater to the unusual and extraordinary\r\n\r\ntalents  that  may  otherwise lie hidden.  These  require  major\r\n\r\nresources  and commitment.  To take a simple example,  the  move\r\n\r\naway from simply transferring information to one where each  and\r\n\r\nevery  child must be brought to give of his or her best requires\r\n\r\na  much  smaller  staff/student ratio. It  requires  experienced\r\n\r\nteachers  - teachers who can recognise the talents in  each  and\r\n\r\nevery child.  Yet, this is the way that we must necessarily go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several other examples can be mentioned to re-adjust the\r\n\r\nmindset.  The Gifted Programme should also be used to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake  in  those  who have talents in music, or art,  or  poetry.\r\n\r\nPresident's Scholars can be selected for arts or music  courses.\r\n\r\nOverseas   Merits  Scholars  can  be  sent  to  various   famous\r\n\r\ninstitutions of music or art to develop their undoubted talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, regional centres of arts and drama should be set\r\n\r\nup  to  bring  such talents closer to the people in the  various\r\n\r\nestates.   As  many of the Members in this House have  observed,\r\n\r\nnothing  brings more pride to a parent than to see  his  or  her\r\n\r\nchild  performing on stage.  It is at the time when they  choose\r\n\r\ntheir career that they make objections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the S21 Committee is not setting any\r\n\r\ndeadlines, or providing any detailed plans or targets.  That  is\r\n\r\na  matter for the Government, and for the Members in this  House\r\n\r\nto note.  In the weeks and years ahead, we can expect that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  opportunities  in this House to  debate  these  issues\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee deliberated for over a year, held many\r\n\r\nmeetings,   obtained   feedback  from  over   6,000   interested\r\n\r\nindividuals,  active citizens.  I believe  this  House  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore owe a great debt to the Committee  members\r\n\r\nand everyone who were involved in the exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has identified the values that would make the\r\n\r\npursuit  of happiness for each and every Singaporean a  reality.\r\n\r\nReading the report, I am reminded of an intriguing question once\r\n\r\nposed by a political scientist.  He asked, \"How can we construct\r\n\r\na  society  so that anyone, no matter what his gifts, can  reach\r\n\r\nseventy,  look back at his or her life, and be able to say  that\r\n\r\nit  has  been  a  happy  life, filled with  deep  and  justified\r\n\r\nsatisfaction?\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the five values point that way. How? Because by\r\n\r\npursuing these values, it is possible for anyone to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) I was a good parent to my children, and they are good\r\n\r\nto me;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I was a good neighbour, an active citizen;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) I always did my best, according to my gifts and\r\n\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are achievable by anyone, unlike fame, wealth or\r\n\r\nmaterial success.  It also emphasises the point that the pursuit\r\n\r\nof  happiness  is  a  social concept -  that  we  need  to  have\r\n\r\nparticipated in the social order to achieve happiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happiness of every Singaporean can be realised, if we\r\n\r\ntake  these  values  seriously  - the  Government,  the  people,\r\n\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those reasons, I strongly support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, last year, I heard of Singapore 21\r\n\r\nbeing  mentioned, but did not really know what it was all  about\r\n\r\nuntil  I  received a copy of the glossy Singapore  21  Committee\r\n\r\nReport, with plenty of coloured pictures and printed words  with\r\n\r\ndouble  spacing, which makes them easy reading.  I  notice  that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore 21 Committee was initiated by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  was  headed by a Minister.  The five subject sub-committees\r\n\r\nwere all having co-Chairmen who were all PAP MPs, except for two\r\n\r\nwho  were  NMPs.   It  is  copyrighted  by  the  Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   My  reaction to the report is that  it  is  another\r\n\r\npiece  of  government  publication to make the  Government  look\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five subject sub-committees have approached some 6,000\r\n\r\npeople  and must have collected a lot of feedback but I  believe\r\n\r\nno Opposition members or representatives were interviewed.  Some\r\n\r\nof these feedback must have been quite controversial because the\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  not  willing to accept them,  for  example,  the\r\n\r\nvoting  rights  of  Singaporeans  when  they  are  abroad.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment refuses to accept the feedback which calls on  it  to\r\n\r\nallow  Singaporeans  who  are abroad  to  vote  at  the  General\r\n\r\nElection.   Obviously,  the  Government  views  this   kind   of\r\n\r\nsuggestion as not being advantageous to it.  For those  who  are\r\n\r\nabroad,  my feeling is that, given a chance to vote, they  shall\r\n\r\nprobably  vote  against the government.  On the  one  hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment tells the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  that  \"Every Singaporean Matters\" and wants Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  believe  that.  But, in reality, the Government  refuses  to\r\n\r\nimplement a policy to show that \"Every Singaporean matters\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite another example to show that the Government does not\r\n\r\ncare for the minority or marginalised people.  A few years back,\r\n\r\nI   asked   the  former  Minister  for  Education  to  implement\r\n\r\ncompulsory  education in our educational system.  He refused  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.   His  excuse  was  that every year,  only  about  2,900\r\n\r\nchildren  do not attend school at all out of a cohort  of  about\r\n\r\n50,000  children. The Minister said that it was  not  worth  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  while to have a whole section in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation to police and enforce a policy of compulsory education\r\n\r\nfor  those  children.  If the Singapore Government really  cares\r\n\r\nfor every Singaporean, then it will not abandon nearly 6% of our\r\n\r\nschool  children  who  do not attend school.   I  am  a  staunch\r\n\r\nbeliever  that  every  Singaporean counts.   If  the  Government\r\n\r\nbelieves that too, then it must immediately implement the policy\r\n\r\nof compulsory education in our school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to \"Every Singaporean matters\", I agree with\r\n\r\nthe  subject committee's call to the Government to lead the way.\r\n\r\nThe  Government must call upon all its employees, whether in the\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments, polyclinics, hospitals  or  the  police\r\n\r\nforce,  to  show respect for every individual.  Only  by  taking\r\n\r\nthis  attitude can the Government demonstrate to the people that\r\n\r\nit really believes in \"Every Singaporean matters\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, despite the fact that it has invested a large\r\n\r\npart  of  its budget in education, there are still about 700,000\r\n\r\nof  its  workforce  who  do  not have secondary  education.   If\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  going  to  be  a  land  where  opportunities  are\r\n\r\navailable  to  all,  the  Government  must  make  available  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  workers  who  have  missed  their   secondary\r\n\r\neducation  to complete their secondary education.  I  have  seen\r\n\r\ntwo cases at my meet-the-people session where Singaporean adults\r\n\r\nhave only primary six education.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwanted  to  continue their studies but just  could  not  find  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  school that will take in over-aged  students.   They\r\n\r\ncould  enrol in a privately run school, but the fees were rather\r\n\r\nhigh.   I  believe that the Government should revive  the  night\r\n\r\nschools  to  cater  for  over-aged  persons  to  further   their\r\n\r\nsecondary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is, the Government must make available real\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  all Singaporeans to train themselves  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest  of  their ability, especially to the older Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho,  for  whatever  reasons, have  missed  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  their  secondary education the first  time  round.   A\r\n\r\nsecond, or even a third chance should be made available to them.\r\n\r\nWhilst   the  Government  wants  to  promote  a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, there is a proportionately large number of our  workers\r\n\r\nwho  still do not have secondary education.  This anomaly sticks\r\n\r\nout  like  a  sore  thumb.   The Government  should  solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications (Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):  Sir, Mr Chiam has, usual to\r\n\r\nhis  characteristic  style of taking  a  swipe  at  the  report,\r\n\r\nstarted very well by commenting on the coloured pictures and the\r\n\r\ndouble spacing.  To suggest that the report is another piece  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  publication is to insult all Singaporeans  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  to the report.  I think he owes an apology  to  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean public because this report is a culmination  of  all\r\n\r\nthe  efforts that we have put together for the last year  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  to  cull  feedback and opinions on how Singapore's  future\r\n\r\nshould  be.   We  also  asked  all Singaporeans,  including  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members, to provide their responses and feedback.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang did submit a report  and  his  name\r\n\r\nappears  in the report.  Had Mr Chiam been vigilant and open  to\r\n\r\nMinister  Teo's request for feedback, he would have submitted  a\r\n\r\nreport  and his name would have appeared in it and he would  not\r\n\r\nhave criticised the report altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised several other points regarding voting overseas\r\n\r\nand  compulsory education.  I think we have to bear in mind that\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of the day when we solicit feedback, it  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean that all feedback must be implemented.   It  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  as  RAdm Teo has mentioned in his interview,  that  there\r\n\r\nwere heated discussions in the subject committees about overseas\r\n\r\nvoting  and  other feedback that we have received.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nend,  what was important was that we arrived at a position as  a\r\n\r\nCommittee, not as a Government, that this is not something which\r\n\r\nis  desirable.   If someone truly has a stake in  Singapore,  he\r\n\r\nwould come back and vote in Singapore and not overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about \"Every Singaporean matters\" and it is time\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  show respect to every individual and he  wants  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to provide the lead.  This is very unusual.   He  has\r\n\r\nalways  asked  the  Government not to  intervene  but,  in  this\r\n\r\ninstance, he wants the Government to intervene.  I think we have\r\n\r\ndone  our best through the campaigns that we have started.  MITA\r\n\r\nhas  a  movement called the \"Small Kindness Movement\" to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  in  the interaction between members of the public and  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector,  kindness, graciousness and courteous  behaviour\r\n\r\nare  shown  towards our public.  I think the movement  is  quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for workers training, it is obvious that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  taken  every effort through the NTUC's SRP to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthose who did not avail themselves of the opportunity to receive\r\n\r\na   decent  education  be  given  a  second  chance  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves to get the skills required to be world ready, and  to\r\n\r\nbe  ready  for the knowledge-based economy which is  coming.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  onus  is on the workers to avail themselves  of  the\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Recently, PM Goh, in the May Day Rally,  further\r\n\r\ncommitted  to workers training by giving more money to  NTUC  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can run more of the SRP programmes to reach  out  to\r\n\r\nmore  workers.  I think the Government has done their fair share\r\n\r\nto ensure that all Singaporeans have enough opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Mr Deputy Speaker, move on to my main point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I just want to inform the Member\r\n\r\nthat we have no compulsory education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> I stand by the same position given by\r\n\r\nthe former Education Minister  -  I presume he meant Dr Tony Tan\r\n\r\nand  also the current Education Minister, RAdm Teo Chee  Hean  - that  it  does  not serve us well to have compulsory  education.\r\n\r\nThe  numbers are small and I think given the thrust that we have\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, very few parents would opt out.  And even if they\r\n\r\ndo  opt out, they do go to an alternative system.  At the end of\r\n\r\nthe  day,  there  is no reason for us to have an  administrative\r\n\r\nmechanism  to ensure that the 2,900 students receive  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation.  As the Minister said, what are you going to do?  Are\r\n\r\nyou  going to arrest the parents because they do not send  their\r\n\r\nkids  to  school?   We have to better utilise our  resources  to\r\n\r\nserve the greater good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAdm Teo Chee Hean, in one of his many e-mails to the\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  Committee members, referred  to  us  as  his  co-conspirators.   I  am  one  of the co-conspirators.   It  was  a\r\n\r\nconspiracy but of a very different kind from those which we have\r\n\r\nlately  heard  of  in  the papers.  It was an  openly  held  and\r\n\r\ntransparent conspiracy which everyone in Singapore was involved.\r\n\r\nAnd  I think for many, it was a liberating process which allowed\r\n\r\nthem to discuss and think about how our nation will develop  and\r\n\r\nevolve.   Many heeded the call of our Prime Minister  to  search\r\n\r\nfor, and develop, the \"heartware\" of the nation because how  our\r\n\r\nnation  grapples  with  its  own  challenges,  constraints,  and\r\n\r\nstrengths mattered to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me first to thank the many Singaporeans that my co-chair, Mr Chan Soo Sen and I met in the many focus group\r\n\r\ndiscussions  for their candid views and suggestions.   We  spent\r\n\r\nmany  nights listening to stories and suggestions.  Some stories\r\n\r\nwere  poignant.  One polytechnic student, for example,  told  us\r\n\r\nhow she is already facing the challenge of having to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake  care  of both her parents and grandparents.   Others  told\r\n\r\nstories  that  reminded us of the strong  gotong  royong  spirit\r\n\r\nwhich we, as Singaporeans were, and, I believe, are still famous\r\n\r\nfor.    To  me,  this  exercise,  though  time  consuming,   was\r\n\r\nnecessary,   because  we  needed  to  hear   from   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthemselves how they felt about the dilemmas posted to them.  For\r\n\r\nme,  this  exercise proves that Singaporeans have a lot  to  say\r\n\r\nabout  their  country and, more importantly,  that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncare  about  their country.  We have put in a lot of  effort  to\r\n\r\nelicit wide-ranging participation and views.  Let us build  upon\r\n\r\nthis effort in inclusiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we started the S21 exercise about a year and a half\r\n\r\nago,  we  were mindful of the trends and challenges  facing  our\r\n\r\nsociety.   We  have an aging population; there are calls  for  a\r\n\r\nmore  relaxed lifestyle; increasingly, Singaporeans  leave  home\r\n\r\nfor jobs overseas, while many foreigners settle in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nwork;  and  there  are  indications  that  our  upwardly  mobile\r\n\r\npopulation  wants  to  play a greater role in  nation  building.\r\n\r\nCasting  these  trends as dilemmas forced people to  think  hard\r\n\r\nabout   the  choices  that  will  need  to  be  made.   In   the\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  forums and seminars which we conducted,  we  found\r\n\r\nourselves going over old ground.  I realise that for  us,  as  a\r\n\r\nnation,  to move forward, we have to look backwards and re-learn\r\n\r\nthe  lessons  of the past.  The values, strategies  and  visions\r\n\r\nwhich  have served us well thus far are still relevant  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact, very important for us to move into the 21st century  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.  The emphasis on family, meritocracy, consensus,  multi-racialism, hard work and perseverance remains central to our S21\r\n\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 process is, therefore, a work in progress.\r\n\r\nIt  is  an iterative exercise in nation building.  We have  been\r\n\r\nable to improve the material well-being of our people, to create\r\n\r\njobs,  to  build homes, and to give pride to a people of  a  new\r\n\r\nnation.   Now,  it  is time to deal with the  emotions  and  the\r\n\r\nattachments that we, as a people, have for this country, what we\r\n\r\ncall  and what Dr Lee Tsao Yuan calls the \"Singapore Heartbeat\".\r\n\r\nHow do we make our people feel for our country and their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfellow  citizens?  This is the challenge of Singapore 21 and  of\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the five key ideas of Singapore 21. But I think\r\n\r\nthese  ideas  must be tempered with the basic realities  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  that we know today.  Some have argued that  the  five\r\n\r\nideas  amount  merely to motherhood statements.  I would  rather\r\n\r\nsee them as statements that reaffirm our basic core values.   In\r\n\r\nour  eagerness to infuse the nation with a new sense of optimism\r\n\r\nand  enthusiasm,  we cannot afford to forget the  strengths  and\r\n\r\nconstraints  that continue to define our life as a nation.   Our\r\n\r\nproved  policy  and  programmes aimed  at  ensuring  that  every\r\n\r\ncommunity  progresses  and retains their own  cultural  identity\r\n\r\ncannot  be  undermined.  The concerns of the various communities\r\n\r\ncannot  be glossed over.  Our emphasis on meritocracy and multi-racialism  must  remain the cornerstone of our  existence  as  a\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the key ideas which have\r\n\r\nattracted some attention is that of active citizens.  We want to\r\n\r\nbuild a civic society, but we have always had a civic tradition.\r\n\r\nThere are many groups and civic organisations which have emerged\r\n\r\nand  have  done  their part to develop a civic movement.   These\r\n\r\ngroups provide grants, welfare services and run other programmes\r\n\r\nbecause they believe that it is for the public good.  Today,  as\r\n\r\nwe  encourage more Singaporeans to be active citizens,  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  emphasise the need to take heart the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  larger Singaporean community.  Being active means different\r\n\r\nthings to different people.  Some may volunteer their time to  a\r\n\r\ncharitable cause while others may actually start a new  movement\r\n\r\nto address problems such as child or spousal abuse.  Many others\r\n\r\nalso  contribute by giving ideas and suggestions, as can be seen\r\n\r\nby  the  many  articles that appear in the forum  pages  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits   Times.    So   there  are  ample   opportunities   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to be active and to be a part of  the  process  of\r\n\r\nnation  building.   Many Singaporeans have  laboured  and  given\r\n\r\ntheir best to help meet the needs of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nothers.  For example, we are seeing in the Malay community  many\r\n\r\nundergraduates and even JC students giving free tuition to those\r\n\r\nwho  need  it.    They  do so because they want  to  help  their\r\n\r\ncommunity and help the nation.  These are active citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean is important to us, and everyone matters\r\n\r\nto us.   But everyone has the duty to put his best foot forward.\r\n\r\nWe  will continue to need to balance the needs of the individual\r\n\r\nagainst  the needs of the nation.  In a family, everyone matters\r\n\r\nand  everyone  is  important.  But most of us would  agree  that\r\n\r\nparents  should not go out of their way to reward  a  child  who\r\n\r\nmakes  no  effort to fulfill his potential and  who  refuses  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  family's well-being.  Indulgence  spoils  a\r\n\r\nchild.   Yet,  at  the same time, most of us  would  agree  that\r\n\r\noverly  strict  and over-bearing parenting approaches  kill  the\r\n\r\ncreativity  and  the spark in a child.  Hence, everyone  matters\r\n\r\nbecause everyone gives his best to the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other social arrangements in Singapore, the\r\n\r\ninstitution of the family is being reshaped by very broad social\r\n\r\ntrends.   In  particular,  we are seeing  a  shift  from  multi-generational  families towards nuclear ones.  These  changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  family form will no doubt have an impact on the  types  and\r\n\r\nnumber of tasks performed by the family, but they need not spell\r\n\r\nthe death of the family as the centre of emotional well-being of\r\n\r\nits  individual  members, or as a \"place  to  come  out  of  the\r\n\r\nstorm\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the US, I was amazed at how the American\r\n\r\nstudents  would find all sorts of ways to get back  home  during\r\n\r\nThanksgiving to spend time with their families.  It was not  the\r\n\r\nturkey  dinners and the cranberry sauce which pulled them  back.\r\n\r\nIt  was  the  sense of family and the ties which these  students\r\n\r\nhave  with  their parents and siblings which brought  them  back\r\n\r\ntogether  every  November  for this annual  ritual.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nparents   in  the  US  make  sure  to  attend  their  children's\r\n\r\ngraduation.   It  is a proud moment for the  family  to  have  a\r\n\r\nmember  receiving a degree.  These displays of family  affection\r\n\r\nbelie the strength and robustness of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  the  family.   Families  will  need   to   make\r\n\r\nadjustments to the changing demands of society.  But  we  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to lose that sense of the family as a place of  support,\r\n\r\nnurture and renewal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is the family that shapes the community. How\r\n\r\na  child feels about himself depends largely upon how he is made\r\n\r\nto feel about himself at home.  It is the home that provides the\r\n\r\ncomfort  and  the  solace for facing failure and  the  sense  of\r\n\r\ntriumph  when a child has achieved something.  It is the  family\r\n\r\nthat  provides  the safety net for the child to  experiment  and\r\n\r\nfail  and try again.  It is the family that is most tolerant  of\r\n\r\nfailure  and  most able to nurture the child.  Our  parents  are\r\n\r\nmore  firm than our teachers and also more forgiving.   A  child\r\n\r\ngrows up according to the values and the signals he receives  at\r\n\r\nhome.   If his family values excellence and hard work, the child\r\n\r\nwill invariably have those values in him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the family also provides a zone of comfort for\r\n\r\nour old.  I have met many older residents of my estates who want\r\n\r\ntheir children to live near them.  Some may want to live near so\r\n\r\nthat  they can help take care of their grandchildren.   In  this\r\n\r\nway, they transmit the values which will help our young and also\r\n\r\nour  families.  Others help the family stay strong by  assisting\r\n\r\nin  some household work.  I believe our older citizens help  out\r\n\r\nbecause  they  believe  that it is the  right  thing  to  do  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the family.  In return, many young parents understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  responsibility of taking care of their  aged  parents\r\n\r\nessentially  lies  with them.  This sharing of  responsibilities\r\n\r\nbetween  the  young  and the old has proven  to  be  successful.\r\n\r\nHence,  as  the family comes under stress, we must  continue  to\r\n\r\nfind  ways  to  ensure that these roles continue to  take  place\r\n\r\nalbeit in different forms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more Singaporeans seize the opportunities abroad, the\r\n\r\nfamily   will   come  under  increasing  stress.    Yet,   these\r\n\r\nopportunities  will  provide  the material  comfort  which  many\r\n\r\nfamilies  yearn  for.   Many families, no doubt,  will  need  to\r\n\r\nperform  a  balancing  act, as they pursue these  opportunities.\r\n\r\nBut my one sense is that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamily  ties are indeed very strong in Singapore.  We must  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  ties continue to be strong  as  the  forces  of\r\n\r\nregionalisation and globalisation will bring new  challenges  to\r\n\r\nthe institution of the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, S21 means different things to\r\n\r\ndifferent  people.   My  colleague, Mr  Inderjit  Singh,  and  I\r\n\r\nchaired  a  feedback session on S21 recently.  We had calls  for\r\n\r\ngreater  creativity in schools, changes in our education system,\r\n\r\nand balancing the needs of Singaporeans and foreign talent.  But\r\n\r\nalong  with  these calls, there was a sense that we  should  not\r\n\r\nthrow  out  the  baby  with  the bathwater.   Participants  want\r\n\r\nchanges  in the education system but do not want to imperil  the\r\n\r\nstrengths of the system.  They acknowledged the need to  recruit\r\n\r\nworld-wide, as this will boost our own local talent.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  participants knew that we need to  tread  carefully\r\n\r\nwith  S21  so  that we will not undermine what we have  achieved\r\n\r\nthus far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, S21 has been an interesting and\r\n\r\nrewarding experience for me.  It has helped to remind me of  the\r\n\r\ncore  values and ideas that hold this nation together.   It  has\r\n\r\nhelped me to place the key ideas in the context of a larger  and\r\n\r\nwider  spectrum  of  ideas and values  which  have  shaped  this\r\n\r\nnation.  As we begin to innovate and find new ways to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  social  glue  that binds as a nation, we cannot  forgo  the\r\n\r\nstrong  traditions which we have built over  the  years.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  the key ideas of Singapore 21,  taken  together\r\n\r\nwith   our   commitment  to  ideals  such  as   multi-racialism,\r\n\r\nmeritocracy, honesty, hard work and a sense of excellence,  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  powerful framework for our nation  building  effort.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  am very happy to join in the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the Singapore 21 Committee headed by RAdm  Teo  Chee\r\n\r\nHean.   This  is the Report put up by the Committee  after  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  year of hard work, collecting information and views  of\r\n\r\nthe people from all walks of life in Singapore.  Once this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nReport  is endorsed by this House, everyone in Singapore  should\r\n\r\nwork  hard  to  translate  the vision  into   reality  and  turn\r\n\r\nSingapore into a dynamic international metropolis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report of this Committee refers to strong families\r\n\r\nas  our  foundation and future.  This is very  important.    The\r\n\r\nsurvival of a country depends very much on family cohesion.  The\r\n\r\nfamily  is  the basic building block of society.  If we  have  a\r\n\r\nsense  of belonging to the family, we will also have a sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the nation.  We all know that it is not  just  the\r\n\r\nhouse  or physical building owned by the family, but it is  also\r\n\r\nthe  emotional and blood bonds,  feelings and care that make the\r\n\r\nhouse  a home or a family.  It is this common sense of belonging\r\n\r\nto Singapore, the common vision that we share, our commitment to\r\n\r\nsuch vision that make us as a country and a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, we may be overseas, but our heart is still with\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So  if  every Singaporean can  strengthen  his  own\r\n\r\nfamily  cohesion,  it  will also help to  enhance  our  national\r\n\r\ncohesion.   A  small  country  like  Singapore  will  become  an\r\n\r\ninternational metropolis.  I am very optimistic about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report wants to turn Singapore, and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   into a higher level of economy,  technology  and\r\n\r\ngreater  prosperity.  But if the people are unable  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  own family cohesion, to preserve their own family  values\r\n\r\nand  traditional cultures, to maintain religious  tolerance  and\r\n\r\nracial  harmony,  we will become the rootless floating  duckweed\r\n\r\nwhen we enter this state of international metropolis.  Our lives\r\n\r\nwill be empty.  We will have no direction.  So I feel that every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  must  build his own family  cohesion  as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible, spend more time with their family members, and try  to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance between our pursuit of  material lives and  our\r\n\r\nefforts to promote the  growth of our family.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always tell my children that even if one day they can\r\n\r\nbecome outstanding Singaporeans, their basic values must not  be\r\n\r\nshaken or changed.  My children graduated from NUS and have gone\r\n\r\noverseas  for further studies.  I want them to accept  the  good\r\n\r\nvalues,  good culture, and good technology from the west.  These\r\n\r\nwill  be  of great help to them when they eventually  step  into\r\n\r\nsociety  to  earn  a  living.  But I want them  to  continue  to\r\n\r\npreserve  the traditional values of their own culture, including\r\n\r\nthe five core values of Singapore and the traditional values  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  culture.   I  am  glad  that  my  children,  while\r\n\r\naccepting the future challenges of life, have not changed  their\r\n\r\nvalues.  I have told them that when they have given full play to\r\n\r\ntheir  talent,  they  have succeeded, their  material  life  has\r\n\r\nchanged,  they can have a big house, a big car, even a  Porsche,\r\n\r\ntheir life, thinking and values should never change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a year and a half ago, I bought a\r\n\r\nPorsche  Boxster.   I believe many people were  very  surprised.\r\n\r\nThey  felt that the Porsche Boxster was simply out of tune  with\r\n\r\nthis  old conservative fellow like me.  Perhaps, Porsche Boxster\r\n\r\ngives one the impression of being contemporary or trendy.  But I\r\n\r\nlike  sports cars because I appreciate them as a piece  of  art.\r\n\r\nBut  I  have not changed my values and thinking just  because  I\r\n\r\nhave  bought a Porsche.  My children feel that at their age  and\r\n\r\nwithout  a  strong economic foundation, they should  not  own  a\r\n\r\nPorsche  or  enjoy  an expensive sports car  like  this.   Their\r\n\r\nthinking is correct.  So I spoke in jest to the agent of Porsche\r\n\r\nthat  the  marketing of Porsche should not just be targetted  at\r\n\r\nthe  young people, they should start giving publicity to  create\r\n\r\nthe  impression  that those who have the means, the  middle-aged\r\n\r\npeople,  should  also  drive Porsche.  I think  the  agent  will\r\n\r\nseriously consider my suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given this example so that we can accept a new\r\n\r\nculture,  new  technology, new science and even a  new  material\r\n\r\nlife, but we must always preserve our own values.  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nvision wants to transform us into a dynamic metropolis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  standard of material life of Singaporeans will be  upgraded\r\n\r\nto  a  higher  level.   Materially, it is a  good  prospect  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and it is what our Singaporeans want to pursue.   But\r\n\r\nwe  must ensure that when the material life has changed, our new\r\n\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans will be corrupted, and their original\r\n\r\nfine traditional values will not be changed.  So I would like to\r\n\r\nremind  the Government that when we are pursuing this  Singapore\r\n\r\n21 vision, we must continue to inculcate in our young people the\r\n\r\nfive  core  values.  Otherwise, when the 21st century  comes  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,   Singapore  may  have  succeeded  in   becoming   an\r\n\r\ninternational  metropolis but it will  also  become  a  rootless\r\n\r\nduckweed  or  a  kite without a string attached  -  aimless  and\r\n\r\ndisoriented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we also encourage our old people to look\r\n\r\nafter  their grandchildren.  When their parents are out at work,\r\n\r\nmore  often than not, the young children are being looked  after\r\n\r\nby  the  maids.  In the developed Singapore, young parents  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work  outside to maintain their  family  life  and\r\n\r\neconomy.  Grandparents will naturally become the best choice for\r\n\r\nlooking after their grandchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I became a grandfather, I began to realise the joy\r\n\r\nthat I have in spending time with my grandchildren.  I feel that\r\n\r\nolder  people can continue to work and contribute to the family,\r\n\r\nthe society and the country, especially when most of the elderly\r\n\r\npeople  are  very  healthy and strong.   If  you  want  them  to\r\n\r\ncompletely retire at 55 or 62 years old and do nothing, I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  a waste of manpower to Singapore.  So whether it is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments or private sector,  we  should  consider\r\n\r\nencouraging older people to continue working.  If they prefer to\r\n\r\nstay  at  home,  we should encourage them  to look  after  their\r\n\r\ngrandchildren.  It is a good arrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always tell my wife that while I have been quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful in my business, my success pales in the face of  what\r\n\r\nshe has done in looking after and bringing up the children.   So\r\n\r\nI hope that she will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nable  to  make  good  use  of  her experience  and   methods  to\r\n\r\ncontinue looking after the grandchildren.  I feel that our third\r\n\r\ngeneration  can  also  grow  up  to  succeed  like  our   second\r\n\r\ngeneration.  I think that will be an ideal situation.  So I hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore 21 Committee will continue to preserve  the\r\n\r\nfine  traditions of Singapore, and that is, we must  look  after\r\n\r\nboth the spiritual and the material aspects of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the S21 Committee has also stated\r\n\r\nthat  everyone in Singapore matters.  We must be  more  open  in\r\n\r\nlooking  at  success, not just to measure success  in  terms  of\r\n\r\neconomic  or academic achievements.  I agree with this  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee.   In  the  past, we were stressing  elitism  and\r\n\r\nscholarship, scholars and successful people.  I do not deny  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  elitism.   I  do  not  deny  that  scholars  are\r\n\r\nsuccessful  people.   But  if  we  over-emphasise  elitism   and\r\n\r\nscholars,  we  are  actually  hurting  the  pride  of   95%   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    Because  we  cannot   deny   that   these   95%\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  neither  elite  nor  scholars  are  also\r\n\r\nsuccessful people in their own ways and they may also  have  the\r\n\r\npotential  to  become outstanding people one of these  days.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  if  we over-emphasise elitism, scholarships,  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of scholars, and so on, 95% of Singaporeans will feel or\r\n\r\nbe made to feel that they are failures.  Therefore, if a country\r\n\r\nor  a company is facing difficulty, the responsibility will rest\r\n\r\non  the shoulders of only a few people.  Most Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nnot  share  such a responsibility or participate in solving  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   I am glad that this Committee has taken an open  view\r\n\r\non  the  criteria for success.  I hope that we will not use  the\r\n\r\nsame  kind  of  mindset or measure as the only  way  to  measure\r\n\r\nsuccess of a person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can be said to be a rare species\r\n\r\nin  Parliament because I am the only non-graduate among all  the\r\n\r\nMembers of the ruling Party in this House.  Although I am not  a\r\n\r\ngraduate,  in  my past few years in Parliament, I think  I  have\r\n\r\nperformed  equally  well on the same kind of  work  done  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues in this House.  I always feel that although I may not\r\n\r\nbe a graduate, I want to do as well as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  graduates.  So my pressure is greater because  our  society\r\n\r\nhas  this kind of mindset about elitism and scholars.  I am  not\r\n\r\none of the elites and I am not one of the scholars.  I have been\r\n\r\nrelying  on  my  hard work, my pragmatism to work  hard  and  to\r\n\r\nachieve my success, and I am proud of my own achievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I entirely agree with the S21\r\n\r\nCommittee  that everyone matters in Singapore.  That is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant point.  To me, every Singaporean is important  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Every  Singaporean can also play  his  own  role,  and\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the success and development of Singapore.   As  a\r\n\r\nmatter of fact, anybody can become a successful person, be it  a\r\n\r\nhawker,  a  driver, or an ordinary  worker.  We must  let  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  give full play to his own talent and potential  and\r\n\r\nlet  the society, the country, his own family, benefit from  his\r\n\r\ntalent.   While we are marching into the 21st century,  we  must\r\n\r\nexercise more tolerance to accept the failures of other  people.\r\n\r\nWe  must  continue to encourage those who are not successful  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to attempt.  That will make Singapore more  successful\r\n\r\nin the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the S21 Committee mentions about\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   heartbeat,  to  make  all  Singaporeans   feel\r\n\r\npassionately about Singapore.  With more intensive globalisation\r\n\r\nand  regionalisation, more Singaporeans will  go  overseas.   To\r\n\r\nensure that when they are overseas, their hearts are still  with\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  regard  Singapore  as  their  home   and   make\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  Singapore,  we  must  strengthen  our  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.   The Ministry of Education has decided  to  introduce\r\n\r\nNational  Education to our primary schools.  I think this  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  wise  move.   If  everybody in Singapore  understands  the\r\n\r\nhistory  and the thinking of our leaders in Singapore,  the  new\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  Singaporeans will  be  able  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  facing  us and will also be able to  appreciate  our\r\n\r\nvulnerability in this environment.  This will be very  important\r\n\r\nin  building  up  mutual confidence within the  people  and  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Committee to urge Singaporeans overseas to\r\n\r\nhave  more contact with one another, and to form more friendship\r\n\r\nclubs among themselves.  More Singaporeans overseas will be able\r\n\r\nto  exchange ideas to help each other, to meet together so as to\r\n\r\npromote  and  celebrate  our  own  festivals  and  our  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage.  I hope that our TCS network would facilitate overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with the means to access our TV  programmes,  news\r\n\r\nreports   and   bulletins,  and  all  kinds   of   entertainment\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   TCS should simplify its procedures for application\r\n\r\nand  payment of fees.  Through these TCS channels,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to unite them together to enhance their cohesion with  the\r\n\r\ncountry  in Singapore.  Today, we cannot just depend  on  laksa,\r\n\r\nmee  siam, roti prata, bak kuh teh and Teochew fishball or  char\r\n\r\nkuay  teow,   to  retain  the  emotional  ties  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\noverseas.   Because  when I was in Shanghai, Melbourne  or  Palo\r\n\r\nAlto  in the United States, I could easily enjoy the local  food\r\n\r\nin the open-air Singaporean restaurants.  Therefore, in the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury,  like in the past, if we were to  depend  on  Singapore\r\n\r\nfood  to  retain  our roots, that would not be enough  and   not\r\n\r\nrealistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is also mentioned in the Report that\r\n\r\nwe must let Singaporeans cultivate the international vision from\r\n\r\nyoung  and  encourage our students to cultivate  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nadventure. I would like to stress the meaning of venture spirit.\r\n\r\nMany  people  say  that entrepreneurs should  have  the  venture\r\n\r\nspirit  but  the so-called \"venture\" has normally  been  wrongly\r\n\r\nperceived  as a kind of \"big stake gambling\".  I think  that  is\r\n\r\nwrong.   I hope that our schools would inculcate in our students\r\n\r\nthe  venture  spirit.   We  should have  very  special  ways  of\r\n\r\nteaching.   I  feel  that venture spirit  is  something  out  of\r\n\r\nboldness,  it  is a kind of courage, and a kind of optimism  for\r\n\r\nfuture  vision.   It  is a kind of ideology;  it  is  not  50-50\r\n\r\ngambling, not fatalism but a sure-win kind of spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this kind of spirit, when we are creating or\r\n\r\nendeavouring to achieve something, we train our entrepreneurs to\r\n\r\nmake a decision.  At times, it takes some very strong nerves  to\r\n\r\nmake major decisions that determine our fate in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen  we  are facing adversity, we must be able to use  all  our\r\n\r\nefforts  and  talent to overcome it.  So we must  have  a  great\r\n\r\nambition  in our career and business, and translate our ambition\r\n\r\ninto  reality.   It is not empty talk.  It is not  just  talking\r\n\r\nwithout  doing  it  or just dreaming.  So you  can  say  that  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  adventurer is both a dreamer and a realist, because  he\r\n\r\nis  able  to translate his imagination into reality.  Later  on,\r\n\r\nafter  the  children  have  grown  up,  when  they  start  their\r\n\r\nenterprises or when they have to make some major decisions, they\r\n\r\nwill  not treat the venture spirit as a big-stake gambling or  a\r\n\r\nlife-and-death battle in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the S21\r\n\r\nreport.  However, while we strive to realize our vision for  the\r\n\r\n21st  century, we must never lose sight of the five core  values\r\n\r\nand  the  excellent traditional cultures of the  various  races,\r\n\r\nracial  harmony, religious tolerance,   the vulnerability  of  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country, and the support of a clean government.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  in the 21st century Singapore, the successful Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  continue to help the less successful Singaporeans to  make\r\n\r\nthem feel the warmth of society and let them feel that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  place  that  they want to live in.   This  will  be  very\r\n\r\nimportant to the cohesion among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to quote the late paramount leader of\r\n\r\nChina, Deng Xiao Peng who called upon the 1.2 billion people  of\r\n\r\nChina  to  learn  from Singapore.  He said, \"We must  adopt  the\r\n\r\nstrategy of \"grabbing with both hands\".  With one hand, we  grab\r\n\r\nthe materialistic civilisation, and with the other hand, we grab\r\n\r\nthe  spiritual civilisation.\"  I hope that even after we go into\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century, Singapore will remain a model for China  and\r\n\r\nother countries to emulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand to applaud\r\n\r\nthe  excellent  work done by the Chairman, the  members  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 Committee and all those who have contributed to the\r\n\r\nvery   comprehensive  report  on  how  we  may  strengthen   the\r\n\r\n\"heartware\" of Singapore in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five areas of study revealed many important\r\n\r\nobservations  and I am glad that the Committee has  put  forward\r\n\r\nmany apt and appropriate responses to them.  Sir, if we can  act\r\n\r\nconstructively  on the various recommendations  offered  by  the\r\n\r\nCommittee, Singapore would definitely be an even better home for\r\n\r\nits people in the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly drawn to the section on \"Strong families:\r\n\r\nour  foundation and our future\" and I cannot agree more with the\r\n\r\n\"Subject Committee Recommendations\" which say,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"With an ageing population, there will be fewer working\r\n\r\nadults to cater for the aged parents.  To ensure that this  does\r\n\r\nnot strain the family too much in the future, some messages must\r\n\r\nbe taught and absorbed now:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Lead a healthy lifestyle to prevent illness in old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Save for old age. Plan our finances now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. No one is too old to learn. Focus not on what we\r\n\r\ncannot do, but on what we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The elderly are not a burden, but a resource. Whatever\r\n\r\nour age, we can still contribute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like us to go on to the\r\n\r\nnext  steps  and translate the recommendations into reality.   I\r\n\r\nwould suggest some further ways to translate the recommendations\r\n\r\ninto  practice in this area.  I felt that for us to realise  our\r\n\r\nset  targets  and ideals, careful planning, good management  and\r\n\r\ncritical  follow-up must be put in place.  We  must,  therefore,\r\n\r\nset  up the machinery for committees with dedicated members, who\r\n\r\nhave  clear  visions of our needs, to follow and  implement  the\r\n\r\nabove recommendations through one of our Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On \"leading healthy lifestyles\", island-wide dissemination\r\n\r\nof   information  on  healthy  living  and  preventive  care  is\r\n\r\nrequired.  Provision in this area is very much lacking  now  and\r\n\r\nshould  be  given much more emphasis if we were  to  attain  our\r\n\r\ngoals.   In the past, there was more emphasis on providing  care\r\n\r\nfor  the  results  of  ailments.  The more correct  path  is  on\r\n\r\npreventing the onset of ailments in the first place.   We  must,\r\n\r\ntherefore, put constructive ideas to work and reap the resultant\r\n\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On \"saving for old age\", apart from re-enforcing the\r\n\r\nmindset  of  self-reliance upon retirement,  providing  for  and\r\n\r\nencouraging  participation in different types of  insurance  and\r\n\r\nannuity  packages for old age savings should  be  enhanced.   To\r\n\r\nencourage  more people to save for this purpose, the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  seriously consider tax exemption on interest  earned  on\r\n\r\nannuity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On \"no one is too old to learn\" and the \"the elderly are\r\n\r\nnot  a  burden but a resource\", a lot will depend on how we  can\r\n\r\nchange  the  mindset  of  the people, and  on  the  creation  of\r\n\r\nopportunities  and making these opportunities available  to  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   Many of our elderly want to continue contributing  to\r\n\r\nthe  society  and  are willing to learn.  They, however,  cannot\r\n\r\nfind  the  avenues  to do so.  I suggest that  we  identify  the\r\n\r\nvocations  that  are suitable for them, create,  or  even  leave\r\n\r\nniche areas for them to fit in.  We may then also have to create\r\n\r\nthe channels to train them.  If I may say so, there is no reason\r\n\r\nto exclude them as part of the future knowledge-based economy of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beseech this House to\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  aim for the \"Singapore - Our Best  Home\"  dream.\r\n\r\nThe  many recommendations made by the Singapore 21 Committee are\r\n\r\nbut  a foretaste of this dream.  Nevertheless, it is a dream  we\r\n\r\ncan  realise.  Yes, we can realise this dream with a people  who\r\n\r\nare  focused  on a vision and are willing to work and  chase  it\r\n\r\nwith a united and wholehearted effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing  in  the\r\n\r\nname of Minister Teo Chee Hean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-80s, the Government developed Vision 1999 which\r\n\r\nwas  the blueprint the second generation leaders embarked on  to\r\n\r\nmake  Singapore a global city and to bring about high  standards\r\n\r\nof living and material well-being for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we have achieved much of what they had set out\r\n\r\nto achieve, and much more.  We are admired the world over by our\r\n\r\nperceivably miraculous economic achievements.  Sir, in spite  of\r\n\r\nour  material  and economic success, or perhaps because  of  its\r\n\r\nover-emphasis,  we  have  not  given  sufficient  attention   in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the heartware  of Singaporeans, as the Minister  has\r\n\r\npointed out in his opening address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we rank among the top few countries in the world,\r\n\r\nin  terms of GNP per capita, we have a long way to go before  we\r\n\r\nimprove our social norms, like keeping our public toilets  clean\r\n\r\nor being more considerate in how we stuff our plates in a buffet\r\n\r\nmeal.  Although we have one of the world's most successful  home\r\n\r\nownership programmes in the world, we have a lot to do to deepen\r\n\r\nthe  rootedness of Singaporeans.  Although we have an  able  and\r\n\r\nhonest Government in power for many years, we have much to do to\r\n\r\ngenerate active participation of Singaporeans in civil life  and\r\n\r\nin community development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore timely that the Singapore 21 Report\r\n\r\nhas  been  tabled  in Parliament.  I would like to  congratulate\r\n\r\nMinister  Teo  and his committee and all Singaporeans  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  for their excellent, comprehensive, innovative  and\r\n\r\nthought-provoking report.  While the report reaffirms our ideals\r\n\r\nof   meritocracy,  racial  harmony,  strong  leadership  and   a\r\n\r\nGovernment free from corruption, it articulates a vision of five\r\n\r\nideals for every Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch just on one ideal which, to me,\r\n\r\nis  indeed very important in shaping future Singapore, that  is,\r\n\r\nbuilding stronger families.  We are all aware of the concept  of\r\n\r\na family unit as the building block of society.  Strong families\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  stronger social fabric and stronger  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the family unit and each constituent family member will\r\n\r\nbe pulled apart in different directions in the years ahead.  The\r\n\r\ndilemma has been well described in the report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, the working parents. Although as individual\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, we have all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecome  more  affluent,  our pursuit  for  more  affluence  will\r\n\r\ncertainly be stepped up.  We have become slaves of technology  - the pager, the handphone, the computer, the e-mail  -  all these\r\n\r\nhave  made  us do much more in much less time.  All  these  mean\r\n\r\nthat, as an individual, we will work harder than ever before  to\r\n\r\nbetter  ourselves to become more affluent so that  our  families\r\n\r\ncan  have  it better.  Ironically, the very desire to do  better\r\n\r\nfor  ourselves and our families pulls us away from our families.\r\n\r\nWorking  harder  means less time spent with  the  family.   When\r\n\r\nhusbands   and   wives   spend   less   time   together,    more\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings  occur and carried to  its  extreme,  divorces\r\n\r\nwill increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, children. With society's emphasis on education and\r\n\r\nrapid  advances  in IT, it will make growing up for  children  a\r\n\r\nstressful  experience.  The peer pressure and  competition  will\r\n\r\nmean  that parents will need to spend much more time with  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  When parents cannot be around because of their  work,\r\n\r\ntheir   children  will  be  open  to  more  influences,  perhaps\r\n\r\nundesirable  influences,  in this era of  Internet  and  digital\r\n\r\nconvergence.  Our moral fabric, our Asian values, our traditions\r\n\r\ncan indeed be diluted and perhaps disappear altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the elder parents. The elder parents will find\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  retirement villages in a  world  of  their  own,\r\n\r\nfending  almost for themselves as their children are  busy  with\r\n\r\ntheir own careers or their own nuclear family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S21 Committee makes broad recommendations as to\r\n\r\nhow  everyone,  individuals, society  and  the  Government,  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  and do their part in building strong families.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  is  going  to  be extremely difficult  to  do  is  whether\r\n\r\nfamilies  can  find  the balance between  building  careers  and\r\n\r\naffluence  with building a strong and caring family,  against  a\r\n\r\nbackdrop  of  economic  and  social  pressures  that  exist   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And this is the crux of the issue.  Our Government,\r\n\r\nand  quite  rightly  so,  has pushed for  economic  success  and\r\n\r\nexcellence  in  every  sphere of activity for  more  than  three\r\n\r\ndecades.  Could we in the near future let\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup  and  say it is good enough to run in the second  league?   I\r\n\r\nthink it is not going to be that simple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that individuals and society must do their\r\n\r\npart, I think the Government must steer the move to build strong\r\n\r\nfamilies  with the same vigour it has demonstrated  in  building\r\n\r\nour  economic success.  This would mean that fundamental changes\r\n\r\nto  policies and radical approaches would be necessary.  Various\r\n\r\nMinistries  presently cater to different aspects of family  life\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.    For   example,  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, through HDB, caters to various needs of housing for\r\n\r\nfamilies, looking into multi-generational flats, and so on;  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health looks at family healthy lifestyle, and so on;\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education looks into the needs of children; the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower, among other things, is looking into how to\r\n\r\nprovide flexible work arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not enough for each of these Ministries to work\r\n\r\nin  isolation  to  tackle different aspects of  family  life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   What  is  necessary is to  initiate  bilateral  and\r\n\r\nmultilateral  inter-Ministry committees so that various  aspects\r\n\r\nof  family life can be looked upon from a holistic point of view\r\n\r\nas   policies  then  can  be  formulated  in  building  stronger\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore 21 Committee, as the Chairman has\r\n\r\nexplained,  does not set any milestones or targets and  for  the\r\n\r\nreasons  he  has explained, and we agree with him.  But  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  building  strong families is a very important  aspect  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  continued success and existence.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nurge the Government to follow up the Singapore 21 Report with  a\r\n\r\nFamily  21 Committee so that more concrete and targeted measures\r\n\r\ncan  be  worked  out  and we can take Singapore  into  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury  with  stronger families which will lead to  a  stronger\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I rise to register\r\n\r\nmy strong and wholehearted support to the motion standing in the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister for Education\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  the  Chairman of the Singapore 21 Committee, RAdm Teo  Chee\r\n\r\nHean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Co-Chairman of the subject committee on Less Stressful\r\n\r\nLife versus Retaining the Drive, I have had the benefit of being\r\n\r\npart  of  the Singapore 21 process.  It has undoubtedly  been  a\r\n\r\nvery  rewarding and enriching process as the dozen or so members\r\n\r\nof  the  committee deliberated and argued passionately with  one\r\n\r\nanother over the dilemma.  Discussions held with focus groups of\r\n\r\npeople  from  a wide range of backgrounds were also intense  and\r\n\r\nsometimes even heated, but at the end of the day, it was  always\r\n\r\nall smiles for everyone.  Why?  Because all participants knew it\r\n\r\nwas for Singapore and its future.  The key idea that came out of\r\n\r\nour  discussion was \"Every Singaporean Matters\".  Let me briefly\r\n\r\nshare with this House what led to this idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Committee recognised that Singapore, as a small nation,\r\n\r\nis   inextricably  tied  to  the  global  economic  system  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  has to meet the challenges of competing  within  the\r\n\r\nconstraints of the new global arena, or perish.  Thus, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  no choice and the economics of survival is, and will always\r\n\r\nbe, Singapore's key priority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Singapore has not only survived economically, but also\r\n\r\nactually flourished against the odds, is a legitimate source  of\r\n\r\npride  for Singaporeans.  Singapore can now look beyond survival\r\n\r\nand aspire towards being a world-class city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phenomenal success, however, has come with a cost - stress. Singaporeans complain about information overload,\r\n\r\npressures  on  time and the sense that they are losing  control.\r\n\r\nMrs  Lim  Hwee Hua, my co-chair in this Committee,  has  earlier\r\n\r\nspoken  about stress faced by children and students  in  school.\r\n\r\nAdults  too  are  subject to stress both as a worker  and  as  a\r\n\r\nparent.   Added stress comes from having to juggle  these  roles\r\n\r\nwithin time and energy constraints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stress also comes from what some people term \"the system\"\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  include a preference for paper qualifications  over  work\r\n\r\nexperience, the equating of staying late with working  hard  and\r\n\r\nolder workers feeling threatened by younger ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy on attracting foreign talent is also felt as a\r\n\r\nsource  of stress.  While Singaporeans appreciate the  need  for\r\n\r\ntalent  at  the  national  level,  they  cannot  help  but  feel\r\n\r\nthreatened at the individual level.  Lower educated Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfear  their  jobs  may be lost to lower-priced, better  educated\r\n\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who took heed of the Government's encouragement\r\n\r\nto  go  regional, added stress comes from the need  to  re-align\r\n\r\nfamily  commitments  and schedules, and  adapting  to  an  alien\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, the pressure faced by school-going children\r\n\r\ntranslates  into  pressure  on  the  parent,  especially  during\r\n\r\nexamination times.  Adults also face the pressure of keeping  up\r\n\r\nwith  the Joneses, for instance, making sure that their children\r\n\r\nkeep  up  with  the  rest,  matching  Reebok  with  Reebok   and\r\n\r\nMontessori with Montessori.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen of this country, Singaporeans subject\r\n\r\nthemselves to high expectations from the State itself.   Regular\r\n\r\nexhortations by leaders to excel are cited as sources of stress.\r\n\r\nThen,  there is also the feeling that the individual Singaporean\r\n\r\nis   being  forced  into  prescribed  moulds,  which  in  a  way\r\n\r\nreinforces the sense of helplessness among some Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey conducted by the Singapore 21 Committee indeed\r\n\r\nfound  that more than half of Singaporeans feel keenly and  were\r\n\r\nanxious about the rapid pace of change here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general consensus that success is defined too\r\n\r\nnarrowly   in   Singapore,  based  on  academic   and   material\r\n\r\nbenchmarks.  And as individuals derive their sense of self-worth\r\n\r\nfrom  these  benchmarks, the resultant effect  is  stress.   The\r\n\r\nnarrow  boundaries  of  these  benchmarks  unfortunately  cannot\r\n\r\naccommodate many people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the positive side, this narrow definition has\r\n\r\nhelped to maintain our country's competitive edge by the pursuit\r\n\r\nof  excellence  in the academic sphere and at the workplace,  it\r\n\r\nhas  also led to some undesirable social consequences.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  ill  effects  include  being an  unforgiving  society,  a\r\n\r\nculture  of risk aversion, under-utilisation of talent  and  the\r\n\r\nloss of buzz.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It results in people unconsciously applying a narrow view\r\n\r\nof the achievements of others by virtue of they themselves being\r\n\r\nnarrowly  judged of their own success in life by others.   There\r\n\r\nis a lack of diversity and a tolerance for second chances.  As a\r\n\r\nresult, passion in what one likes or enjoys doing is compromised\r\n\r\nfor  something  which  is accepted as a  conventional  norm.   A\r\n\r\npotentially  first  rate violinist becomes a  second-rate,  say,\r\n\r\neconomist instead!  People become afraid to take risk because of\r\n\r\nfear of failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy where\r\n\r\ncreativity, innovation and technopreneurship are encouraged, the\r\n\r\nold way we look at success is no longer relevant nor healthy for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We need a new mindset in how we look at success.  It\r\n\r\nmust  extend  beyond  material and academic success  to  embrace\r\n\r\nachievements in all fields of human endeavour, so that people do\r\n\r\nnot treat the pursuit of material life as an end in itself.   No\r\n\r\njob, whether it is a cleaner or a gardener, should be viewed  as\r\n\r\ntoo low where one cannot apply knowledge and excellence to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As individuals, we need to realise that stress and drive\r\n\r\nare  not  at opposite ends.  After all, not all stress  is  bad.\r\n\r\nLike cholesterol, we should optimise good stress and get rid  of\r\n\r\nthe  bad.   We  need to learn to de-stress and  not  succumb  to\r\n\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be passionate in the pursuit of our own goals\r\n\r\nand  have the courage to choose our own path, even if it is  one\r\n\r\nwhich is not frequently travelled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall being fascinated by Sir Edmund Hillary, the first\r\n\r\nman to conquer Mount\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEverest,  when I was a student.  By coincidence, his achievement\r\n\r\nis  being disputed in the papers today.  His passion, dedication\r\n\r\nand  obsession  to  his pursuits - which included  climbing  the\r\n\r\nhighest  mountain  in the world at 28,028 feet,  the  height  at\r\n\r\nwhich modern jetliners today typically cruise - often struck awe\r\n\r\nand  admiration in me.  Today, of course, we have our  very  own\r\n\r\nKhoo Swee Chiow who, as if conquering Everest was not enough, is\r\n\r\nnow  intent on leading a team of Singaporeans to the South Pole.\r\n\r\nThen,  there was David Bellamy, the botanist.  I used  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nwatching  him  on television, either picking up  some  worms  or\r\n\r\nfingering  some leaves in some off-the-beaten-track places.   It\r\n\r\nwas  evident  that both had natural passion for what  they  were\r\n\r\ndoing.   Because of that, watching them at work became enjoyable\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Sir Hillary and Bellamy, having a sense of passion for\r\n\r\nwhat  we do is now a quality which we need to cultivate, as  the\r\n\r\nnew  millennium draws near.  Our country's dependence  on  human\r\n\r\nresources makes the need for passion even more pertinent.  If we\r\n\r\ncouple  working hard with a strong passion in whatever  work  we\r\n\r\nundertake,  the result can be astounding.  Because with  passion\r\n\r\ncomes not only dedication but also creativity and the desire  to\r\n\r\ninnovate, and be different from others.  Passion which  is  akin\r\n\r\nto  \"intense  interest\" paves the way for  \"true  expertise\"  to\r\n\r\neventually  emerge, as Prime Minister Goh puts  it.   Being  the\r\n\r\nbest we can be then comes quite naturally.  This is what we need\r\n\r\nin our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this, if our society could begin appreciating\r\n\r\nunconventional  accomplishments, such as those who  successfully\r\n\r\nclimbed  Everest  or  become a renowned violinist,  and  if  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  helps lead the way in propagating the  message  that\r\n\r\ntalents  and  abilities  are  not  just  confined  to  top-notch\r\n\r\nscholars  or  bankers, and if we begin to  readily  accept  that\r\n\r\nfailure  opens doors to successes and there is room  for  second\r\n\r\nchances  in  our pursuits, then there is hope that  we  can  get\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  unleash  the  best  in  whatever  areas   their\r\n\r\npotential leads to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  is hope that everyone could believe that each has a  role\r\n\r\nand part to play and their contribution, no matter how small, is\r\n\r\nvalued.   Then  there is hope for Singaporeans  to  accept  that\r\n\r\n\"Every Singaporean truly Matters\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have just briefly spoken on one of the key ideas of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore 21 Vision - Every Singaporean Matters.  I am sure\r\n\r\nmy  other  counterparts  from the Singapore  21  Committee  will\r\n\r\nelaborate  on  the  other four.  As the Prime Minister  stressed\r\n\r\nduring its launch about two weeks ago, unlike Vision 1999,  this\r\n\r\nis  the  people's vision and not one crafted by the  Government.\r\n\r\nIt  is  forceful,  comprehensive and  inspiring,  motivated  for\r\n\r\nchange forged by 6,000 serious Singaporeans who have gone beyond\r\n\r\nmaterial and academic pursuits to emotional, spiritual, cultural\r\n\r\nand social fulfilment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Asad Latiff puts it, it is a product of social\r\n\r\ntripartism  -  a  partnership between the  public,  private  and\r\n\r\npeople sectors, what if I may call, a new tripartism formula for\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century.  This is where we need to  construct  a  new\r\n\r\nmodel to harmonise the three sectors in such a way that we  pull\r\n\r\nand  involve each and every Singaporean so that each  and  every\r\n\r\none of us could make the difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, we have forged the new Vision for the 21st\r\n\r\nCentury  but to make the difference we must now act on  it.   In\r\n\r\nconclusion,  allow  me to quote Joel Arthur Barker,  a  renowned\r\n\r\nfuturist.  He said, \"Vision without action will remain a  dream.\r\n\r\nAction  without vision just passes the time.  Vision with Action\r\n\r\ncan  change the world.\"  Let us together make the difference for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the debate be now adjourned.\" - [RAdm Teo Chee Hean].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Debate to be resumed what day?\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Two Minutes to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ILL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwhether  ill discipline is rising in schools and among  students\r\n\r\noutside schools, and what measures are being taken to help  stem\r\n\r\nsuch incidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>State Of Discipline In Schools</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall state of discipline in our schools is good.\r\n\r\nSerious cases of breach of discipline are infrequent.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has implemented the Behaviour Tracking and Analysis\r\n\r\n(BETA)  system in schools since 1995.  The system collects  data\r\n\r\non  the  state of discipline in individual schools.  For primary\r\n\r\nschools,  misdemeanours  such  as  not  doing  assignments   and\r\n\r\ndisruptive    behaviour,   and   attendance-related    offences,\r\n\r\nconstitute  84% of all the recorded offences. In  the  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  74%  of the offences were attendance-related,  namely,\r\n\r\nlate-coming and truancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BETA records show no significant statistical change in\r\n\r\nthe offence rates from 1995 to 1997.  \"Offence rates\" refers  to\r\n\r\nthe  number of offences per 1000 pupils. The data for 1998  show\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  serious  offences  such  as  gangsterism   and\r\n\r\npossession of weapons remaining close to that of 1997,  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of cases of substance abuse falling from 272 in 1997  to 40\r\n\r\nin 1998. However, the incidence of smoking has risen from 14\r\n\r\nper  1000 pupils over the three years 1995 -1997 to 19 per  1000\r\n\r\npupils in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall offence rate for boys has remained stable over\r\n\r\nthe  years, but a worrying trend is the increasing offence  rate\r\n\r\nfor  girls in the secondary schools. Though lower than the  male\r\n\r\noffence rates, the female offence rates have increased by 6%  to 9%\r\n\r\nper year over the last 4 years, going up from 300 in 1995 to 456\r\n\r\nin 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee chaired by the Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nEducation,  Dr Aline Wong, was set up in May last year  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  discipline  situation among  girls  in  schools.  The\r\n\r\ncommittee is finalising its recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Measures To Address Discipline in Schools</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's philosophy is that to care is to discipline.\r\n\r\nSchools by and large take a whole-person approach to discipline.\r\n\r\nThey have many programmes and support structures to help promote\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  Besides  the creation of the  posts  of  Discipline\r\n\r\nMaster,   Head/Pupil  Welfare  and,  most  recently,  Operations\r\n\r\nManager, there is also the Voluntary Special Constabulary Scheme\r\n\r\nwhere teachers assume the mantle of law enforcement officers  to\r\n\r\nhelp reinforce an orderly school environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers have been equipped with basic counselling skills\r\n\r\nand  many  spend  much  time counselling errant  students.  Such\r\n\r\nefforts are complemented by programmes like life skills and peer\r\n\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, discipline of students is not just the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of  schools.  Parents  must  remain   primarily\r\n\r\nresponsible for their children, particularly outside  of  school\r\n\r\nhours.  While the Ministry does not have data on  ill-discipline\r\n\r\noutside  school, schools do work closely with the  Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nPolice Posts through the NPP-School Link-Up Scheme. Many schools\r\n\r\nalso  mount  before-and-after-school programmes  to  keep  their\r\n\r\nstudents gainfully engaged in school activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately though, schools need the support, co-operation and understanding of parents and the community to\r\n\r\ninsist  on  good  discipline. With the  benefit  of  advice  and\r\n\r\nfeedback  from COMPASS - the Committee on Community and  Parents\r\n\r\nin  Support  of  Schools, the Ministry  will  work  towards  the\r\n\r\ngreater  involvement of parents and the community  in  promoting\r\n\r\ngood discipline in and outside the school environment.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INCIDENCE OF CRIME BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\nwhether  the  incidence  of  crime  by  illegal  immigrants   or\r\n\r\noverstayers has risen over the last twelve months and what steps\r\n\r\nare being taken to keep such incidence in check.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of crime by illegal immigrants and\r\n\r\noverstayers  has  remained low.  In 1998, the number  of  crimes\r\n\r\ncommitted by immigration offenders was about 250.  This is about\r\n\r\n0.5% of the total number of seizable offences reported in 19981.\r\n\r\nOf  the 1929 foreigners arrested for crimes in 1998, 210 (10.9%)\r\n\r\nwere  illegal immigrants and 46 (2.4%) were overstayers.   These\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders were mostly involved in  minor  offences,\r\n\r\nsuch as shoplifting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not practical to devise specific measures targeted\r\n\r\nonly at the immigration offenders involved in crime.  Hence,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's  approach  is  to deter and  take  tough  enforcement\r\n\r\naction against all immigration offenders in Singapore.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  we have enhanced the penalties in the Immigration  Act.\r\n\r\nImmigration  officers  have stepped up their  vigilance  at  our\r\n\r\ncheckpoints,  the Coast Guard has intensified  its  patrols  and\r\n\r\nsurveillance of suspicious activities at sea, and the Police has\r\n\r\nconducted islandwide raids at suspected places of refuge.   This\r\n\r\nhas  led  to  a  record high of 23,000 in the  total  number  of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants and overstayers arrested in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team will maintain its enforcement efforts to\r\n\r\nensure   that  the  immigration  offender  situation   and   the\r\n\r\nassociated crime problems remain firmly under control.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, 48,260 seizable offences were reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RAPE CASES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  if  he  will indicate, between 1990 and 1999,  (a)  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of rape cases; (b) the age profile of the rape  victims;\r\n\r\nand (c) the number of convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of rape cases, the age profile of the rape\r\n\r\nvictims and the number of convictions from 1990 to 1999  (up  to\r\n\r\nthe month of March) are given as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>     \r\n\r\n             RAPE CASES REPORTED IN 1990 - 1999\r\n\r\n          1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996  1997 1998 1999*\r\n\r\n                                         \r\n\r\nCases     111   74   80   79   81  102   99   103  104   25\r\n\r\nReported\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCases      63   53   68   64   56   75   48   61   76    16\r\n\r\nCleared**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCases      2    0    0    31   16   31   15   19    9    0\r\n\r\nConvicted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClearance  57   72   85   81   69   74   48   59   73    64\r\n\r\n Rates***\r\n\r\n (%)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n    *  January to March.\r\n\r\n    ** Cases such as the following are categorised as cases cleared:\r\n\r\n    - cases where arrests are made;\r\n\r\n    - cases where the accused is charged in Court;\r\n\r\n    - cases where the accused is warned in lieu of prosecution;\r\n\r\n    - cases where there is insufficient evidence to proceed in Court.\r\n\r\n    *** Clearance rate = No of cases cleared/No of cases reported x 100%\r\n\r\n</pre>         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                 PROFILE OF VICTIMS BY AGE\r\n\r\n          1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998  1999\r\n\r\nBelow 10*                       1    2    4    4    3     2\r\n\r\n10 - 144                       15   40   31   41   35     5\r\n\r\n 15 - 19                       16   16   19   24   27     7\r\n\r\n 20 - 24                       17   23   18   14   19     3\r\n\r\n 25 - 29                       18   11    8   13    8     5\r\n\r\n 30 - 34                        5    5    9    3    6     2\r\n\r\n 35 - 39                        6    3    5    2    2      \r\n\r\n 40 - 44                        3    3    3    2    3      \r\n\r\n 45 - 49                        1    1    2    1    1      \r\n\r\n 50 - 54                                                 \r\n\r\n 55 - 59                                                  1\r\n\r\n 60 - 64                                       1           \r\n\r\n 65 - 69                                                 \r\n\r\nAbove 70                                            1      \r\n\r\n  TOTAL     (not available)    82   104  99  105  105    25\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n    *  Of  the  176 cases in 1994 to 1998, 147 (84%) were  statutory\r\n\r\n    rapes, i.e. the victims were below 14.\r\n\r\n    Out of the 147 statutory rape cases, there was consent in 67 cases (46%).\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment whether there is any danger of the foot and mouth\r\n\r\ndisease spreading to Singapore from Malaysia in view of the\r\n\r\nrecent outbreak of the virus in Negri Sembilan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a serious viral disease\r\n\r\naffecting  cloven hoof animals such as cattle, pigs,  sheep  and\r\n\r\ngoats.   However, FMD does not affect humans and is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nnot  a  health  risk to the general public.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nclarify that the Foot and Mouth Disease is totally unrelated  to\r\n\r\nthe human disease called Hand-Foot-and-Mouth disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have managed to keep Singapore free from FMD over the\r\n\r\nyears  even  though  it is endemic in the region.   To  maintain\r\n\r\nSingapore's  FMD free status, the Primary Production  Department\r\n\r\n(PPD)  allows cloven hoof animals to be imported from  FMD  free\r\n\r\nsources  only.   As for Malaysia, PPD only allows  imports  from\r\n\r\naccredited  farms  in  the  FMD free  areas.   Upon  arrival  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the animal consignments are inspected for  signs  of\r\n\r\ndisease.  In addition, animals, such as dairy cattle, brought in\r\n\r\nfrom FMD free countries for breeding and production are required\r\n\r\nto  go  through  at  least 30 days of on-farm  quarantine  in  a\r\n\r\nspecified isolated area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is free from FMD.
