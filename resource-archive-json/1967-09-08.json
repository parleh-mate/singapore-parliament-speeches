The\r\n\r\nreductions  will be so phased that,  by  the  early\r\n\r\n1970s,  the  British  forces  still  stationed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaysia will  consist  largely  of\r\n\r\nnaval forces (including an amphibious element)  and\r\n\r\nair forces.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 8 of the Supplementary Statement,\r\n\r\nthey stated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot plan the period beyond 1970-71 in the\r\n\r\nsame detail. The reductions over the next few years\r\n\r\nwill  be considerable: we are determined that  they\r\n\r\nwill  take  place in an orderly manner, which  will\r\n\r\nenable  our  Commonwealth partners to adjust  their\r\n\r\nplans,  and  will allow Singapore and  Malaysia  to\r\n\r\nmake  the necessary economic transition as smoothly\r\n\r\nas  possible.  We plan to withdraw altogether  from\r\n\r\nour  bases in Singapore and Malaysia in the  middle\r\n\r\nl970s;   the   precise  timing  of   our   eventual\r\n\r\nwithdrawal   will  depend  on  progress   made   in\r\n\r\nachieving  a  new basis for stability in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia  and  in resolving other problems in  the  Far\r\n\r\nEast.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elaboration of the British Government's position\r\n\r\ncan  be found in the speech of the British Minister\r\n\r\nof  Defence, who opened the debate in Parliament on\r\n\r\nthe 27th July and also in the speech of the British\r\n\r\nPrime Minister when he closed the debate that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame evening. Copies of the Supplementary Statement\r\n\r\nand  the Hansard record of the debate are available\r\n\r\nin the library. I commend them to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right up till the middle 1970s, a period of\r\n\r\nbetween six years at the earliest and ten years  at\r\n\r\nthe latest, there will be an actual presence in the\r\n\r\narea   consisting  mainly  of  aircraft  and  naval\r\n\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 9 of the Statement, the British\r\n\r\nGovernment states:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are, therefore, planning to maintain a\r\n\r\nmilitary  capability for use, if required,  in  the\r\n\r\narea,   even   when  we  no  longer   have   forces\r\n\r\npermanently based there.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And in paragraph 10, they stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We do not need to settle the precise character,\r\n\r\nsize  and  deployment of this  capability  now.  It\r\n\r\nwould be largely drawn, however, from the forces of\r\n\r\nall three Services which would be stationed in this\r\n\r\ncountry  as  a  strategic reserve;  and  we  should\r\n\r\nprobably  keep  in  the Far  East  some  naval  and\r\n\r\namphibious forces.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These decisions have now been made public. They\r\n\r\nrequire reappraisal and readjustment in the foreign\r\n\r\nand  defence  policies of all the governments  that\r\n\r\nhave  planned their previous policies on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  a  continuing British military presence in  the\r\n\r\nregion into the indefinite future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the 1970s rearrangements will have to be\r\n\r\nmade  and  will  probably have  been  made  in  the\r\n\r\npattern  of defence in which we must seek  our  own\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whilst our problems of defence are those of\r\n\r\nthe middle term and beyond, the economic impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  defence cuts will be immediate. Total  British\r\n\r\nbase expenditure constitutes roughly 20 per cent of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  G.N.P.  (Gross National  Product).  It\r\n\r\nprovides direct employment for some 30,000 civilian\r\n\r\nemployees  in  the armed forces and another  10,000\r\n\r\nwomen  and  girls as domestic help for the  service\r\n\r\nfamilies.  About 15,000 of these civilian employees\r\n\r\nand  about  5,000 domestic helpers will be  out  of\r\n\r\njobs  by 1971, adding to our already large pool  of\r\n\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem is to lessen the dislocation of our\r\n\r\neconomy. In this connection, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  useful to recall that from 1819 (the foundation\r\n\r\nof Singapore)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright up to the 1930s there was  a  thriving\r\n\r\nand  prosperous Singapore without either a  British\r\n\r\nnaval  base  or  an  air base. The  Naval  Base  in\r\n\r\nSembawang and the Air Base in Seletar were built in\r\n\r\nthe  1930s.  It  was only the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  allowing serving officers  and  other\r\n\r\nranks to be accompanied by their wives and children\r\n\r\nin the 1950s that British base expenditure began to\r\n\r\nconstitute so sizable a percentage of our G.N.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, over a period of about a decade this figure\r\n\r\nwill  tail  back to zero. We shall be back  in  the\r\n\r\nposition   of   the   1930s,where   British    base\r\n\r\nexpenditure constituted a negligible proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe economy of Singapore. As I have said, there was\r\n\r\na  thriving  Singapore before the bases were  built\r\n\r\nand   manned,   and  if  we  set  about   our   job\r\n\r\nintelligently and in good heart, there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nbigger and economically more self-reliant Singapore\r\n\r\nafter  the  bases have been run down and  uniformed\r\n\r\npersonnel withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems arising out of this process are\r\n\r\nbeing studied by a team headed by Mr Hon Sui  Sen,\r\n\r\nChairman  of our Economic Development Board.  Steps\r\n\r\nare  being taken to build up a team of experts  and\r\n\r\nconsultants  who  can  advise  the  Board  on   the\r\n\r\npossible  ways in which the facilities  which  will\r\n\r\nbecome surplus to British service requirements  can\r\n\r\nbe  converted to civilian user, so as to create the\r\n\r\nmaximum number of new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a problem of considerable magnitude and\r\n\r\ncomplexity. Put simply, it is this: what to do with\r\n\r\nthis  vast military complex, one naval base  and  a\r\n\r\ndockyard, three military airfields, and a vast army\r\n\r\ncomplex  of  workshops,  supply  depots  and  other\r\n\r\nsupporting services. For whilst we will inherit all\r\n\r\nthe  fixtures which have been built over the  years\r\n\r\non lands made available by the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nto the British armed services, we will also inherit\r\n\r\nmore  than 40,000 bread-winners and their  families\r\n\r\nwho   have  come  to  Singapore  from  India,  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and from places as far off  as  Hongkong\r\n\r\nand   Weihaiwei.  With  their  families  they   now\r\n\r\ncomprise  some  half  a  million  persons;   three-quarters of them are now our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both in their public statements and in\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and  communications  between   British\r\n\r\nMinisters  and ourselves, they have made  it  plain\r\n\r\nthat  they  shared  our  interests  in  maintaining\r\n\r\nconfidence   in   the   continued   stability   and\r\n\r\nprosperity of Singapore and were anxious to  assist\r\n\r\nin  meeting economic problems which the run-down of\r\n\r\ntheir  bases, according to programme,  will  cause.\r\n\r\nThey  have  stated  that they  would  be  ready  to\r\n\r\nconsider  with us the most effective and productive\r\n\r\nuses  of the economic and technical resources  they\r\n\r\ncould  provide. They have nominated Sir Alan Dudley\r\n\r\nof   their  Ministry  of  Overseas  Development  to\r\n\r\nconduct discussions with us. We have nominated  Mr\r\n\r\nHon  Sui  Sen. Talks will begin shortly. The  first\r\n\r\nmatters for discussion will be the kind of  aid  to\r\n\r\ndeal with the more immediate problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, however significant the aid, the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  Singapore depends upon our capacity  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  orderly  and stable economic  and  social\r\n\r\nconditions as we go through the pangs of withdrawal\r\n\r\nof  British base expenditure. The success  of  this\r\n\r\noperation depends upon three factors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our ability to maintain that climate of\r\n\r\nquiet  confidence and the establishment  of  labour\r\n\r\nattitudes  and social conditions which will  assure\r\n\r\nlocal  investors  and  overseas  investors  of  the\r\n\r\ncertainty  of  their planning assumptions  for  the\r\n\r\nestablishment and expansion of their industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the capacity of our population to adapt\r\n\r\nand  to  adjust, without any whimpering or wringing\r\n\r\nof  hands, as a way of life to which they have been\r\n\r\naccustomed over 30 years comes to an end. The least\r\n\r\nof  the  changes contemplated means  that  dockyard\r\n\r\nworkers,   working  on  naval  vessels  for   naval\r\n\r\ncommanders, who are not concerned with the  time  a\r\n\r\nvessel is out of service whilst undergoing repairs,\r\n\r\nhave  now  to  adjust their attitudes to  work  and\r\n\r\nadapt their methods of work, and also the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich  they may be rewarded for work, to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of ship-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nowners who want their vessels repaired in as little\r\n\r\na  time as possible, as every hour in repair  means\r\n\r\nvast  sums  of  money in loss of earnings.  At  the\r\n\r\nworst,  it  means being able, sometimes at  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  age  of  life for the  people  in  their\r\n\r\nmiddle 40's and above to make the painful change of\r\n\r\nearning  a living in a different way - from  being  a\r\n\r\nstorekeeper or a clerk to a skilled, semiskilled or\r\n\r\neven a manual worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor is whether the economic aid that\r\n\r\nwe  have  been promised will be substantial  enough\r\n\r\nand  utilised  intelligently enough to  create  the\r\n\r\nmaximum number of jobs. Whether British performance\r\n\r\nwill be equal to their promises will in part depend\r\n\r\nupon the performance of Britain's own economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will be foolish to believe that others can\r\n\r\ndo  for us what we as a people, and organised as  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  government, must do for  ourselves.\r\n\r\nFrom our past performance, given no ill-fortune, it\r\n\r\nis  more  than likely that we can and will make  up\r\n\r\nfor  the loss of this 20 per cent G.N.P. which will\r\n\r\ntake  place  over the next decade. Our economy  has\r\n\r\ngrown  at  the rate of 6 to 9 per cent  per  annum,\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the  first full year of confrontation,\r\n\r\n1964,  when the increase was only 2 per  cent.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  we  may  not  be  able  to  do,  unless   our\r\n\r\nperformance is better than that of the  last  eight\r\n\r\nyears,  is to create meaningful jobs as the  annual\r\n\r\n15,000 to 20,000 young boys and girls who now  come\r\n\r\ninto the labour market are joined by another 40,000\r\n\r\nworkers,  30,000 of whom are our citizens who  will\r\n\r\nbe  put  out of employment from the British  bases.\r\n\r\nAir  the  family  planning  and  other  methods  of\r\n\r\ncontrolling  population which we may  have  to  use\r\n\r\nwill  be  of  great  benefit to whoever  forms  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  in the late '70s and '80s. But  we  are\r\n\r\nalready  saddled with the baby boom of the post-war\r\n\r\nyears of the 1940s and early 1950s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assured the British Government of our co-operation to ensure the orderly withdrawal of their\r\n\r\nforces and the run-down of their Bases according to\r\n\r\nprogramme.

In the past we have said that we would\r\n\r\nrather have trade than economic aid. That was  also\r\n\r\nstated by the Prime Minister some time ago.  Can  I\r\n\r\nhave   the   Prime   Minister's  clarification   or\r\n\r\nelaboration on this? If the so-called economic  aid\r\n\r\nis  just  like  the type given to  other  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  are  receiving foreign aid, then it  may  be\r\n\r\ninconsistent with our policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nintend to anticipate the out-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  of the first discussions between Mr Hon  and\r\n\r\nSir Alan Dudley.

Although  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  policy  and the intention, it is obvious  that\r\n\r\nunless  care  is exercised over the length  of  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  secondment,  this  may  not  happen  in\r\n\r\npractice.  The  reason is that  if  an  officer  is\r\n\r\nseconded for an unduly long period of time, it  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  possible  to  assess his  suitability  for\r\n\r\nconfirmation or promotion, especially if the nature\r\n\r\nof  the  duties of the post to which he is seconded\r\n\r\ndiffers vastly from that of the service to which he\r\n\r\nbelongs.

The Government\r\n\r\nis  prepared  to grant protection to industries  if\r\n\r\nseveral   factors  are  satisfied.   Firstly,   the\r\n\r\nindustry  must be in a position to supply  a  major\r\n\r\npart  of  the local market. Secondly, the  industry\r\n\r\nshould  result in a net gain to the economy by  way\r\n\r\nof foreign exchange savings, local income generated\r\n\r\nand  local  employment created.  In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nindustry should as far as possible be one with some\r\n\r\nexport  potential. The industry must show  evidence\r\n\r\nof being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwilling  and able to compete in the export  market.\r\n\r\nThus it can be seen that the productive capacity of\r\n\r\nan  industry  alone is not sufficient  to  conclude\r\n\r\nthat  it  should be protected. There are  other  no\r\n\r\nless   important   factors   to   be   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration.  In considering the actual  measures\r\n\r\nto  be  adopted, we have learned through experience\r\n\r\nthat prohibition of imports is not the best means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, such prohibition does not set an\r\n\r\nautomatic limit to the extent to which local prices\r\n\r\ncan increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, prohibition of imports would mean that\r\n\r\nthe  local  industry  would be  divorced  from  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  pressures of new designs and  improved\r\n\r\nquality  which  are constantly being  developed  by\r\n\r\nindustries abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, prohibition creates a situation which\r\n\r\nopens the administration to business pressures  and\r\n\r\nenticements. It also results in a very high premium\r\n\r\nfor   the   imported  products,  which   encourages\r\n\r\nsmuggling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons the Government would prefer to\r\n\r\ngrant  protection  in the form  of  import  duties.\r\n\r\nThere  are,  of  course, cases  where  quantitative\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  imports  are  necessary  in   the\r\n\r\ninitial stages of an industry's existence. In  such\r\n\r\ncases, the Government is prepared to consider  such\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summing up, the Government is prepared to\r\n\r\nconsider measures to protect local industries  from\r\n\r\nimports,  but  does  not  consider  prohibition  of\r\n\r\nimports as the best means of doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, the Government  has  imposed  a\r\n\r\nquota  on  textiles and singlets.

Sir, I do not propose to give a  detailed\r\n\r\naccount of the aims and purposes of the Association\r\n\r\nof South-east Asian Nations, or ASEAN for short, as\r\n\r\nthese   have   already  been   published   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  Very briefly, ASEAN is an organisation\r\n\r\nto  accelerate economic growth, social progress and\r\n\r\ncultural  development in the region  through  joint\r\n\r\nendeavours   in   the  spirit   of   equality   and\r\n\r\npartnership. This is the essence of ASEAN. However,\r\n\r\nwhat  I would like to stress is that ASEAN as  such\r\n\r\nis  not  concerned with military  problems  of  the\r\n\r\nregion.  This  is not to say that member  countries\r\n\r\nare  disinterested  in defence  matters.  In  fact,\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social progress in the region  would\r\n\r\nbecome  well  nigh  impossible if  these  countries\r\n\r\ncannot  safeguard  their  national  integrity   and\r\n\r\nsecurity. However, one of the consequences  of  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  realisation of the aims and objects  of\r\n\r\nASEAN  would  be  to bring economic  stability  and\r\n\r\nthereby enhance prospects for peace and security in\r\n\r\nthe  region. In this sense, and only in this sense,\r\n\r\nis  ASEAN  an organisation for promoting peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  in  the region. Economic  life  today  is\r\n\r\nrooted  in  interdependence, and national frontiers\r\n\r\ndo not coincide with our actual economic frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe  advanced and economically-developed  countries\r\n\r\nof the West, both Communist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  non-Communist, realise this. The two  Americas\r\n\r\nconstitute,   for  all  practical   purposes,   one\r\n\r\ngigantic   working  economic  bloc.  The  Communist\r\n\r\ncountries  of  the  West have  their  COMICON.  The\r\n\r\nhighly  industrialised countries of Western  Europe\r\n\r\nhave  formed themselves into an economic community.\r\n\r\nAt  such  a time when most countries of the  world,\r\n\r\nespecially the advanced countries of the world, are\r\n\r\nwelding  themselves into bigger and bigger economic\r\n\r\nunits, the countries of South-east Asia, which  are\r\n\r\nrelatively under-developed and small, cannot go  on\r\n\r\nbelieving  that  economic  nationalism  and   self-sufficiency are the sure roads to modernisation and\r\n\r\nprogress.   ASEAN   is,   therefore,   the    first\r\n\r\nsubstantive  step we have taken with  other  South-east Asian countries towards a regional economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok we agreed that\r\n\r\nregional  co-operation should begin not  merely  by\r\n\r\ndeclaring  good intentions embodied  in  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nDeclaration,  but to go a step further  and  pursue\r\n\r\nprojects  which are relatively simple in that  they\r\n\r\nare  those  in  which, no strong  vested  national\r\n\r\ninterests  are  involved.  The  Standing  Committee\r\n\r\nwhich  was  set up has been asked to  consider  and\r\n\r\nmake proposals for joint development programmes  on\r\n\r\nsuch  subjects as tourism, shipping, fisheries  and\r\n\r\nwhat is called expansion of intra-regional trade at\r\n\r\nthe  next  Ministerial meeting in Jakarta. However,\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  will agree that the good  intentions\r\n\r\nembodied  in  the ASEAN declaration alone  are  not\r\n\r\nsufficient.  They  have  to  run  the  gauntlet  of\r\n\r\npolitical   difficulties   before   they   can   be\r\n\r\ntranslated  into  action.  As  such,  it  will   be\r\n\r\nunrealistic to expect a dramatic leap into regional\r\n\r\nco-operation.  We  should remember  that  even  the\r\n\r\nEuropean Economic Community took some ten years  of\r\n\r\nhaggling before it got off the ground. But for  the\r\n\r\ntime  being, we should be satisfied if there  is  a\r\n\r\nsteady, even if slow, movement towards regionalism.\r\n\r\nASEAN  is South-east Asia's first major attempt  to\r\n\r\napply to South-east Asia and its problems the  more\r\n\r\nhopeful and fruitful idea of regionalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain to the House what effects the formation  of\r\n\r\nASEAN will have on the Association of South Asia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

As far as Singapore is\r\n\r\nconcerned,   a  common  market  is   one   of   the\r\n\r\nobjectives, and I am glad to say that a  number  of\r\n\r\ncountries, particularly Indonesia, since my  recent\r\n\r\nvisit  there, have indicated an interest in  seeing\r\n\r\nthat ASEAN in the course of time also develops into\r\n\r\na common market region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now that we have\r\n\r\njoined  ASEAN, can the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\ninform  us whether there will be any effect on  our\r\n\r\nforeign  policy? There has been talk outside  that,\r\n\r\nas  a result of British withdrawal, we will have to\r\n\r\nreview  our original non-alignment policy. Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister elaborate on and clarify this point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As I have stated, Sir, ASEAN is a\r\n\r\nscheme   for  economic  co-operation.  It  is   not\r\n\r\nmilitary.  It  does  not affect our  basic  foreign\r\n\r\npolicies  and  certainly  not  Singapore's  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy,  though we might have to adjust our foreign\r\n\r\npolicy. This has nothing to do with ASEAN but  with\r\n\r\nchanging circumstances in the region. But ASEAN  as\r\n\r\nsuch  does  not in any way bind us to  any  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy that we do not want to pursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has also\r\n\r\nbeen said that the ultimate objective of ASEAN is a\r\n\r\npolitical union. Would the Foreign Minister comment\r\n\r\non this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> At the moment, I do not think we\r\n\r\nshould  consider  any other objectives  than  those\r\n\r\ndeclared in ASEAN and those, at the moment, do  not\r\n\r\ncontain   any  political  objectives  but  economic\r\n\r\nobjectives.  I am in no position to say  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen in 5, 10, 20 or 50 years from now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can the Minister\r\n\r\nsay  whether, among the members of ASEAN, there are\r\n\r\nsome who were members of Maphilindo? Can he explain\r\n\r\nwhether the spirit of Maphilindo has any effect  on ASEAN?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir, it will have no effect,\r\n\r\nbecause the members of ASEAN subscribe to the  aims\r\n\r\nand  objectives  of ASEAN. Whether  they  have  any\r\n\r\nother arrangements outside of ASEAN is none of  our\r\n\r\nconcern. After all, we belong to the United Nations\r\n\r\nwhere there are 126 members ranging from Maphilindo\r\n\r\nto   other   beliefs   - Communist,   non-Communist,\r\n\r\ncapitalist,  democratic and so on.  The  fact  that\r\n\r\nmembers  have  different ideologies does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat they do in any way commit ASEAN to depart from\r\n\r\nthe   declared  objectives  which  have  been  made\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been\r\n\r\ngiven a very clear picture of what the ASEAN set-up\r\n\r\nis.

(I am afraid I have not done my  Latin;\r\n\r\nso  the  accent  may not be quite  right.)  As  the\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  which transmit haemorrhagic  fever  are\r\n\r\ndifferent,  namely,  Aedes species,  other  methods\r\n\r\nwill have to be adopted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods are mainly against the larval\r\n\r\nstages  of  these  mosquitoes.  A  one-year   pilot\r\n\r\nproject, which was carried out in the Geylang  area\r\n\r\nbounded by Sims Avenue, Paya Lebar Road, Sungei\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKallang  and  Sungei Geylang since  September  last\r\n\r\nyear,  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  simple\r\n\r\nmeasures  by  elimination of  breeding  places  and\r\n\r\npublic  education  through  television,  radio  and\r\n\r\npamphlets,  and  by  personal  contacts  with   the\r\n\r\nresidents.  The  mosquito index  fell  within  five\r\n\r\nweeks  from an original 10 per cent to about 2  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As complete eradication of the mosquito vectors\r\n\r\nmay  not be a practical possibility, what is  aimed\r\n\r\nat  is  effective control, in order  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nmosquito  index down to insignificant numbers.  For\r\n\r\nthe present, D.D.T. appears to be effective against\r\n\r\nthe   local   strains   of   mosquitoes,   although\r\n\r\nresistance has already been reported in most  parts\r\n\r\nof South East Asia.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also making determined efforts to improve\r\n\r\nenvironmental sanitation in urban constituencies by\r\n\r\nclearing  blocked drains, which are the  cause  for\r\n\r\nstagnant  water and thus become excellent  breeding\r\n\r\ngrounds  for mosquitoes. This involves many aspects\r\n\r\nof  public health, especially licensing and control\r\n\r\nof    hawkers   (who   are   chief   culprits   for\r\n\r\nirresponsible  dumping  of  refuse  into   drains),\r\n\r\nbetter  drainage and unslabbing of roadside drains,\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to the Member for Tampines\r\n\r\nto  know  that  a W.H.O.

Hitherto the Vigilante Corps has existed  as\r\n\r\nan  organisation  without any statutory  provisions\r\n\r\nsince its formation in May 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bill provides that the existing Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nshall,  as  from  the  date  of  the  coming   into\r\n\r\noperation of the Act, be deemed to have been raised\r\n\r\nand  maintained under the Act, thus giving the body\r\n\r\na legal standing (clause 25).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranks of the Vigilante Corps up till now had\r\n\r\nbeen filled by person volunteering to be members of\r\n\r\nthe  Corps.  These volunteer members who registered\r\n\r\nthemselves as corps members came from various walks\r\n\r\nof  life, ranging from watchmen to businessmen, and\r\n\r\nfrom clerks to hawkers. These persons had powers of\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens and their main  duties  were  to\r\n\r\nperform  foot  patrols,  coastal  observations,  to\r\n\r\nassist  the  police in reporting  the  movement  or\r\n\r\npresence   of  suspicious  characters,  to   arrest\r\n\r\npersons  committing  any  seizable  offence  within\r\n\r\ntheir  sight,  and  to assist the  public  whenever\r\n\r\nrequested. With the establishment of the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps,  it was observed that the crime rate dropped\r\n\r\nin  areas  covered  by  the Vigilante  Corps  Beat-Patrols.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes provision for national\r\n\r\nservicemen  to  be  directed for  national  service\r\n\r\nunder  the  National Service Ordinance, 1952,  with\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante Corps. Thus the Vigilante Corps will\r\n\r\nconsist of both volunteers and national servicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national servicemen who are called up for\r\n\r\ntraining  in the Vigilante Corps will do 12  years'\r\n\r\npart-time  training during their off-work  or  off-duty hours.

Its purpose is to\r\n\r\nenable members of the Vigilante Corps to be a  more\r\n\r\ndisciplined  force  in order  to  help  our  police\r\n\r\nmaintain law and order and public security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we can all recall that the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  was set up in April 1964 when Indonesia  was\r\n\r\nin  confrontation against us and when there  was  a\r\n\r\nseries  of  sabotage  and  bomb  incidents  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  And  in order to protect  the  lives  and\r\n\r\nproperty of our people, the Prime Minister (Mr Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew then) called for the setting-up of such  a\r\n\r\nCorps.  We  all  know the historical background  of\r\n\r\nthis  Corps. The Prime Minister's call  was  warmly\r\n\r\nsupported by people of all walks of life. The  bomb\r\n\r\nincidents  and  the  series of  sabotage  acts  had\r\n\r\ncaused some damage to property, if they had not  at\r\n\r\nleast   adversely  affected  our   commercial   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  activities. Our people then felt  quite\r\n\r\nuneasy and had a sense of insecurity. Following the\r\n\r\nformation  of the Vigilante Corps, such  activities\r\n\r\nwere on a reduced scale and the situation was later\r\n\r\nput  under control. For these achievements  by  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps, we all should give them our praise\r\n\r\nand   admiration.   I  understand   that   everyone\r\n\r\nappreciates their efforts and contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Indonesian confrontation has become\r\n\r\nhistory,  the Vigilante Corps' assistance is  still\r\n\r\nnecessary  at  the present juncture,  although  its\r\n\r\npresent duties may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  different. In the past their duty was mainly to\r\n\r\nprevent  any  sabotage, to catch  spies  and  enemy\r\n\r\nagents,  and  to protect the lives and property  of\r\n\r\nour people. Today their task and responsibility  is\r\n\r\nto  help  the  police maintain law  and  order  and\r\n\r\npublic security, and prevent anti-social activities\r\n\r\nby anti-national elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After strict semi-military training, they will\r\n\r\nbecome the pillars of our rugged society and become\r\n\r\nmodel  citizens of our multi-racial  society.  Over\r\n\r\nthese  past several years the Vigilante  Corps  has\r\n\r\ndone  well to maintain public order and has  helped\r\n\r\nthe  Police  by  arresting robbers  and  protecting\r\n\r\nwomen from being bullied by hooligans. In all these\r\n\r\nactivities they have shown that they are people  of\r\n\r\ngood  quality and imbued with a sense of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThey  have set an example as good citizens for  all\r\n\r\nto  see, and have maintained a very close and  good\r\n\r\nrelationship with community centres and the  people\r\n\r\nof the various constituencies. Their high spirit of\r\n\r\nservice has given the public a good impression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps consist of people from\r\n\r\nvarious  races  of  different  cultures,  different\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education,  different  languages   and\r\n\r\ndifferent religions. Their contribution in  uniting\r\n\r\nthe  people of various races together has  produced\r\n\r\nresults.  Their achievements have helped  to  unite\r\n\r\nthe  people.  In  my constituency,  Sembawang,  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps unit consists of Chinese,  Indians\r\n\r\nand  Malays.  The unit leader is an Indian.  He  is\r\n\r\nable to unite the team together and has helped them\r\n\r\nto  put up good achievements. This might be due  to\r\n\r\nthe  personal  capacity and  merits  of  this  unit\r\n\r\nleader, but I believe another factor is that  there\r\n\r\nis  already  being  formed a sort  of  identity  of\r\n\r\npurpose. This will be a great contribution  to  our\r\n\r\ntask in building a multi-racial model society. This\r\n\r\nis a very significant factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the training of the Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nconsists  mainly  of  drills  and  instruction   in\r\n\r\ngeneral police regulations. But I think they should\r\n\r\nalso be inculcated with a spirit of patriotism and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloyalty to our country. This is also important.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I have received complaints from members\r\n\r\nof the Vigilante Corps. They say they have only one\r\n\r\nuniform.  They  have to keep this clean  and  neat.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I think they should be issued with\r\n\r\nat least two uniforms. In my opinion, their request\r\n\r\nis  very  reasonable, and I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides that the basic task of\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante Corps is to help the police maintain\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order,  to preserve public  security,  to\r\n\r\nprevent   criminal  activities,   and   to   arrest\r\n\r\ncriminals, etc. At the same time, it also  provides\r\n\r\ncertain penalties against any members of the  Corps\r\n\r\nwho  commit  any  offences. Generally  speaking,  I\r\n\r\nregard  this Bill as perfect and I hope that  after\r\n\r\nits implemenation, the Vigilante Corps organisation\r\n\r\ncan  be further perfected and strengthened and grow\r\n\r\nfrom strength to strength, making it more effective\r\n\r\nin  the  preservation of our social  order  and  in\r\n\r\ncarrying out their task in serving the country  and\r\n\r\nprotecting the lives and property of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, the purpose of this Bill,\r\n\r\nas explained by the Minister of Defence, is to make\r\n\r\nstatutory  provisions  for  the  establishment  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the Vigilante Corps in our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Vigilante Corps existed as a\r\n\r\nlocal  voluntary organisation formed by some civic-\r\n\r\nminded  citizens who saw the need  of  a  vigilante\r\n\r\norganisation  to  assist the police  in  preserving\r\n\r\npeace  and order in their own areas. Later,  during\r\n\r\nthe  confrontation days, our Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nrealised the important role of the Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\nand appealed to the public to join the Corps. After\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  enthusiastic  response  from  the\r\n\r\npublic, and the Vigilante Corps was set up both  in\r\n\r\nthe   rural  and  urban  areas  of  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps then began to grow to their present\r\n\r\nstrength  with the support, of course,  of  various\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders. As a matter of fact, our  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister went\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  some  constituencies  to  visit  the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps.  In some of the constituencies which  border\r\n\r\nthe  sea,  the  Vigilante Corps  also  did  coastal\r\n\r\npatrol duties until well past midnight to help  the\r\n\r\npolice  watch  for illegal entry of  saboteurs  and\r\n\r\nagents.  In  fact,  the  Vigilante  Corps  made   a\r\n\r\ntremendous   contribution  towards   the   internal\r\n\r\nsecurity of Singapore during confrontation days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to avail myself of this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to ask this House to place  on  record\r\n\r\nthe  appreciation of our Government to  members  of\r\n\r\nthe Vigilante Corps for their voluntary services in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the peace and security of our  country\r\n\r\nduring confrontation days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present circumstances have necessitated the\r\n\r\nenlargement of the Vigilante Corps so as to take in\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen who will do  their  part-time\r\n\r\nservice in the Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to enact laws to make the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  a statutory organisation, therefore,  cannot\r\n\r\nbe disputed in this House. All hon. Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I am sure, will give their support to  this\r\n\r\nBill.  However,  there  is one  point  I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider, that is, the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps members. I notice in clause  24  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  that  the  Minister  makes  regulations\r\n\r\nconcerning the administration, discipline, training\r\n\r\nand  welfare of the Corps. I am happy to note  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  provisions  in  this  section  to  make\r\n\r\nregulations  on  the  awards  of  compensation   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of death and personal injuries, awards  of\r\n\r\npensions  and  gratuities  and  reimbursements   of\r\n\r\npayments  to  members of the Vigilante  Corps.  But\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  provision also  to  provide  for\r\n\r\nmedical   care  and  attention  not  arising   from\r\n\r\ninjuries. Can the Minister clarify the question  of\r\n\r\nreimbursements  and  payments  to  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCorps? Does he mean that a travelling allowance  at\r\n\r\nthe  same rate as that paid to the P.D.F. will  be\r\n\r\npaid  to  Corps members who turn out  for  duty  or\r\n\r\ntraining? Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nall those people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho   are  concerned  with  security  and  who  pay\r\n\r\nattention  to  current affairs will agree  with  me\r\n\r\nthat  the economy of a nation is a basic factor  in\r\n\r\ncontributing towards its stability. Our people work\r\n\r\nvery   hard  in  contributing  towards  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic  stability.  So if they  work  harder  and\r\n\r\nserve   society  in  general  and  the  nation   in\r\n\r\nparticular, then everybody should have a  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  a  strong  sense  of  patriotism.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  majority of the people  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfully  understand that their fate is closely linked\r\n\r\nwith that of the nation, and that their future  too\r\n\r\nis  closely related to the future of Singapore.  So\r\n\r\ntheir love of Singapore is absolute and beyond  any\r\n\r\ndoubt. The question is, how is the Government going\r\n\r\nto  preserve  the  peace  of  this  country  in   a\r\n\r\nturbulent region, to instil a sense of security  in\r\n\r\na  sea of trouble in this region? So it is for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to come out with definite  policies  to\r\n\r\nshow us how we can do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of regular armed forces for\r\n\r\nnational  defence  is the usual method  adopted  by\r\n\r\nother  countries,  but it is not  applicable  in  a\r\n\r\nsmall  island  State like Singapore. In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,    we    cannot   shoulder   the   financial\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of maintaining  a  large  regular\r\n\r\narmy.  Secondly, its existence may give rise  to  a\r\n\r\npossible    military    take-over    or    military\r\n\r\ndictatorship.  In the Afro-Asian countries  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  South  American countries, we find  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ninstances of a military dictatorship as a result of\r\n\r\na  large standing army. Although they have standing\r\n\r\narmies, they are without a closely-knit society. In\r\n\r\nSouth Vietnam there are about half a million strong\r\n\r\nregular  forces,  but in spite of  this,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill turbulence and trouble there. South Korea has\r\n\r\nan  army of about 600,000 strong, but there is also\r\n\r\ntrouble there. This is because of their lack of  an\r\n\r\norganised  and  a  closely-knit  society.  In   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  too, there is a strong army,  but  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  that,  there is trouble,  and  there  is\r\n\r\nsmuggling and robbery throughout the country.  This\r\n\r\nis   because   the  people  are  poorly  organised.\r\n\r\nIndonesia  has  an army of about  400,000,  but  in\r\n\r\nspite of that, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ntrouble and disorder there. In other countries even\r\n\r\nwhere they have strong armies, military coups  take\r\n\r\nplace.  All this is due to the lack of organisation\r\n\r\nand a closely-knit society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we can successfully organise our people,\r\n\r\nthat, I think, is the best method to defend our own\r\n\r\ncountry.  This is because, in the first  place,  we\r\n\r\ncan  do away with the necessity to maintain a large\r\n\r\narmy.  Secondly,  we can bring up a  generation  of\r\n\r\npeople   who  will  be  nationally  conscious   and\r\n\r\npatriotic  and  well organised to  maintain  social\r\n\r\norder  and national security. I am glad, therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is not just shouting  slogans\r\n\r\nbut is carrying out in a practical way whatever  it\r\n\r\nhas  promised. It is an effective Government  which\r\n\r\nmeans what it says and says what it means.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official establishment of the Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nis  another instance to show that the Government is\r\n\r\nalways  concerned with the security of  the  people\r\n\r\nand  the maintenance of an orderly society. We were\r\n\r\nthreatened with communal disturbances in the  past,\r\n\r\nbut  we do not gloat over the disturbances and  the\r\n\r\nmisfortunes of others. In troubled times we had  to\r\n\r\nset  up a Vigilante Corps in order to smash up  the\r\n\r\nintrigues of our enemies who wished to disrupt  our\r\n\r\nsocial  order and, at the same time, to  unite  our\r\n\r\npeople so that the various races in Singapore could\r\n\r\nunderstand the importance of racial harmony in  the\r\n\r\nState.  Now this painful event in history is  past,\r\n\r\nbut  the fact remains that the contributions of the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps are still fresh in the minds of the\r\n\r\npeople.  Now  that  Singapore  is  independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign,   people  of  all  races  must   further\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the Vigilante  Corps,  their  own\r\n\r\norganisation,   must  continue  to   maintain   the\r\n\r\nintegrity of our country and to preserve  order  in\r\n\r\nour  society. It is the responsibility and duty  of\r\n\r\nevery citizen to take part in this great task.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a saying that to build a strong\r\n\r\ncountry   we  must  build  a  strong  people.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment of the country, in officially setting up\r\n\r\nthe Vigilante Corps, and in giving legal status  to\r\n\r\nit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  going  one  step further to  show  that  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirous  of building a strong people in  order  to\r\n\r\ndefend  our  own  country and  to  maintain  social\r\n\r\norder. It is an enlightened policy and a very  wise\r\n\r\nstep  to take. If necessary, we shall turn all  our\r\n\r\npeople  into soldiers. This is a test of our people\r\n\r\nto  see  whether  they  have  this  spirit.  As   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the people and  as  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen, I am proud of the step being taken  and  I\r\n\r\nam honoured to associate myself with this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I think this is a convenient\r\n\r\ntime  to suspend the sitting.

This has resulted in unnecessary  delays\r\n\r\nin the implementation of urgent projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance has been in operation for the past\r\n\r\nsix  years  and,  in the light of this  experience,\r\n\r\ncertain amendments to the Ordinance are necessary.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1967,\r\n\r\nseeks to bring the Development Fund Ordinance  (No.\r\n\r\n52  of  1959) in line with the Financial  Procedure\r\n\r\nAct which was passed by Parliament in April 1966 to\r\n\r\nempower the Minister to create new subheads and  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  any  surplus  arising  under  any   other\r\n\r\nsubhead  of  the  same  head  to  the  new  subhead\r\n\r\ncreated; that is, it follows a similar procedure as\r\n\r\nthat  for  the ordinary Estimates. This is provided\r\n\r\nfor under clause 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of virements using savings from one\r\n\r\nsubhead to meet increased expenditure under another\r\n\r\nsubhead  may lead to slackness in planning projects\r\n\r\nin the knowledge that there are savings to be vired\r\n\r\nfrom   somewhere,   or  a  tendency   to   withhold\r\n\r\nimplementation of difficult projects on the  excuse\r\n\r\nthat  funds  for such projects are urgently  needed\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  To discourage the use of  virements,  a\r\n\r\nContingencies Fund is provided to meet  any  urgent\r\n\r\nand unforeseen need for expenditure on projects for\r\n\r\nwhich  no  other  provision exists.

V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nour Republic of Singapore has a multi-racial, multi-\r\n\r\nreligious  and multi-lingual society. It  does  not\r\n\r\nbelong  to any particular race. The Government  has\r\n\r\ngiven  full freedom to the various groups of people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  to  exercise their  own  rights  and\r\n\r\nprinciples  in the broad context of a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety, for example, freedom of speech, freedom of\r\n\r\nreligion and freedom of association. Time and again\r\n\r\nour  Ministers have spoken to the people  on  these\r\n\r\nmatters  and  reminded  them  of  the  duties   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities towards society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that all registered\r\n\r\norganisations  in Singapore should have  faith  and\r\n\r\ninterest  in  our country and work for our  people.\r\n\r\nBut   there  are  some  organisations  who,  though\r\n\r\nregistered  in  Singapore,  have  their  loyalties,\r\n\r\ndirectly  or  indirectly,  somewhere  else  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore. They have more connections with  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries. Their activities show that they are more\r\n\r\ninterested in the people and organisations  outside\r\n\r\nthis  country. Sir, I have in my mind the Singapore\r\n\r\nDravida   Munnetra  Kazhagam,  in  short,   D.M.K.,\r\n\r\nregistered in Singapore under the Societies Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven  though this society claims to look after  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people of  Singapore,  there  is\r\n\r\nevidence to show that this organisation has, in all\r\n\r\nrespects,  connections with the D.M.K, in  Madras.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the society bears the exact  name  of\r\n\r\nthe  political  party in power in Madras  State  of\r\n\r\nIndia,  the  D.M.K.,  except for  the  addition  of\r\n\r\nSingapore before its name. Its symbol is the rising\r\n\r\nsun  which  is the same as that of the D.M.K.,  the\r\n\r\npolitical party of a foreign State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present set-up of our country is not in\r\n\r\nfavour of having one language or one religion. That\r\n\r\nis  why  we  are  preaching and  practising  multi-\r\n\r\nlingualism and multi-religion. There are  societies\r\n\r\nformed   on  the  basis  of  different  races   and\r\n\r\nreligions,  but  they all work for one  nation  and\r\n\r\nthat  is Singapore. We can have many cultures, many\r\n\r\nreligions  and  many  languages.  But  our   nation\r\n\r\n-nationhood should be one. We may be diversified in\r\n\r\nlanguage and religion - but we should have unity and\r\n\r\noneness in loyalty.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote from the Mirror of\r\n\r\nOpinion,  a publication of the Ministry of Culture,\r\n\r\ndated 24th August, 1967, page 10. Under the heading\r\n\r\nTamil Press appears a translation of the speech  by\r\n\r\nthe  General Secretary of the Singapore  D.M.K. at\r\n\r\nthe  dinner  given to Mr Manoharan,  a  leader  of\r\n\r\nMadras  D.M.K. and an Indian Member of  Parliament,\r\n\r\nby  the Singapore D.M.K. on Sunday, 20th August.

Annadurai and his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe  organ  symbolises the photo of Mr  Annadurai.\r\n\r\nFrom this alone, I am sure the Members of the House\r\n\r\nmay   find  the  truth  of  the  statement  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  D.M.K. denying links  with  the  Madras D.M.K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look into the functions organised by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore D.M.K. All the functions are  graced\r\n\r\nby  the  presence  of one or more  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nMadras  D.M.K.  But the organisers are  careful  to\r\n\r\ninvite local leaders too. And on one such occasion,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   for  Foreign   Affairs,   Mr   S.\r\n\r\nRajaratnam,  at a meeting held on 29th July,  1967,\r\n\r\nat  the Conference Hall, had advised the Indians in\r\n\r\nSingapore:  \"Think of Singapore first  and  others\r\n\r\nsecondary, and Tamils in Singapore should not think\r\n\r\nof  themselves  only but to care  for  the  general\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people of  Singapore.\"  And  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Social Affairs at a meeting of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore D.M.K. Pasir Panjang Branch reminded  the\r\n\r\nmembers to co-operate with the Government. This  is\r\n\r\nreported  on page 1 of the Mirror of Opinion  dated\r\n\r\n19th  August, 1967. But I am doubtful how  many  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore D.M.K. members took this advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the functions makes us look into\r\n\r\nthe  financial side of this organisation. They have\r\n\r\ncollected a fairly large amount towards a  building\r\n\r\nfund.  But to date I do not know what has  happened\r\n\r\nto  this money. Seldom was there a function without\r\n\r\na  leader from Madras, and they spend big sums  for\r\n\r\ntheir  visits.  The  highlight  was  in  1965.   An\r\n\r\nofficial of the local D.M.K. was sent to Madras  to\r\n\r\ninvite a prominent member of the Madras D.M.K. and\r\n\r\nmake  other arrangements for his visit. In addition\r\n\r\nto  the passage-fare of this official, another $500\r\n\r\nwas  paid to him for pocket expenses. And  for  the\r\n\r\nvisit  of  the  Madras leader itself,  a  total  of\r\n\r\n$34,658.92  was  spent. The air  passage  for  this\r\n\r\nleader  and  one of his colleagues came to  $5,369.\r\n\r\nHere I wish to mention that even a first-class  air\r\n\r\npassage for Madras-Singapore-Madras would cost only\r\n\r\n$2,204  for  two persons. I leave the rest  to  the\r\n\r\nMembers.  And  again,  gifts worth  $4,118.10  were\r\n\r\ngiven to the visitors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am informed that a few members of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  D.M.K.,  who were  unhappy  about  these\r\n\r\nexpenses, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister with\r\n\r\na copy to the Registrar of Societies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given a list of items. I\r\n\r\ncan  quote  numerous instances to  prove  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore D.M.K, is foreign-orientated and that it\r\n\r\nis   spending  money  not  for  the  interests   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  But I do not wish  to  take  up  the\r\n\r\nprecious  time  of the House since I  think  a  few\r\n\r\nexamples  will do. In view of the present situation\r\n\r\nand  as we have reached the limits of our patience,\r\n\r\nI  request  the Minister to look into the  accounts\r\n\r\nand  activities of the said organisation  and  take\r\n\r\nthe necessary action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nD.M.K, is an organisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregistered  as  a  cultural  organisation  and   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  prohibited  from  taking  part  in   any\r\n\r\npolitical activities. I do not know the composition\r\n\r\nof  its  members. Probably there are some who  have\r\n\r\njust  obtained Singapore citizenship and there  may\r\n\r\nbe   some  who  are  not  local  citizens  as  yet.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  perhaps there is a tendency  for  these\r\n\r\npeople to be orientated outwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a democratic society and we believe more\r\n\r\nin the art of persuasion and example rather than by\r\n\r\nusing  force.  We believe that by our  example  and\r\n\r\nthrough persuasion we can make the immigrant  races\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  come  to realise that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntheir  home  and that their loyalty  lies  here.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this must have been in the minds of both  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  when\r\n\r\nhe  addressed the D.M.K. and advised them to  think\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  first, and the Minister  for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs,  who  at  one of their functions  strongly\r\n\r\nurged   that  they  should  co-operate   with   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the enthusiastic\r\n\r\nresponse  of  the people of Singapore  to  national\r\n\r\nservice  and  the  present  spirit  prevailing   in\r\n\r\nSingapore will make whatever organisation there  is\r\n\r\nrealise  soon  that  if  they  are  not  Singapore-\r\n\r\norientated  but foreign-orientated,  they  will  be\r\n\r\ngoing  against national sentiment and the  national\r\n\r\nspirit  and  that it will not pay them to  continue\r\n\r\ndoing so. I expect that, given time, the members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  D.M.K. will probably be infected with  the\r\n\r\nspirit of nationalism that is to be seen among  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Member for Aljunied has brought up in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  however,  is quite  disturbing,  that\r\n\r\nthere  seems to be a very clear connection  between\r\n\r\nthe  D.M.K. here and the D.M.K. in Madras and  that\r\n\r\nprobably  they  have  been indulging  in  political\r\n\r\nactivities.  However, I would like  to  assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  a strong reminder will be sent to the office-bearers  of  the D.M.K. to the effect  that,  as  a cultural  organisation, they are not to participate\r\n\r\nin  any political activities, local or foreign, and\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  do  so, they will infringe  on  the\r\n\r\nSocieties   Act   and  will  have   to   bear   the\r\n\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember has raised, the alleged misuse of funds will\r\n\r\nhave  to be left to the members of the organisation\r\n\r\nthemselves, but I can assure him that I  will  look\r\n\r\nvery  closely  into the question  of  the  D.M.K.'s\r\n\r\nsymbol  and activities and will watch what they  do\r\n\r\nin future with a hawk-like eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-one minutes past Six o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19670908/19670908-HA-0260243.pdf\"\">Appendix to Oral Answer to Question No. 16, cols. 196-7 (Cols 0243-0246)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19670908/19670908-HA-0260243.pdf\"\">Appendix to Oral Answer to Question No. 32, cols. 210-11 (Cols 247-50)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
