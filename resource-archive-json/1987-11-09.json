This service was discontinued because the healthy employment market made it redundant. In a growing economy, National Servicemen, like others in the job \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> market, have been able to find jobs on their own without any difficulty. Their National Service training, discipline and self-confidence stand them in good stead for any job. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service reservists work in well over 55,000 companies.

General cargo throughput also increased by 16%, compared with the same period last year, to 38 million tonnes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to long-term planning, our Port has been able to accommodate these substantial increases without any adverse effect. The port continues to maintain a high level of productivity. On the average, the port turns a container ship around in about seven hours, handling something like 600 containers. This turnaround time is one of the fastest in the world. It means much lower costs for shipowners as well as shippers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the foreseeable future, we expect containerised cargo to continue to increase. To meet this expected growth, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) is increasing the capacity of its existing container facilities by adding more quay cranes and other handling equipment. These cranes will be computerized to handle fourth-generation container vessels even more efficiently. The contract for 10 such cranes, amounting to $55 million, was recently awarded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA is also converting two conventional berths into a container berth at a cost of about $30 million. The new container berth will be ready in the second half of next year. This additional berth will be equipped with the latest container handling facilities and should be sufficient to meet the expected growth up to 1992. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond 1992, PSA plans to develop a new container terminal on Pulau Brani. Pulau Brani will have a modern terminal with maximum use of automation, mechanization and computerization in all its operations. Pulau Brani will also be linked to the mainland by a causeway. This will help reduce land transport time for importers and exporters as well as for sea-air freighters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore intends to maintain its position as the world's busiest port. For the first nine months of this year, shipping tonnage calling at Singapore increased by another 4%, bringing the total tonnage to 250 million gross registered tonnes. We will ensure that our port services are efficient and that our port charges competitive. We will strive for higher standards of productivity to give lower costs and to streamline port tariffs to maintain competitiveness. New computer hardware will be acquired and software developed to improve planning as well as to facilitate information and communication between the port, port users as well as the relevant Government departments. More aggressive marketing programmes will also be initiated to attract more ships and cargo to Singapore. No effort will be spared to maintain our position as the premier port internationally. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL LION SYMBOL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Response to use)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information what the response has been from both the public and private sectors to the use of our National Symbol, since it was launched in 1986. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, since the National Lion Symbol was launched in July last year as an integral part of the National Day Celebrations, it has been well received by the public.

The ST index fell a total of 31% between 19th October 1987 and 2nd November 1987. Due to a combination of international and regional factors, this fall was only exceeded by the decline in Hong Kong and was substantially larger than the falls in New York and Tokyo over the same period. The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) was also able to cope with sharp rises in turnover without any hiccups. This performance provides ample evidence of the fundamental soundness of the stockbroking industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present stability of the industry is a direct result of reforms introduced following the Pan-Electric crisis two years ago. They included the Securities Industry Act of 1986, the reconstitution of the Stock Exchange Committee, the corporatization of stockbroking firms, and the more recent introduction of revised rules on settlement and delivery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank borrowings of the stockbroking industry totalled $260 million as at 30th October 1987, compared to $1 billion two \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> years ago. These borrowings are well supported by aggregate shareholders' funds of $484 million so that stockbrokers are operating within the capital and debt-gearing criteria required in the Regulations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stockbroking firms have extended only $100 million in margin financing to their clients and their own investment in stocks and underwriting exposures are relatively modest, amounting to $92 million and $53 million respectively. With a much improved capital base and a healthy flow of commission income, the firms are well placed to weather the present turmoil in the stock markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Queenstown):</b> Would the Minister now consider it wrong to allow CPF members to use their CPF money to buy shares in the stock exchange, people whom the Howe Yoon Chong Report not so long ago would like us to believe that they could not be trusted to look after their own savings and yet they are now allowed to participate in the stock exchange casino, speculating away their hard earned money on shares, gold, and heaven knows what? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Although the question is not relevant to the question being asked, I will nevertheless reply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that it was a mistake and I think there is a presumption that all members who have used their CPF money have, in fact, lost money. This is not true. Some who have bought early should have made some money and those who have sold before the peak would also have made money. Undoubtedly there would be some who have taken on paper losses and one assumes that these people would not find it necessary to sell because the funds used were surplus to their immediate requirements and they should have bought only shares which were sensibly priced in the first place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be recognized that any investment carries a risk. The higher the rate of return one expects the higher the risk and one can assume that the majority of investors in Singapore are reasonably sensible, although one cannot exclude the possibility of those who want to speculate and therefore have to accept the risk. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CRISIS IN WORLD STOCK MARKETS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Effect on Singapore's reserves)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S.

Our investments are mainly in Government bonds, with the balance divided between gold, cash, stocks and shares, and real estate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stock portfolio has declined in value in line with world stock markets but as the bulk of our portfolio was purchased over a period of several years since 1982, our investments still show very substantial real gains even at present prices. The present fall in share prices should also be seen in its proper context. The worldwide bull market in stocks started in 1982 and the recent stock market declines merely bring share prices back to levels last seen in late 1986 in the United States and early 1987 in Japan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also fortunate that when share prices fell, bond prices moved in the opposite direction, so that the declines in our stock portfolio were partly offset by gains in our bond portfolios. Overall, the present crisis in world stock markets has had little impact on our overseas investments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also mention that our equity purchase policies have always been a conservative one. We are long term investors, concentrating on a portfolio of strong, low price/earning multiple companies with a large market capitalization, all well placed to ride through economic downturns. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can the Minister please tell us what is the percentage of the reserves that are invested in stock overseas? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We have never announced a breakdown of our investments and I do not propose to do so now. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>UNEMPLOYMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Measures to reduce)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin</b> asked the Minister for Labour what is the latest unemployment situation and whether his Ministry has plans (i) to encourage part-time employment, (ii) to persuade employers in the private sector to increase the retirement age of their workers and (iii) to monitor the supply and demand on foreign workers so as not to jeopardize our own people of job opportunities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. \n  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng</b> asked the Minister for Labour what is the latest available unemployment rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I answer Questions 13 and 14 together as they overlap. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest labour force survey in September 1987 shows that there were an estimated 44,700 unemployed persons, a decline of 14,100 persons from June 1987. This gives an unemployment rate of 3.6%, down from the 4.7% recorded in June 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic recovery, the unemployment situation has improved as many of the jobs created have been taken up by Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been encouraging companies to employ more part-time workers as an additional source to meet their labour requirements. Our survey shows that about 27,000 housewives are interested to return to work. Of these, about 12,000 would like to work part-time. This is a potential pool of persons for employers to attract back to the workforce by devising part-time schemes with working hours which suit these women. There is also the pool of retired workers some of whom may be prepared to seek part-time employment. My Ministry is presently looking into how the Employment Act can be amended to facilitate part-time employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made clear that the Government would like employers in the private sector to raise the retirement age of their workers to 60 years.

In the first eight months of this year, it created about 32,000 new jobs compared to 9,000 in the commerce sector, 2,500 in the transport and communications sector and 2,000 in the finance and business service sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth in manufacturing has been mainly in the electronics and garment \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> industries which account for about 60% of the job increases. These two industries as well as the retail sector have a preference for young unskilled female workers who are in short supply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic recovery, many jobs created have been taken up by new entrants to the labour market from our schools, vocational institutes, Polytechnics and Universities as well as by retrenched workers and other unemployed Singaporeans. Since June last year, about 30,000 unemployed Singaporeans have found jobs. There are also an estimated 36,000 Singaporeans classified as economically inactive who have indicated interest in seeking employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent the labour market from getting too tight, the Government has allowed the liberal entry of foreign workers into the four approved sectors which are manufacturing, hotels, construction and domestic maids. This policy indirectly benefits the other sectors of the economy by untightening the labour market. Foreign work permit holders who have been employed in the unapproved sectors have been allowed to remain in those sectors and to change jobs if they wish. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from increased competition for workers, certain firms may have difficulty in recruiting and retaining sufficient workers for various reasons. Some examples are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The firm pays salaries which are below market rates; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The working environment is unpleasant and the image of the firm is poor; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The company has more than 50% foreign workers in its workforce and is not allowed to recruit any more foreign workers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The firm has been blacklisted for employing foreign workers illegally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's question implies that the Government has to make available sufficient workers to meet whatever demand. With our limited working population this means an increasing access to foreign workers. Such a liberal policy would not be to our national interest. The current econo- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mic situation is such that a ready supply of foreign workers tends to create its own demand. There will be no incentive to optimize the use of local manpower, to employ older Singaporean workers and housewives and to increase productivity through automation and improved work methods. Too liberal an inflow of foreign workers will also depress local wages and attract more unskilled labour-intensive operations to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has to carry out a difficult balancing task. We have to allow a regulated inflow of foreign workers to facilitate healthy economic growth and upgrading whilst avoiding over-dependence on foreign workers. Economic growth should not be achieved simply by importing an ever-increasing number of foreign workers. Our goal should be to upgrade the level of our economy so that Singaporeans can be trained and employed in better paid jobs. To achieve this, both employers and workers must be prepared to make the necessary adjustments and to play their parts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister please tell this House whether workers have been recruited from China or attempts have been made to recruit workers from China? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are very few workers here from China.

My Ministry takes a very serious view of these disruptions. Their cost to the nation is tremendous; far greater than the cost of repairing the damaged cable. In a power blackout, factories have to stop, offices cannot function, and shops and establishments lose business. Banks, foreign exchange markets and the stock exchange, where every minute huge amounts are bought and sold, are all paralysed. Industries like petrochemicals and electronics, which depend critically on a continuous and reliable source of power, incur millions of dollars in lost production and start-up costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable damage is not the inevitable result of construction activity. It is purely the result of ignorance and negligence, and is wholly unnecessary and preventable, if \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> only contractors follow the proper procedures, verify the locations of underground cables, and take all necessary precautions before doing excavation works. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board has formed a cable damage prevention unit to patrol and inspect excavation sites, and to assist contractors working near cables. It will step up its education programme to teach contractors proper excavation procedures and use of cable detectors, through talks and demonstrations. It is also considering debarring recalcitrant contractors, and requiring all contractors to pay a deposit with PUB and obtain a permit before undertaking any excavation and earthworks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the maximum fine for damaging PUB cables is only $5,000. This is grossly inadequate and totally out of proportion to the gravity of the offence. PUB is seeking to amend the law to increase the maximum fine substantially. A figure of $200,000 would be more realistic, although even this would still be much less than the potential damage done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the PUB will continue to improve the reliability of its power equipment and network. In the next decade, PUB will spend some $5.2 billion to develop, expand and upgrade Singapore's electricity supply. New power stations and transmission cables will replace older and less reliable equipment. A computerized power system control centre will remotely monitor and control the power stations and transmission and distribution network, and speed up restoration of supplies in the event of power failure. I am confident that these measures will minimize power failures in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HEPATITIS B IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMME</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Education of public)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. \n  <b>Dr Ho Tat Kin</b> asked the Acting Minister for Health what steps his Ministry is taking to (i) prevent undue fear among the public which may be generated by the publicity surrounding the Hepatitis B immunization programme, and (ii) prevent profiteering by any one who capitalises on this fear. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, information on Hepatitis B immunization has been provided by my Ministry as part of its health education programme.

There are also a small number of flats with unfavourable features which should be sold at a discount from the prevailing posted price. However, the current pricing system does not reflect these factors for flats within the same estate or within the same new town. These different factors are presently reflected in the prices of HDB flats in the resale market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB will implement differential pricing of flats within the same estate or new town and add a premium to reflect the extra value for those flats with favourable factors. In the first instance, premia will be added for flats with easy accessibility to MRT stations and town centres, and for flats with scenic views. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flats in less favourable locations will be sold at a discount on the prevailing selling prices. These will be mostly flats very near refuse bin compounds, or those which have been repeatedly rejected for various reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other flats, there will be no adjustment to their prevailing selling prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed differential pricing is expected to be implemented before the end of this year. About 2,500 flats will be affected by this change. This represents about 6% of the flats sold in this financial year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next few years only about 5-10% of HDB flats will be affected by such differential pricing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change to the existing system of allocation. Public applicants will continue to select flats according to their registration numbers. The existing priority given to resettlement applicants will remain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing categories of flats will continue to be available for selection to both public and resettlement applicants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general pricing policy, HDB will continue to price flats within an affordable range to applicants. We want to encourage a full home-owning society, so prices must be affordable. However, this does not mean that all flats must cost the same. Flats which enjoy special features must naturally cost a little more than those without such features. Differential pricing of better located flats will not put home ownership of HDB flats out of reach of the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe the Minister has not really thoroughly answered the question because I think the Member who puts this question is interested in the proposed differential pricing.

Following the receipt of this decision, MUIS has been working towards taking over the management of pilgrimage matters from pilgrim brokers. MUIS is hopeful that this can be achieved by the end of 1988. For the coming Haj season, MUIS will continue its present arrangement of having licensed pilgrim brokers assist in the pilgrimage exercise. However, MUIS will assume greater responsibility and control in many areas previously left to pilgrim brokers to manage independently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS will be responsible for:- (i) negotiating directly with airlines for a reasonable fare; (ii) negotiating directly with the various agencies in Saudi Arabia for accomodation for Singapore pilgrims; (iii) approving the itinerary and services offered by the pilgrim brokers and the tour fares which they will charge; and (iv) ensuring that pilgrim brokers provide a sufficient number of experienced helpers to look after the welfare of the pilgrims under their charge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the spate of advertisements by tour organisations, MUIS called a meeting of interested pilgrim brokers on 27th October, 1987 and asked them to cease advertising their services for the forthcoming Haj season.

Apart from airfares, the quality of the pilgrim's accommodation is another important factor that will determine the expenses the pilgrim will incur. For example, if a pilgrim wishes to stay in a five-star hotel, such as the Ajyad Hotel in the Holy City of Makkah, this will automatically increase his expenses, compared with that of a pilgrim who only needs moderate accommodation. In any case, MUIS will try its best to ensure that the services it provides and the services provided by certain agencies in Saudi Arabia will satisfy to the pilgrims. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second question, I think it would be best for prospective pilgrims who have hitherto registered with pilgrimage agents to contact MUIS to resolve this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin (Pasir Panjang)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in view of the increasing responsibilities of MUIS in coordinating these new functions, does it have sufficient staff to cope with this, or has it sought the people who can really give better service than the pilgrim brokers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): As the hon.

Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, from January to September this year, a total of 8,979 heavy vehicles were issued summonses for various moving offences on the expressways. Of these, 97.2% were booked for speeding, 2.7% for careless driving and 0.14% for inconsiderate driving. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same period, Sir, there were 55 accidents involving heavy vehicles on expressways.

Under the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Rules, 1974, the owner of a vehicle can be liable for prosecution for improper maintenance or use of the vehicle. Therefore, in a traffic accident involving heavy vehicles, both the driver and owner may be prosecuted, though for different offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Police is promoting the use of tachograph among major fleet owners. This device is installed in a vehicle which will record information relating to speed, distance travelled and the number of stops made during each journey. Last month the Traffic Police conducted a seminar for a number of major fleet owners on the subject of how to enhance the safety and performance of their fleet of vehicles. Among the subjects covered was the use of tachographs in vehicles.

Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in May this year, I announced in Parliament that a Working Committee comprising Government and private sector representatives had been set under the chairmanship of the Director-General of Public Works, who is also the President of the Professional Engineers \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Board, to look into the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the collapse of the Hotel New World. The Committee has finished its study and has submitted its recommendations to the Government. A copy of the Committee's Report has been circulated to Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of its work, the Committee visited Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom and West Germany to study their building control systems and practices which are similar or relevant to the recommendations made by the Commission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The views and recommendations of the Working Committee cover five main areas, ie: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) checking of structural design; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) control during construction stage; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) maintenance of buildings; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) registration of contractors; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) DBCD's legislation and staffing requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Working Committee with very slight modifications and will proceed to implement them. I will now comment on each of the recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(1) Checking of Structural Designs</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the checking of structural design, the Government agrees with the view that structural plans and calculations should be independently checked. We will implement a checking system proposed by the Working Committee under which DBCD will accredit registered professional engineers as checkers. Under the system, the developer will engage an accredited checker, who must be from a different firm from the designer, to check the structural design. The checker will submit an independent set of calculations and analyses to DBCD. DBCD will also carry out its own selective checking to make sure that the system is effective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed checking system by accredited checkers has several advantages: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, checking can be done in stages as each structural sub-system is designed. Consultations between the checker and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> designer can proceed expeditiously at every stage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, fees paid to the checker by the developer can be based on actual work performed by the checker. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, independence is ensured by requiring the designer and checker to be from different firms and by DBCD's own selective checking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee estimated that the proposed checking system would cost developers a marginal increase of 0.11% to the total construction cost or 1.6% to the total consultancy cost for a building project. To give Members some idea of what this would represent, if we take a workload equivalent to 70% of the annual value of building projects approved by DBCD during the period from 1982 to 1986, the checking work will represent $6.5 million annually in fees to private consultants. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(2) Construction Supervision</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On construction supervision, the Government agrees that DBCD should enforce proper supervision by full-time qualified persons at the construction sites. For major projects costing $10 million and above, resident engineers will have to be engaged. A full-time clerk-of-works will be required for minor projects costing less than $10 million. However, only \"standing supervision\" by clerk-of-works during concreting and piling will be required for conventional residential projects costing $2 million and below. Clerks-of-works will have to be formally qualified with at least a Polytechnic Diploma or equivalent. However, in order not to affect the livelihood of the many clerks-of-works who have no formal qualifications and who are currently working in the industry, we will not impose this requirement for three years. Within three years, these people should upgrade themselves. The Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) will organize a 6-month National Construction Supervisors' Course for these unqualified clerks-of-works. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other control measures to be introduced during the construction stage include: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) various tests to be carried out under the supervision of the professional engineers; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) laboratory tests to be conducted by SISIR's accredited laboratories; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) test results, schedule and record of supervision of the main structural elements to be maintained at the site office for DBCD's inspection and information; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) quarterly reports to be submitted to DBCD; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) spot checks of construction sites by DBCD; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) major structural amendments during construction to be submitted for DBCD's approval. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(3) Maintenance of Buildings</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the maintenance of buildings, mandatory inspections by professional engineeers will be required for non-residential buildings at 5-yearly intervals. The frequency of inspection will be reviewed 5-10 years after impl ementation with a view to reducing it. Residential apartments and condominiums will be inspected once every 10 years. Private residential houses will be exempted from such mandatory inspection. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(4) Registration of Contractors</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the CIDB Registry of Contractors is to serve the needs of Government. Such a system of compulsory registration was introduced to ensure that only bona fide tenderers with the ability to provide a satisfactory level of supplies and services could participate in Government tenders. Therefore, it is inappropriate for CIDB to register and, in the process, to grade contractors for the purpose of private sector projects. It should be up to the private sector developers to make their own assessment on the contractors for their projects. Developes could, if they wish, also pick from amongst those registered with CIDB. However, users of the registry should note that the registration system by itself does not guarantee the quality and performance of the registered contractors. On the contractors' side, they can, in practice, also register with CIDB even if they do only private sector projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(5) Legislation and Staffing Requirements</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New legislation will be introduced to enable DBCD to perform the new functions. DBCD will expand its professional \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> staff strength to cope with its enhanced role in the design, construction and maintenance of buildings. The responsibility of the Building Authority will be transferred from the Deputy Director of DBCD to the Director-General of Public Works, who is in a better position to marshall the necessary technical resources within PWD when required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to add that although the aforesaid measures as recommended are aimed primarily at buildings in the private sector, they would also be applied to public sector buildings, where these measures are applicable. Statutory boards with in-house design expertise will be required to institute proper internal checking systems, ie, all structural plans and calculations must be certified by two qualified engineers, one as the designer and the other as the checker. This internal checking system is currently being practised by PWD as the Government Engineering Authority and responsible for all Government buildings as well as the HDB as the Public Housing Authority. The Building Authority would carry out selective checking to audit the internal checking systems of PWD and the statutory boards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above measures will be implemented in phases in the coming months as and when the required procedures, legislation and manpower are in place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is grateful to the Building Control Working Committee for their effort in coming out with the above practical preventive measures to enhance structural safety of our buildings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whilst my Government Parliamentary Committee did not have the opportunity to study the Report of the Working Committee, nevertheless we are giving it a general support, and therefore we would like to pose some questions to the Hon. Minister. First, what are the main problems his Ministry will face in implementing the proposals as stated in the Report? And which are the measures likely to be introduced first? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all the recommendations of the Committee can be implemented. There are no big problems. The problems really arise from the rate at which they can be implemented. As I have already mentioned in my statement, it depends upon how quickly we can introduce the procedures, legislation and recruit the manpower. Some of the measures obviously require amendments to existing legislation, the Building Control Act, for example. These could take a little longer because we have to draft the amendments, present them to Parliament, debate and pass the amended legislation in Parliament. We would also take some time to recruit the necessary engineers and supporting staff to implement the measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DBCD has already prepared the groundwork on the accreditation of checkers. In this, it will be working very closely with the professional bodies in Singapore. Applications for accreditation of checkers will soon be invited by DBCD and these applications will be evaluated by a selection panel comprising eminent engineers from both the public as well as the private sector. Design checks can be implemented once the accredited checkers are selected. Even though the legislation may not be in place, once we announce the list of accredited checkers, I am sure developers would want to use them. I want to emphasize that developers should not take these measures as measures just to comply with Government requirements. These measures are to protect them and the public. Therefore, even before the legislation is in place which will force them to use checkers, they should start using them to protect themselves and the potential buyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for tests during construction and spot checks of construction sites will also be implemented shortly and the targetted date is January 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I understand it, the responsibility of the Building Authority will be transferred from the Deputy Director of DBCD to the Director-General of Public Works. I think the Minister stated that the Director-General is in a better position to marshall the necessary technical resources within \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> PWD. In this respect, does the Minister not envisage a problem during the transitional period when the Building Authority is transferred to the Director-General of Public Works? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not expect any special problems. The Deputy Director who is now the Building Authority as defined in the law actually is one of the Deputy Directors working under the Director-General of Public Works. But there are other Deputies who are responsible for other aspects of public works and their resources and their expertise can be used. If the Director-General is the Building Authority as defined in the law, then he can call upon any one of the Deputies to participate in the evaluation of projects or in the implementation of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Geylang Serai):</b> Sir, I would like to ask some questions on construction supervision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will this 6-month National Construction Supervisors Course which the CIDB is organizing provide sufficient training for clerks-of-works to enable them to competently supervise construction works? And is this course considered equivalent to the Polytechnic diploma? Another question is whether CIDB will want the clerks-of-works to be registered with them, or at least ask developers to register their clerks-of-works with the Board? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the course that will be organized, ie, the National Construction Supervisors Course, is an upgrading course for those who are already engaged in the industry. Applicants must have had sufficient experience, at least two years' minimum experience in the industry, before they can take this course. In other words, it is not a course for newcomers but for those who already have some practical experience. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course, as drafted by the CIDB, should meet the requirements of any competent clerk-of-works. It consists of four modules which will cover all the fundamental requirements that the clerk-of-works should have to do his job properly. The curriculum was planned with major inputs from the construction \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> industry as well as from the professional bodies and the Polytechnics. Depending upon the background, how much education he has had and how much experience, the course can be completed within a period of six to 12 months. The course will be held in the evenings. So it will not interfere with the work of the clerk-of works. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are some who already have some qualifications which may not be directly relevant but some part of their courses may be relevant. For such people, there will be exemptions from certain parts of the course. We are convinced that the course will be sufficient to make the clerks-of-works competent in their job. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of registration of clerks-of-works, this matter was dealt with by the Working Committee, and I think they quite rightly came to the conclusion that there should not be a separate board of registration for clerks-of-works. It is a question of how far down the line we want to go. The consultant engineer in charge of the job is the one who is responsible, and it is up to him to employ competent people to execute the work. In any architect's firm or in any professional engineer's firm, the consultant engineer cannot say, \"Well, somebody else did the job, therefore, I am not responsible.\" In the same way, in this case of clerks-of-works the engineer cannot disclaim responsibility. It is up to the consultant engineer to make sure, whether he employs a resident engineer or a clerk-of-works in the job, that such people are competent and carry out the job competently. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister some questions with regard to the registration of contractors. What is the Committee's recommendation on registration of contractors and the basis of this recommendation. Secondly, would the Government encourage all contractors to register with the CIDB even though they are only doing private sector projects? Thirdly, has the contractors' association's view been sought on the registration of contractors? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have mentioned in my Statement that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Working Committee looked at this recommendation which has been made by the Commission of Inquiry and they came to the conclusion that it was not necessary to register contractors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registry of contractors now maintained by the CIDB is for Government as a consumer of supplies and services, and contractors are assessed according to the kinds of work they can do. When Government wants to call for tenders, they use this list. Private developers have to make their own assessment. Of course, they can select from the list that the Government uses on the basis that such contractors already have passed through the scrutiny of Government. There are contractors who do basically priva sector work. If they want to be registered, of course they can apply and provide all the details. In other words, they will be applying as though they want to bid for Government tenders, and if they pass the scrutiny of the relevant authorities, they will be listed, and even though they do not bid for Government tenders, they would have at least passed the scrutiny for Government jobs and the private sector can always use such contractors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, just a clarification on the answer on the National Construction Supervisor's Course. Will the qualification of those unqualified clerks-of-works who have attended this course be considered at par or equivalent to the Polytechnic diploma? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Yes, but it does not mean in all respects. That is why I started off the answer by saying that in respect of this job that we have for them, it will be considered as equivalent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to raise a few questions related to maintenance? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister explain why residential buildings are inspected once in ten years whereas non-residential buildings are inspected once in five years? The second question is, why are private residential apartments or houses exempted from inspection, and will the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> inspection of buildings be extended to public housing blocks of flats? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have exempted the private residential houses because most of these are not more than two storeys high and are individual properties. I think owners can be expected to look after their properties. If there are any cracks, I am sure they will take immediate action to get somebody to look into the cracks. The use of the building is also not likely to change and it is also unlikely that the owner will make structural changes which will endanger his life. The responsibility, of course, must rest basically with the owner-occupants in the case of residential properties. If they detect any cracks, I am sure that they will seek the necessary advice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of commercial buildings, it is quite different. They are rented out usually and very often changes or structural changes take place - partitions are removed, partitions are put in, and there is not the same close scrutiny and sense of ownership. That is why we have accepted the recommendation that these buildings should be inspected once in five years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of residential apartments and condominiums which are highrise, the recommendation is that they should be inspected once in ten years. Most of these apartments are occupied by the owners. Of course, some are rented. And even where they are rented, they are not on very long leases, maybe two or three years. The owner then has an opportunity to go back, inspect, refurnish or restore the place before he rents it out again. So there is constant supervision by the owner of his property, and the owner can be expected to act responsibly. The occurrence of alterations and additions affecting structures is also less likely to take place in the case of residential premises as compared to commercial premises. Moreover, condominiums are required by law to be managed by management corporations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for maintenance, I must emphasise, is only an interim proposal. We are not certain yet whether it is necessary over the long term to insist on five-yearly inspections. We have to run the system for five to ten years and make the necessary adjustments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister as to the need to have accredited professional engineers. I see that all engineers, if they are professional engineers, would be certified by the Board. So why is there a need to have two standards of engineers, one accredited and the other non-accredited? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> To be registered as an engineer, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all that one needs to have is, I think, a degree and a minimum of working experience and you can start designing structures. For those who are going to check, the approach is that such engineers should have had at least ten years' experience because they are going to check on the work done by others and they should not be people who have just been registered to practice as engineers. There is therefore a need need to separate the requirements for checkers from those who design. The system that is recommended is actually taken from the practice in Germany where not all engineers are selected as checkers. Checkers are those who fulfill certain minimum requirements which are higher than those required for just normal engineers who do designs. We do not want a fresh graduate who has just been registered as an engineer to be checking the work of another fresh graduate. I do not think we will get any better work done. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister a couple of questions concerning the proposed checking system for structural designs, plans and calculations? The first question is, will it bring about any difficulties to the developers other than the slight increase in cost he mentioned earlier? Secondly, will it cause any delay in the approval of the building plans? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it should not cause any delay since the checkers will be also from the private sector, as I mentioned in my Statement. The checking can take place from the very first design of the building. It is not necessary for the whole building to be designed and the full set of drawings be submitted to the DBCD for checking and, if there are changes to be made or if there are errors, then the whole set has to be re-prepared. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Under the system proposed, the checker can work with the designer right from the very beginning, and as the building is designed at every stage the checking can be done. So I think it should not lead to any delay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of those particular designs on which DBCD chooses to do a counter-check, there could be a small delay. But even then I do not expect it to be a serious delay. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister forgot to answer my last question, ie, whether the maintenance inspection will be extended to public housing as well as URA and JTC buildings too? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is already a very elaborate and extensive system of checking of HDB, JTC and URA buildings, and that system will continue. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LONG-TERM RATES OF CPF CONTRIBUTION FOR</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PENSIONABLE EMPLOYEES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Labour)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>12.27 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the 28th July this year, I informed this House about the long-term target CPF rates which are applicable to the private sector as well as non-pensionable public sector employees. The Government has since decided on the long-term rates for pensionable employees in the public sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the CPF cut in April 1986, the employer's CPF rate for pensionable employees in the public sector was 15%. This was 60% of the private sector rate of 25%. After the CPF cut, the employer's CPF contribution rate for pensionable employees was reduced to 6%. This is 60% of the private sector rate of 10%. The Government has decided to set the long-term rates for pensionable employees at 60% of the rate for each respective age group in the private sector. The current relativity in CPF contribution rates between pensionable public sector employees on the one hand and private \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sector employees as well as non-pensionable public sector employees on the other will thus be maintained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target total contribution rate is therefore 24% for pensionable employees below age 55, 15% for those aged 55 to 59, 9% for those aged 60 to 64 and 6% for those 65 years old and above. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute an Annex (Cols. 53 - 54) which shows the target CPF rates for pensionable public sector employees. For comparison, the already announced long-term CPF rates for employees in the private sector are also given in the Annex. [Copies of document distributed to hon.
