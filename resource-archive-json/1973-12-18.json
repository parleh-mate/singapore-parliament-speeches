Members may permit me to recall\r\n\r\nthe rationale for the implementation of the policy\r\n\r\nin July this year requiring work permit holders to\r\n\r\nobtain  the  approval  of  the  Commissioner   for\r\n\r\nEmployment   before  contracting   marriage   with\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's high rate of economic growth and the\r\n\r\nresultant  tight labour situation in recent  years\r\n\r\nhave  led  to the adoption of a liberal policy  in\r\n\r\nthe  issue of work permits. There is at present  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of such work permit holders, many  of\r\n\r\nwhom  are  in  the younger age group,  working  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. For these young workers, it is  natural\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  mix  freely in our society,  making\r\n\r\nfriends,  marrying,  settling  down  and   raising\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  Singapore. A healthy infusion  of  a\r\n\r\nvigorous  and hardworking people can  result  from\r\n\r\nthis,  provided  they  are  industrious  and  have\r\n\r\nacquired the necessary skills. These qualities are\r\n\r\nessential if the young work permit holders are  to\r\n\r\nbe  integrated  successfully into the  society  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The policy requiring work permit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nholders to obtain the approval of the Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor Employment was implemented to discourage young\r\n\r\nworkers  on  work  permit from  contracting  early\r\n\r\nmarriages until they have shown that they are able\r\n\r\nto  settle down successfully in Singapore  and  to\r\n\r\nsupport  a  small  family. Unless  a  work  permit\r\n\r\nholder  has  adjusted to the different and  faster\r\n\r\npace of life in Singapore's highly disciplined and\r\n\r\nurbanised society, marriage between a work  permit\r\n\r\nholder  and  a  Singapore  citizen  can  lead   to\r\n\r\ndifficulties for themselves and for Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nprocessing     applications     for     marriages,\r\n\r\nconsideration  must therefore be  given  to  these\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th November, 1973, the Commissioner for\r\n\r\nEmployment  has  approved  a  total  of  702  such\r\n\r\napplications. 792 others were rejected because the\r\n\r\nwork permit holders were unskilled and working  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  too  short  a  period   prior   to\r\n\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, hon. Members may wish to note\r\n\r\nthat  no approval is required in marriages between\r\n\r\nwork permit holders where Singapore citizenship or\r\n\r\npermanent  residence in Singapore is not  acquired\r\n\r\nnor  desired. Furthermore, applications from  work\r\n\r\npermit  holders who are skilled or who  have  more\r\n\r\nthan   five   years'  continuous   employment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore will be favourably considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the Minister say whether applications\r\n\r\nwill be approved for those work permit holders who\r\n\r\nwant to give up their work permits and who want to\r\n\r\nmarry local citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the answer is \"No\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But I would like to ask him  why  has\r\n\r\nthe  regulation  been made retroactive.  When  the\r\n\r\nregulation  came  into force on  1st  July,  1973,\r\n\r\nthose  people who had already contracted to  marry\r\n\r\nbefore that date, applied to the Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nEmployment  for  approval, but their  applications\r\n\r\nwere  rejected.  I  want  to  know  what  is   the\r\n\r\njustification    for   making    the    regulation\r\n\r\nretroactive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I am\r\n\r\naware,  I  have  not rejected any of  those  cases\r\n\r\nwhere the applicants have made arrangements to get\r\n\r\nmarried,  i.e, if  they  have  made  bookings  of\r\n\r\nrestaurants,  and  if  they have  spent  money  on\r\n\r\nfurniture  and all sorts of things connected  with\r\n\r\nthe proposed marriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I have even come across a\r\n\r\ncase where the girl is already pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, that shows a lack of\r\n\r\ndiscipline  on  the  part of the  couple.  If  the\r\n\r\ncouple can show to the Commissioner for Employment\r\n\r\nthat   they   have  already  made  the   necessary\r\n\r\narrangements, I think favourable consideration may\r\n\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, never mind the discipline.\r\n\r\nEverybody  makes mistakes. The fact is  that  this\r\n\r\ncouple  had contracted to marry before  1st  July,\r\n\r\n1973.  And  when this regulation came into  force,\r\n\r\nall  those who wanted to marry foreigners  had  to\r\n\r\nget   the   approval   of  the  Commissioner   for\r\n\r\nEmployment. So the couple went to the Registry  of\r\n\r\nMarriages and the Registrar referred them  to  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Employment, who turned  it  down\r\n\r\nwithout finding out whether the contract was  made\r\n\r\nbefore or after the 1st of July, 1973. This is the\r\n\r\npoint I am making: How can, the Minister make  his\r\n\r\nregulations retroactive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, if the Member can submit\r\n\r\nhis  case to me, I will look into it. If the whole\r\n\r\nintention is to beat the deadline by submitting an\r\n\r\napplication for marriage even though there was  no\r\n\r\nintention  originally, then I  think  we  have  to\r\n\r\nthink twice before giving approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, this is not the fault of the\r\n\r\npeople  who want to beat the deadline because  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  was made earlier than the  effective\r\n\r\ndate  of the regulation. Naturally, those who  had\r\n\r\nalready contracted to marry wanted to apply before\r\n\r\n1st  July,  1973.

To\r\n\r\nalleviate the situation, paid parking of cars  has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  progressively in  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nestates.  This  should  ensure  more  orderly  and\r\n\r\nsystematic parking of cars and prevent  misuse  of\r\n\r\nthe  car parks. The parking fees in Toa Payoh  New\r\n\r\nTown  at  20 cents per hour, or for season tickets\r\n\r\nat $15 per month day-and-night, are reasonable and\r\n\r\nnot  beyond  the means of car owners. Car  parking\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  allowed to overspill on  to  public\r\n\r\nroads. Car ownership may eventually require  proof\r\n\r\nof  a car parking space either in a parking lot or\r\n\r\nprivate   garage.

This problem is  also\r\n\r\npartly  due  at  the very outset to  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nplanning and control on the allocation of  parking\r\n\r\nspaces  in  HDB estates.

The job of the Housing Board  is\r\n\r\nreally  to build houses for the people. It  cannot\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time build one car park  for  every\r\n\r\nhouse  it  builds.

These are  mainly  food\r\n\r\nitems,   building   and  construction   materials,\r\n\r\nhousehold  goods and other consumer products.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will lose approximately $19.6  million\r\n\r\nannually  in revenue. The consumers, on the  other\r\n\r\nhand, should benefit both in terms of lower prices\r\n\r\nin  some of the imported commodities and a greater\r\n\r\nvariety  and  regularity  of  supplies.  In  other\r\n\r\ncases,   where   the  duties  have   been   mainly\r\n\r\nprotective in nature, the prices of goods of local\r\n\r\nmanufacture   could  also,  because  of   possible\r\n\r\ncompetition from imports, be significantly lowered\r\n\r\nto the benefit of consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the prices of imported goods should be\r\n\r\ncheaper at least to the extent of the duties which\r\n\r\nhave been removed. In practice, importers who have\r\n\r\npaid  duty  on  existing stocks and  do  not  face\r\n\r\nimmediate competition from other importers may not\r\n\r\nbe  willing to reduce prices immediately. I  would\r\n\r\nexpect   importers,   however,   in   their    own\r\n\r\nenlightened self-interest, to reduce prices on new\r\n\r\nstocks  which are no longer subject to  duty.  The\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Trade is keeping a close  watch  on\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of  goods on which duties  have  been\r\n\r\nlifted,  and  if  the prices are not  reduced  the\r\n\r\nimporters will be required to explain why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importers, who are competing against local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and have not been importing  in  the\r\n\r\npast  because of the duty, may need some  time  to\r\n\r\nestablish  fresh  links with  overseas  suppliers.\r\n\r\nWhen   such  links  have  been  established,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  expects that prices in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nat least be comparable to international prices. It\r\n\r\nis  heartening to note that prices of some of  the\r\n\r\nimported items which are no more subject to import\r\n\r\nduties have gone down by 10 to 30 per cent, but in\r\n\r\nother cases the prices have remained high or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven increased because of the world wide shortage\r\n\r\nand increasing cost of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RESTRICTIONS ON THE SUPPLY, DISTRIBUTION AND</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>USE OF PETROLEUM AND ELECTRICITY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled\r\n\r\n\"An  Act  to  make  temporary  provision  for  the\r\n\r\nimposition   of   restrictions  on   the   supply,\r\n\r\ndistribution    and   use   of    petroleum    and\r\n\r\nelectricity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Second Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Now, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency signed by the President in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the Bill, laid upon the Table  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the gloomy reading in the news these\r\n\r\ndays,  Members of the House will need no  reminder\r\n\r\nof  the  grave  situation facing  many  countries,\r\n\r\nincluding  Singapore, as a result of the reduction\r\n\r\nin   oil   production  by  Middle  East  producing\r\n\r\ncountries.   While   we   must   all   hope   that\r\n\r\ninternational discussions in the near future  will\r\n\r\nlead  to  some  alleviation of the  situation,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be foolhardy to assume that there  will  be\r\n\r\nany  early  resumption of the normal  supplies  of\r\n\r\npetroleum  products to consuming  countries.  Many\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  world have  already  begun  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  compulsory  measures  to  conserve  all\r\n\r\nenergy  resources. Singapore itself has started  a\r\n\r\nSave Energy Campaign, with active participation by\r\n\r\nthe public, the Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board  and all the oil  companies.  But\r\n\r\nwhile  there has been a useful drop of electricity\r\n\r\nconsumption  since the start of the  campaign,  we\r\n\r\nhave  not achieved anything like the 12 to 13  per\r\n\r\ncent  savings  required by the  present  level  of\r\n\r\nrestriction in petroleum supplies. We must  expect\r\n\r\nthis  level  to  go progressively  higher  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming   months.  It  is  clearly  unlikely   that\r\n\r\nvoluntary  restraints alone would be effective  in\r\n\r\ncutting down the often unnecessary consumption  of\r\n\r\nenergy  to the desired extent. Compulsory measures\r\n\r\nmust therefore be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government already has certain powers under\r\n\r\nvarious Acts enacted by Parliament. The Control of\r\n\r\nEssential  Supplies Act, 1973,  approved  by  this\r\n\r\nHouse  at  its  last  sitting,  gives  powers  for\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the domestic sale, including  possibly\r\n\r\nrationing, of essential commodities but it is  not\r\n\r\nentirely suitable for the control of petroleum and\r\n\r\nelectricity  consumption. Under the Petroleum  Act\r\n\r\nalso,  action  can  be taken against  hoarders  of\r\n\r\npetroleum.  Under the Public Utilities Board  Act,\r\n\r\nmeasures to restrict the use of electricity can be\r\n\r\nimposed.   And   under  the  Road   Traffic   Act,\r\n\r\nprohibition  on  the use of public  roads  can  be\r\n\r\nintroduced. But these Acts will have to be amended\r\n\r\nif,  as  announced in Government's press statement\r\n\r\nsometime  ago,  compulsory  measures  to  conserve\r\n\r\nenergy  have to be implemented and heavy deterrent\r\n\r\npenalties  imposed,  such  as  the  suspension  of\r\n\r\ndriving  licences and the cancellation of  vehicle\r\n\r\nlicences. It is desirable, therefore, that all the\r\n\r\nnecessary  measures  to  cope  with  the   current\r\n\r\nsituation be provided under a single Bill and  not\r\n\r\nby amendments to several existing Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House will provide the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with the necessary powers to  restrict\r\n\r\nthe  supply, distribution and use of petroleum and\r\n\r\nelectricity.  It also provides for the  imposition\r\n\r\nof severe penalties for the prohibited use of cars\r\n\r\nor  hoarding  of  petrol or the excessive  use  of\r\n\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPenalties include the cancellation of vehicle  and\r\n\r\ndriving  licences and the cutting off or reduction\r\n\r\nof  electricity supplies to premises.

I wonder whether the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  any  plans  to  obtain  alternative\r\n\r\nsources, like building a tidal barrage in the  sea\r\n\r\nto  generate  electricity, or to  utilise  gaseous\r\n\r\nvapours as substitutes for petroleum for our daily\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics have shown that our major oil users\r\n\r\nare as follows: electricity 45 per cent; transport\r\n\r\n38  per  cent;  industry 14 per cent and  domestic\r\n\r\nheating 3 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent.   Our   main   users  are  electricity   and\r\n\r\ntransport,   while  the  industrial  sector   only\r\n\r\nutilises  14 per cent. We must be careful  not  to\r\n\r\nrestrict  the industrial sector too much  or  else\r\n\r\nour economy will be greatly hit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the implementation of the law should be\r\n\r\ncarried out carefully. We should not be penny-wise\r\n\r\nand  pound  foolish, because there may be  avenues\r\n\r\nwhere  a  small percentage of oil and  electricity\r\n\r\nmay  be  saved but in terms of production  we  may\r\n\r\nlose heavily. On the other hand, there may also be\r\n\r\nareas  where electricity and petroleum are heavily\r\n\r\nused, but the profits are nominal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst implementing the Act, consideration\r\n\r\nshould  also be given to the safety of  our  shift\r\n\r\nworkers  in the factories and industries  who  may\r\n\r\nhave to go to work in blacked-out streets.

It is perhaps unfortunate that  this\r\n\r\nBill  has  to  be passed in this Chamber.

With  affluence\r\n\r\nand  additional  income,  people  sought  to  gain\r\n\r\nhigher  standards of living and, in  fact,  gained\r\n\r\nthem.  In  transport, the scooter, the motorcycle,\r\n\r\nthe  car, has been bought. In home convenience and\r\n\r\ncomfort,  the electric oven, the washing  machine,\r\n\r\nthe   vacuum  cleaner,  the  air  cooler  or  air-conditioning  plant, has been  bought.  Additional\r\n\r\nlighting   for  sophisticated  effects  has   been\r\n\r\ninstalled,  complete with solid state stereophonic\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high standard of living means a high\r\n\r\nconsumption  of fuel and electrical power.  It  is\r\n\r\nimperative that our industries do not drag and  it\r\n\r\nis  also  imperative  that the  entire  industrial\r\n\r\ninfrastructure supporting our economy is fed  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  energy  in  order  that  it   operates\r\n\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help ensure this situation, Sir,\r\n\r\nthose  of  us who have benefited from the  economy\r\n\r\nand  become  high fuel and energy consumers  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  being  able  to afford  cars,  energy-consuming   appliances,   comfort   devices    and\r\n\r\namusement  gadgetry,  should  be  the   first   to\r\n\r\nrestrain  ourselves in our daily manner and  tempo\r\n\r\nof living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does the Government accept this but I\r\n\r\nthink  I  may say that the greater number  of  the\r\n\r\nless  well-off  people  expect  such  self-imposed\r\n\r\nrestraints from those who can afford to bear  such\r\n\r\nrestraints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a compact nation and should easily jell\r\n\r\naround  a  slogan  for  survival  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nnecessary measure of social discipline in the face\r\n\r\nof  national threats or difficulties.

Member for Jalan Kayu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him entirely that Government should\r\n\r\ntake  a  lead  in  setting the example  of  saving\r\n\r\nelectricity, and that this should start  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries, Government offices, statutory\r\n\r\nboards,  and  so  on.  But  where  Parliament   is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I would like to correct the impression\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps this institution is not  setting  an\r\n\r\nexample.  If anybody were to come here on  a  non-sitting day, he will have to grope his way through\r\n\r\ndark  passages and feel the presence  of  a  musty\r\n\r\nodour affecting him wherever he goes, because  all\r\n\r\nthe  lights  and the air-conditioning  are  turned\r\n\r\noff.  In  this case, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think  you\r\n\r\nare  also  at  a  disadvantage  because  the  air-conditioning here is turned on for one hour only a\r\n\r\nday   and   you  have  to  work  in  these   musty\r\n\r\nconditions.

To what extent  are\r\n\r\nwe  dependent  on  the Middle  East  for  our  oil\r\n\r\nsupplies, and what efforts have been made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  look  for alternative  sources  of\r\n\r\nsupply? The next question\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis: Has the Government sought the co-operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Government  for  such  alternative\r\n\r\nsources of supply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much\r\n\r\nobliged to all the Members of this House who  have\r\n\r\nspoken   and   given  us  their   views   on   the\r\n\r\nconservation of energy. It is very necessary  that\r\n\r\nall  of  us pay attention to the requirements  for\r\n\r\nsaving  which  will  be necessary  in  the  coming\r\n\r\nmonths.   I  am  therefore  gratified  that   this\r\n\r\nparticular  Bill has attracted so much comment  in\r\n\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the various questions which have\r\n\r\nbeen  asked,  I think one which has  received  the\r\n\r\nattention of more than one Member is the  question\r\n\r\nof  whether we can have alternative energy sources\r\n\r\nand   whether  we  can  formulate  any  plans  for\r\n\r\nreplacing  petroleum  as the  energy  source.  The\r\n\r\nanswer to this is, in the short-term, \"No\" because\r\n\r\n-  and this is in answer to another question - the\r\n\r\nmain  sources of oil supplies come from the Middle\r\n\r\nEast.  Of  course,  there are some  supplies  from\r\n\r\nnearer  Singapore,  but the amount  is  relatively\r\n\r\nsmall,  and  the proportion of energy which  comes\r\n\r\nfrom oil is also very high. The amount that we can\r\n\r\nget   from  wood  or  charcoal  is  really   quite\r\n\r\nnegligible. In the long term, of course, it  would\r\n\r\nbe  to  Singapore's advantage to try and diversify\r\n\r\nour  sources  of supply and I have no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a matter to which we ought to give  some\r\n\r\nattention.  The  Public  Utilities  Board  and  my\r\n\r\nMinistry have, between them, set up a committee to\r\n\r\nstudy  the  feasibility of setting  up  a  nuclear\r\n\r\npower  station. This will to some extent  help  us\r\n\r\nlessen  our  dependence on oil as  the  source  of\r\n\r\nenergy  for Singapore. There is also a possibility\r\n\r\nthat  coal  may be used and may be  fired  in  the\r\n\r\nboilers  for  the power station.  But  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which, I have no doubt again, my  Ministry\r\n\r\nand  the  Public  Utilities Board will  give  some\r\n\r\nattention in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the various comments on the need\r\n\r\nfor    ensuring    that   Government,    including\r\n\r\nParliament,   should  take   the   lead   in   the\r\n\r\npossibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof reducing electricity consumption, I should like\r\n\r\nto  say  that  it  is  really necessary  that  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of Singapore should be carried on  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that the business of Parliament  in\r\n\r\nthe  passing of this Bill is as important  as  any\r\n\r\nother  activity  in  trying to reduce  electricity\r\n\r\nconsumption in Singapore. But I quite  agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jalan Kayu and other Members  that\r\n\r\nit  is very necessary that we should always be  on\r\n\r\nthe   look-out  for  ways  and  means  of   saving\r\n\r\nelectricity, for example, raising the  temperature\r\n\r\nof  rooms  cooled by air-conditioning and  thereby\r\n\r\nsaving electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  that  with  our very  high  standards  of\r\n\r\nliving  and  perhaps a very lavish use of  energy,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  manifestation  of  our  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving,  we can all afford to make some  sacrifice\r\n\r\nagainst our high standards of living. This is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  position in many other very  developed\r\n\r\ncountries in the world to-day. I also concur  with\r\n\r\nhim  that  in  a cohesive and homogeneous  society\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore's,  we ought to  be  able  to  co-ordinate our efforts in the campaign to save a lot\r\n\r\nmore energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions,\r\n\r\nexcept perhaps those raised by the Member for  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.  I  think his first question was, \"What  is\r\n\r\nour   dependence  on  the  Middle  East?\"  I  have\r\n\r\nanswered  that we are almost wholly  dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe  Middle  East oil for our sources  of  energy.\r\n\r\nWhat alternatives have we got? It is possible,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  that  the sources nearer Singapore,  i.e.\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Malaysia, may be available. I  think\r\n\r\nsuggestions  had  already  been  made   by   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  that additional supplies of oil  should\r\n\r\nperhaps   be  made  available  first   to   ASEAIN\r\n\r\ncountries.  But  in regard to his question  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether   we   have   approached   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment, the answer is no. I do not  think  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government  at  the  moment   has   any\r\n\r\nadditional  supply  of oil to spare.  If  they  do\r\n\r\nhave,  I  shall have no difficulties in making  an\r\n\r\napproach to that Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just\r\n\r\nlike  to tender my apologies to you and your staff\r\n\r\nfor  my hasty remarks, and to thank the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong for putting me right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 35, to leave out \"for\" and insert \"from\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a typographical error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 to 13 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND ACQUISITION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Zoning,  density\r\n\r\nrequirements and other restrictions imposed  under\r\n\r\nthe  Planning  Act  as  well  as  any  restrictive\r\n\r\ncovenant  in the title of the acquired land  shall\r\n\r\nbe taken into account in determining market value,\r\n\r\nbut  no  account  will be taken of  any  potential\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the  land for any other more  intensive\r\n\r\nuse.  This  will  obviate  the  argument  that  is\r\n\r\nsometimes  made where land has been  zoned  for  a\r\n\r\nrestrictive  use,  as  for example,  \"public  open\r\n\r\nspace\",   that   the  land  has  got  considerable\r\n\r\npotential for development for residential or other\r\n\r\npurposes. In future, such arguments based  on  the\r\n\r\nhypothetical consideration that a future change of\r\n\r\nzoning  or  use  will be granted by  the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment will not be taken into consideration in\r\n\r\ndetermining   the   compensation   payable    upon\r\n\r\nacquisition.   Thus,  land  zoned   \"Agriculture\",\r\n\r\n\"Rural\",  \"Green  Belt\" or \"Unclassified\"  at  the\r\n\r\ntime of acquisition, will be valued as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the acquisition of land used as burial\r\n\r\ngrounds,   for   the   purpose  of   compensation,\r\n\r\nconsideration in cash or kind already received  by\r\n\r\nthe  owner  of the acquired land by  the  sale  of\r\n\r\ngrave  plots,  will be taken into account.  Again,\r\n\r\nany potential value of such land on the basis that\r\n\r\nit  could  be  put to more intensive use  will  be\r\n\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Other amendments tighten existing provisions\r\n\r\nto    discourage   speculation   and    fictitious\r\n\r\ntransactions aimed at securing a higher value  for\r\n\r\nsuch  land, or are redrafts of existing provisions\r\n\r\nto make intentions more explicit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 2 of the Bill amends the definition\r\n\r\nof \"person interested\" to provide that a statutory\r\n\r\ntenant,  under  the Control of Rent  Act,  of  any\r\n\r\nacquired  land  cannot claim any  compensation  on\r\n\r\naccount of acquisition of land.

Re-defining the section to specifically exclude rent-controlled tenants would make it abundantly  clear\r\n\r\nthat   such   persons   are   not   entitled    to\r\n\r\ncompensation,  and  would  therefore  reduce   the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  claims made to the Collector  of  Land\r\n\r\nRevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for a hiatus in the law.

It had  ten\r\n\r\nmembers, three from Singapore and seven from  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   These   members   were   drawn    from\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Government and  the  timber\r\n\r\nindustry from both sides of the Causeway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During its existence, the Board did good work in\r\n\r\npromoting,  regulating and  improving  the  timber\r\n\r\nexport  industry in both countries. It was  always\r\n\r\nself-financing through cess collection on  exports\r\n\r\nof  sawn timber and logs and the Singapore  Office\r\n\r\nof  the  Board has till today a substantial amount\r\n\r\nof liquid assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position has now changed to the extent that\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Government on its own initiative has\r\n\r\ndecided  to have a separate Timber Board  for  the\r\n\r\ntimber industry of Malaysia only.

A  new\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Timber  Industry Board  (Incorporation)\r\n\r\nAct,  1973,  was passed and came into  force  with\r\n\r\neffect from 1st June, 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Singapore industry is concerned,\r\n\r\nit is encouraging to note the large and increasing\r\n\r\nexports  of sawn timber. The f.o.b, value of  this\r\n\r\ntimber, both graded and ungraded, rose from  $67.9\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1968 to $132.8 million  in  1972,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  95  per cent during  the  last  four\r\n\r\nyears.  Owing  to  an  unprecedented  demand   and\r\n\r\nconsequent  high  prices for this  commodity,  our\r\n\r\nexports for the first six months of this year  for\r\n\r\nsawn timber topped $140.5 million - more than  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  our  1972  exports.  In  view  of   the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the timber industry and  its  major\r\n\r\ncontribution   to  our  external  trade,   it   is\r\n\r\nconsidered   that  it  should   continue   to   be\r\n\r\ncontrolled and regulated by a statutory body as in\r\n\r\nthe case of the rubber industry. It will therefore\r\n\r\nbe  necessary for Singapore to establish  its  own\r\n\r\nTimber Industry Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Timber Export Industry Board\r\n\r\n(Incorporation) Act, 1966, the now  defunct  joint\r\n\r\nBoard  was  responsible  only  for  problems   and\r\n\r\noperations affecting the export of sawn timber and\r\n\r\nlogs  only.  It  is proposed, however,  under  the\r\n\r\npresent   Timber  Industry  Board  (Incorporation)\r\n\r\nBill, that the functions of the new Board will  be\r\n\r\nextended  to cover all matters pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\ntimber  industry, which include not only logs  and\r\n\r\nsawn   timber  but  also  veneer,  plywood,   wood\r\n\r\nmouldings and other wood products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the establishment of a\r\n\r\nTimber  Industry Board which shall  consist  of  a\r\n\r\nChairman,  a Deputy Chairman and eight members  to\r\n\r\nbe   appointed  by  the  Minister.

A\r\n\r\nfundamental defect of the existing legislation  is\r\n\r\nthat  it confines itself, as the Minister has just\r\n\r\nsaid, to the regulation of timber export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation, I am happy to note,\r\n\r\nhas done away with the impractical distinction  of\r\n\r\nregulating  timber for export and ignoring  timber\r\n\r\nfor  local consumption. All timber sold, processed\r\n\r\nor  manufactured in Singapore, whether for  export\r\n\r\nor  local  use, are henceforth to come within  the\r\n\r\npurview  of  the  proposed  Bill.  Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nregistration   of   timber   exporters,   graders,\r\n\r\nsuppliers,  packers or manufacturers  -  that  is,\r\n\r\neveryone who has anything to do with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  timber  trade  or  industry  in  Singapore  - provides  a  firm basis for the proper control  of\r\n\r\nthe timber trade or industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only regret is that, under clause 4 of the\r\n\r\nBill,  the  proposed Board seems to be constituted\r\n\r\nof  the representatives of the Government and  the\r\n\r\ntimber    exporters,   suppliers,    packers    or\r\n\r\nmanufacturers.  The Second Schedule  to  the  Bill\r\n\r\nlists out the four recognised associations for the\r\n\r\npurpose  of clause 5 of the Bill. Nowhere  in  the\r\n\r\nBill   has   any  reference  been  made   to   the\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of  the  interest  of  the  timber\r\n\r\ngraders in the proposed Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it would not be practical for the proposed\r\n\r\nBoard  itself  to  employ all the  timber  graders\r\n\r\nrequired in the timber industry in Singapore, most\r\n\r\nof  the graders would be and are, in fact, in  the\r\n\r\nservice   of   the  timber  exporters,  suppliers,\r\n\r\npackers or manufacturers themselves. As such,  the\r\n\r\ntimber  graders represent a vital group of persons\r\n\r\nin  the  timber  industry who  can  make  positive\r\n\r\ncontributions towards the further improvement  and\r\n\r\nrationalisation of the timber industry. But at the\r\n\r\nsame  time they also constitute a body of  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are extremely vulnerable to any conflict that\r\n\r\nmay  arise between the interest of their employers\r\n\r\nand  the  objective  of the proposed  Board.  Many\r\n\r\ntimber  graders  are  members  of  a  trade  union\r\n\r\naffiliated  to the National Trades Union  Congress\r\n\r\nfor  their  own  protection.  Under  the  Bill  it\r\n\r\nappears   that   whatever   scant   trade    union\r\n\r\nrecognition  or protection the timber graders  may\r\n\r\npresently have would not be given expression to in\r\n\r\nthe proposed Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the hon. Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance would be able to give an assurance that  a\r\n\r\nmember  would be appointed under clause 4 (1)  (a)\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  to  represent  the  timber  graders\r\n\r\nindirectly  through  the NTUC  or,  alternatively,\r\n\r\nsince there are provisions for five members to  be\r\n\r\nappointed under clause 4 (1) (b), to list the NTUC\r\n\r\nas  the fifth recognised association in the Second\r\n\r\nSchedule to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that important\r\n\r\nchanges  have been made by this Bill which,  among\r\n\r\nother things, repeals the existing legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak on the question of timber\r\n\r\ngrading in Singapore. In the past, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned, timber grading was  based  on  the\r\n\r\ncriteria  set down in Malaysia. Sources of  timber\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  are diversified.

Sir,  some\r\n\r\nsawmillers  have made representations to  me  that\r\n\r\ntimber  and logs from Malaysia and Indonesia  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  criteria for grading. As a  result,  if\r\n\r\nour  local timber graders are to grade the  timber\r\n\r\nfrom Indonesia according to the criteria laid down\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia, there will be difficulties.
