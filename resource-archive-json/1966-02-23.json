The issue was first brought  to  public\r\n\r\nattention by a public statement made by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Malaysia on 17th February,  when  he\r\n\r\ndescribed how he was taken aback by what he termed\r\n\r\nthe sudden demand by the Singapore Government that\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  battalion should vacate  the  camp\r\n\r\nthat  they had been occupying. This came,  in  the\r\n\r\nwords of the Tengku, as a bolt from the blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, quite some time before the Tengku's\r\n\r\npublic  statement, events had already been set  in\r\n\r\nmotion.  The first step was taken by the Malaysian\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Defence.  In  a  letter  dated   4th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1966, i.e, nearly two weeks before  the\r\n\r\nTengku's   public  statement,  the  Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Malaysia and Minister of Defence wrote\r\n\r\nto   me   proposing  that  a  Malaysian   infantry\r\n\r\nbattalion  remains stationed in the  island.  This\r\n\r\nparticular  battalion had been  in  occupation  of\r\n\r\nCamp  Temasek, following upon the posting  of  the\r\n\r\n2nd  Battalion,  Singapore Infantry  Regiment,  to\r\n\r\ndefence duties in Sabah. In February the battalion\r\n\r\nhad  completed its tour of duty and was  scheduled\r\n\r\nto  return  to  its  own camp by  stages.  Advance\r\n\r\nparties  of  the battalion had already arrived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and were in occupation of Camp  Temasek\r\n\r\nto  prepare  for the arrival of the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nbattalion.   At  the  same  time,  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nbattalion in Camp Temasek was scheduled to move to\r\n\r\nanother  battalion  camp in  Tapah  and,  in  like\r\n\r\nmanner,  advance  parties of  this  battalion  had\r\n\r\nmoved to Tapah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request of the Malaysian Defence Minister was\r\n\r\ntherefore  an  unexpected move not  in  conformity\r\n\r\nwith the schedule of rotation of troops previously\r\n\r\nlaid  down.  It  constituted an obvious  departure\r\n\r\nfrom policy. I replied on the 9th February stating\r\n\r\nthat the question\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the continued presence of a Malaysian infantry\r\n\r\nbattalion  in Singapore was something that  should\r\n\r\nbe discussed as a separate issue. In the meantime,\r\n\r\nit was urgent that the Malaysian battalion vacates\r\n\r\nCamp   Temasek  to  allow  units  of  the   Second\r\n\r\nBattalion  of the Singapore Infantry  Regiment  to\r\n\r\nreturn to their camp since they had been living in\r\n\r\nvery difficult conditions in the jungles of Borneo\r\n\r\nfor the past six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Tengku's statement, there has been\r\n\r\npublic controversy as to the respective rights  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  Governments  under  the  separation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  agreement in respect of  stationing  of\r\n\r\ntroops. The Ministry of Defence, Malaysia, claimed\r\n\r\nthat  \"it  is  obligatory  on  the  part  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to allow Malaysian troops  to\r\n\r\nstay  in  the  present bases or, if  they  require\r\n\r\nthese  bases  for  their own  troops,  to  provide\r\n\r\nsuitable alternative accommodation.\" Article V (3)\r\n\r\nof  the Independence of Singapore Agreement, 1965,\r\n\r\nwas invoked in support of this claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government had made it clear in a\r\n\r\nstatement on 18th February that it does not accept\r\n\r\nthis  interpretation  of  the  agreement  on   two\r\n\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Article V stipulates that the two\r\n\r\nGovernments  will enter into a treaty of  external\r\n\r\ndefence  and  mutual  assistance  to  provide  for\r\n\r\nmatters set out in four separate sections. The two\r\n\r\nGovernments have not as yet entered into any  such\r\n\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when such a defence treaty is agreed and\r\n\r\nsigned,  it  will  provide,  in  accordance   with\r\n\r\nparagraph  (3) of Article V, that \"the  Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  will  afford to the  Government  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  the  right to continue to  maintain  the\r\n\r\nbases  and  other facilities used by its  military\r\n\r\nforces  within  Singapore  and  will  permit   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Malaysia to make such use  of  these\r\n\r\nbases and facilities as the Government of Malaysia\r\n\r\nmay consider necessary for the purpose of external\r\n\r\ndefence\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operative words are \"right to continue\" bases\r\n\r\nand   facilities  \"used\"  by  Malaysia's  military\r\n\r\nforces.  Camp Temasek was not \"used\" by Malaysia's\r\n\r\nmilitary  forces  on the date  of  the  separation\r\n\r\nagreement - 7th August,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1965, or the date of separation, 9th August, 1965.\r\n\r\nBy  section  9  of  the Constitution  of  Malaysia\r\n\r\n(Singapore  Amendment) Act, 1965,  passed  by  the\r\n\r\nParliament of Malaysia, all property which  before\r\n\r\nMalaysia   belonged  to  Singapore  reverted   to\r\n\r\nSingapore once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offered to submit the issue to arbitration by\r\n\r\nan   independent  Commonwealth  or   international\r\n\r\ntribunal  as a means of resolving the disagreement\r\n\r\nas  to the interpretation of the Agreement. Up  to\r\n\r\nnow,  this  offer  has not been  accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence,\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  issued  a  public  statement  on   21st\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1966. In one respect, the statement  was\r\n\r\nre-assuring  in  that the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nstated that his Government accepted the fact  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is an independent and sovereign  State.\r\n\r\nHe  also stated that the Malaysian Government  had\r\n\r\nnever  maintained the right to station  troops  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  without  regard to  the  agreement  and\r\n\r\nwithout  the  consent of the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\nSo far so good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he went on to say that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  had agreed to the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\nstationing  their  troops in Singapore  under  the\r\n\r\nseparation  agreement. He also stated  that  under\r\n\r\nthe separation agreement Singapore had agreed that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  shall be responsible for the defence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that the two Governments\r\n\r\nshould  be  in no doubt as to what the  separation\r\n\r\nagreement  provides  for  and  what  it  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide for. Nowhere does the separation agreement\r\n\r\nstate  that  Singapore  has agreed  that  Malaysia\r\n\r\nshall be responsible for the defence of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf   the  Malaysian  Parliamentary  Secretary  had\r\n\r\nconsulted his own Attorney-General, he would never\r\n\r\nhave  made a statement like this. The second point\r\n\r\nis  that  the  agreement in respect of  bases  and\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  Singapore, as we  have  repeatedly\r\n\r\npointed  out,  is  limited  to  those  bases   and\r\n\r\nfacilities used by the Malaysians on the island at\r\n\r\nthe   time  of  separation.  The  right   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Malaysia is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  right to continue to maintain these bases and\r\n\r\nto  make  such  use  of these bases  as  they  may\r\n\r\nconsider  necessary for the purpose of  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nexternal defence. It does not extend to the  right\r\n\r\nto  occupy new bases with new troops. Here  again,\r\n\r\nif  the  Malaysian Government disagrees  with  our\r\n\r\ninterpretation,  the matter can  quite  easily  be\r\n\r\nresolved    by   reference   to   an   independent\r\n\r\ninternational tribunal, whose decision  should  be\r\n\r\naccepted as binding on both Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, for a moment, move away from the\r\n\r\nconstitutional and legal aspects of  this  matter.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two points to which attention  may  be\r\n\r\ndrawn.  The  first  is the obvious  one  that  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Battalion of the S.I.R., having  served  a\r\n\r\ngruelling campaign in the jungles of Sabah in  the\r\n\r\ndefence   of   Malaysia,  surely  deserve   better\r\n\r\ntreatment  on  their return to Singapore  than  to\r\n\r\nfind   that  their  camp  has  been  occupied   by\r\n\r\nMalaysian troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation is that a disagreement of\r\n\r\nsuch a nature could have arisen in the way it  did\r\n\r\nis   symptomatic  of  a  deeper  malaise  in   the\r\n\r\nrelations  between the two Governments on  defence\r\n\r\nmatters.  This  issue  is  but  one  of  the  many\r\n\r\noutstanding issues which had arisen between us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to overburden the House with the\r\n\r\nminutiae of the many points of unresolved disputes\r\n\r\narising  between  the  Ministries  of  Defence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and Kuala Lumpur, but an outline of some\r\n\r\nof the matters may be illuminating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Battalion, S.I.R., has not only been\r\n\r\ndeprived  of its camp accommodation, but  also  of\r\n\r\nthe  greater  part of its Battalion  transport.  A\r\n\r\nsearch  party  is  now in Batu  Gajah  to  try  to\r\n\r\ncollect the Battalion's transport which has  found\r\n\r\nits  way  there.  So far their efforts  to  locate\r\n\r\ntheir trucks, jeeps, landrovers and other vehicles\r\n\r\nhave  met  with only limited success. Nor  is  the\r\n\r\nFirst   Battalion  of  the  S.I.R. in  a   better\r\n\r\nposition.  Much  of its transport had  been  taken\r\n\r\nover  by  the  Fourth Malaysian  Infantry  Brigade\r\n\r\nHeadquarters during the time when Singapore was in\r\n\r\nMalaysia. In spite of repeated requests  over  the\r\n\r\nlast four or five months for the return of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe transport to the First Battalion, S.I.R., both\r\n\r\nthe  trucks and the drivers still remain with  the\r\n\r\nFourth  Malaysian Infantry Brigade,  who  maintain\r\n\r\nthat  until  they receive instructions from  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur, they are unable to make any move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Singapore Day, there were large numbers of\r\n\r\nSingapore  army personnel, some three  hundred  in\r\n\r\nnumber,  posted in various units of the  Malaysian\r\n\r\narmy.  Similarly,  there  are  large  numbers   of\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizens in the Singapore army. Attempts\r\n\r\nto  have  this matter sorted out so that  citizens\r\n\r\nmay  return to their own armies, have so far  made\r\n\r\nvery  little headway. However, a message has  been\r\n\r\nreceived  from Kuala Lumpur recently that suggests\r\n\r\nthat  there is hope that this vexatious issue will\r\n\r\nbe settled shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the army transport and camp\r\n\r\naccommodation taken over by Malaysian units, but a\r\n\r\nlarge  part of our signals equipment and personnel\r\n\r\nhave  also been taken over by them. There  are  60\r\n\r\nofficers  and  men of the Singapore  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nposted  to the Fourth Malaysian Infantry  Brigade.\r\n\r\nIt  was  agreed in November last year  that  these\r\n\r\nofficers and men and their equipment should return\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  units in a phased  programme.  Here\r\n\r\nagain, no progress has been made to carry out this\r\n\r\nphased   programme,  with  the  result  that   the\r\n\r\noperational   efficiency  of  our  Battalions   in\r\n\r\ncarrying   out  internal  security  functions   is\r\n\r\nreduced.  Again,  armoured  cars,  equipment   and\r\n\r\npersonnel  belonging  to Singapore  were  attached\r\n\r\nduring   Malaysia   to   the   Federation    First\r\n\r\nIndependent  Reconnaisance Regiment  and  all  our\r\n\r\nattempts  to  unscramble this  have  met  with  no\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards our Navy, the story is even more\r\n\r\nextraordinary. Before we joined Malaysia, we had a\r\n\r\nnaval ship, the renowned \"Panglima\". This ship has\r\n\r\ndisappeared under Malaysian Command, and  attempts\r\n\r\neven  to  find its location have not met with  any\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where do we go from here? It is important\r\n\r\nthat  we  should never lose grasp  of  the  proper\r\n\r\nperspective  of  the fundamentals of  our  defence\r\n\r\npolicy. Both Malaysia and Singapore do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  adequate defence forces at their command  to\r\n\r\ndeter aggression from their larger neighbours, nor\r\n\r\nare  they able successfully to fend off any  major\r\n\r\nassault  that may be mounted upon us. So for  some\r\n\r\ntime,  until  our defence forces are substantially\r\n\r\nincreased, we shall have to depend on the military\r\n\r\nshield  provided by our Commonwealth  Allies.  But\r\n\r\nour Commonwealth Allies will be willing to provide\r\n\r\nus  with  this  shield only  if  they  find  their\r\n\r\ninternational political position a tenable one and\r\n\r\nthe domestic scene stable enough for their defence\r\n\r\neffort  to  be  effective. If the  Governments  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaysia are unable effectively  to\r\n\r\nco-operate  in their common defence  effort,  this\r\n\r\nmust in turn adversely affect the efficacy of  the\r\n\r\ndefence  arrangements with Britain, Australia  and\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand who are expending large sums of money\r\n\r\nand men in retaining their military commitments in\r\n\r\nthis  region. So co-operate we must, but this  co-operation must be as between two sovereign  States\r\n\r\nand not as between big brother and his satellite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary that the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment should revise its attitude towards  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Government   in   defence    matters.\r\n\r\nPeremptory  requests, stone-walling and  obviously\r\n\r\ndilatory  and  evasive  tactics  in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nlegitimate requests and enquiries from us can only\r\n\r\nlead  to increasing exasperation. If the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment is prepared to accept Singapore both in\r\n\r\nword  and  in  deed  as an equal  partner  in  the\r\n\r\ndefence arrangements of the whole region,  then  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see that there is any problem that cannot\r\n\r\nbe resolved to our mutual satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\nwere to insist on having its own way regardless of\r\n\r\nthe  legality of its actions in international law,\r\n\r\nthen   the   whole   issue  will   acquire   wider\r\n\r\nimplications   and   it  may   eventually   become\r\n\r\nnecessary for us, in order to have our sovereignty\r\n\r\nin these matters recognised and respected, to have\r\n\r\nrecourse to appropriate international tribunals. I\r\n\r\nam  certain  that  it is not  the  desire  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government to bring matters to  such  a\r\n\r\npass,  and that they are as prepared as we are  to\r\n\r\narrive at a mutually satisfactory solution of  all\r\n\r\noutstanding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissues.

Now, under Article V,  there\r\n\r\nare  four sections. I think I had better read  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Article V because this is the one  that\r\n\r\ndeals with Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Article V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties hereto will enter into a treaty on\r\n\r\nexternal  defence and mutual assistance  providing\r\n\r\nthat -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the parties hereto will establish a joint\r\n\r\ndefence  council  for purposes  of  external\r\n\r\ndefence and mutual assistance;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the Government of Malaysia will afford to\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Singapore such assistance\r\n\r\nas may be considered reasonable and adequate\r\n\r\nfor  external  defence, and in consideration\r\n\r\nthereof  the  Government of  Singapore  will\r\n\r\ncontribute  from its own armed  forces  such\r\n\r\nunits   thereof   as   may   be   considered\r\n\r\nreasonable and adequate for such defence;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the Government of Singapore will afford to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of Malaysia  the  right  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  and maintain the bases  and  other\r\n\r\nfacilities  used  by  its  military   forces\r\n\r\nwithin   Singapore  and  will   permit   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Malaysia to make such  use  of\r\n\r\nthese bases and facilities as the Government\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia may consider necessary for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of external defence;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) each party will undertake not to enter into\r\n\r\nany  treaty  or  agreement  with  a  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry  which  may  be detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\nindependence and defence of the territory of\r\n\r\nthe other party.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  paragraph  (3)  of Article  V  is  the  most\r\n\r\nrelevant  one. Under this the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\nwill  have the right to continue and maintain  its\r\n\r\nbases.  The  Malaysian Government does maintain  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  bases  and military establishments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For instance, the main naval  base  of\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Navy is in Woodlands,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   is,   in   Singapore,  and  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment,  therefore, has the right to  continue\r\n\r\nto  maintain  this  base and use  it  in  whatever\r\n\r\nmanner   it  thinks  necessary  for  the  external\r\n\r\ndefence  of Malaysia. Similarly, there  are  other\r\n\r\nunits with which I need not burden the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I am making is that this agreement\r\n\r\nextends the right to the Government of Malaysia to\r\n\r\nuse  these bases and not to establish new ones  or\r\n\r\noccupy  them  with new troops. It is  not,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  correct for the Malaysian Government  to\r\n\r\ninvoke  this  particular Article  to  support  the\r\n\r\ncontinued stay of the Malaysian Infantry Battalion\r\n\r\nin  Camp  Temasek. Should it want to  station  its\r\n\r\nbattalion  here for whatever purposes  it  has  in\r\n\r\nmind,  this  is  something  which  we  are  always\r\n\r\nwilling  to discuss with it and reach an  amicable\r\n\r\nsettlement.

I have my own reason for wanting Malaysian\r\n\r\ntroops  to  go away, but quite a lot of people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  want  to know the reasons  why  we  are\r\n\r\nasking Malaysian troops to leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The presence of troops from\r\n\r\nother  countries  in  Singapore  is  regulated  by\r\n\r\ndefence  treaty, defence agreement and such  types\r\n\r\nof  legal  document.  So far as  British  military\r\n\r\nforces  are concerned, their position is  governed\r\n\r\nby  Article 13 or clause 13 of the Bill  to  amend\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution of Malaysia which was passed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian Parliament. This provided  for  the\r\n\r\ncontinuation of treaties, agreements,  conventions\r\n\r\nentered   into  before  separation   between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Malaysia and other  countries.  In\r\n\r\nother   words,   until  they  are  expressly   re-negotiated, then they continue to remain in force.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  defence  agreement  between   the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Government  and  the  British  Government\r\n\r\ngoverning   British  troops  in  this  area   will\r\n\r\ncontinue in force until it is re-negotiated by us,\r\n\r\npresumably some time this year. So the position of\r\n\r\nthe British Army, Air Force and Navy is sanctioned\r\n\r\nunder this agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Malaysian troops, although we have\r\n\r\nnot  entered  into  a treaty on  external  defence\r\n\r\nprovided   for  in  Article  V, and,   therefore,\r\n\r\nstrictly speaking, none of them have any right  to\r\n\r\nbe  here, nevertheless, it was agreed that such  a\r\n\r\ntreaty  would be entered into to provide  for  the\r\n\r\npresence  of some of their troops and the  use  of\r\n\r\nsome  of the bases. So those units and those bases\r\n\r\nwhich  come within the ambit of Article V (3)  are\r\n\r\nhere  quite  correctly; that is, it is within  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional rights of both Governments to allow\r\n\r\nthe continued presence of such troops. The point I\r\n\r\nwas  making  is  that  this  particular  Battalion\r\n\r\nstaying  in  this particular camp  does  not  come\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of Article V (3) or any other\r\n\r\narticle of the separation agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>IMMIGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration (Amendment) Bill, 1965, seeks to\r\n\r\namend   certain   provisions  of   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nImmigration Ordinance (No. 12 of 1959) to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  control  of immigration  with  power  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  the presence of a person in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  unlawful  when such a person fails  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith the conditions stipulated in the entry permit\r\n\r\nissued  to  him.
