According to a news article in the BBC, independent\r\nthink tank Demos observed that many young people did not know how\r\nto navigate the vast information available on the Internet.

I agree with the President that diversity\r\nin society is a good thing. Since the early 1990s, we have encouraged\r\ndiversity. Mr George Yeo, then Acting Minister for Information and\r\nthe Arts, had spoken about the need for the state and Government\r\nto recede its reach, to trim the branches of the banyan tree and\r\nallow society to flourish. That, I think, has seen significant transformation\r\nover the past 20 years, for our society has become more diverse\r\nand active citizenry can be said to be more vibrant, both in the\r\nreal and the virtual world. This diversity should be perceived and\r\nreceived positively, as Singaporeans have begun to take charge of\r\nwhat they are passionate about and many have naturally begun to\r\nsee Singapore more as a home for themselves and their families. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-09b0c2ff-425e-4267-9efd-e6a992317d1c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-09b0c2ff-425e-4267-9efd-e6a992317d1c\"><!--a--></a>For those who believe in their\r\nown political views, to the cats, dogs and dolphin lovers, the nature\r\nand heritage supporters, we see in Singapore, people who root themselves\r\nto causes they believe is right and passionate about.

Now, before we increase the Medisave contribution,\r\nlet us remember that the medical inflation rates ranged from 6%-8%\r\nover the last three years while the wage increase ranged from 2%-4%.\r\nClearly, the increase in the cost of healthcare is outstripping\r\nthat of the rate of increase in our salaries.

Where other public housing programmes\r\nhouse low-income population and often quickly reduce to slums, Singapore's\r\npublic housing programme houses about 80% of our population, with options\r\nfor low-income as well as high-income earners. Today, we proudly\r\nsay that Singapore boasts among the highest home owners figure in\r\nthe world. And this did not happen by chance. It happens because\r\nof a very conscious decision by the Government that people should\r\nown their homes and have a stake in this country.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9b3ecd57-7e41-40bd-8b7e-7d404f39c954\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-9b3ecd57-7e41-40bd-8b7e-7d404f39c954\"><!--a--></a>Home ownership also promotes\r\na certain sense of belonging in the estate and encourages residents\r\nto look after their flats and their neighbourhood.

If demand was constant and\r\npredictable, I do not think there will be an issue. HDB will be\r\nable to plan the number and the types of flats to build enough to\r\nsatisfy all the flat buyers. But demand has not been predictable for\r\nmany, many reasons \u2212 a poor and volatile economy, fewer marriages\r\nand new family units, and sometimes even the fear of a \"Tiger\" year\r\nbaby. So it seems to me that rather than trying to predict demand,\r\nHDB sought to deal with this by building to order. A very great\r\nidea because flats would be built when there were buyers for them\r\nand buyers would know when their flats would be delivered to them.\r\nThis would allow them to plan, save money for payments, renovations,\r\nfurniture and get on with the business of raising a family. And\r\nyet, Sir, there are people who are very dissatisfied with this solution.\r\nSome say that they cannot get a flat that they like. Others say\r\nthat they wait too long. Yet, others say that the location is no\r\ngood \u2013 too far from the amenities, too far from their parents. I\r\nam sure these are all valid complaints. But I cannot see how HDB\r\ncan address all of them, except perhaps by building flats faster\r\nwithout putting too much pressure on construction resources and\r\nputting all the necessary amenities in place at the same time. If\r\nnewer flats have all the necessary amenities and good public transport,\r\nI believe flat buyers in newer flats will have less cause for concern.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2a9d0055-c784-4564-acbe-3502d8859ab2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-2a9d0055-c784-4564-acbe-3502d8859ab2\"><!--a--></a>I recognise that some of the\r\nbusinesses that offered amenities may not be economically viable\r\nin the first instance because new flats only slowly build up their population\r\nand their clientele for the businesses. But this is something that\r\ncreative support from Government can overcome, whether through reduced\r\nrental, small business financing schemes or manpower cost subsidies.\r\nI believe that if we want to tackle these issues, we should take\r\nthe concerns of home buyers as legitimate throughout our preconceived\r\nnotions and start with a fresh look for solutions.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-302ab47f-dd86-45fc-9e31-cca85c8d2c68\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-302ab47f-dd86-45fc-9e31-cca85c8d2c68\"><!--a--></a>The next thing, Sir, is the\r\nissue of cost. There is no lack of feedback that cost of housing,\r\nincluding public housing, is too high. One resident quipped to me\r\nthat most Singaporeans are working for the HDB. He explained that\r\nmany of us take a whole working lifetime to pay off our mortgage\r\nfor our flat. After we have done so, we are left with little savings\r\nfor our retirement and, heaven forbid, if our family members are\r\nfaced with major illnesses and the expenses related to that. Looking\r\nback, as a Government that encourages home ownership, we cannot\r\nabsolve ourselves of the responsibility of acceding to the deep\r\ndesire among Singaporeans to own property. As I understand, from\r\nthe feedback from the residents, there are at least two sides to\r\nthe concern about the high cost of public housing. Clearly, those\r\nwho aspire to buy their flats, even new flats, and after the subsidies\r\nthat HDB offers, are concerned that they will be saddled with a\r\nlarge mortgage. A large chunk of their income will go towards paying\r\nfor their flats and this is not an unreasonable concern. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a9555666-2d4f-46f1-a938-ba378718e816\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a9555666-2d4f-46f1-a938-ba378718e816\"><!--a--></a>I look at the HDB Annual Report\r\nof 2009/2010 and the prices of flats that were offered ranged from\r\n$72,000 for a 2-room flat in Bukit Panjang to $409,000 for a 5-room\r\nflat in Punggol. Former Minister for National Development, Mr Mah\r\nBow Tan, in his article in <em class=\"ph i\">TODAY</em> newspaper in November 2010\r\ndealt with this issue of whether HDB flats were affordable. Using\r\nthe concept of debt service ratio, Mr Mah said that for a new HDB\r\nflat in non-mature estates and for a 30-year loan, the debt service\r\nratio was an average of 20%. This means that, for me, when I buy\r\nan HDB flat, 20 cents of every dollar I earn goes towards paying\r\nfor my flat. Sir, no wonder my resident told me that we all worked\r\nfor HDB. Granted that this ratio is lower, according to Mr Mah,\r\nthan the international benchmark of 30% to 35% for affordable expenditure\r\non housing, but let us also consider that unlike other countries,\r\na large chunk of Singapore's income is also spent on transport and\r\neducation. After all the other expenses, it is no surprise that\r\nmany Singaporeans live from pay cheque to pay cheque.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 72</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a92d66d4-ec58-4ae5-9e4c-6ad1cb2af568\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a92d66d4-ec58-4ae5-9e4c-6ad1cb2af568\"><!--a--></a>The other side of the issue\r\nis that no one seems to be able to tell me how much actually does\r\nan HDB flat cost. Since our private sector construction companies\r\nbuild our flats, I suppose we could look at their tender price for\r\na clue to what the construction cost is. I am sure there must be\r\nother costs, including cost of land. Now, if we think about it, should\r\nland cost be included in the price of HDB flat, some may ask. I\r\nagree that we have to impute the cost for the use of land to build\r\nflats, but what would be the basis? I do not think this question\r\nhas been adequately debated. Having promised home ownership for all,\r\nthe Government must do its utmost to fulfil it. If a quarter of\r\nour income is used to finance our home, where would our savings\r\nfor retirement come from? Is this the reason that many people hope\r\nto boost their savings by trading their biggest asset, that is,\r\ntheir home? Is that why many people buy their flats, take the so-called\r\nfirst bite of the cherry and then tempted at selling the flats five\r\nyears later for profit to invest in a retirement fund, and to attempt\r\na second bite of the cherry after that? Some may point to the Minimum\r\nSum Scheme and the CPF LIFE Scheme for retirement. But all of us\r\nknow that these will hardly be adequate and other sources of income\r\nare also needed. Of course, Sir, we could all keep working until\r\na ripe old age, but we all know the challenges older workers face\r\ntoo.

No doubt, HDB works hard with them to reschedule their instalment\r\narrears but, in some cases, regardless of what is done, some residents\r\nsimply are not able to pay. The reasons are many \u2013 unemployment,\r\nprolonged sickness, unstable families, prison, and the like.

I am sure many will say that this group of residents\r\nput themselves into the situation and have themselves to be blamed.\r\nI would say that we all share the blame. Let me explain. In the\r\nfirst place, why should we encourage people who simply cannot afford\r\nto buy a flat to aspire towards home ownership? I personally have seen\r\na scenario where a resident defaults on his housing instalments,\r\nhas his flat sold or repossessed. He is put in an interim housing\r\nfor a period and then he is encouraged to again buy another flat.\r\nI think we cannot see residents as simply statistics or numbers, to\r\nbe channelled from one place to another. I think the Government\r\nmust think of a longer term sustainable solution for this group.\r\nPerhaps, HDB can think of expanding this rental scheme and work\r\nout meaningful subsidy scheme so that families can live together\r\nsafely, children can have a conducive environment to study and play\r\nand, over time, hold up hope that they can improve their lives and\r\nbreak out from the poverty cycle. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-17995df9-c875-413e-ac6f-e553c5f0f5b5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-17995df9-c875-413e-ac6f-e553c5f0f5b5\"><!--a--></a>In addition to setting maximum\r\nincome ceilings on purchase of new 3-room flats, as it does now,\r\nHDB might consider restricting the resale of 3-room flats to only\r\nlow-income Singaporeans. HDB could consider being the sole agency\r\nthat sells and buys back 3-room flats at a price that is predetermined,\r\nfor example, at the original sale price plus the annual inflation\r\nrate, because these small flats are meant for low income as its original\r\nintent. In this way, the price of 3-room flats can be managed and\r\nlow-income families can aspire to own flats without undue burden\r\non their incomes. Once the price is controlled, we can also exclude\r\npeople who want to buy 3-room flats as an investment or for even\r\nspeculation. We have a duty to our residents, to understand their\r\nneeds, recognise their circumstances and offer solutions to improve\r\ntheir lives, as we have said in the speech, and not to put them\r\nin situations where they end up worse than they were before.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5eae0fdc-e8f0-4f5a-a3af-64331f6d9acf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-5eae0fdc-e8f0-4f5a-a3af-64331f6d9acf\"><!--a--></a>Still on the subject of housing,\r\nwe should also recognise that the home is more than just some bricks\r\nand tiles.

While I received\r\nwarm reception from many, there were also those who told me quite\r\nopenly they did not support \"my party\". When I asked them for more\r\ndetails, some of them expressed the angst that Mr Zainudin Nordin\r\nexpressed earlier; others also explained to me that it was because\r\nthey felt that our Party no longer cares for ordinary Singaporeans.\r\nThis was a little hurtful for me and also for many of the volunteers\r\nwho were assisting me at that time. For the volunteers, they get\r\nnothing in this except the gratitude of serving people. So, in that\r\nsense, I think the President's first message, to make life better\r\nfor all Singaporeans, is an important one, and one that I am sure\r\nwill be supported by all.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2132409d-b8ec-4d7e-bdf0-2b600ee0fa4a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-2132409d-b8ec-4d7e-bdf0-2b600ee0fa4a\"><!--a--></a>I would like to make two points\r\non this goal. The first is in trying to make life better for all\r\nSingaporeans, I think it is important to build a consensus first.\r\nThere is an old Tamil proverb by a wise old lady named Avvaiyar\r\nthat goes like this \u0b95\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bb3\u0bb5\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b89\u0bb2\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bb5\u0bc1. Now, that translates into saying that the sum\r\nof your knowledge can be captured in the palm of a hand, whereas\r\nthe things you do not know is the size of the world. Essentially,\r\nwhat that means is that when we approach people to build this consensus,\r\nwe have to approach it with an open mind. We have to be prepared\r\nto learn as well. So, if our opinions are different, we have to\r\nchange those opinions. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ed36eb40-ccf8-4167-95c0-ed1413fc5fcf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-ed36eb40-ccf8-4167-95c0-ed1413fc5fcf\"><!--a--></a>One example of a policy that\r\nI think was seriously misunderstood was the decision to open the\r\ndoor to foreigners quite widely in the last few years. I think the\r\nreasoning for that was sound. It was to capture the economic growth\r\nin the wake of the global recession. But, unfortunately, I think\r\nthe way it played out was most Singaporeans did not really understand\r\nwhat all these foreigners were suddenly doing in our country. We just\r\nhad a recession the year before and at the same time we now see\r\na lot more foreigners in our trains, in our housing estates, perhaps\r\neven working with us. I think this added to some of the angst that\r\npeople were feeling. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 75</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1344f9c6-b2bd-4c64-bd39-96e72c2379b2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-1344f9c6-b2bd-4c64-bd39-96e72c2379b2\"><!--a--></a>For myself, I work in an international\r\nlaw firm, so I experience first-hand the jobs created by foreigners.\r\nI think people working in multi-national companies would probably\r\nshare the same experience too. But not everyone works with foreigners.\r\nOthers benefit indirectly from it, say, for example, the construction\r\nindustry which builds houses for every one of us. That industry\r\nis sustained largely also by foreigners. So, broadly speaking, foreigners\r\ndo play an important role in our economy but I think it is necessary\r\nfor us to build a consensus on how many we need before opening the\r\ndoor. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bb43bba2-d766-43ed-a486-6875171978c0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-bb43bba2-d766-43ed-a486-6875171978c0\"><!--a--></a>Going forward, I think the\r\ndeclining birth rate, as was already mentioned, is a problem that\r\nwe all accept.

When the Berlin Wall came\r\ndown in the 1990s, there was a view that liberal democracy was the\r\nright way forward, and capitalism was the best way to govern. This\r\nwas also coupled with the fall of communism which was at that time\r\nthe only alternative. The last 20 years has seen the unleashing\r\nof global capitalism, but this also has some downsides. The first\r\nis the movement of capital to the lowest cost locations. Now, what\r\nthis means is that capital will always go to where the cost production\r\nis lowest. So, the First World, for example, that had the highest\r\nwages was also amongst the first to suffer as manufacturing and\r\nso on, moved to developing parts of the world. The First World,\r\nat the moment, has unemployment rates close to 10%, along with the\r\nlow cost jobs that have moved abroad, and there are no clear alternatives\r\nfor the people who are at the very bottom. The other effect of globalisation\r\nis at the very top. The companies in these countries have also become\r\nglobal corporations. And this has actually permitted the CEOs of\r\nthese companies to earn phenomenal salaries because they commanded\r\nmuch a larger corporation. But the impact this has created within\r\nthe countries is a tremendous divide in income. The lowest income\r\nworkers face unemployment at the worst or stagnating on low wages\r\nbecause they compete with low-wage workers in other countries. On\r\nthe other hand, the people at the top enjoy a tremendous amount\r\nof wealth because they are leveraging on everyone else.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3803de88-0975-4db8-9481-42d8bb6fbd48\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-3803de88-0975-4db8-9481-42d8bb6fbd48\"><!--a--></a>Singapore has not quite reached\r\nthat stage yet. But as we strive to get higher wages for all our\r\nworkers, we have to make sure that we do not fall into that trap\r\nbecause that is the direction that we are going into. Is there another\r\nway out? I do not have the answer at the moment but I think that\r\nis a problem that we have to be aware of as we move forward.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a8119a44-fdbb-47f6-8382-74ce2f696bc2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a8119a44-fdbb-47f6-8382-74ce2f696bc2\"><!--a--></a>The second issue that we face\r\nin the external environment is what I call a sea of money. Now,\r\na sea of money is a good thing except that it does not really wind\r\nup in the pockets of the people who need it most. In fact, what\r\nhas happened in a lot of the developed world is that in order to\r\nstimulate the economy, the Central Banks have kept interest rates\r\nat very low rates. This money has flowed not necessarily into their\r\nown economies but to other parts of the world. And while this has\r\nnot stimulated the economies, it has created rising prices all around.\r\nIn Singapore, we feel this too. Our young people are afraid of the\r\nrising price of buying a house; our old people are afraid that they\r\ndo not have enough for retirement and medical expenses. All around,\r\nI think we feel the prices of rising food and oil. But this is created\r\nby the fact that Central Banks around the world are printing money.\r\nOur own Singapore dollar is strong and that limits the effects somewhat,\r\nbut there is a limit to how much we can let the Singapore dollar rise\r\nas well because that would kill our manufacturing sector. So, again,\r\nthis is another complex problem we face. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 76</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ec92cf49-a5c4-456c-aa68-f74b3aec90c5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-ec92cf49-a5c4-456c-aa68-f74b3aec90c5\"><!--a--></a>The third issue \u2212 and this\r\nis something that came up in the last few months \u2212 is somewhat the\r\nreverse of the sea of money but it may co-exist, and that is, a\r\nrisk that capital may actually fly from Singapore. Over the past\r\nyear or so, the flight to quality had been to places like Asia but\r\nthe last one or two months when the financial markets crashed, what\r\nwe noticed was that some of the money was going back to US treasuries. Even\r\nthough the US government is in trouble, for some reason money always\r\ngoes back to its home base. Although the money that was coming out\r\nin the first place was from the developed world, it tends to run\r\nback there. Now, the issue we face when capital flight takes place\r\nis a little bit different. Capital flight would be similar to what\r\nhappened during the Asian economic crisis. In 1997, when economies\r\nin Asia started collapsing one after the other, capital ran away\r\nfrom Asia. And when capital ran away from Asia, Singapore faced\r\nits worst recession in history up to that point in time. I do not\r\nthink we are getting close to that scenario at the moment but that\r\nis a risk we have to bear in mind, at least on account of events\r\nthe last one or two months.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5a2bc910-4745-43b0-9b51-1170a51fce2e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-5a2bc910-4745-43b0-9b51-1170a51fce2e\"><!--a--></a>The fourth issue is what would\r\nhappen if there is a protracted crisis in the West and the developed\r\nworld. As we know it, during the last crisis in 2008, much of the\r\ndeveloped world managed to get its way out of the crisis because\r\ngovernments helped to bail out banks that were in trouble. They\r\ntook on the distressed debts. The trouble we face right now is that\r\nthe governments themselves are the ones in crisis. Fiscal policy,\r\nwhich was a tool that permitted governments to spend more than their\r\nbudget in times of crisis, is no longer available to any of these\r\ngovernments because they do not have the ability to run budget deficits\r\nany longer. The weakest economies, like Greece, are in danger of default,\r\nbut even the strongest economies like the US have faced credit downgrades\r\nand parts of their governments have shut down every now and then.\r\nSo, the reality is that the West seems to have protracted crisis\r\nand one of the tools that they used to get out of crisis in the\r\npast was fiscal policy, which is not available to them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-03f8bdef-7d61-4164-a6b6-12ad12c4db50\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-03f8bdef-7d61-4164-a6b6-12ad12c4db50\"><!--a--></a>The other tool that these\r\ncountries used to use in the past was what we call monetary policy,\r\nand that was to keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy.\r\nUnfortunately, this policy also seems to have reached its limits\r\nbecause interest rates have already been floored and yet the economy\r\ndoes not seem to be reviving. So, in a sense, the economic stimulus\r\nalmost seems to be at full force but the economies are still flagging.\r\nNow, a crisis in the West is not something that we should be celebrating\r\nor in any way be happy about because it would have profound impact\r\non the world. A lot of global demand comes from the West, a lot\r\nof our exports are going there.

In spite of its\r\nlimited land area and resources, and dependence on the world economy,\r\nSingapore attained remarkable achievements. Many describe this as\r\n\u20ac\u02dcThe Singapore Economic Miracle'. Since the 1997 Asian financial\r\ncrisis, global economic cycles have become shorter and shorter,\r\nto the extent that it experiences one cycle every three years. From September\r\n11 in 2008, to SARS, to economic recession, to the global food crisis,\r\nto the global financial crisis in 2009, in a span of 15 years, our\r\ncountry experienced the impact of an economic crisis every three\r\nyears. However, we were able to tide over these crises. This little\r\nred dot was able to race against the tide, not only was it able\r\nto stay afloat, it even emerged stronger. During this period, when\r\nthe unemployment rate of many countries had been on the rise, we\r\nwere able to sustain full employment with low jobless rate. In many\r\ncountries, real wages have stopped increasing. But with the tripartite partnership\r\nbetween the government, unions and employers, we were able to achieve wage\r\ngrowth. Although the increment is not great, we were still able\r\nto achieve real wage growth. We cannot take these achievements for\r\ngranted. Our \u20ac\u02dcmiracle' is, in fact, the result of our nation's stability,\r\nevery Singaporean's hard work and the spirit of working together\r\nto overcome difficulties. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e670bfd0-0a99-496a-b809-ff0aa7642fdb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-e670bfd0-0a99-496a-b809-ff0aa7642fdb\"><!--a--></a>Looking ahead, the challenges\r\nthat lie ahead are relentless.

The Ministry of Manpower can also consider tying\r\nthe application for work permit to the employment of older workers,\r\nto reduce employers' over-reliance on foreign labour. The Ministry\r\nof Manpower should also strengthen legal measures and impose harsher\r\npenalties for employment agencies and employers who are involved\r\nin exploitative practices when employing foreign workers, for example,\r\nreceiving kick-backs, giving loans to foreign workers, charging\r\nexorbitant agency fees and other unreasonable exploits.

A further\r\nimportant note in the quagmire of statistics is that of the 103,000 reported\r\njobs added back into the US economy, close to 50,000 were due to\r\nworkers returning from strike action, not new jobs at all. In essence,\r\nit was a recovery that was very much a non-event.

The unemployment situation in Singapore has remained\r\nstable, at about 2%. Our fundamentals remain strong and, amongst younger\r\nSingaporeans, our labour force participation rates remain stable\r\nat 89.4% for those aged 25 to 29, and 89% for those aged 30 to 34.\r\nHigher education amongst younger Singaporeans has also kept them\r\nmobile in the job market compared to their seniors. And a recent\r\ndevelopment is that a far larger proportion is now employed as PMEs.\r\nHowever, Sir, just as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, the Member for Ang Mo Kio\r\nGRC, had mentioned earlier, I have had the opportunity to hear from\r\nmany young workers, both from trade unions as well as from my residents\r\nin the constituency over the past few months. A common refrain has\r\nbeen concerns over the future of our economy as well as the stability\r\nof the job market. Although a significant proportion of our graduating students\r\nfrom polytechnics as well as universities continue to be able to\r\nfind suitable employment, a growing number is feeling the strain\r\nof both global competition as well as decreasing job security. A\r\nrecent straw poll of 200 young respondents showed that 70% did not\r\nthink that the world economy has recovered since 2009. A further\r\n50% were least optimistic when asked to project the economic performance\r\nof the world economy for 2012. During a recent focus group discussion,\r\na large proportion of time was spent discussing the challenges faced\r\nby young contract workers. Dismiss the current notion of contract\r\nwork as that of older workers or low-wage workers alone. Contract\r\nhire has been the norm in many western economies for PMEs as well.\r\nIn Singapore, this preference for contractors has only recently\r\nseen a rise in demand amongst employers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2f27f980-3f8a-499b-a2e2-7dfa6961ec42\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-2f27f980-3f8a-499b-a2e2-7dfa6961ec42\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, in a <em class=\"ph i\">Business\r\nTimes</em> article on 11 October 2011, the title read and I quote,\r\n\"contract workers become more attractive to MNCs\". The article alluded\r\nto the fact that more MNCs as well as local companies are beginning\r\nto hire staff on contract basis. Following the Lehman crisis, the\r\nlap to downsizing by many companies, including MNCs in Singapore,\r\na new trend has been to move towards the hiring of short-term contractors\r\nto shift headcount costs to become a variable rather than a fixed\r\ncost. This arrangement works well for some PMEs, young PMEs in particular,\r\nwho gain greater exposure and are able to explore more horizons\r\nin their early career. Flexibility is also an added bonus for them.\r\nHowever, the reality hits home for some, when rolling contracts\r\nmean that career progression and employment benefits are curtailed.\r\nWhile there are many enlightened employers, many young PMEs on contract\r\nfind themselves losing out to their peers on permanent employment\r\nin terms of job security as well as benefits.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-570147ff-622c-43af-90ee-7211e10405a9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-570147ff-622c-43af-90ee-7211e10405a9\"><!--a--></a>A working contract, in itself,\r\nis not evil. Many young workers thrive on it. The problem, frankly,\r\nbecomes finding the next job and putting yourself out there on the market.\r\nThe other issue, however, is the fairness of contracts as well as\r\nwhether young workers are aware of their contractual obligations\r\nas well as the type of contracts they have entered into. In our\r\nenthusiasm to start work, I believe that many of us, Sir, have plunged\r\ninto our first job with the eagerness of children in a sweet shop,\r\nonly to find that we have inadvertently ended up in a sweat shop\r\ninstead. While many employers provide their contractors with leave\r\nand even medical benefits comparable to permanent staff, these appear\r\nto be few and far between. Many young workers on contract continue\r\nto sacrifice employment benefits in looking for contract work and\r\nthis may lead to long-term issues. One young lady I spoke to was\r\ntroubled by how she would be treated by her employers should she\r\nsettle down and start a family. She was genuinely worried that her\r\ncontract would not be renewed, should she get pregnant and that\r\nher employer may still legitimately decide not to renew her contract.\r\nA young IT professional was equally worried about finding the next\r\nproject within the industry, with it becoming increasingly crowded\r\nout. Another felt that after two renewals, he seems to have lagged behind\r\nhis peers in career progression when compared to those on permanent employment.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 102</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0ce43801-0c01-419e-bd87-7dcc702f1996\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-0ce43801-0c01-419e-bd87-7dcc702f1996\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, these are\r\njust some of the many feedback that young workers have provided\r\nrecently and represents a microcosm of the bigger issues faced by\r\nthem.

This change\r\nrecognises the changing demography of our workforce with PMEs soon\r\nbecoming the rank-and-file of today. In fact, based on the labour\r\nforce survey by the Ministry of Manpower, the share of young PMETs\r\nin the age band of 25 to 29 has increased significantly from 55%\r\nin 1999 to 69% in 2009. Sir, it is in this vein that I sincerely\r\nurge the Ministry of Manpower to continue to look into the issue\r\nof contract work, especially the challenges it poses for young PMEs.\r\nI further urge the Ministry to consider a set of guidelines to ensure\r\nthat young workers in particular are not taken advantage of, should\r\nthey be in contract hires and to expand the information base contained\r\nwithin MOM's Career Compass initiative.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b1f32574-c3e6-4215-8bfc-b24eff150281\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b1f32574-c3e6-4215-8bfc-b24eff150281\"><!--a--></a>Unlike in many countries,\r\nyouth employment in Singapore is decidedly optimistic.

In the immediate post-Cold War decades where many countries\r\nwere still pursuing import substitution, and when we have lost our\r\nhinterland, we chose the path of export-led growth.

First, on tripartism. Tripartism has brought industrial\r\npeace and economic progress to Singapore and Singaporeans have benefited\r\nand this is not automatic. The tripartite partners understood the\r\nbasic truths that if investors, whether local or foreign, have to\r\nworry constantly whether their businesses in Singapore would be\r\ndisrupted or their factories burned down, they will go elsewhere.\r\nAnd if they go, the jobs go. We also knew that if workers of any\r\nsegment feel that they have been pushed into a corner with little\r\nfairness and no prospect, then it is a time bomb that must eventually\r\nexplode. Our tripartism is, therefore, constructed upon a clear-eyed understanding\r\nof the realities and the need to find a mechanism and an enduring\r\nset of trustworthy relations to achieve stable, win-win outcomes\r\nover an extended period.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 106</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-00507d5f-4a23-4671-b9b7-24a88cd492d3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-00507d5f-4a23-4671-b9b7-24a88cd492d3\"><!--a--></a>Tripartism has served us\r\nwell. In good times, it has given us the platform to agree on productivity\r\nand competitiveness improvement and gain-sharing. In bad times,\r\nit has granted us the responsiveness and agility to act quickly\r\nand decisively to minimise the pain for workers and for companies.\r\nWhat we have achieved in real outcomes is admired by many in the\r\ninternational community. For example, many countries knew of our\r\nJobs Credit and SPUR programmes. They knew the logic of these arrangements\r\nand they also knew that their countrymen and companies would have\r\nbenefited if similar actions were taken in their case. But the fact\r\nwas that they could not get their social partners to come together\r\nto work for the collective good nor did they have the resources\r\nto do so because their countries were mired in debt. As a result,\r\nwhile Singapore came through the storm with relatively lower retrenchment\r\nfigures and a low unemployment rate, many OECD countries were stuck\r\nwith unemployment ranging from 5%-10% and youth unemployment ranging\r\nfrom 20%-45%. This is but one of the many examples of how Singapore's\r\ntripartism has quietly but surely given us a competitive advantage\r\nand a refuge through the decades.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e25a9e16-4937-4e0e-afc7-d65c9ec3ff6d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-e25a9e16-4937-4e0e-afc7-d65c9ec3ff6d\"><!--a--></a> Yet there are those who\r\nmight doubt the authenticity of our tripartism. They say that it\r\nis too quietly done. They do not know what is going on and they\r\nwant to see more of what is actually happening. I spoke recently\r\nto a group of senior civil servants on this subject. I said that\r\nperhaps a traditional approach of our tripartism was like a three-in-one\r\ncoffee mix. It is good coffee, premixed for quick use and convenience.\r\nBut I observe that in today's context many people buy expensive\r\ncoffee machines. You stick a capsule of beans into the machine and\r\nyou press the button and you hear this grinding sound that the machine\r\nmakes as it works on the beans and then out comes the coffee, and then\r\nyou say, \"Ah, this coffee is fresh and good.\" So, I think that there\r\nis a need for tripartism to also adapt to the changing mindset and\r\nexpectation. It is fine for the social partners to share more of\r\nhow each one thinks and what feedback its respective constituencies\r\nare giving. But let us be clear that the quality of the coffee lies\r\nnot in how much grind you hear but in the quality of the bean and\r\nthe mix. Never let our tripartism go the way of that in many other\r\ncountries, bogged down by players' incessant bickering, posturing\r\nwhile the common people suffer and see their jobs evaporate. Mistaking\r\none for the other is to mistake heat for light, form for substance\r\nand rhetoric for solution.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-38c4a173-cd13-4172-a087-b2952ecdbc48\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-38c4a173-cd13-4172-a087-b2952ecdbc48\"><!--a--></a>Sir, next, I would like\r\nto speak on social capital, in particular on the Wellness programme.\r\nI spoke earlier of the boldness and insight of going into export-led\r\ngrowth, unafraid of going against the trend of the world at that\r\npoint because we knew ourselves well. We also knew where we needed\r\nto head. That was certainly not the only example. Changi Airport,\r\nJurong Island, our MRT system, even the 3G SAF. These are strategic decisions\r\nthat do not come by just looking at existing data and options and\r\ndoing number crunching. These game-changing decisions do not just\r\noptimise for more efficiency. They do not even just innovate on\r\nwhat already exist. They create a new reality and for that they\r\nrequire insight, foresight and gumption, in short, strong leadership.\r\nWe must continue to have the courage to invest ahead in infrastructure,\r\nin capability and capacity to address the emerging needs of society\r\nproactively. This will help Singapore find ways to punch above our\r\nweight and avoid drifting willy-nilly into the league of the \"no\r\ndifferent from other nations\" or worse still, into the company of countries\r\nthat are constantly fire-fighting to fix problems but with decreasing\r\nsuccess.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 107</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d96b4597-f04d-49ad-a28c-57390a9b9aa3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-d96b4597-f04d-49ad-a28c-57390a9b9aa3\"><!--a--></a> A key investment that Singapore\r\nmust make is into our ageing population and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin has\r\nspoken a lot about that just now.

Knowing this, we\r\nmust create a Singapore that embraces advancing years with a positive\r\nattitude so that Singaporeans may live long, live well and live\r\nwith peace of mind. For that to happen, we have to alter stereotypes\r\nand restructure society and institutions to reflect this new reality.\r\nWe must create the conditions and opportunities for our seniors\r\nto be healthy, to be happy and to be active. The Wellness programme\r\nis a strategic investment to convert this good intention and kind\r\nthought into real outcomes. Wellness is not only about physical\r\nhealth or sickness. Equally importantly, it is about having good\r\nfriends and neighbours. It is about relationships that care. It\r\nis about opportunities for volunteerism.

Recently, a newspaper\r\narticle highlighted the plight of some workers of industrial accidents\r\n\u2013 that they were given two days of medical leave, which according\r\nto those that they interviewed appeared to be manifestly inadequate\r\nfor the condition that they are suffering. It could be an odd case but\r\nwe have to look further into these kinds of situations. For example,\r\nunder current regulations, companies do not need to report industrial\r\naccidents if injuries do not call for more than two days of medical\r\nleave. And this is probably to avoid swarming the system of very\r\nminor types of episodes \u2013 which is right. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8ad91956-062c-4050-908a-62638acd7948\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-8ad91956-062c-4050-908a-62638acd7948\"><!--a--></a>However, as there are penalties\r\nfor companies with high reported rates of industrial accidents,\r\nthen, we must be careful to check and police the issuing of medical\r\nleave so that a holistic picture emerges for all of us at the national\r\nlevel for each industry and at the company level. This would then\r\nput to rest any suspicion that anyone might have that there was\r\ngaming on the part of companies, leading to unfair treatment of\r\ninjured workers on a systematic basis.

If I have your leave, Sir, I would like to make three clarifications\r\nsince Mr Heng referred to my speech earlier. The first is: he mentioned\r\nthe resolution that I made reference to in my speech. And the point\r\nof my speech was that, because Singapore has actually been one of\r\nthe co-sponsors of that draft resolution at the UN, and the text\r\nof the resolution says that the member states are to be pursuing\r\nthe elaboration of additional measures to better capture the importance\r\nof the pursuit of happiness and well-being in guiding their national\r\npolicies, since our Government has endorsed this resolution, I was\r\nasking the Government to elaborate on what additional measures it\r\nintends to put in place since that is the text of the resolution. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8e189d6d-5219-42db-89a9-ec7441820c35\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-8e189d6d-5219-42db-89a9-ec7441820c35\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, he made reference\r\nto my example on housing \u2013 and that was brought up to illustrate\r\nthat if we are really concerned about the declining TFR, concentration\r\non happiness and well-being and sustainability of the society as\r\na whole may require us to weigh the options differently. This means,\r\nright now, the Government seems to say that the TFR is a concern\r\nbut immigration can help us to address that, but the question is what\r\nis the cost of immigration to Singapore if it is done on a large\r\nscale and are we not concerned about taking more steps to improve\r\nthe fertility rate of indigenous Singaporeans? If these studies\r\nbear out a linkage between housing affordability and low fertility\r\nrates, then it is incumbent upon the Government to do something\r\nabout that. Instead of looking at fertility just as a procreation\r\nissue, giving more incentives, we have to look at the bigger picture\r\nand see \u2013 if we are serious about improving the fertility rate of\r\nindigenous Singaporeans \u2013 we may need to look at some of these things\r\nwhich were not traditionally associated with the mere act of procreation.\r\nMy point was an example of a policy which may need to be relooked\r\nat if we have a different compass \u2013 looking at sustainability and\r\nhappiness of society rather than the economics of bringing in immigrants\r\nto replace the population as such. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-38d29e85-cedc-4375-9348-a02257665b4d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-38d29e85-cedc-4375-9348-a02257665b4d\"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, Mr Heng asked what\r\nindicators I have in my own mind.

In fact, having served at the front bench, I can say\r\nthat all we do is to make sure that, ultimately, we can improve\r\nthe quality of life for all Singaporeans. It is the Government's\r\njob, I believe, to make sure that conditions are right, so that\r\nsuch quality of life can be enjoyed.

And they are now a constitutional monarchy. They\r\nhave a bicameral system and the Lower House, I think the party is\r\nDPT, won 45 out of 47 seats. So, maybe because they never had an\r\nOpposition or only two Opposition members recently, the people are\r\nvery happy. I really do not know. How does the \"gross national happiness\"\r\nwork? But if you read the literature and study it carefully, the\r\nproponents of this system said that this is an additional or supplemental\r\nmeasure that countries could use. It is not to substitute GDP growth.\r\nSo, I want the Opposition Member, Ms Sylvia Lim, to clarify whether\r\nor not she thinks GDP is total baloney and we should forget about GDP,\r\nand I hope she can confirm her position. I would support that other\r\nthan just gross GDP growth, yes, we should look at other aspects\r\nof growth but not to say that GDP growth is unimportant. Because\r\nif it were unimportant, what does it mean? What is the formula for\r\nGDP \u2013 consumption, investment, government spending, exports minus imports?\r\nIf it is unimportant, we do not want any investment in trains or\r\nhousing? If it is unimportant, we do not want any government spending?\r\nWe do not want the private sector investment in jobs for Singaporeans?\r\nIf we do not have GDP growth, given the fact that we were thrown\r\nout to be independent and yet our success was actually nothing short\r\nof miraculous? Even though we are resource-poor, how do we get the funds\r\nto fund all the programmes, all the \"equal opportunities\", the safety\r\nnet, and so forth? So I hope Ms Sylvia Lim will be more specific\r\nin what she means by adopting the gross national happiness (GNH)\r\nand that she will confirm that GDP is still important.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 112</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-749b33ce-759c-47a5-9430-6415ed4b8686\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-749b33ce-759c-47a5-9430-6415ed4b8686\"><!--a--></a>On her point about total\r\nfertility rate (TFR), I think we heard in this House many, many times\r\n\u2013 in fact, former Minister Mentor had mentioned it here \u2013 that our\r\nnumber one challenge is the replacement rate for Singapore, and\r\nSingaporeans must come first, and there are a lot of efforts put\r\ninto it.

The more information the\r\npeople have, the easier it is for us to bring them on board and\r\nalso the greater will be their buy-in and the more likely we can\r\nachieve a convergence of opinions.

Also, one of the features that I would like to recommend is\r\nthat the frequency of fare reviews not be carried out annually but, perhaps,\r\nevery two to three years. This formula, I see as only a means to\r\nachieving a higher public transport modal share, up from the 60%\r\nwe have today to about 70% by 2020.

I stand in support of the Motion.\r\nSir, before I speak on matters that I would like to share with the\r\nHouse, I would like to just seek clarification from the Member for\r\nAljunied, Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap, who just spoke a while\r\nago. He spoke of the fault lines that exist. And if I heard him\r\ncorrectly, there seems to be an indication, or he alluded to the\r\nfact, that economic growth does not heal fault lines. I just wonder\r\nif what he is saying is that we should not have economic growth,\r\nso that we do not have fault lines or that fault lines will not\r\nexist if there is no economic growth. I am not quite sure what he\r\nreally meant when he spoke about the fact that we are always focusing\r\nso much on economic growth and, because of those fault lines, that\r\nwe are not paying attention to the fault lines.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1e46d4fe-98ed-49a3-a3ab-36f4e9c7bab4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-1e46d4fe-98ed-49a3-a3ab-36f4e9c7bab4\"><!--a--></a>Maybe I could clarify that\r\nthe PAP Government has always been very concerned about potential\r\nsystemic effect. He is right that, if there is a problem in one\r\naspect of the system, there will be a trickling effect. But if there\r\nis success, there will also be trickling effect of the success.\r\nTherefore, while we work on economic growth, while we focus on suggesting\r\nand ensuring that our country and Singaporeans succeed, we get growth and\r\nwe channel the excess growth to issues or fault lines that may exist,\r\nto make sure that we do heal those fault lines. He is a counsellor.\r\nI am also a social worker for many, many years. I worked with families\r\nall my life as a professional social worker, and in all those families\r\nthat I worked with, nothing I think is attributed to economic growth. Nothing\r\nis attributed to the fact that because we are successful, therefore,\r\nwe have family problems. There are many, many issues that relate\r\nto family problems and we cannot pinpoint any particular factor\r\nthat could possibly explain family issues. But what is important\r\nis really whether we have enough support systems in place. We have enough\r\nsocial workers, counsellors and resources that we put in place.\r\nOver time, we have been putting in so much resources. In this House,\r\nfor example, in the last 10 years I have been a Member of this House,\r\nwe have never stopped talking about the need for social workers.\r\nWe have never stopped talking about the need to raise the value\r\nof social workers in society, and that is really the recognition.\r\nWhile we acknowledge there are fault lines, we are not irresponsible\r\nto allow the fault lines to continue to become deepened.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-49b90bea-c60c-4cdb-9eb4-aa4c0cc8a907\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-49b90bea-c60c-4cdb-9eb4-aa4c0cc8a907\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 114</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d73fb9ec-93e6-40d0-9cd9-a875f7eb8423\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-d73fb9ec-93e6-40d0-9cd9-a875f7eb8423\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I want to assure the\r\nMember that we cannot possibly talk about economic growth not being\r\ngood and therefore we need not focus on it, or what the Member is\r\nsaying is, do not focus too much on economic growth. I think there\r\nis this old adage that says that we are so small, we cannot afford\r\nnot to have economic growth. But, really, what is important is how\r\ndo we manage the potential impact of economic growth, the potential impact\r\non individuals and families? It is true that we have to strengthen\r\nour families, and we have been strengthening our families. We have\r\nto make sure that families continue to be the building block. We\r\nare challenged. We spoke a lot about how the elderly is being taken\r\ncare of and the fact that with our lower TFR, the possibility of\r\nfamilies looking after the elderly will continue to be challenged.\r\nBut that does not mean that we cannot continue to have growth rate.\r\nWe need to have more growth to make sure that we can take care of\r\nthe elderly in the future by virtue of the fact that the TFR is\r\nnot coming down, by virtue of the fact that the family may continue\r\nto be challenged. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-49e12809-b1e4-4d00-bf31-5e7e3c1a4586\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-49e12809-b1e4-4d00-bf31-5e7e3c1a4586\"><!--a--></a>So I think what is important\r\nis to really look at the principles behind governance, how do we\r\nensure that we must make sure that the economy grows so that individuals\r\ncan take advantage of good income, good jobs and support their families,\r\nstrengthen their families and thereby make sure that our children\r\nwill also have a brighter future ahead of them.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a17476b9-fcd0-4976-aaad-85dd48c932fb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a17476b9-fcd0-4976-aaad-85dd48c932fb\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, the President\r\nspoke about the new environment we face in Singapore \u2013 a changing\r\nsociety, a changing economy and changing politics.

Families who do not do well economically also have got family\r\nissues. So, there is no correlation or a direct relationship between\r\neconomic growth and difficulties in families. These are dynamic factors.\r\nSocial workers and counsellors can tell you that these factors are\r\nmulti-dimensional and I do not think it is easy for us to just simply\r\nsay that economic growth at all costs will translate to family problems.\r\nSir, I urge the Member to look at these issues of family difficulties\r\nin a more holistic manner, to study the dynamic process that happens\r\nin families and for us to see how economic growth in itself can\r\nhelp facilitate and help these families get out of the difficulties\r\nthey are facing. I think it is more than just that correlation but\r\nthere is a whole slew of factors that we have to understand. We want\r\nto continue to understand them and to help families. We will continue\r\nto put in resources as a result of economic growth to help these\r\nfamilies.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-04a936e1-4372-43d2-9f5f-7216b050cc8f\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-04a936e1-4372-43d2-9f5f-7216b050cc8f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-a07c8ec0-f56b-4215-934b-b5f6f3da8d8f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a07c8ec0-f56b-4215-934b-b5f6f3da8d8f\"><!--a--></a>5.51 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-93fe95a2-e7c9-4d84-9b7a-b5e54d8d67b8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-93fe95a2-e7c9-4d84-9b7a-b5e54d8d67b8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: <span class=\"ph hcInline hcLang\">(<em class=\"ph i\">In Mandarin</em>): [<em class=\"ph i\">For\r\nMandarin speech, please refer to Pg 148 for <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=017_20111017_S0016_T0006.pdf\"\">Vernacular Speeches</a>\r\n                     </em>\r\n                  </span>.]\r\nMr Speaker, I have originally intended to devote my entire speech\r\ntoday to push for the Government to resume building new hawker centres.\r\nTo my delight, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr\r\nVivian Balakrishnan, has announced the building of 10 new hawker\r\ncentres on 8 October.

It is also unfortunate that in many cases, many of\r\nour seniors have little or no Medisave, MediShield or other insurance\r\ncoverage. Therefore, they are fully dependent on the younger generation\r\nfor payments of medical bills. We have a world-class medical infrastructure.\r\nSimilarly, we should also have a world-class framework to alleviate\r\nthe burden of medical cost. It is evident that with better quality\r\nof life, health awareness and medical facilities, life expectancy\r\ncould continue to rise. Presently, we have 29,000 elderly who are\r\n85 years and above, who are not covered by MediShield. We should\r\nreview the extension of MediShield coverage for elderly citizens\r\nbeyond the age of 85 years.

Mary is 71, a single. She worked hard as a Personal\r\nAssistant (PA) to a company director for many years and now owns\r\nher own flat in Toa Payoh where she lives with her widowed sister.\r\nThey did not receive any form of financial support and had been\r\nliving off their savings, and these savings are now running dry. They\r\nare still healthy but understandably worried of what would happen\r\nif either or both of them should fall ill. Mary believes that her\r\nonly option is to sell the flat and downgrade to a studio apartment.\r\nThat is logical, but it is also not easy to get one as demand far exceeds\r\nsupply. She wanted me to secure priority for a studio apartment\r\nand was disappointed that I could not. Hers is not a unique situation.\r\nIn my recent block visit to a block of 3-room flats in Toa Payoh,\r\nI met others in similar situations. Elderly Singaporeans who are\r\nasset rich but cash poor. I am sure many in this House would have\r\nas well.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 131</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b0de5b1c-4594-4e6d-97dc-42cb76beb15e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b0de5b1c-4594-4e6d-97dc-42cb76beb15e\"><!--a--></a>We all accept that society\r\nhas changed over the last 30 years. One of the institutions most\r\naffected is the family unit. Much as we like to resist it, there\r\nare some consequences which are inevitable. More Singaporeans will\r\nnot marry. Those who do will have fewer children. Our fertility\r\nrate has dropped below 1.2. However much money we throw at the problem,\r\nwhile it can increase slightly, it will never rise anywhere close to\r\nthe replacement level of 2.1. The days of large families are over.\r\nThis has nothing to do with the \"Stop at Two\" policy in the 1970s\r\nor any particular Government policy. We are witnessing a world-wide\r\ntrend brought about by a confluence of factors and some of these\r\nfactors are what we consider positive to us like more women entering\r\nthe workforce. So it is not just about rising housing prices. That\r\nis a simplistic way to look at it. But whatever the cost, the result\r\nis that when we get old and retire, we have to depend less on the\r\nyounger generation to maintain us. The Maintenance of Parents Act, however\r\nmuch it was improved recently, can only go so far and do so much. Singaporeans\r\nwould have to plan carefully for their retirement and plan early.\r\nBut the fact of the matter is, many will not or will not be able\r\nto. In particular, those who earn less may not be able to put enough\r\naway as salaries stagnate and the cost of living rises.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-14c0b384-c3ff-4b9e-bff0-ad6854311cc2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-14c0b384-c3ff-4b9e-bff0-ad6854311cc2\"><!--a--></a>Singaporeans have long relied\r\non two main pillars of security \u2013 our CPF and our homes. For the\r\nless well-off, these are their only pillars. For many elderly, it\r\nis too late to talk about savings, investments or insurance. They\r\nare from a generation who were less educated but who worked hard\r\nand in difficult circumstances to provide for their families and\r\nto build a better life for their children. By and large, they succeeded.\r\nFor one reason or another, they now receive little or no support\r\nfrom their families. As families get smaller, we will see more Mdm\r\nMarys looking for help. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9c3c225d-8451-43be-85af-5f36873f5e82\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-9c3c225d-8451-43be-85af-5f36873f5e82\"><!--a--></a>The CPF has its limitations.\r\nThe monthly payout is not sufficient to maintain a reasonable lifestyle,\r\nparticularly in the current environment. It is also inadequate to\r\ndeal with the crisis such as medical expenses. Medisave cannot be\r\nused for all treatments and there are limits to drawdowns. This\r\napplies to every Singaporean. So why do I highlight the elderly?\r\nTwo reasons. First, unlike the young, most cannot do much to improve\r\ntheir prospects. Retraining will be difficult and getting a job\r\n\u2013 next to impossible. Second, many have means because they own their\r\nown homes outright. They are the beneficiaries of a far-sighted\r\npolicy by the PAP Government to encourage Singaporeans to own their\r\nown homes. And because of sound economic management, they have seen\r\nthe values of their homes rise significantly. We take this for granted\r\nand some even complain about it. But an entire generation of Singaporeans\r\nis better off for it. As in any policy, the difficulty lies not\r\nwith the objective for the policy, but its consequences. Most elderly\r\ntoday have a major part, in some cases almost all, of their networth\r\nlocked up in their homes. The problem is that this benefit remains\r\nlocked up and therefore unhelpful in times of need. This is the\r\nproblem of Mdm Mary, and many others like her.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 132</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-307c47a7-cc85-4294-a4bb-0e48c73d27fd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-307c47a7-cc85-4294-a4bb-0e48c73d27fd\"><!--a--></a>Mdm Mary came to me not\r\nlooking for handout, just an opportunity to provide for her sister\r\nand herself using her own means. But what options do we provide\r\nher and others like her today? We say she can downgrade. Easier\r\nsaid than done. It works if she can get a studio apartment, but\r\nthose are not easy to come by. So she will need to buy a resale flat\r\nwhich is expensive. She will not be able to obtain a loan because\r\nof her age. Therefore, most of the proceeds of the sale of a flat\r\nwould be ploughed back into her new flat. So that does not address\r\nthe problem. Besides, do we really want older Singaporeans to move,\r\nbreak ties they have developed with their neighbours over many years\r\nand start all over again in an unfamiliar environment. That cannot\r\nbe good for their well-being. We want them to grow old among friends\r\nand people they know, people who will look out for them. Second\r\noption, she can sell and then rent a home, but she will be barred\r\nfor 30 months from getting an HDB rental flat, and even then, she\r\nis unlikely to get one because she has the proceeds of the sale\r\nof her flat. So she has to rent from the open market which is expensive\r\nand uncertain because she will have to keep renewing her lease and\r\ntherefore be subject to market forces. Not a good solution. We tell\r\nher that she can rent out a room to earn income. But Mary does not\r\nhave a spare room because her sister stays with her. Again, is it\r\nreally a feasible solution for two elderly women or any elderly\r\nperson to let a stranger into their home? Further, it may take some\r\ntime to find a suitable tenant and the value of the home remains\r\nlocked up.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-397eae6e-db83-4970-9389-4d201b61d8f8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-397eae6e-db83-4970-9389-4d201b61d8f8\"><!--a--></a>Sir, a few years ago, we\r\nintroduced reverse mortgages to unlock value, but that has not proven\r\npopular. I can understand why. It is very inflexible. It only applies\r\nto 2- or 3-room flats. The monthly payments are low. I asked HDB\r\nfor some estimates in Mary's case. Her flat now has a market value\r\nof above $300,000 and has 57 years left on the lease. Mary will\r\nreceive an upfront payment of $5,000 and a monthly payment of about $630.\r\nSix hundred and thirty dollars a month is difficult for two elderly\r\nwomen. Further, there is a number of disadvantages. The payments\r\nare based on the present-day value of the flat as determined by\r\nthe HDB, which means Mary does not benefit from any rise in property\r\nprices in the following years. Once she signs on, she cannot sign\r\nout. So she can no longer sell her flat or bequeath it to her beneficiaries.\r\nWhen she passes on, the flat is taken back by the HDB and the remaining\r\nvalue cashed out at current prices and given to her beneficiaries.\r\nSo what is the point of having a $300,000 home, if you cannot extract\r\nvalue in times of need? It is a good thing to be asset rich, but\r\nelderly Singaporeans do not want to be cash poor.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4ce741a3-6ae5-473e-8776-8302b223a04a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-4ce741a3-6ae5-473e-8776-8302b223a04a\"><!--a--></a>I therefore urge the Government\r\nto come up with a different programme to help older Singaporeans\r\nunlock the value of their HDB flats. One suggestion is to have a\r\nmore flexible lease buyback programme. For example, can we not allow\r\nSingaporeans to sell back portions of their lease to HDB at market\r\nvalue? A 70-year-old couple does not need a 50- or 60-year-old lease.\r\nIf they can sell part of the lease back to HDB, say, in parcel of five\r\nor 10 years, that would give them a decent sum. This would have\r\na number of advantages. A lump sum payment would give them more\r\nflexibility in planning and meeting their immediate needs such as\r\nthe cost of an operation or other medical needs. Only a small portion\r\nof their lease would be valued at current prices, which means they still\r\nbenefit from rising property prices and the effects of inflation\r\nare reduced. They will continue to have the option to sell their\r\nflat if they want to buy a studio apartment when one becomes available,\r\nor they can leave the flat behind for their loved ones. More importantly\r\nand underpinning this suggestion is that they will not be receiving something\r\nfor nothing. They will be using their own asset to support themselves,\r\nand this is consistent with our core principles.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 133</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1b395b23-96e3-4b3a-965d-f247bd5f6cfa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-1b395b23-96e3-4b3a-965d-f247bd5f6cfa\"><!--a--></a>What are the downsides?\r\nWill too many apply? We can prevent a floodgate of applications\r\nby placing conditions on who will qualify such as imposing an age\r\ncriteria for applicants in matching the number of surrenders or\r\nspecifying a minimum balance of 10 years to ensure that the lease\r\nwill not expire prematurely. Will this not result in flats in the\r\nsame block having different tenures? Yes, it will but with technology,\r\nthat should not be a problem to administer. Such a scheme would\r\nbe in addition to all the other programmes currently available and\r\nwould give the elderly more options and greater flexibility to take\r\ncare of their own needs. This would strengthen HDB's role, not only\r\nas a builder of homes, but as an important institution in the welfare\r\nof Singaporeans and particularly the elderly. This is what our home\r\nownership policy was designed to do, not just provide a roof over\r\nour heads, certainly not to provide an asset which one can buy and\r\nsell to make money, but to give every Singaporean a stake in this\r\ncountry and to provide for their well-being.
