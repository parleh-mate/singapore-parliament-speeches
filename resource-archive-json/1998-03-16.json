It  is  important  that  TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  especially the News that is telecast in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  as  pointed  out by the Minister last year  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  should focus on the Singapore viewpoint.   It  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsometimes I wonder what has a bus accident or small human  story\r\n\r\nin  America  got  to  do.  In fact, if there  were  other  human\r\n\r\nstories  of  what is happening in Asia they would be  much  more\r\n\r\nrelevant.  So I would urge the News editors to focus and give  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  viewpoint whenever news is reported.   There  may  be\r\n\r\nsome human angle, I can agree.  But to report on small incidents\r\n\r\nof  road  blocks, or things like that, I do not think it  serves\r\n\r\nany purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move to the question of Indian programmes, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  Indian News programme is hampered because it has to  depend\r\n\r\non  the  other sections and it does not cover news on the Indian\r\n\r\ncommunity as widely as it should.  Also, there is a tendency for\r\n\r\nthe  Indian  news  programmes to focus on matters  happening  in\r\n\r\nIndia.  I do not deny that India is an important country but  to\r\n\r\nfocus  unduly  on affairs in India, I think it is not  good  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  I  would urge that we  should  take  a  focused\r\n\r\nviewpoint.  The Indian PAC has pointed this out.  But I want  to\r\n\r\nshare  my  views with this House that we should try  to  portray\r\n\r\nIndia's problems in India's setting and not India's problems  in\r\n\r\nSingapore setting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be good to have more journalists in this\r\n\r\nsection.  I know there are budget constraints.  But I would  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to urge his colleague, the Finance Minister, to  be\r\n\r\na  little more generous because I know the Indian programmes are\r\n\r\nnot  self-financing.   But  it is an  important  sector  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and it should get its coverage, not only  the  Indian\r\n\r\nprogrammes  but the other community and national  programmes  in\r\n\r\nthe Indian channel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the question of timing. I know the\r\n\r\ntiming  has  improved.  The Minister may say that we are  asking\r\n\r\ntoo  much.   But  I think it would benefit half  of  the  Indian\r\n\r\ncommunity, especially the younger listeners and viewers, if  the\r\n\r\nNews  programme  could be shifted after  8.30  pm.   The  second\r\n\r\npoint,  Sir, is that we do not have a current affairs  programme\r\n\r\nin the Indian segment.  It is important to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow what is happening around us in Singapore and we should have\r\n\r\nsuch  a programme either twice a month or, if not, at least once\r\n\r\na  month.   The programme could be for half an hour to one  hour\r\n\r\nwhere  the Indian viewers could have the opportunity to see  the\r\n\r\nproblems  facing Singapore.  For this, I think  we  should  have\r\n\r\nfunding.  Again, I would urge the Minister to reconsider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must applaud TCS for the improvement in its quality\r\n\r\nof  programmes.  I think it would be hypocrisy not to admit that\r\n\r\nthe  standards  have gone up.  But I am asking the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nurge his officers to do something that we can be proud of our TV\r\n\r\nand radio programmes, especially when they compare with the news\r\n\r\nmedia.  If you look at the Straits Times, it has got such a wide\r\n\r\ncoverage, in particular From the Gallery.  If we could have  the\r\n\r\nsame  coverage for TV programmes, I think Singapore as  a  whole\r\n\r\nwould benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\ntelevision  programmes produced by TCS   have  become  part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  the  Singapore  culture,  and  the  current  affairs\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  dramas produced by Channel 8 have  also  become\r\n\r\npart of the social life in the Chinese community in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1997 is an eventful year for Singapore. First, we were\r\n\r\naffected  by  the  haze.  Then there was  this  tension  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaysia, followed by the financial  turmoil  and\r\n\r\nthe  SilkAir  tragedy.   The  current  affairs  programmes  from\r\n\r\nChannel  8  such  as Tuesday Report, Focus and Money  Week  gave\r\n\r\nextensive  coverage  and analysis of all these  events  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of Singaporeans who are concerned with the society  and\r\n\r\nthe fate of their compatriots. The efforts and prompt reports by\r\n\r\nthe   Current   Affairs  Section  of  TCS  are   indeed   highly\r\n\r\ncommendable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, TCS telecast a serial known as Taxi Driver,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  well  received by the audience in general,  and  the\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers themselves in particular.  They feel that this kind\r\n\r\nof drama truly reflects our society and the transport workers in\r\n\r\nour society.  It shows not only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  life  but  also their hardship.  It  would  also  promote\r\n\r\nbetter   understanding  between  the  taxi  drivers  and   their\r\n\r\ncommuters,  as well as  improve the image of taxi  drivers.   On\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  taxi  drivers, I would like  to  record   their\r\n\r\nappreciation to the producers of this serial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Programme Advisory Committee in its report released\r\n\r\nrecently, pointed out that among TCS's top 10 serials last year,\r\n\r\ntwo   were  considered  to  be  undesirable,  not  suitable  for\r\n\r\nchildren.   One  of  them  is the Choice Partner  which  conveys\r\n\r\nundesirable ideas and the other is Rising Expectations which has\r\n\r\na  very complicated plot, involving prostitution, rape and other\r\n\r\nvery illicit relationship between men and women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report commended the good social values depicted in\r\n\r\nThe Price of Peace and Guest People.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one related problem is that the viewership of Channel\r\n\r\n8  drama serials  has generally dropped.  In the past, they used\r\n\r\nto  command  a viewership of more than 700,000, but now  it  has\r\n\r\ndropped  to  around  600,000.  When we are producing  television\r\n\r\ndrama serials, no doubt we have to consider viewership, but with\r\n\r\nso  many channels now available, a viewership of 600,000 can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered not too bad.   If we want to cater for the viewership\r\n\r\nand the revenue from the commercials, and add in plots which are\r\n\r\nundesirable and depict bad social values, then  it is not  good.\r\n\r\nI  think  we should not be too surprised by a drop in viewership\r\n\r\nbecause there are now so many channels available to the viewers.\r\n\r\nViewership is spread out and thinned out.   What TCS  should  do\r\n\r\nis  to produce more programmes like The Price of Peace and Guest\r\n\r\nPeople  to attract more viewers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days, we have been discussing the question\r\n\r\nof  bond-breakers of our scholarship holders in this Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis  involves  the  basic  value of trust.   TCS  may  consider\r\n\r\ngathering  more materials on this matter and produce a programme\r\n\r\non   scholarships,  bond-breakers,  and  so  on.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\nMinister may call upon TCS  to consider  producing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  programme  based  on scholarship bond-breakers.  If  we  have\r\n\r\nrealistic programmes like this, it has a good chance of securing\r\n\r\nhigh viewership.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in\r\n\r\nthe  Final Report of the Advisory Committee on TCS Chinese Drama\r\n\r\nand  Variety Shows (ACCESS), 1996/98, it was pointed out,  among\r\n\r\nother things, that TCS should not telecast programmes which  are\r\n\r\nunsuitable  for children, during the prime time.  In  the  past,\r\n\r\nTCS used to schedule their programmes in such a way that certain\r\n\r\ntypes  of programmes were telecast during certain time slots  to\r\n\r\ncater  for the different groups of viewers. However, as  pointed\r\n\r\nout  by  the  Advisory Committee, in recent years, there  was  a\r\n\r\nchange  in  this kind of arrangement.  I feel that the Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Authority should prepare a  menu for  TCS  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  would  be  guided  as to when to  telecast  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Then, the Chinese Programme Advisory Committee (PAC)\r\n\r\nwill  not have to spend so much time to set out all this  advice\r\n\r\nin its annual report.  The Committee will then have more time to\r\n\r\ndevote  themselves on constructive suggestions and giving  ideas\r\n\r\non  the production of better programmes, such as art programmes,\r\n\r\ndocumentaries,  etc.  to  inculcate  cultural  values   in   our\r\n\r\nchildren  and young people, for example, to encourage people  to\r\n\r\nlook after the old and the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the locally produced TV drama serials, I am glad to say\r\n\r\nthat  over  the past few years, they have improved by leaps  and\r\n\r\nbounds.   But  there  is still room for  improvement.    On  the\r\n\r\nwhole, the programmes are good.  There are not many big problems\r\n\r\nwith the programmes.  But, as pointed out in the final report of\r\n\r\nACCESS,   TCS  should  be  careful not to introduce  undesirable\r\n\r\nvalues  in  these  serials, as these serials  have  considerable\r\n\r\ninfluence on our society at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the TV programmes from another angle, when you\r\n\r\nare   talking  about  the  decline  in  viewership  of  our   TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  I think this is a bigger problem that  we  have  to\r\n\r\nface.  Because, basically, from the viewership, we can see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   challenges  facing  TCS  and  SBA  ahead.   Comparing  the\r\n\r\nviewership of our programmes with that of the imported ones,  we\r\n\r\ncan know how we fare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have cable TV and wireless TV. Are there any\r\n\r\ndifferences in the programmes between the two?   I think we have\r\n\r\nto consider this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, are the wireless TV Channel 5 and Channel 8 making\r\n\r\nprofits or not?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, how are the programmes produced by us compared to\r\n\r\nthose  produced  by  Hong Kong and China  which  are  now  being\r\n\r\ntelecast over cable TV?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline of viewership for our local TV channels is not\r\n\r\na totally unexpected phenomenon.  I believe that in the years to\r\n\r\ncome,   viewership  may continue to decline as  cable  TV  gains\r\n\r\npopularity.   I  hope the Minister can take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\ninform us of the future of cable TV and wireless TV.  What  kind\r\n\r\nof a role will TCS  play in future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on digital TV. The advent of digital TV\r\n\r\nwill also have an impact on television in Singapore.  There will\r\n\r\nbe  some kind of revolutionary effect.  I hope that the Minister\r\n\r\ncan enlighten us on this new phase of development in  television\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to address\r\n\r\nsome  concerns specific to Singapore Cable Vision (SCV) or cable\r\n\r\nTV.   Would  the  Minister be able to provide an update  on  the\r\n\r\nproject  to  develop the infrastructure for Singapore  to  be  a\r\n\r\n\"wired city state\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the items on the agenda was to give every household\r\n\r\naccess  to cable TV, should they wish to subscribe to  it.   For\r\n\r\nHDB   estates,  the  feasibility  and  the  cost  is  reasonably\r\n\r\nefficient.   But  how does SCV handle landed  estates  where  it\r\n\r\ncould  cost easily up to $3,000 to wire up an individual  house?\r\n\r\nWhat  if private estate residents refuse to pay this sum?   What\r\n\r\nrecourse  does  MITA  or SCV have?  Would  the  Minister  please\r\n\r\nclarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, further to my comment on the long-term role of TCS\r\n\r\nwhich  I raised last Friday under an earlier amendment, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to seek clarifications from the Minister on what MITA  see\r\n\r\nas the long-term role of SCV vis-a-vis TCS?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is timely to review the definitions and the role\r\n\r\nof SCV versus TCS, in the light of the limited resources that we\r\n\r\nhave.   And I mentioned last Friday that we should try to  avoid\r\n\r\ntoo much duplication of resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, first, I wish to declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest.   I am a director at Singapore Technologies  (Pte)\r\n\r\nLimited, which is one of the principal shareholders of Singapore\r\n\r\nCable Vision (SCV).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV is responsible for wiring up the entire island to\r\n\r\nensure Singapore is cable ready by the end of next year, in time\r\n\r\nfor  the  new millennium.  I wish to take up, more specifically,\r\n\r\nthe  point  just raised by my colleague, Mr Chew.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  progress in wiring up has been good.  80% of the HDB flats\r\n\r\nhave  been wired and I think about 40% of the private flats have\r\n\r\nalso  been  similarly wired.  The project has been  extended  to\r\n\r\nlanded  properties,  and  I understand the  response  from  this\r\n\r\nsegment  of  the population has been less than enthusiastic.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  relatively  high cost of getting  wired  up  is  the\r\n\r\nprincipal reason for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may illustrate, Sir, for the typical HDB unit, the\r\n\r\nfirst TV point is free.  For each subsequent point, the cost  is\r\n\r\n$60-$70.  This affordable rate is possible, partly because of  a\r\n\r\nGovernment grant to SCV to wire up about 7,000 HDB blocks.   For\r\n\r\na  typical private flat, the cost to the first TV point is  $150\r\n\r\nand  $90  for  each  subsequent point.  There is  no  Government\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  as far as I understand, but the operator  is  able  to\r\n\r\noffer  more competitive prices because of the density  of  these\r\n\r\ndevelopments.  But for private landed properties,  the  cost  to\r\n\r\nthe  first point is at least $1,500 and, in some cases, as  high\r\n\r\nas  $3,000.  This is largely because they have to foot the  bill\r\n\r\nof  the  external  wiring, to tap the main  lines  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelecom and bring it to the household.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of these households could reasonably ask the\r\n\r\nquestion whether the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice or cable access they receive is worth paying 10 times as\r\n\r\nmuch  or  more  as  that paid by their counterparts  in  HDB  or\r\n\r\nprivate  flats.  There are about 60,000-70,000 such  households.\r\n\r\nI  urge the Minister to consider extending a Government grant or\r\n\r\nsome  other form of measure to defray at least part of this cost\r\n\r\nwhich  would otherwise have to be borne by these households.  It\r\n\r\nwould at least bring it to a level more comparable to that  paid\r\n\r\nby private flats and HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible measure could be for Government, the household\r\n\r\nand  SCV  to  bear this cost equally, for argument's sake,  $500\r\n\r\neach.  I think this would amount to about $35 million investment\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government as a one-off exercise.   This  would  be  a\r\n\r\nworthwhile  investment in Singapore's IT infrastructure,  as  we\r\n\r\nall  know  that  the cable network is not just a medium  for  TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  it  is  part  of Singapore  One  providing  a  high\r\n\r\nbandwidth   network  for  access  to  the  Internet  and   other\r\n\r\nmultimedia  applications.  In time to come,  a  cable  point  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be as essential in the home as a telephone point,  and\r\n\r\nwe  do  not have this kind of differentiation when it  comes  to\r\n\r\ntelephone  points in the home.  At least, the cost  relativities\r\n\r\nare  far less.  It would therefore be a great pity, I think,  if\r\n\r\nwe do not seize this opportunity to ensure that all of Singapore\r\n\r\nis cable ready by the end of next year.  I think, in my view,  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  financial stimulus would be a  welcome  catalyst  in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore\r\n\r\nis  now  developing  into an IT hub.  Our IT infrastructure  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  are more advanced than our neighbouring  countries.\r\n\r\nThe  strange  thing  is  that countries such  as  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  which  are  lagging behind us in IT  development,  are\r\n\r\nallowing  their  people  to  use the satellite  dish  freely  to\r\n\r\nreceive satellite TV telecast,  while Singapore bans the use  of\r\n\r\nsuch satellite dish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is concerned that if people are allowed to\r\n\r\ntune  in  freely to undesirable programmes, such as pornography,\r\n\r\nfrom   the  satellite  TV,  this  would  have  a  grave  adverse\r\n\r\nrepercussion on our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety.  I agree with this stand.  However, with the advance in\r\n\r\ntechnology, would the Minister consider the use of some kind  of\r\n\r\ntechnology  to  block out such undesirable programmes  from  the\r\n\r\nsatellite TV, so that they will not reach Singapore?   Then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can allow people to install satellite dishes so  that\r\n\r\nthey can freely select and watch programmes from other parts  of\r\n\r\nthe world, particularly programmes on political commentaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday,  the  younger  generation of Singaporeans  are  receiving\r\n\r\nbetter  education,  and many of them are effectively  bilingual.\r\n\r\nWith  the advancement in communications, the quality of life  of\r\n\r\nour  people  has enhanced.  Now, more and more Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ntravelling overseas to broaden their visit and to motivate their\r\n\r\npursuit for knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, each of the four language streams has one\r\n\r\ndaily  newspaper.   In addition, there is one afternoon  English\r\n\r\nnewspaper and two Chinese evening newspapers.  As far as I know,\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans are hoping to have at least one more  Chinese\r\n\r\nor  English daily newspaper, so that they can have the option of\r\n\r\nan  alternative  newspaper to the existing one  and  only  major\r\n\r\nlanguage newspaper in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after 30 years of nation building, our people are more\r\n\r\nmature  now.   The  younger  generation  of  Singaporeans   have\r\n\r\nreceived better education.  They know how to distinguish between\r\n\r\nright and wrong.  They are not easily instigated by others.   So\r\n\r\nby  giving  them one more newspaper, their daily life  could  be\r\n\r\nfurther  enriched.    Under competition, I think  the  editorial\r\n\r\ncontents  and  substance  of  the newspapers  would  be  further\r\n\r\nimproved  and  more  quality reports will be  provided  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of  the readers.  To the advertisers, they will have  an\r\n\r\nalternative choice to place their advertisement.  It  will  also\r\n\r\ncreate   more  job  opportunities  for  our  mass  communication\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Government has already started what we call a\r\n\r\n\"self-discipline\" development in terms of education and culture.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation is encouraging more independent schools to be  set  up\r\n\r\nso  that  they  could have their own curriculum and  methods  of\r\n\r\nteaching,  provided they comply with the   guidelines issued  by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education.  Secondly, with cable TV and Internet\r\n\r\ngetting  more and more popular, it implies that MITA is allowing\r\n\r\nour  people to be subjected to the impact of various  views  and\r\n\r\nschools  of  thoughts.   Thirdly, we are allowing  our  cultural\r\n\r\norganisations more space for development, for example,  busking.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  necessary  supervision, encouraging  creativity  and\r\n\r\ncompetition is a breakthrough.  I hope that the Government would\r\n\r\nencourage  any  consortium which is interested to  start  a  new\r\n\r\nmajor daily newspaper in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I am sorry I did not catch your\r\n\r\neye earlier.

I  think\r\n\r\nthese  are  good  moves.  It serves to benefit our  arts  loving\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and our senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent financial crisis developments in the\r\n\r\nregion,  the  Indonesian crisis, the SilkAir MI 185  crash,  the\r\n\r\nThai  baht  crisis and so on, all show that there is  a  greater\r\n\r\ndemand  now  for  news coverage of international,  regional  and\r\n\r\ncurrent events over radio.  Singaporeans want to tune in to  the\r\n\r\nlatest on the news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe we have yet to have a station solely\r\n\r\ndedicated to providing up-to-date news.  May I therefore ask the\r\n\r\nMinister what plans RCS has to set up more stations to cater  to\r\n\r\nthe  needs of Singaporeans in general and the business community\r\n\r\nat large?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Chinese\r\n\r\nnews  over  Channel  8  enjoys one of  the  highest  viewership,\r\n\r\nespecially during this period of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis and unrest in Indonesia.  A lot of people  are\r\n\r\nwatching TV  news on Channel 8.  Two months ago, in January,  TV\r\n\r\nnews  on  Channel 8 itself became a  focus of news   because  it\r\n\r\nfailed to telecast the death of the well-known veteran comedian,\r\n\r\nWang  Sa.  There was no mention at all over the TV news  in  the\r\n\r\nthree  days immediately after his death.   A lot of people  were\r\n\r\ntalking  about this omission.  Personally, I believe  that  this\r\n\r\nomission was unintentional.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident tells us that our society is still quite\r\n\r\nhumane.   Our  veteran  comedian died, and  he  is  still  being\r\n\r\nremembered  by the people.  They want more people to know  about\r\n\r\nhis death through the TV news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we are going regional and international, the news\r\n\r\non  TCS  should  cover  not only local news,  but  regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational news as well, so that Singaporeans can cast  their\r\n\r\neyes  not only on our society but on the whole world.   This,  I\r\n\r\nthink, should be the policy of all media in Singapore.   On  top\r\n\r\nof  that,  we  are a multi-racial society.  One of  our  special\r\n\r\nfeatures  is the ability to seek concord while maintaining   our\r\n\r\ndifferences.   As such,  the people of Singapore  are  concerned\r\n\r\nnot  only with common issues in our nation, our society and  the\r\n\r\nregion, but also  what is happening in our own communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, while covering the major events in the world and\r\n\r\nin Singapore,  Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel 12 share more or\r\n\r\nless  the  same contents.  However, while covering news  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious communities,  each has its own characteristics.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame   time,  they  do  not  exclude  coverage  on   the   other\r\n\r\ncommunities.    This  is  to  ensure  that   there   is   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding and familiarisation among the various communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take our Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao, Beritan Harian, and\r\n\r\nTamil  Murasu,  for example.  Although their main  focus  is  on\r\n\r\nSingapore,  regional and international news,  each has  its  own\r\n\r\ncharacteristics   when  covering  events  in  their   respective\r\n\r\ncommunity.   To understand the Chinese society, we  should  read\r\n\r\nLianhe Zaobao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Lianhe Zaobao  also covers the news concerning the Malay and\r\n\r\nIndian  communities as well.   The Straits Times is targeted  at\r\n\r\nthe  English educated and the bilingual readers, but it does not\r\n\r\nneglect the other communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore needs to have newspapers which have their own\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  as well as common points.  Likewise,  Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds  to  have  different  TV channels  which  have  their  own\r\n\r\ncharacteristics as well as common points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am\r\n\r\nquite  happy  with the yardstick adopted by our Film  Censorship\r\n\r\nBoard.

Many foreign film producers are interested  to  come\r\n\r\nand  invest  in  the film industry in Singapore.  However,  they\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  procedure  for  various  applications  is   too\r\n\r\ncomplicated.   They  have  to go from one  Ministry  to  another\r\n\r\nMinistry,  and  one  department to  another,  to  process  their\r\n\r\napplications.  A lot of time is wasted in these procedures.   To\r\n\r\nfilm  a  programme with Singapore as a background, many  permits\r\n\r\nhave to be applied for, and many departments are involved.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  the  film touches on life at a  HDB  estate,  with\r\n\r\nschools,  factories, riverside, etc., applications  have  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  to the HDB, Town Council, URA, National Parks Board,  Land\r\n\r\nOffice,  Ministry  of the Environment, JTC,  etc.   Filming  can\r\n\r\ncommence  only  after permits have been granted by  the  various\r\n\r\nMinistries   and   departments.   It  is   so   cumbersome   and\r\n\r\ntroublesome.  As a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  Jalan Besar Town Council, I have also  received\r\n\r\nletters  from TCS for permission to film the activities  of  our\r\n\r\nJalan  Besar  Town  Council.   Can we  not  simplify  all  these\r\n\r\nprocedures?  If we apply for a permit and must wait for approval\r\n\r\nfrom  each and every agency before anything can be done, it will\r\n\r\ntake  a very long time and this is inconsistent with our pursuit\r\n\r\nfor  high efficiency in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that so long as we have some control over the moral\r\n\r\nvalues  depicted in the films, and our oriental values will  not\r\n\r\nbe  adversely  affected, then we should liberalise and  simplify\r\n\r\nthe  procedures for  permission to film in Singapore.  We should\r\n\r\nprovide  a  one-stop  agency to handle all  these  applications.\r\n\r\nProducers need submit only one application and MITA will be able\r\n\r\nto  coordinate and help them to get the approval so that filming\r\n\r\ncan  commence as soon as possible.  This will be very useful  in\r\n\r\nhelping  Singapore to become a film and movie hub  in  the  Asia\r\n\r\nPacific  area.  I hope that MITA will consider this  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore into a Hollywood of the East.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as Singapore moves\r\n\r\ntowards  high  value-added industries, there should  be  a  more\r\n\r\nconcentrated  effort to develop film as a core art  form  and  a\r\n\r\nmajor  drive  to make Singapore a film industry  centre  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic problems in the region, in South Korea, with\r\n\r\nrecession  in Hong Kong and Japan, the timing looks correct  for\r\n\r\nthis  push.  Unlike other high value-added industries, the  film\r\n\r\nindustry  has low education entry barriers. A wide  spectrum  of\r\n\r\njobs  could be created for a wide range of age groups  from  the\r\n\r\nyoung to the old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ACCESS, the Advisory Committee on TCS Chinese Drama\r\n\r\nand  Variety Show, in its February 1998 Report, also  felt  that\r\n\r\nTCS  had an important role to play in the development of a full-fledged  TV  Centre  and went on to say  that  TCS  support  was\r\n\r\ncrucial for the development of an educated, mature film  and  TV\r\n\r\nprofession  in Singapore.  ACCESS observes that the  recruitment\r\n\r\nof  creative  talents continues to be a concern.  The  Committee\r\n\r\nhopes to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee  a  long  term solution to this issue.  The  Committee  also\r\n\r\nrecommends TCS to widen its search for instructors from  England\r\n\r\nand  the  United States instead of focusing only on  those  from\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  Taiwan and China.  The same report also  recommends\r\n\r\nTCS  to open some of the more general training workshops to non-TCS staff as well so that wider interests could be attracted and\r\n\r\npotential talents nurtured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what measures will MITA take to implement\r\n\r\nthese recommendations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the film industry to take off, there must also be\r\n\r\nalternatives to TCS productions.  More production houses  should\r\n\r\nbe  invited  to Singapore.  Just as my colleague, Mr  Peh  says,\r\n\r\nfilm  companies feel that shooting movies in Singapore has  many\r\n\r\ncomplications  and  they  complain of  difficulties  in  getting\r\n\r\npermission  or permit for location shooting, lack of  supporting\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, post-production and animation facilities.   Film\r\n\r\ncompanies feel that there are too many permits to apply from too\r\n\r\nmany  different Government and statutory bodies before they  can\r\n\r\nstart shooting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MITA could consider setting up a one-stop service\r\n\r\ncentre, as Mr Peh has suggested, which will help film production\r\n\r\nhouses  obtain all the necessary permits and clearance, such  as\r\n\r\nclosure  of  roads  for  location  shooting,  getting  loan   of\r\n\r\nequipment and props from Government bodies like MINDEF  and  the\r\n\r\nPolice.  MITA could perhaps look into the provision of grants to\r\n\r\nassist  local  film companies to bring in talents from  overseas\r\n\r\nfor  local  production.  This could include  grants  for  hiring\r\n\r\ndirectors,  art  directors,  music  directors,  special   effect\r\n\r\ntechnicians and any other talents or skills lacking  here.   The\r\n\r\ntechnology  transfer will help our local talent pool to  develop\r\n\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, a report which I read\r\n\r\nin  the Life Section of the Straits Times on 19th February 1998,\r\n\r\nnoted that studies in the US showed that art and music may  make\r\n\r\nchildren smarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  seems  that  fine arts help the brain to focus  on  learning\r\n\r\nother  skills.  The researcher concluded that there are  logical\r\n\r\nlinks between music and mathematics.  It was also reported,  and\r\n\r\nI  quote,  \"learning  from  the arts can  help  build  emotional\r\n\r\nskills\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that in Singapore we also have embarked\r\n\r\non  an  arts  education  programme.  The National  Arts  Council\r\n\r\nlaunched  last  year the 6th Arts Education Programme  aimed  at\r\n\r\nbringing  the arts to the students through a variety of  events,\r\n\r\nsome  even  staged by the students themselves.  The Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe NAC, Mr Liu Thai Ker, noted that the young formed the second\r\n\r\nlargest  audience  at last year's  Festival of Asian  Performing\r\n\r\nArts.   He  also  pointed out that schools have increased  their\r\n\r\nbookings  for  arts  programmes  and  that  the  Arts  Education\r\n\r\nProgramme has reached about 60% of schools in Singapore.   These\r\n\r\nare  healthy signs of a growing art scene and art following.   I\r\n\r\nam  confident  that  all  this  will  contribute  to  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's vision of a gracious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if the time is not right for MITA, being the\r\n\r\nlead  agency,  in  conjunction with MOE,  to  push  further  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the Arts Programme in Singapore.  I  believe  we\r\n\r\nshould  make  arts part of the core curriculum  for  all  school\r\n\r\nchildren  in  Singapore.  I am not advocating that we  implement\r\n\r\nthis  immediately.  What I am suggesting is that we have a plan,\r\n\r\nsay, an Arts 2005 Plan providing for all schools in Singapore to\r\n\r\neventually have an arts programme in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits that would flow to students from introducing a\r\n\r\nuniversal  arts education will be tremendous.  First,  based  on\r\n\r\nthe study I cited earlier, improvements in the school children's\r\n\r\nacademic performance in key subjects such as mathematics can  be\r\n\r\nachieved.  Secondly, such a programme would help to create  more\r\n\r\nwell-rounded students.  And this is in line with our efforts  to\r\n\r\nmove  away from examination performance as a sole criterion  for\r\n\r\nuniversity admission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arts scene would also benefit tremendously from such a\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn  arts  education programme will help us cultivate and develop\r\n\r\nthe  art  followers of tomorrow.  This is a vital component  for\r\n\r\nthe  development  of a healthy art scene.  Furthermore,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  noted  in  some reports, the arts usually survive  due  to\r\n\r\ngenerous  donations  from individuals and corporations.   It  is\r\n\r\nhighly unlikely that those without an interest in the arts  will\r\n\r\nwant to make generous donations to the arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Arts 2005 Plan which I mentioned must be\r\n\r\napproached  creatively.   I share the concerns  of  MOE  on  the\r\n\r\nburden  that  incorporating the arts into the school  curriculum\r\n\r\nwould  place  on students.  Perhaps this is where MITA  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate arts groups can come in and share their experiences  and\r\n\r\ninsights  in  developing the arts.  I do not believe  we  should\r\n\r\napproach the arts education programme in the same manner  as  we\r\n\r\napproach  a  mathematics  programme,  for  example.   The   arts\r\n\r\ncurriculum need not follow curriculum time.  I believe  that  if\r\n\r\nwe  can  bring together experts from MITA, the arts  groups  and\r\n\r\nMOE,  we can find creative ways to introduce arts to all  school\r\n\r\nchildren in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, let me first\r\n\r\nstart by declaring my interest as a member of the resource panel\r\n\r\nfor  the  National  Arts  Council and a past  recipient  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Arts Award.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we have heard quite a lot about MITA in its\r\n\r\nfunction as censor and controller. I turn more to MITA's role as\r\n\r\npromoter and sponsor.  The comments I have heard from my  fellow\r\n\r\nMPs  have also focused on the arts as an industry, the  arts  as\r\n\r\neducation and perhaps, underlying some of the ideas, a luxury in\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   I  think  that this is  an  important  background\r\n\r\nperception  of  the arts that we need to focus on  during  these\r\n\r\neconomic hard times.  The downturn has led to a budget with less\r\n\r\noperating expenditure for the arts and grants.  I make this  cut\r\n\r\nin order to call for consistent support and attempts to continue\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  and  support of the arts that  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nimprove the quality of life in Singapore.  In making this  call,\r\n\r\nSir, I see that the arts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromotion has two prongs.  The first is of Singapore being a hub\r\n\r\nfor  arts and here the focus is on foreign talent, such as  some\r\n\r\nof  the  large scale musicals we have seen.  The second,  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  hub concept, is that of promoting the indigenous talent  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   In  this sense, our arts policy,  like  so  many\r\n\r\nother   policies  in  Singapore,  demonstrates  tension  between\r\n\r\nattracting  foreign  talent  and giving  sufficient  support  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these hard times, we may have to make hard choices.\r\n\r\nIf  funding  does  go down, we may have to well  decide  between\r\n\r\npriorities, between foreign talent and our own artists,  between\r\n\r\nhub  and  indigenous growth.  Sir, we owe it to our artists  and\r\n\r\nour arts groups to put them first.  Some of these have gone full\r\n\r\ntime.   For  every one large Beauty World there  are  many  more\r\n\r\nexperimental productions which attract an audience  but  do  not\r\n\r\nmake the kind of commercial reward.  I call for this, not in the\r\n\r\nname  of  blind nationalism or parochialism, rather, it  is  the\r\n\r\nessential  difference between a foreign artist and a Singaporean\r\n\r\nartist.   To  me,  Sir,  the  foreign  artist,  no  matter   how\r\n\r\nacclaimed,  no matter how entertaining, no matter how universal,\r\n\r\nwill  fail  to  speak as a Singaporean artist can of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe Singaporean artist can portray us and articulate Singaporean\r\n\r\nlife,  who  we are, and from this particularity, also touch  the\r\n\r\nuniversal.   With  that,  Sir, I ask the  Minister  to  continue\r\n\r\nsupport for art and artists as a whole, but especially a  choice\r\n\r\nmust be made for Singaporean artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I recently saw a full-page print\r\n\r\nadvertisement  by the EDB which reads: \"How do you  reach  three\r\n\r\nbillion people in Asia?  Simply get a desk in Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summarises our vision of becoming the centre or hub in\r\n\r\nAsia  for  the  media and the arts.  I understand, for  example,\r\n\r\nthat   industry  heavyweights  such  as  Discovery,  HBO,   Sony\r\n\r\nEntertainment  - just to name a few - are already in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis is good and I believe we must continue to make every effort\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattract   wire   service   providers,  arts   providers,   major\r\n\r\nexhibitions, theatrical performances and the like to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  must  also examine our regulatory framework to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthese  companies find Singapore an attractive place in which  to\r\n\r\noperate.  I understand, for example, that the move to allow 100%\r\n\r\nforeign  ownership  for  broadcasting companies  has  been  well\r\n\r\nreceived.  This is a good beginning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is whether given the current economic turmoil,\r\n\r\nour  efforts to realise our vision are being cut back or whether\r\n\r\nforeign companies have cut back or avoided setting up operations\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   It  is not uncommon to cut funding  and  reduce\r\n\r\nefforts  in the arts and media when there is an economic crunch.\r\n\r\nHowever, our efforts to consolidate during this period  so  that\r\n\r\nwe  are well placed at the next economic boom must also apply to\r\n\r\nour effort at making Singapore a hub for the media and the arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are investing heavily in many areas. During a briefing\r\n\r\nby  the  Singapore Arts Centre to GPC (MITA), we were told  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is not investing $500 million solely for the  sake  of\r\n\r\nher  three million people.  This investment is meant to have  an\r\n\r\ninternational impact.  I applaud this vision.  And this must  be\r\n\r\nour  vision even in these difficult times.  I read, for example,\r\n\r\nin  the  Asia Magazine of 6-8 March 1998, that there are critics\r\n\r\nof  this vision.  A reader, Mr John Faulkner wrote that,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote,  \"the  SAC  could  be one of the  most  celebrated  white\r\n\r\nelephant  in  Asia:\".  I am confident that  he  will  be  proven\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to double its efforts at\r\n\r\nrealising  our vision.  We need not beat our chest  and  declare\r\n\r\nthis  to  the  world.   Let us work quietly but  conscientiously\r\n\r\ntowards this dream.  I would like an update from the Minister on\r\n\r\nwhat more is being done by MITA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making ourselves into a hub does not entail just providing\r\n\r\nbuildings  and a good regulatory framework.  That  is  the  easy\r\n\r\npart.   We  must also ensure that our people are interested  in,\r\n\r\nand support and donate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerously to the arts.  It is also important to ensure that our\r\n\r\npeople  can  pursue  careers in the arts in  a  financially  and\r\n\r\nintellectually  supportive environment.  I have been  told  that\r\n\r\narts groups in Singapore are constantly in search of funds.  And\r\n\r\nwe  have just heard Mr Tay appealing on behalf of our local arts\r\n\r\ngroup.   I  support  his appeal and I wish MITA  could  consider\r\n\r\nfurther ways of assisting these groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us do more to ensure that the successes that we\r\n\r\nhave achieved thus far in the arts are not whittled away by  the\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown.  If so, our dream of becoming a hub  for  the\r\n\r\narts and the media may just become a pipe dream.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, busking was introduced on 1st\r\n\r\nOctober  1997.

They  create\r\n\r\nopportunities for both local and foreign artistes to be creative\r\n\r\nand, hopefully, lead to the development of youth interest in the\r\n\r\narts and also participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe we should further encourage busking in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  current  form of controlled  busking  has  its\r\n\r\nbenefits.

I, therefore, would like to urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  make  the  application for  busking  licence  more\r\n\r\naccessible  and to also consider allowing busking in HDB  towns,\r\n\r\nand not just be confined to public parks and open spaces managed\r\n\r\nby  the  National  Parks Board and pedestrian malls  at  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister, therefore, give the House an update on\r\n\r\nhis Ministry's latest thinking on busking?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran is not here.

Turnover for such sex-related information on the Internet\r\n\r\ncomes  up to  billions of US dollars. Apart from providing  nude\r\n\r\npictures, these sex websites also provide pornographic materials\r\n\r\nsuch  as  \"digital striptease shows\" and \"exotic  nude  videos\",\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our young people can gain access to these undesirable\r\n\r\nwebsites  without  paying a single cent for  it.   In  order  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  healthy growth of our children and  young  people,\r\n\r\nand to prevent these sex-mongers from promoting such undesirable\r\n\r\nactivities  on the Internet, we should pass more stringent  laws\r\n\r\nto  regulate and shut out such pornographic information  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.

Of  course,\r\n\r\nISPs  will  argue that filtering software such as  NetNanny  and\r\n\r\nCyber  Patrol  and many others, are available and parents  could\r\n\r\nput  such filtering software in their children's PCs.  But  most\r\n\r\nparents today are not so well versed as their children when they\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  computers and the Internet.   Most  probably  the\r\n\r\nparents will have to ask their children to install the filtering\r\n\r\nsoftware and the children may not even do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many school children are today asked to do research on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet.  Children learn to use different search  engines.\r\n\r\nBut  once the children know how to use the search engines,  they\r\n\r\nget access to much information, including those not suitable for\r\n\r\nthem.   Currently, there is also no system of classification  or\r\n\r\nage restriction that is enforceable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, SBA could make available tools for parents to protect\r\n\r\ntheir  children.   ISPs could be encouraged  to  offer  filtered\r\n\r\nInternet  access  with web filtering software installed  at  the\r\n\r\nserver level.  Children's safe zones which offer monitored  safe\r\n\r\nsites  for kids could be created.  This service could be offered\r\n\r\nto  schools  and  parents who want cleaner Internet  access  for\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, shall I proceed to the next amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, since last year, many Chinese-based\r\n\r\nInternet sites have been developed.  According to the China  Net\r\n\r\nInformation Centre, there are over 49,000 homes and 250,000  PCs\r\n\r\nconnected to the Chinese Internet.  Meanwhile, Chinese  Internet\r\n\r\nhas grown into bandwidth to accommodate an increasing number  of\r\n\r\nusers,  estimated to hit some three to four million in China  by\r\n\r\nthe year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this development, many large databases with important\r\n\r\nbusiness  and education information and a vast pool of knowledge\r\n\r\nare  now  available on Chinese Internet sites.  With  the  rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  on-line  networking for  Chinese-based  information,\r\n\r\nChinese  Internet  becomes  a whole new  field  of  opportunity,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  many  Singaporeans who  are  today  effectively\r\n\r\nbilingual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA could encourage the development and expansion of usage\r\n\r\nof Chinese-based Internet services, so that Singaporeans will be\r\n\r\nable  to tap two huge reservoirs of knowledge in English and  in\r\n\r\nChinese.   Sir,  encouraging  the development  of  Chinese-based\r\n\r\nInternet  will  also  speed  up the development  of  double-byte\r\n\r\ncomputing   technology,  extending  our  development  capability\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  single-byte computing technology used  in  English-based Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what measures will be taken to drive\r\n\r\nthis  development  and provide the direction  for  technological\r\n\r\nresearch in this area?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in October last year,\r\n\r\nthe  web  page of Lianhe Zaobao attracted more than  10  million\r\n\r\nvisitors,  and this makes it an international on-line newspaper.\r\n\r\nIt  is  something  that  we  can rejoice  in.   This  shows  the\r\n\r\npopularity  of  the  Internet which  enables  Lianhe  Zaobao  to\r\n\r\ntranscend  geographical and national boundaries  to  extend  its\r\n\r\ninfluence throughout the world, and not just confined to a small\r\n\r\nnation like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  enables the newspaper to  break  through  the\r\n\r\nrestriction  of  having  just  a small  readership  of  Chinese-educated Singaporeans, and expand its market to the whole world.\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking readers all over the world can now gain  access\r\n\r\nto  information on Singapore through the Internet, and thus have\r\n\r\na  better understanding of Singapore.  This is very important to\r\n\r\nthe internationalistion of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the English Internet has been extensively used\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and  information activities on the Net  are  very\r\n\r\nbusy  and frequent.  This strengthens our exchanges and contacts\r\n\r\nwith  the  world  and opens up new channels  for  us  to  access\r\n\r\ninformation.   But in terms of the development  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nInternet,  we  are lagging behind.  At the moment, the  Internet\r\n\r\nmarket  in  China  is  developing  very  quickly  and  all   the\r\n\r\ngovernment  agencies,  universities,  research  institutes   and\r\n\r\nbusiness community are making more and more use of the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere  are also more and more people using Chinese all over  the\r\n\r\nworld.  If  we can promote and develop the Chinese  Internet  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it  will help us to promote our exchanges with  other\r\n\r\nChinese communities from various parts of the world.  This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  promote our exchanges in terms of culture,  trade  and\r\n\r\nindustry,   technology,   etc.     This   has   very   important\r\n\r\nsignificance in realizing our dream of going regional.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Information and the Arts can\r\n\r\nmake  a  study on how to promote the use of Chinese Internet  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nNational  Courtesy Campaign has been around for many years  now.\r\n\r\nIt  is  held with the hope of creating a more gracious  society.\r\n\r\nWith  the rapid pace of advances in technology, the courtesy  or\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  it  continues to affect our quality  of  life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As a result, the nature of courtesy has to take  new\r\n\r\nand different forms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me talk about the growing trend of the lack\r\n\r\nof handphone courtesy.  I think the advent of handphones has not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  made us busier but has also made some of us in our society\r\n\r\nbecome  ruder.   We  need to remember that restaurants,  private\r\n\r\nclubs,  libraries,  theatres, auditoriums and conferences,  etc.\r\n\r\nare  public  places  and  the basic  human  courtesy  should  be\r\n\r\nexpected and extended to the public and it should be the  public\r\n\r\nnorm.  I  am  sure  that Members of this  House  would  be  very\r\n\r\nirritated  when someone's phone rings like this.   Let  me  try,\r\n\r\nSir. [Demonstrating].  It is very irritating, as you can see.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was this person who told me that at his business\r\n\r\nassociation's  monthly meeting one of his  fellow  businessmen's\r\n\r\nphone  rang  and he whipped out his handphone oblivious  of  the\r\n\r\noccasion and went on loudly and said, \"Ah Beng, can you buy  for\r\n\r\nme  this number 1234, 10 big and five small.\"  Sir, is this  not\r\n\r\ntotally discourteous and something that we should frown upon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then there was another occasion when a stage\r\n\r\nperformance   was  in  progress  at  the  World   Trade   Centre\r\n\r\nAuditorium.   While  the  play was  entering  an  emotional  and\r\n\r\nsentimental  scene, a handphone rang.  The handphone  owner  who\r\n\r\nwas  seated at the second row unhesitantly whipped up his  phone\r\n\r\nand   spoke  so  loudly,  seemingly  again  oblivious   of   the\r\n\r\nsurroundings.   Needless  to say, the audience's  attention  was\r\n\r\nangrily  shifted from the stage to him.  But he went on  despite\r\n\r\nvoices of strong disapproval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister that it is time that\r\n\r\nwe made the theme of this year's National Courtesy Campaign such\r\n\r\nthat  it is focused on courtesy or the lack of it, brought about\r\n\r\nby  technological gadgets like handphones, pagers and  also  the\r\n\r\nproblems of e-mail.  So we need to educate the public on how  to\r\n\r\nuse   these   gadgets  so  that  Singaporeans  do   not   become\r\n\r\ninconsiderate of others around them.  Sir, I do not have time to\r\n\r\nexplain the discourtesies of e-mailers, both \"he-mailers and fe-mailers\",  who  put up rude and irresponsible outbursts  on  the\r\n\r\nNet,  especially  in the Internet chat groups like  `soc.culture\r\n\r\nsingapore'.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  some  of  them  use pseudonyms which  therefore  cannot\r\n\r\nidentify them, the law cannot get onto them. Instead, we  suffer\r\n\r\nas we try to find out what is on the Net.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their outbursts are totally ungracious and\r\n\r\nirresponsible.  Again, I would urge the Minister that we have to\r\n\r\ntackle  this problem not just by legislation, but by  trying  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  them  through  other  means  such  as  the  courtesy\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us work on creating a technologically advanced but\r\n\r\ngracious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I would like to commend the good\r\n\r\nwork  done by the National Heritage Board.  We have more museums\r\n\r\nthan we had originally.  We are not just serving our own people,\r\n\r\nbut also people from other parts of the world who want to get  a\r\n\r\nflavour  of  our  past  can do so.   And  I  am  glad  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has done so much in an area which cannot be mentioned\r\n\r\nin dollars and cents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to touch on is the buildings.\r\n\r\nSir,  many  buildings which would have been demolished  are  now\r\n\r\npreserved.  Thanks to the National Heritage Board.  This  is  of\r\n\r\ncourse  a historical heritage which we are bequeathing  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneration  to  come to cherish and enjoy.  In this  context,  a\r\n\r\nshophouse  in Telok Ayer Street, where the Anglo-Chinese  School\r\n\r\nstarted, was preserved by an old boy of the school.  Such an act\r\n\r\nof  generosity should be applauded.  I hope other members of the\r\n\r\npublic,  who  are  owners  of buildings  with  historical  link,\r\n\r\nwhether  started  by an association, school or  even  a  clinic,\r\n\r\nshould try to preserve them.  I hope the National Heritage Board\r\n\r\nwould  get  in touch with them and assist them, not by financial\r\n\r\nmeans but by historical research.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we take a walk along London street, we come across\r\n\r\nmany  buildings and plaques saying that a governor or  a  writer\r\n\r\nhad stayed or was born there.  I hope we too could have this.  I\r\n\r\nknow  there are some streets with plaques at the corner.   There\r\n\r\nare   many   roads  which  are  named  after  many   illustrious\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  we  should try to find out  their  historical\r\n\r\nlink.  How many people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  about  Kim  Seng Street or Jiak Kim Street?   There  is  a\r\n\r\nhistory behind it.  Take, for example, Coleman Street.  There is\r\n\r\na plaque which was beautifully done.  Unfortunately, maybe it is\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  weather the inscription has faded, and  it  is  so\r\n\r\ndifficult for one to read now.  It serves no purpose.  So if  we\r\n\r\nwant to do it, do it well.  I would urge the Minister to ask his\r\n\r\nofficials  to look around for such buildings.  How  many  of  us\r\n\r\nknow where the Trade Unions Building was?  None.  Where was  the\r\n\r\ncommunist party operating from?  Where did many of the political\r\n\r\nparties  start off?  This is a historical wealth.  I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to go in because time is not on our side.   Many\r\n\r\nof the buildings would be torn down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may illustrate, recently, there was a building in\r\n\r\nLittle  India  at Dunlop Street, which was first  started  by  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of Hindi community speakers in 1910 or 1920.  Some people\r\n\r\nwanted to buy it.  Unfortunately, the price was too high.   They\r\n\r\ncould  not buy it.  But they were hoping that a plaque could  be\r\n\r\nconstructed  there.  I will be writing to the  Minister  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse and hope that he will give consideration to this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that we recognise the good work of the\r\n\r\nNational  Heritage Board.  Every member of the  public  who  has\r\n\r\nknowledge  of a historical building should do his own  research,\r\n\r\nfind out how it started and pass it to the Government so that we\r\n\r\ncould preserve it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo): Sir, I would like to thank Members for their\r\n\r\ncomments  and suggestions.  This year I notice that,  when  many\r\n\r\nMembers  were raising problems or challenges to MITA, they  also\r\n\r\nbuilt  into their comments and suggestions the recognition that,\r\n\r\nvery  often, what we are trying to do is a question of  balance.\r\n\r\nAnd the entire cut has been characterised by two threads running\r\n\r\nthrough:  One thread wanting Singapore to open up, to be a media\r\n\r\nhub, to promote the film industry, to bring in talent, satellite\r\n\r\ndishes, second Chinese newspaper, and so on.  Then there is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecond  thread  running through, which is,  but  please  let  us\r\n\r\npreserve our identity, let us control TCS, let us not forget  to\r\n\r\ncensor,  yes, more Internet but be careful of Internet,  protect\r\n\r\nour young, and so on.  These two threads are entangled.  And  if\r\n\r\nwe  have one without the other, both will come off and both must\r\n\r\nsomehow be woven into our social fabric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we had the debate in this House about bond breaking,\r\n\r\nthe  issue there really is what kind of people do we want to be.\r\n\r\nWe  want to be a big tree with branches spreading everywhere and\r\n\r\na  huge canopy.  But big trees catch big winds and the tree  can\r\n\r\ntopple  unless the roots are very deep, especially in a  crisis.\r\n\r\nSo  the challenge to us is to grow but at the same time to  sink\r\n\r\nroots.   And, paradoxically, the more we want to grow, the  more\r\n\r\nwe  must  sink  roots.   The  more we  want  one  thread  to  be\r\n\r\naccentuated, the more we must colour the other thread  as  well.\r\n\r\nThen  our  fabric  would  be strong.   But  otherwise,  we  lose\r\n\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this really is what we try very hard to do in all our\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in  MITA,  to  promote  the  external  dimension  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   but,   at  the  same  time,  to  ensure   that   our\r\n\r\nunderpinnings are strong and become stronger year by year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to address the specific points raised by\r\n\r\nMembers.  First, the Internet.  Both Mr Peh Chin Hua and  Dr  Ho\r\n\r\nTat  Kin  touched on the explosive growth of the  Internet,  the\r\n\r\neffects of pornographic and other undesirable sites on the young\r\n\r\nand the way children are catching on to the e-mail.  Here, there\r\n\r\nis  a generational divide.  It is very difficult for parents  to\r\n\r\ninstall  the software programmes to protect their children  when\r\n\r\ntheir  children  know  much more about  the  computer  than  the\r\n\r\nparents  do.   We have grappled long and hard with this  problem\r\n\r\nand  SBA  has decided that by the end of this year, all Internet\r\n\r\nService Providers in Singapore will be required by regulation to\r\n\r\nprovide  an  option for all parents, a cleaner,  more  sanitised\r\n\r\nInternet  service  which will build in at  the  server  level  a\r\n\r\nsoftware  filter  programme like Cyber  Patrol,  Surf  Watch  or\r\n\r\nNetNanny.  There are many available now in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not really want to specify the particular one for\r\n\r\nwhich  the Internet Service Provider should offer as an  option.\r\n\r\nBut an option should be given to parents and should be available\r\n\r\nin  schools and public libraries.  So if we, as parents,  get  a\r\n\r\nrequest from our children to have Internet installed and  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  know too much about it, then at least we know enough to put\r\n\r\na  tick that it should be the Family Access Network and not  the\r\n\r\ngeneral service Internet which you may not want your children to\r\n\r\nhave  until they have reached a certain age.  I think this  will\r\n\r\nprovide  something more practical for parents to have.   But  of\r\n\r\ncourse  whatever  safer,  cleaner,  more  sanitised  option   we\r\n\r\nprovide, it cannot be 100%.  Indeed, if it is even 70%  to  80%,\r\n\r\nthat is already very good, and do not expect that there could be\r\n\r\nany  service which is provided which will ensure that everything\r\n\r\nthat comes into the home is completely clean and sanitised.   It\r\n\r\nis  not possible.  But it should be better than what is commonly\r\n\r\navailable.  However, there is a price to be paid.  Otherwise, we\r\n\r\nwill  introduce it for everybody.  The price to be paid is there\r\n\r\nwill  be a certain degradation of the Internet service but which\r\n\r\nshould not matter too much for young people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA is also encouraging a voluntary code of good practice\r\n\r\nand  encouraging web sites in Singapore to classify  themselves.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  big  problem all over the world.  Every  regulatory\r\n\r\nauthority in the world is grappling with this problem.  There is\r\n\r\nstill no consensus.  People are meeting and talking.  I think we\r\n\r\nshould also keep up with the technology, try certain things  and\r\n\r\neventually work out a system of regulation which best suits  our\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new phenomenon of the Internet is a big thing. It\r\n\r\nwill  change  human history.  It is like fire.   Once  fire  has\r\n\r\narrived,  you  cannot  ban  it.  You cannot  say,  \"Well,  let's\r\n\r\ndisinvent fire.\"  You can regulate fire.  But you cannot prevent\r\n\r\nit.   You cannot control it properly.  The only way to handle  a\r\n\r\nnew  technology like fire is to teach every young child.  So all\r\n\r\nof  us,  as  parents, as part of our education  of  raising  the\r\n\r\nyoung, is to teach them how to strike a matchstick and to  learn\r\n\r\nto respect fire as a force for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboth  good  and  evil.   Of  course,  public  authority  has   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility to provide fire hydrants and have the fire  code.\r\n\r\nBut  at  the end of the day, the technology must be internalised\r\n\r\nwithin every individual.  All our children will grow up with not\r\n\r\nonly a postal address but also an e-mail address.  When they  go\r\n\r\nhome,  when  they go to the office, you do not just  check  your\r\n\r\nmail  box  which all of us do, you check your e-mail, you  check\r\n\r\nyour  voicemail,  your  check your fax machine.   Yes,  life  is\r\n\r\nbecoming more complicated and for those of us who are older,  it\r\n\r\nis  becoming somewhat confusing.  But the young ones, they  must\r\n\r\nbe prepared for this new age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Ho and Mr Peh Chin Hua talked about the importance\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese  Internet.  I fully agree with their  point  of\r\n\r\nview.   Right  now, the English Language websites  dominate  the\r\n\r\nworld,  and  if  you do not know English, you are  at  a  severe\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.   But  the  Chinese  universe  is  expanding  very\r\n\r\nrapidly.  All kinds of figures have been offered.  By the end of\r\n\r\nthe  century, there will be 2-4 million Internet users in China.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  know  that  Chinese is the fastest  growing  foreign\r\n\r\nlanguage,  taught  and  learnt in the whole  world,  because  of\r\n\r\nChina's economic progress.  It would be very foolish of us  when\r\n\r\nmany  of our people have a mastery of both not to dive into  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Internet as well.  Language is a very high  barrier  to\r\n\r\nentry.  If you do not know it, to acquire enough skills and then\r\n\r\nto  develop the inputting systems and to master the nuances  and\r\n\r\nsubtleties, it is impossible.  But if we get our young people on\r\n\r\nto  it  when their minds are still flexible, then we will  equip\r\n\r\nthem  with  an advantage which will see them through  throughout\r\n\r\nlife.   And it will also position Singapore wonderfully  between\r\n\r\nthe English-speaking world and the Chinese-speaking world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate this, MITA has set up a Chinese Internet\r\n\r\nSteering  Committee.  It is chaired by Prof. Wee Chou  How  from\r\n\r\nthe  University.  He is also the Chairman of our Speak  Mandarin\r\n\r\nCampaign.   In  it,  we have many members from  a  broad  cross-section  of society, including technologists like Sim Wong  Hoo.\r\n\r\nThe list will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreleased this afternoon to the media.  The idea is to study  the\r\n\r\nproblem and the opportunities, to address all aspects, inputting\r\n\r\nsystems,   double   byte  technology,  creation   of   websites,\r\n\r\nclassification and so on, in order that, comprehensively, across\r\n\r\nthe  whole  country, we move our people into it.  And then  when\r\n\r\nInternet fully takes off in China and becomes important  in  the\r\n\r\nworld, our people are fully equipped to access this universe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On television and radio, many speakers have asked me about\r\n\r\nwhat is our long-term objective.  We know that for stations like\r\n\r\nChannel 8, viewership is on the decline.  I think this is a long-term  trend because of SCV and the Internet.  Then why have SCV?\r\n\r\nAnd what is the proper relationship between TCS, TV12 and SCV?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recall for Members the general approach\r\n\r\nthat my Ministry has been taking for the last 6-7 years.  First,\r\n\r\nwe  saw the challenge of satellite television, and how this will\r\n\r\neventually  erode our ability to monopolise TV  broadcasting  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So,  to  prepare  for  the  day  when  it   becomes\r\n\r\nimpossible to keep out satellites, we forced the corporatisation\r\n\r\nof  TCS  and forced it to become more responsive to the  market.\r\n\r\nIt  used to be run as a department of state, as a civil service.\r\n\r\nThen  RTS  became  SBC,  then TCS.  And  we  freed  up  internal\r\n\r\nprocedures  so  that they can hire and fire.  And  they  had  to\r\n\r\nwatch  ratings.   Of  course, in the  process,  they  made  many\r\n\r\nmistakes.   But  had  we not forced SBC into  restructuring  and\r\n\r\nprivatisation, I do not think we would be where we are now.  And\r\n\r\nsince   corporatisation,  programming   hours   have   increased\r\n\r\ntremendously    news, current affairs, dramas and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we try to keep satellite TV at bay for as\r\n\r\nlong as possible, while recognising that one day it will come in\r\n\r\nno matter what we do.  And when that day comes, we will probably\r\n\r\nchange our regulations to say, \"Okay, now we accept satellites.\"\r\n\r\nBut while it is possible to keep it out, we keep it out in order\r\n\r\nto buy time for local broadcasters and local programme producers\r\n\r\nto become better.  And for them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  become  better, we have got to put the spurs into  them,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  subject  to external pressures  and  they  face\r\n\r\ncompetition.  At the same time, we did not want Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nbe  denied  of  programming choice and of access  to  broadband.\r\n\r\nWhat  did  we  do?  We embarked on a programme to cable  up  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Singapore.  Unlike Indonesia or Malaysia,  we  are  a\r\n\r\ncompact  city  state.   90%  of our  people  live  in  high-rise\r\n\r\napartments.   It  is  not  feasible, to begin  with,  for  every\r\n\r\nhousehold to stick out a satellite dish.  Satellite dishes  work\r\n\r\non  the  basis  of line of sight.  We cannot just cantilever  it\r\n\r\nout.  We put it on top of our rooftops.  In the old days, we had\r\n\r\nTV antennas on our rooftops and they made it look as if we had a\r\n\r\nfull  head of hair.  Today, if we have dishes all over, we  look\r\n\r\nlike a golliwog.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the position we take? We treat Singapore as a\r\n\r\nheavily  cabled local area network, which is Singapore One,  big\r\n\r\ndishes  to take in all signals from all major satellites in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  all  kinds  of  broadband  cables,  T1,  T2,  T3  lines,\r\n\r\nconnected  to the major hubs in the world and, within Singapore,\r\n\r\nto  progressively  remove bandwidth as a constraint.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  our  strategy for survival is not to think that  we  can\r\n\r\nkeep  out the water, but to channel the water.  And to tell  the\r\n\r\nlocal  broadcasters that they have got to swim  in  this  water.\r\n\r\nThey  have got to give up dry land.  And these are the pressures\r\n\r\nand  the  tensions that we face.  If we say, \"TCS,  don't  worry\r\n\r\nabout  viewership.  Concentrate on the good stuff  news, current\r\n\r\naffairs, local programming, \"Today in Parliament\", that  is  the\r\n\r\neasiest  thing for them to do.  Any civil servant can  do  that,\r\n\r\nand they will do it with distinction.  But that is not the skill\r\n\r\nthat  they  need to survive in this new environment.  They  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  watch ratings.  They have got to accept the programming\r\n\r\nneed to change from day to day, from week to week, and they must\r\n\r\nbe very responsive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, on the one hand, we should not give them a free hand.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, we want them to develop swimming skills  and\r\n\r\nto force them to learn quickly.  We throw them into the deep end\r\n\r\nand  some will, from time to time, reach out for help, gasp  for\r\n\r\nair, and then we rescue them and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntry  them again.  But I agree with Mr Choo Wee Khiang  that some\r\n\r\nof  them  may be bad swimmers whatever we do.  Maybe  we  should\r\n\r\ntake them out of the pool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA is constantly caught between these two requirements, on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, to maintain a certain level of public programming\r\n\r\nwhile,  at  the same time, understanding that the only  way  for\r\n\r\nTCS, TV12 and RCS to survive is to swim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the long-term position that we want? Our hope is\r\n\r\nfor our national broadcasters eventually to have a position like\r\n\r\nthat of the BBC in England.  Today, the BBC operates in quite  a\r\n\r\nfree  environment of competition, they still  have  50%  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket share, with BBC1, BBC2 and the various stations on FM.  I\r\n\r\nmet  John Birt recently and he told me that, with the advent  of\r\n\r\ndigital  television, they have got to keep on moving.  And  from\r\n\r\nthis year or next year, they are starting seven new TV stations,\r\n\r\nin  addition to BBC1 and BBC2, three based on public funding and\r\n\r\nthe  other  four commercially funded, including a  24-hour  news\r\n\r\nchannel and various other things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge is not over. Digital TV, Internet TV, will\r\n\r\nconfront  us  with new challenges and we must  ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nlocal stations maintain their dominance in the English language,\r\n\r\nChinese language, Malay language, Tamil, in radio and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In radio, despite fierce competition from abroad and from\r\n\r\nNTUC  and SAFRA, RCS has managed to maintain dominance in  every\r\n\r\nsegment,  and they have done well.  TCS and TV12 will face  more\r\n\r\ncompetition, particularly from SCV.  What should they  do?   The\r\n\r\nstrategy really is to concentrate on local programming,  because\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  most difficult for international broadcasters  to\r\n\r\ntake  away from them.  It is not easy for a local radio  station\r\n\r\nto  compete  with  the  BBC  or  CNN.   But  none  of  us  would\r\n\r\nexclusively watch CNN or exclusively listen to BBC.  Our day  is\r\n\r\nnot  complete  until we have also tuned in to  our  local  radio\r\n\r\nstation,  local  TV station, read our local newspapers.   So  we\r\n\r\nmust ensure that our local newspapers, local television stations\r\n\r\nand local radio stations are able to maintain a certain position\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndominance and credibility in our hearts and in our minds.  If we\r\n\r\nsay,  only  good stuff, unfortunately, a lot of  good  stuff  is\r\n\r\nboring.   After  a long day's work, and Singaporeans  work  very\r\n\r\nhard,  they  go back home, they are not going to  read  War  and\r\n\r\nPeace.    They  want entertainment.  They want something  simple\r\n\r\nand  easy to digest.  They sit back, be couch potatoes for a few\r\n\r\nminutes at the end of a hard day.  And what we try to do  is  to\r\n\r\nbuild  in some education, some social values into the programmes\r\n\r\nthat we put out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very elaborate programming code for\r\n\r\nbroadcasters.  They breach it from time to time.  And when  they\r\n\r\ndo, I think we should rap their knuckles.  But we should not rap\r\n\r\nthem so hard as to stifle their creativity.  And to help SBA  do\r\n\r\nthis,  they have worked out with the industry a system of fines.\r\n\r\nSo  sometime towards the end of this year, SBA will say,  \"Okay,\r\n\r\nthese  are the programming guidelines.  They were arrived at  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the industry.  If you make a mistake, we  will\r\n\r\nfine  you,  maybe  $1,000.  If you are a repeated  offender  and\r\n\r\nseriously offensive, we may fine you $50,000.\"  The objective is\r\n\r\nnot  to  inflict  financial hardship.  It is to send  a  signal.\r\n\r\nEven  within a TV station, there are many players in competition\r\n\r\nwith  each other.  From time to time, they get offside  and  the\r\n\r\nreferee may have to wave a card.  And I think this is a  way  of\r\n\r\ninstitutionalising a process by which those who are recalcitrant\r\n\r\nare told off, and it will help the industry too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank Members and PAC and ACCESS committee members\r\n\r\nfor  bringing  to our attention programmes which  have  been  in\r\n\r\nbreach like,  Zhuo Ai Jin Shen and Chang He which, I agree, were\r\n\r\nscreened  at the wrong times.  They were screened during  family\r\n\r\nhours between 7-10 pm when adult themes were in the series.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong talked about how TCS did not cover Wang\r\n\r\nSa's  death.   I was overseas at that time.  He was  one  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents and he turned up for one of my block  parties.   At\r\n\r\nthat time, he had weak legs.  What struck me was that every  one\r\n\r\nin  the  block party stood up when he walked into the  compound.\r\n\r\nSuch was the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect  and  reverence  they had for  him.   People  were  very\r\n\r\ncourteous.  They were very keen to meet him, because  he  was  a\r\n\r\nfigure  whom  they  remembered with great nostalgia,  especially\r\n\r\namong older Singaporeans.  I think it was a mistake for TCS  not\r\n\r\nto  have  understood  this immediately and reported  his  death.\r\n\r\nThey did subsequently, after criticisms.  They made up.  But, at\r\n\r\nthat  time, somehow the instincts were not there and  I  suspect\r\n\r\npartly  because young journalists, young editors, did not  quite\r\n\r\nunderstand.  And for these things, we cannot specify in advance.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not possible.  There must be a certain deep feeling  for\r\n\r\nwhat  we are and where we have come from.  If you are not rooted\r\n\r\nhere,  if  you are a journalist or an editor who has  just  been\r\n\r\nbrought  in  from Hong Kong, Taiwan or whatever, you  would  not\r\n\r\nunderstand who is Wang Sa and how he made us laugh and cry  some\r\n\r\ntime ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I agree with Mr Shriniwas Rai that our stations and our\r\n\r\nnews crews should ensure that while they should cover their  own\r\n\r\nmarket  segments,  there  must be a  core  which  makes  us  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  In other words, whether you tune to TV12,  Prime,\r\n\r\nPremiere,  Channel 5 or Channel 8, and listen  to  the  news  in\r\n\r\nMalay,  Chinese  or Tamil, at the end of the day,  it  is  still\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore.  So when a big issue like Singapore's position\r\n\r\nin  the  financial  crisis comes up, there should  be  a  common\r\n\r\nposition  across all the news stations.  And this  is  what  the\r\n\r\nnewsroom  tries  to do.  They define a core  but  they  allow  a\r\n\r\nperiphery which is for the particular ethnic station to decide.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked if we could not have longer reports\r\n\r\non  Parliament  and have it at prime time.  We have  tried  many\r\n\r\nformulas  in  the  past.   At  one  stage,  Mr  Rai  might  have\r\n\r\nforgotten,  we actually carried the Budget session live  in  the\r\n\r\nafternoon,  and  the viewership was so low, it  was  funny,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps an insult to MPs.  So gingerly we retreated and we said,\r\n\r\n\"No,  no.  We  only  cover it when the issues  warrant  coverage\r\n\r\nduring prime time.\"  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  we  have  got  it about right now.  The  key  points  are\r\n\r\nsummarised, encapsuled and put out in news times, it is on InTV,\r\n\r\nit  is  carried.  Then 15 minutes at the end of the news, it  is\r\n\r\nnot too big a pill to swallow.  But if you have it too long, too\r\n\r\nextended, I think the viewership will plummet.  And we  have  to\r\n\r\nworry  about  viewership.   If our  viewers  develop  a  certain\r\n\r\nantagonism, a certain negative attitude, towards our  television\r\n\r\nstations, they will not turn to it routinely.  You know how some\r\n\r\nmagazines turn us off.  And even when they arrive on our  desks,\r\n\r\nthey go out to the out-tray immediately.  While others, you will\r\n\r\nalways leaf through.  This is the kind of position which all our\r\n\r\nstations  should try to maintain.  When digital TV  arrives,  we\r\n\r\nmay  have  to  unbundle even more to ensure  that  every  market\r\n\r\nsegment is properly looked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On TCS coverage of the SilkAir accident, in fact, TCS gave\r\n\r\na  lot of coverage to SilkAir.  The problem, I believe, was that\r\n\r\nfor  certain  news  breaking items, foreign  news  stations  and\r\n\r\nforeign  journalists cover them before us. And that is  because,\r\n\r\nas  national broadcasters, TCS has a special responsibility  for\r\n\r\naccurate  news  reporting.  They  could  not  confirm  that   an\r\n\r\naeroplane  was  missing until CAAS told them  so.   Others  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to  speculate and they could, because if they  make  a\r\n\r\nmistake they make a mistake.  But CAAS cannot make that mistake,\r\n\r\nand TCS cannot make that mistake.  The price we pay for that  is\r\n\r\nthat occasionally we may be a few minutes behind other stations,\r\n\r\nbut it is a price well worth paying for the credibility that our\r\n\r\nstations enjoy among Singaporeans and in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully sympathise with Mr Rai's request for more Indian\r\n\r\nprogrammes, but it is difficult.  For television, 16% of funding\r\n\r\ngoes  to  Indian programmes compared to 23% for Malay,  34%  for\r\n\r\nChinese  and 26% for English programmes.  For radio, the  Indian\r\n\r\nstation get 33% of the revenues as opposed to 53% for Malay,  0%\r\n\r\nfor Chinese and 14% for English.  Within this budget allocation,\r\n\r\nwe can try to do more.  As Members know, Mr Dhanabalan chairs  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  try  and improve our programming  but  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain limits to what we can do and I hope our Indian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naudiences will understand this.  Even  Tamil Murasu has  a  very\r\n\r\nlow  circulation of less than 10,000 and finds it hard to  break\r\n\r\neven, which was why they sold out to SPH.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether we have plans to provide\r\n\r\nmore  radio services to enhance our position as an international\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre.  In fact, we do.  We have managed to  squeeze\r\n\r\nout  three additional FM frequencies.  RCS will be launching  an\r\n\r\nall news station in October 1998.  They can do this because they\r\n\r\nalready run a 24-hour news room.  The factory is there.   It  is\r\n\r\ncreating another product.  That additional product will be a 24-hour news radio.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are prepared now to have an international\r\n\r\nfinancial news station on FM, and we have discussed this with  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of foreign operators, like Bloomberg and Reuters.   Some\r\n\r\nhave  expressed  interest. We will tender  out  that  particular\r\n\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to serve the various foreign communities in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  are  also  planning for an  international  radio\r\n\r\nstation  to broadcast in French, German and Japanese.  But  this\r\n\r\nwill depend on private sponsorship because I do not think it  is\r\n\r\nright to use public funds for this purpose.  All this will  help\r\n\r\nenhance our hub status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable TV, particularly the cabling of private estates, was\r\n\r\nraised  by  a number of MPs such as  Mr Chew Heng Ching  and  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran.  By the end of this year, all apartment blocks, HDB and\r\n\r\nprivate, will be cabled up.  The last and most difficult bit  is\r\n\r\nthe  landed  properties because they are scattered over  a  wide\r\n\r\narea  and we do not allow overhead cabling in Singapore.  If  we\r\n\r\nallow  overhead cabling in Singapore, this is not a problem,  we\r\n\r\ncan  just  hang  it from pole to pole and get into  your  house.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  require it to be dug under.  This is a  matter  of\r\n\r\npublic  policy and it has been so for a long time.   This  makes\r\n\r\ncabling rather more expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV is required by its licence to ensure that all estates\r\n\r\nare  passed through by the end of 1999, which means that if  you\r\n\r\nlive  in a semi-detached, or a terrace house or a bungalow,  and\r\n\r\nyou want it, you can have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit.   But  you  may have to pay for it, depending on  where  you\r\n\r\nlive.   If these are town houses and compact, then you will  pay\r\n\r\nless.  If you are living in a sprawling bungalow area, then  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay more.  Even if you have to pay $2,000 for a  house\r\n\r\nwhich   is   worth   $10  million,  I  do  not   think   it   is\r\n\r\ndisproportionate.  It is not quite right to ask  for  a  subsidy\r\n\r\nfor  the  small  number of Singaporeans who are already  in  the\r\n\r\nhighest  income  bracket to be subsidised for having  access  to\r\n\r\nbroadband.  It  is  available to them.   The  infrastructure  is\r\n\r\nalready  provided.  But for the last bit to bring it into  their\r\n\r\nhomes, they must surely pay for that bit of it.  It is like  gas\r\n\r\nand  electricity  and water. The Government  provides  it  to  a\r\n\r\nparticular  point and you bring it into the  house.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink it will be a problem because you cannot afford not to have\r\n\r\nit.   Our  objective in the end is to ensure that you  have  the\r\n\r\ntelephone line, and with ADSL technology you can get  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nbandwidth  from  it,  and also a coaxial cable,  and  eventually\r\n\r\nthere  will probably be cellular wireless access into the  house\r\n\r\nas well.  Our whole telecommunication strategy is to ensure that\r\n\r\nwithin Singapore, bandwidth is not a problem at all. And for the\r\n\r\nkind  of  prices they are talking about for cabling,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink they are prohibitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV, of course, can weight the payments differently. They\r\n\r\ncan  give you a free handphone and charge you a little more  for\r\n\r\nthe  subscription.  So they can tell private households, \"I will\r\n\r\ncharge you less to lay it into your house on condition that  you\r\n\r\nsubscribe  for  three years and I charge you a little  more  per\r\n\r\nmonth.\"   But  that  is for SCV to decide. They  are  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany  and  they have got to answer to their own shareholders.\r\n\r\nBut  they  are  required by their licence  to  ensure  that  all\r\n\r\nprivate estates are passed through by the end of 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether we can jam satellite\r\n\r\nbroadcasts instead of banning dishes.  It is not easy.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  is unbecoming of us to jam satellite broadcasts when we  are\r\n\r\nan  up-linking  centre and a media hub.  We   have  more  subtle\r\n\r\nmethods  of achieving our purposes.  That is the broadest  blast\r\n\r\napproach one could think of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng asked whether we would allow another major\r\n\r\nChinese  newspaper in Singapore.  No, I do not  think  we  would\r\n\r\ndisallow  it  if  the  market  can  accommodate  another   major\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  Of course, we should not allow foreign control.   We\r\n\r\nmust  ensure that whatever newspaper comes out, it feels a  deep\r\n\r\nsense of responsibility for Singapore, and these conditions  are\r\n\r\nadequately  covered  under the Newspapers and  Printing  Presses\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan talked about the use of handphone getting\r\n\r\nout  of hand in Singapore.  I fully agree with him.  I will  put\r\n\r\nit  to  the Courtesy Council for them to take it up.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  talking about it.  But I think Mr Sinnakaruppan is  right.\r\n\r\nMaybe  they  should  make it a particular subject  of  emphasis,\r\n\r\nmaybe this year, next year, or at some opportune time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for courtesy in cyberspace, I think they should also\r\n\r\nhave  a  cyber  courtesy campaign, particularly  on  soc.culture\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Soc.culture Singapore, as Members know, is a kind of\r\n\r\na market place, anything goes.  But there is nothing to stop the\r\n\r\nCourtesy  Council from seeding a civic group of  cyber  denizens\r\n\r\nwho  understand  Netiqette and behave with a certain  propriety,\r\n\r\ntrying to influence the atmosphere and the way communication  is\r\n\r\ncarried out in that market place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On art policies, I would like to thank Mr Simon Tay for his\r\n\r\nstalwart  and consistent support for the arts and  artists.   He\r\n\r\nmade  an important point that our objective is not just to trade\r\n\r\nin  the  arts which he inferred, when we said we want to  be  an\r\n\r\narts hub.  He said that we should foster local arts, and I agree\r\n\r\nwith him entirely, in fact this has always been the objective of\r\n\r\nMITA  and  the  NAC.  It is very important that  we  foster  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  local arts because they express something  very\r\n\r\ndeep  in the soul of the people.  You ask yourself: what is  the\r\n\r\ndifference  between  a  computer and a  human  being?   Science,\r\n\r\ntechnology,  solving calculus, memory banks, a computer  can  do\r\n\r\nany  of these things, and do it better than we can.  In the end,\r\n\r\nchampionship chess in the world will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot be played between Deep Blue and Kasparov.  It will be played\r\n\r\nbetween computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the difference between computers and human\r\n\r\nbeings?   Computers do not laugh and cry. They have no emotions.\r\n\r\nSo  the whole phenomenon of the art in human civilisation is not\r\n\r\nan  add-on.  It is not entertainment.  It is something  deep  in\r\n\r\nthe nature of man, in our biological and spiritual nature, which\r\n\r\nwe do not fully understand.  And to deny that aspect of us is  a\r\n\r\ngreat danger. Then we will produce more Hector Yees.  You may be\r\n\r\nvery smart, but if you have no sense of where you came from, who\r\n\r\nyour  parents are, the schools you came from, the community from\r\n\r\nwhich you sprang, something is wrong.  A computer programme, you\r\n\r\npress  one button, the software gets transferred. You  carry  it\r\n\r\nfrom  place  to  place, you buy it and you sell it.   But  human\r\n\r\nbeings, like all animals, are not like that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A turtle may swim in the vast ocean but it never forgets\r\n\r\nthe tiny stretch of beach from which it swam out.  For birds and\r\n\r\nanimals, it is encoded in the early memories.  How much more for\r\n\r\nhuman  beings!   And  the  arts somehow  reflect  this.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething from deep inside.  And when we promote it, we  are  in\r\n\r\nfact  affirming ourselves and our identity.  Therefore, I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Dr  Yaacob that we should make it a part of our  education\r\n\r\nsystem, not in a stilted curricular way, prescribe it, you  must\r\n\r\nhave  so  much of it.  No.  But somehow to create an environment\r\n\r\nwhere people feel that they are incomplete without art.  You may\r\n\r\nbe  very  smart, but if you do not recognise this tune,  or  you\r\n\r\ncannot  tell  the  difference between two  paintings,  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething missing in you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can somehow create this environment in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen  we  would  have  succeeded.  If  we  do  not  create  this\r\n\r\nenvironment  in Singapore, where the art carries  no  financial,\r\n\r\nmoral  or  social value, then we will fail, and  we  will  be  a\r\n\r\nstunted  tree which will not be able to take a storm.  The  word\r\n\r\nfor  it  is pathos.  How do you programme pathos into a computer\r\n\r\nand make it feel for people?  You cannot.  But a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuman  being, even a Downs syndrome child, will have some of  it\r\n\r\nin  him  or in her. This is the difference between a human  life\r\n\r\nand a smart computer, and the reason why the arts are not an add-on,  not  a luxury, but something which is very important.   And\r\n\r\nGovernment takes it as something which is very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the private sector does as well because every time\r\n\r\nwe have fund raising for a violinist or for a good cause, people\r\n\r\nturn up and try their best to be helpful.  And interestingly, it\r\n\r\nis  in  times of crisis that real creative work is done, not  in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  prosperity.   In times of prosperity,  you  may  have\r\n\r\nbeautiful paintings and beautiful studios and so on.   But  deep\r\n\r\nfeelings  are  the result of people caught with having  to  make\r\n\r\ntough   choices,  and  re-examining  the  conditions  of   their\r\n\r\nexistence and then coming up with new creative alternatives, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  when artistic developments take place.  So I see  this\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis as being two-edged for the arts.   It  is  not\r\n\r\ncompletely  a  bad  thing. The crisis will  itself  provoke  new\r\n\r\nthinking and deepen our sense of being Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of having our debate on bond-breaking here is\r\n\r\nthat,  at  the  end  of it, our thoughts crystallise,  the  line\r\n\r\nbetween right and wrong is more clearly demarcated, our position\r\n\r\nis  consolidated.  Across the whole front now,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial and economic crisis in the region, new positions  will\r\n\r\nbe  established.  This will make us stronger.   It  will  better\r\n\r\ndefend  us as Singaporeans.  For this, our musicians, our poets,\r\n\r\nour  prose  writers, our painters, our calligraphers, will  make\r\n\r\ntheir contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busking - we try to do more. Firstly, what we do not want\r\n\r\nis  for busking to become a glorified form of begging, which  is\r\n\r\nthe  case  in  many cities in the West.  A hippie  comes  along,\r\n\r\nshort  of cash, so he takes out his guitar, he opens his  guitar\r\n\r\ncase,  he strums, and people throw in a few coins, and  he  gets\r\n\r\nsome  pocket  money.  I do not think that is  what  we  want  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What we are hoping to create is something more  like\r\n\r\nthe Xinyao\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphenomenon  which used to take place in the Bras Basah  Complex.\r\n\r\nI  have not been there recently.  So I do not know whether it is\r\n\r\nstill continuing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Saturday afternoon, school kids would go there. They\r\n\r\nput  up  a banner, they put up a microphone, and then they  will\r\n\r\nsing  beautiful  songs, beautiful ballads which they  themselves\r\n\r\ncompose,  and  they provide their own audiences.   And  shoppers\r\n\r\nlike us come along, stand for a while and say, \"Oh, it is a good\r\n\r\ntune!\",  and clap, and cheer them along.  Any Town Council,  any\r\n\r\nHDB  estate,  Pasir  Ris  Resort,  anyone  of  us  here  who  is\r\n\r\ninterested in bringing street performance to a particular place,\r\n\r\nspontaneous  or  otherwise,  let  the  NAC  know,  and  we  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  it.  I think it is good for us.  You enliven  street\r\n\r\nlife  in  Singapore and enliven our cultural  scene  here,  but,\r\n\r\nplease, do not turn busking into a form of begging, so that even\r\n\r\nparents  are  reluctant to have their children get  involved  in\r\n\r\nbusking, which is the situation today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob asked about LaSalle and NAFA. Dr Tony Tan has\r\n\r\nappointed Dr Tan Chin Nam to chair a committee to study  how  we\r\n\r\ncan   upgrade   NAFA   and  LaSalle  into  fully   funded   arts\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   The report will be coming out later  this  year,\r\n\r\nand  I  think  we  intend to fund them off  fully,  but  without\r\n\r\nrobbing  them of their independence or killing their independent\r\n\r\nspirit.   They  both  have  got long  histories;  they  survive,\r\n\r\ndespite  quite  difficult conditions, and it is  important  that\r\n\r\nwhile  we  help  them, we should not in helping them  make  them\r\n\r\ndependent on us and nationalise their activities.  That  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  intention.  But it is right that we pay much more attention\r\n\r\nto arts education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many comments about the film industry. Let me\r\n\r\nsummarise by saying that we hope to promote it.  We are  setting\r\n\r\nup a Film Commission to facilitate film production in Singapore,\r\n\r\nnot  to  finance  film  production  because  that  is  expensive\r\n\r\nbusiness which is best left to the market, but to facilitate it,\r\n\r\nto  promote Singapore as an Asian film festival centre and to be\r\n\r\na  one-stop centre.  Many film producers face a lot of  problems\r\n\r\nin Singapore getting permits.  I remember once Andy Lau's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanager coming to see me to get my help for a hot-air balloon to\r\n\r\nbe  put up over Singapore for a dramatic scene between Andy  Lau\r\n\r\nand  Li  Nanxing, a final moment before some cataclysm occurred,\r\n\r\nand he wanted Singapore as a backdrop.  But he could not get the\r\n\r\npermit from CAAS.  So I asked my staff to help, and they helped.\r\n\r\nBut  by that time, the producer gave up, they went to Johor  and\r\n\r\nshot the scene in Johor.  We do not want that to be repeated and\r\n\r\nwe   should  really  facilitate  the  production  of  films   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That is good for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai talked about how to mark more places in Singapore in\r\n\r\norder that the island is scattered with memories.  In fact, this\r\n\r\nis  what the National Heritage Board has been trying to do.   We\r\n\r\nhave a programme now to identify buildings for preservation  and\r\n\r\nfor conservation.  We mark many sites, about the old days, about\r\n\r\nthe  war,  many  of  the  things  which  we  talked  about  will\r\n\r\neventually be marked, including the marking of schools, and that\r\n\r\nis  important because many of us have some of our most important\r\n\r\nmemories from our school days.  Raffles has been marked.  So too\r\n\r\nACS, RGS, Singapore Chinese Girls' School, Gan Eng Seng and  St.\r\n\r\nMargaret's.   We  are  also  working  on  heritage  trails,  and\r\n\r\neventually  our objective is, whether you are in  Changi  or  in\r\n\r\nTuas,  in Woodlands or in Sentosa, within a short distance there\r\n\r\nare  markers  telling  you about the significance  of  different\r\n\r\nparts  of  Singapore at different periods of our  history.   And\r\n\r\nthese  are  the  things  which will eventually  cause  Singapore\r\n\r\nturtles  to  remember the beach from which they swim to  conquer\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim asked me about the\r\n\r\nprogress  of our National Education Exhibition.  It is in  hand.\r\n\r\nThe  exhibition will be held from 7th to 31st July this year  at\r\n\r\nSuntec  City.  The emphasis will be on Singapore's history  from\r\n\r\nthe early days, Second World War, the struggle for independence,\r\n\r\nour  years  in Malaysia, and having to go off on our  own.   The\r\n\r\nidea  is  to teach young Singaporeans who they are.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  need  very  much  to teach that they are  Chinese,  Indians,\r\n\r\nMalays  or  Muslims, or Buddhists - these things are  powerfully\r\n\r\ntransmitted through families and through religions - but that we\r\n\r\nare  Singaporeans in good times and in bad, that is much harder.\r\n\r\nWe  have 11 public holidays a year.  But most of them, eight  of\r\n\r\nthem, are ethnic or religious holidays - Christmas, Chinese  New\r\n\r\nYear, Hari Raya, Thaipusam, Vesak, Good Friday.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I think it is not correct. Not\r\n\r\nThaipusam.  Deepavali.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Not Thaipusam, I am sorry.\r\n\r\nDeepavali.   Only  three days we celebrate together  -  the  New\r\n\r\nYear,  May  Day,  National Day.  This is how much  we  celebrate\r\n\r\ntogether  as  a  people.  So we have a  long  way  to  go.   Our\r\n\r\nancestral history is much longer than our national history.   We\r\n\r\nmust give much more emphasis on our national history so that the\r\n\r\nparts  of  us  which  bind us together as Singaporeans  will  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  We hope to have up to half a million visitors  to\r\n\r\nthis  Exhibition.  It will be presented in all the four official\r\n\r\nlanguages  and  we estimate a budget of about $10  million.   We\r\n\r\nhope that some of it can be privately funded, but the bulk of it\r\n\r\nwill  be  funded  by Government.  This will supplement  all  our\r\n\r\nefforts  in  National Education, in our schools, by the  various\r\n\r\ncultural associations, the clan associations, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob asked whether we should not fund private efforts.\r\n\r\nI  think we should facilitate private efforts.  We fund them  if\r\n\r\nthere  is justification.  If you take the Chinese Chamber,  they\r\n\r\nhave  done  very good work, every year organising  the  memorial\r\n\r\nremembrance  at  the civilian memorial.  This year,  over  1,500\r\n\r\nstudents turned up, and they put up an exhibition which will now\r\n\r\nbe  compiled into a book.  It is part of National Education  for\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans  to know of an event which  shook  us  as  a\r\n\r\npeople  and  which  created the most powerful influence  on  the\r\n\r\nnationalist movement here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other efforts being made by various groups.\r\n\r\nI  think they should be encouraged.  Force 136, they worked with\r\n\r\nTCS to create a series called\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Price of Peace, and this was very well received, and in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  enjoying a very good TV serial, young  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nlearnt  about  a very important part of their past,  when  local\r\n\r\npeople,  despite  the  fact that they were a  colonised  people,\r\n\r\nfought, sacrificed their lives, in order to keep the land free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is running out. If I can summarise, the character of\r\n\r\na people is shaped more by adversity than by prosperity.  A long\r\n\r\nboom  has  ended.  We are going through a period of crisis.   It\r\n\r\ncan  be  a very bad crisis.  It can be a relatively minor crisis\r\n\r\nfor  us.  But there is no doubt that across the region, it is  a\r\n\r\nvery major crisis.  And because of this crisis, the character of\r\n\r\nAsia will change.  The fundamental attitudes towards the market,\r\n\r\ntowards America, towards China, towards Japan, towards religion,\r\n\r\nwill change, as a result of this crisis.  Our national character\r\n\r\nwas  very  much  forged  as  a result of  the  British  colonial\r\n\r\nexperience,  of the Second World War, of the fight  against  the\r\n\r\nCommunists, of our traumatic years in Malaysia, and of our  need\r\n\r\nto  survive when we became independent.  In the same  way,  this\r\n\r\ncrisis  will  reshape young minds, and young people who  thought\r\n\r\nthat  the boom will never end, are suddenly confronted with  the\r\n\r\nharsh  reality of living in a tumultuous world, and  discovering\r\n\r\nwhat  their own strengths and weaknesses are.  So if we put  our\r\n\r\nminds  to  it, all of us, as teachers, as parents,  as  MPs,  as\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, as workers, as unionists, we can turn this crisis\r\n\r\ninto  a strengthening experience, once out of it, we will emerge\r\n\r\nmuch stronger as a people.  In a crisis like this, either we  go\r\n\r\nthrough  it stronger or we go through it weakened.  No one  will\r\n\r\ngo through it intact, everyone of us.  No one is spared.  But if\r\n\r\nwe  do it right, if the people and the Government work together,\r\n\r\nthen  I  have  no doubt that across all fields, we  will  emerge\r\n\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister.   I  am  not  asking the  Government  to  jam  up  the\r\n\r\nsatellite TV transmission.

Why  did  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not consider installing a central satellite  dish  at\r\n\r\nHDB  blocks?   And I understand that quite a lot  of  programmes\r\n\r\ntransmitted through satellite are free.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Low's first point.

A number of interesting  events\r\n\r\nwere  held.   For  example,  to attract  the  English  speakers,\r\n\r\nTeochew opera was presented with English subtitles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Festival succeeded in attracting many sponsors such as\r\n\r\nthe People's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation,  the  Federation of Chinese Clans  Association  and\r\n\r\nShell  group.   This shows that there is no lack  of  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations and corporate bodies who are prepared  to  support\r\n\r\ncultural and artistic programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, there is feedback that the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity would also like to hold a similar festival.  This is a\r\n\r\ngood idea and I hope it would have Government assistance.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  referring  to financial assistance, although  we  will  not\r\n\r\ndecline   it.   The  assistance  needed  is  in  the   form   of\r\n\r\nopportunities  to publicise the festival in the mass  media  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  media,  and  publicity  by  organisations  like  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Tourism Board and SIA.  At the same time,  assistance\r\n\r\nis also needed to secure performance venues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Malay community, like the other communities,\r\n\r\nwant  to  spread their culture not only to the other communities\r\n\r\nbut also to the tourists.  In view of the fact that this will be\r\n\r\nan  inaugural  effort,  Government assistance,  as  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  will  be  important  to ensure  the  success  of  this\r\n\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dream to make Singapore a cultural hub needs the\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  all  communities  in  Singapore.

I am happy  to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment has managed to persuade the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  to  do  this.  Because in his recent  Budget,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has provided for accelerated depreciation\r\n\r\nallowances for industrial noise and chemical hazard control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to appear ungrateful. But I must say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  enough.  Environmental awareness  leading  to\r\n\r\nresponsible environmental behaviour rests with individuals,  not\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Company decisions are in fact made  by  individuals\r\n\r\nand such decision makers will by the nature of their trusteeship\r\n\r\nmake  decisions  for  the good of their company's  bottom  line.\r\n\r\nWhen such decisions get translated into environmentally friendly\r\n\r\npractices,  Sir,  it is usually incidental and  not  by  design.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  believe  that  to  achieve responsible  environmental\r\n\r\nbehaviour,  the  Government  must  begin  with  influencing  the\r\n\r\nindividuals.  In fact, if one can induce environmental awareness\r\n\r\nto  be  part  of  an  individual's  personal  value  system  and\r\n\r\nenvironmentally friendly behaviour to be part and parcel  of  an\r\n\r\nindividual's  behaviour,  there will  be  no  need  to  persuade\r\n\r\ncompanies to behave in a responsible manner.  They would  do  so\r\n\r\non  their own accord because their decision makers will do it as\r\n\r\na  matter  of routine.  It is the right thing if it is  part  of\r\n\r\ntheir value system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current policy regarding the inculcation of\r\n\r\nenvironmental awareness and hopefully responsible  behaviour  in\r\n\r\nindividuals  is  through public education.  It is  good  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  continue  to  do so.  But again,  it  is  not  adequate.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  awareness does not automatically  translate  into\r\n\r\nenvironmentally responsible behaviour.  We simply  do  not  have\r\n\r\nthe necessary social discipline.  Otherwise there is no need for\r\n\r\nlittering penalties and CWOs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public education in this important social behaviour\r\n\r\nmust  be augmented by financial incentives, whether positive  or\r\n\r\nnegative, as in penalties for littering.  So if we are  prepared\r\n\r\nto  use  negative financial incentives to punish environmentally\r\n\r\nand   socially  irresponsible  behaviour,  what  so  wrong  with\r\n\r\npositive  incentives  to  reinforce environmentally  responsible\r\n\r\nbehaviour?   Why  cannot, for example, we give tax  rebates  for\r\n\r\nhousehold   expenditure  related  to  environmentally   friendly\r\n\r\npractices?   We already had done so in the past for  expenditure\r\n\r\nrelated to gardening.  Why cannot we do so again?  Why cannot we\r\n\r\ngive  tax  rebates  to those who install solar heating  systems?\r\n\r\nWhy cannot we reduce the PARF for electric vehicles?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are only some examples which come to mind. I am\r\n\r\nsure  the  Ministry would have many others if only the  idea  is\r\n\r\naccepted.    Today,   we   are  already  considered   the   most\r\n\r\nenvironmentally aware country in this part of the world.  Let us\r\n\r\nalso  be the most environmentally protected country.  Sir,  with\r\n\r\nour  small land mass, it is imperative for us to be so.  And the\r\n\r\nonly  way  to start on this difficult journey is to utilise  all\r\n\r\nways  and  means, including financial incentives,  to  inculcate\r\n\r\nenvironmentally responsible behaviour in individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low is not here. Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I think that in talking about this cut\r\n\r\non  trans-boundary pollution, some backgrounding  is  necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first is that, clearly, as Mr Heng has pointed out, we are a\r\n\r\nvery  small country.  It behoves us therefore to recognise  that\r\n\r\nthe  region  we  are in is one ecological system,  that  we  are\r\n\r\ninterdependent  with our neighbours, in the Straits  of  Malacca\r\n\r\nand the Straits of Johor, in airborne pollution which we see now\r\n\r\nin  the haze and the fires in Indonesia, and that there are also\r\n\r\neconomic  links together with the environment.  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nvast  port  of  the region has a great hand in trade,  including\r\n\r\nthat of potentially hazardous materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that Singapore has been a good citizen in\r\n\r\naccepting its responsibility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  do  our best not to cause harm to our neighbours or to allow\r\n\r\nother  companies, ships that pass through, things  that  we  can\r\n\r\ncontrol, from passing on this harm to our neighbours.   In  this\r\n\r\npast year, our country has acceded to the Basel Convention,  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  of  course  being that our ability  to  control  the\r\n\r\ntranshipment of hazardous materials is encumbered by our wish to\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  busy port and it is impossible  for  us  to  play\r\n\r\npoliceman for all our neighbours.  So we have a system where  we\r\n\r\nare  part  of the larger web.  The harm caused and harm suffered\r\n\r\nto us are interwoven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seeing this therefore, Sir, I think that the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  and  of this Government as regards  environmental\r\n\r\ntrans-boundary pollution must take on a new chapter.  This is to\r\n\r\nincreasingly   recognise  an  international   principle.    This\r\n\r\nprinciple  is  called common but differentiated  responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis  principle suggests that we have a common  aim  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncleaner  environment,  whether  in  the  sea  or  in  the   haze\r\n\r\npollution.   But  our countries have different responsibilities,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  regards our ability to deal with this problem to  come\r\n\r\nout  with  a  solution or to prevent the problem  in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, focusing on the haze pollution, a recent study has\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  the  region as a whole has suffered  some  $1.4\r\n\r\nbillion worth of damage.  Singapore, in the study, was estimated\r\n\r\nto  have suffered some $90 million in damages.  Sir, this  is  a\r\n\r\npreliminary  study. I think these figures are undervalued.   The\r\n\r\nglobal cost of the haze pollution in terms of bio-diversity  and\r\n\r\nthe  release  of CO2 climate change gases has not been  factored\r\n\r\nin, for example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the principle of common but differentiated\r\n\r\nresponsibility, Sir, would be very helpful for the  Ministry  in\r\n\r\nmoving us beyond finger-pointing, either our neighbours pointing\r\n\r\nfingers at us for whatever harm we may cause them or us, as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as the people, pointing fingers at our  neighbours.\r\n\r\nI think this finger-pointing and blame allegation is not helpful\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we need to do, and I was very heartened by the\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement  in reply to a  question  I  filed  at  an\r\n\r\nearlier   sitting,  is  to  internationalise  the  concern   and\r\n\r\nattention  that the haze pollution problem needs.  Much  as  the\r\n\r\nregional  economic  crisis  has had  to  have  an  international\r\n\r\nresponse,  I believe, Sir, that it is timely that our Government\r\n\r\nhas   welcomed  the  move  by  the  United  Nations  Environment\r\n\r\nProgramme to call for international attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new push towards international attention to\r\n\r\nthe   trans-boundary  haze  pollution  that   faces   Singapore,\r\n\r\nSingapore must do more.  Beyond what we can do as a small nation\r\n\r\nfor  ourselves and beyond what we have put into our work at  the\r\n\r\nregional level, we must do our bit to support this international\r\n\r\nattention and effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken in the previous cut on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs that Singapore needs to do more to  assist  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme.  I still say so but I will\r\n\r\nnot repeat my point in detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if and when international cooperation for the haze\r\n\r\ncomes,  Singapore should be among the first countries to  fulfil\r\n\r\nour  obligation under the principle of common but differentiated\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  If our technical and financial and other  forms\r\n\r\nof  assistance can go well beyond the rather modest sums we have\r\n\r\ngiven  and  help  we have given in terms of computerisation  and\r\n\r\nsatellite  imaging, this should continue and we  should  add  to\r\n\r\nthem.  This is not just for good neighbourliness.  It is in  our\r\n\r\nself-interest to do so.  And in that sense, Sir, I wish that the\r\n\r\nMinister  will provide some assurance that it is the  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to join in any pending international  effort  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be both the political will and  the  budgetary\r\n\r\nreserves to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my cut is on the\r\n\r\ntopic \"Cooperation to solve haze problem\".  Singapore as a  good\r\n\r\nASEAN  neighbour has tolerated the haze problem  for  too  long.\r\n\r\nThe haze problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  with us for six years since 1992.  ASEAN  Environment\r\n\r\nMinisters  have  met  and  discussed  the  problem  but  nothing\r\n\r\nconcrete  appears  to have come out of those meetings.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  at  the  next  ASEAN Environment Ministers'  meeting,  our\r\n\r\nMinister  shall use stronger words to put the message across  to\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian Environment Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore cannot tolerate the haze problem any longer. The\r\n\r\ncosts  are  too  high.  It is not only a big financial  loss  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  but,  more importantly, the haze is a health  hazard.\r\n\r\nIt  is  reported in the Straits Times today that the haze caused\r\n\r\nSingapore $104 million last year.  This amount comprised loss by\r\n\r\nthe  tourism  industry, $81.8 million, health cost incurred  was\r\n\r\n$12.5  million and the airline industry's loss of  business  was\r\n\r\nestimated at $9.7 million.  We have just heard Mr Simon Tay that\r\n\r\nthe  actual  loss  may  even be more than this  amount  of  $104\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monetary losses do not take into account the long-term effects from cancer and other diseases. The price is too\r\n\r\nhigh.   I would urge our Minister at the next round of the ASEAN\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Ministers' meeting to put across to the Indonesians\r\n\r\nthe  message that the haze problem cannot be tolerated any  more\r\n\r\nby  Singaporeans.   It  is  true that the  haze  problem  is  an\r\n\r\ninternational one.  But the Indonesians in the first place  must\r\n\r\nbe  made  responsible  for  it.  The haze  originates  in  their\r\n\r\ncountry.   International help, however good the intention,  from\r\n\r\nfriendly  nations or international organisations like  UNEP  can\r\n\r\nonly  go  so  far.  The brunt of eliminating the  problem  rests\r\n\r\nsquarely on the shoulders of the Indonesians themselves.  If the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  do  care for their good name and  reputation  as  a\r\n\r\ncountry  that assumes full international responsibilities,  then\r\n\r\nit  is  incumbent on them to make more stringent laws  and  take\r\n\r\nmore effective enforcement action to wipe out the haze problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze problem is a serious problem. It is not just a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  smoke  being blown from  one  country  to  another\r\n\r\ncountry.   The  haze  contains  tiny  harmful  pollutants.    In\r\n\r\naddition  to some very toxic gases, these tiny pollutants  known\r\n\r\nas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespiratory  suspended particles (RSPs)  cannot  be  stopped  by\r\n\r\nwearing  cloth  masks.  These pollutants  can  only  be  stopped\r\n\r\nthrough  the wearing of heavy war time type of gas  masks.   But\r\n\r\nusing such masks is impractical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to medical sources, the best solution is to move\r\n\r\nout  of the region.  This we certainly cannot do.  So are we  to\r\n\r\nbreathe these harmful pollutants for six to eight months a  year\r\n\r\ndepending on the weather?  If the haze is not eliminated, we may\r\n\r\nhave  a  whole  nation of sick people in 10 to 15  years'  time.\r\n\r\nThis  certainly again we do not want.  It is therefore important\r\n\r\nto   once  and  for  all  resolve  the  haze  problem  with  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians.   I  shall  say  that  if  the  Minister  for   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment insists on being polite to the Indonesians, then  he\r\n\r\nshould consider telling them politely that we shall take them to\r\n\r\nthe International Court if the haze problem is still unresolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the immediate health\r\n\r\nhazards  caused by haze, like eyes, nose and throat  irritation,\r\n\r\nskin  rashes, asthma and other respiratory problems are obvious.\r\n\r\nThe   long-term   ill-effects,  however,  are  not   so   easily\r\n\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study from Harvard University suggested that particulate\r\n\r\npollution  over  a period of time was strongly  associated  with\r\n\r\ndeaths from lung cancer and heart disease.

Despite all the international\r\n\r\nand  regional  efforts in trying to deal with this hazard,  very\r\n\r\nlittle  headway  has been made.  And I do not  think  it  is  as\r\n\r\nsimple  as Mr Chiam says, just to be tough with the Indonesians.\r\n\r\nBecause,  I  believe,  the Ministry of the Environment  and  the\r\n\r\ninternational  environment organisation are fully  committed  to\r\n\r\nbattle  the serious problem in this region.  But, realistically,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to resign ourselves to the fact that there is  nothing\r\n\r\nmuch  that  can  be  done,  at  least  for  the  coming  months.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important for us to make preparations  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith this problem ourselves internally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we made improvements in the early warning system\r\n\r\nand  much has been done to alert our Singaporeans on the  impact\r\n\r\nand  condition  of  the haze daily.  But  most  of  the  average\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  still at a loss on  how  to  react  when  the\r\n\r\ncondition worsens. I would suggest that the Ministry draw  up  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  plan  on what action can the average  Singaporean\r\n\r\ntake  when  the haze hazard strikes, especially measures  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  by schools, old folks' homes and any other crowded public\r\n\r\nareas.   For example, the Ministry can advise every school,  old\r\n\r\nfolks'  home  and  public  premises  where  there  is  no   air-conditioning  to  at least provide one room equipped  with  air-conditioning, so that those who are more sensitive to  breathing\r\n\r\nproblems  can  take  refuge.   They could  also  conduct  public\r\n\r\nseminars and talks to better educate the public on how to lessen\r\n\r\nthe  negative  effects  of this problem, and  provide  technical\r\n\r\nadvice  such  as  recommending  special  filters  to  all   air-conditioning  units, provide more information on  all  available\r\n\r\nair  purifiers or the type of masks, if any, that can reduce the\r\n\r\neffect  of the smog and harmful particles, or any other measures\r\n\r\nthat can make our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation safer.

I shall reply in the order of the\r\n\r\nMembers who have spoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I am glad that Mr Heng Chiang Meng is happy with the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Finance  Ministry has  now  also  extended  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  for  companies  which have  introduced  more  energy\r\n\r\nefficient equipment.  But I would like to point out to him  that\r\n\r\nthe  state  of  the environment in Singapore has  been  of  high\r\n\r\ninternational  standards, even though much of the  actions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken without tax incentives.  I think this points to  the\r\n\r\nfact   that,  firstly,  our  regulations  have  been  very  well\r\n\r\nstructured  and, secondly, that we have been able to impress  on\r\n\r\ncompanies the need to be good corporate citizens and to take the\r\n\r\nnecessary steps to reduce pollution voluntarily.  In fact, I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to say that most companies have introduced measures which\r\n\r\nreduce their pollution levels far below what is stipulated.   It\r\n\r\nshows  that the awareness is there.  Therefore, while incentives\r\n\r\nare useful, incentives are not everything.  If we have to depend\r\n\r\non  incentives for each and every action, I think our  companies\r\n\r\nwould  not really be reacting at all on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also agree with him that individuals can play a\r\n\r\nuseful  part in enhancing environmental compliance, and this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  we are doing.  We are educating the public through various\r\n\r\nmechanisms at the school level, through grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nand by working with the NGOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that, as the environmental awareness\r\n\r\nincreases, Singaporeans will become more discerning consumers of\r\n\r\nproducts and that we should not be using incentives to influence\r\n\r\nSingaporeans on what to buy, because it is not just in terms  of\r\n\r\nelectric  vehicles  or  solar heaters, but  there  are  so  many\r\n\r\nproducts available,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose   manufacturers  claim  that  their  products   are   more\r\n\r\nenvironmentally friendly and are more energy efficient.  And for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  get  involved in vetting them  and  then  giving\r\n\r\nincentives  for each of them, I think would really  distort  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  It is better that these products are sold based on  the\r\n\r\nvalues  they  give to the people, and let us not  intervene  too\r\n\r\nmuch by giving incentives.  But we should continue educating our\r\n\r\npeople  so  that they are more discerning in terms of what  they\r\n\r\nbuy.   And,  hopefully, over time, they will  be  buying  things\r\n\r\nwhich are also more environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has asked that I reassure the House about\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  in terms of joining in  the  regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational  efforts on the haze problem.  Sir, Singapore  was\r\n\r\nvery  forthcoming on a bilateral basis, because we realise  that\r\n\r\nthe  haze  problem is one which cannot be tackled  by  Indonesia\r\n\r\nalone.   The  problem  is  much too  big  for  the  country  and\r\n\r\nespecially  in  today's context of the economic  turmoil,  their\r\n\r\nability  to  tackle the haze at source is a lot more diminished,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  why at the last Ministerial meeting in February,  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians were very willing to straightaway join us in issuing\r\n\r\na  call  for international assistance.  And I am glad also  that\r\n\r\nUNEP  was there at the meeting and UNEP has assured us that  the\r\n\r\nUN  itself  would  be  very interested in  getting  involved  in\r\n\r\nresolving  this  problem.  I can assure Mr Tay  that  when  UNEP\r\n\r\nfinally comes up with a package of needed assistance,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be amongst the countries to review the assistance required\r\n\r\nand  we  will  do  our  part in helping to push  the  assistance\r\n\r\nprogramme and effort forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has spoken very strongly and I appreciate his\r\n\r\nconcern which many of us share as well.  It is just that we  are\r\n\r\na  little bit more circumspect but, nonetheless, we too are very\r\n\r\nconcerned about the impact of the haze on not just the health of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans but also the overall regional economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in trying to resolve the problem, I think one must\r\n\r\nalso  analyse and see what is the most effective approach.  Will\r\n\r\nshouting be counter productive or will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshouting  help  to  resolve  the  problem?   If  it  is  counter\r\n\r\nproductive, then I think we should not shout too loudly but  use\r\n\r\nbetter persuasive tools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example about Miri. Miri is in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  if  Mr  Chiam does not know.  It is in  the  west  of\r\n\r\nKalimantan, northern part of Sarawak.  Miri recently was totally\r\n\r\nblanketed  by  smoke haze from fires within Sarawak  itself,  so\r\n\r\nmuch so that the airport had to be closed and the PSI level  was\r\n\r\n300-400.   You cannot even see beyond 50 metres.   And  this  is\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  This is not Indonesia.  At first, the Malaysians  had\r\n\r\nto  despatch 500 people from peninsular Malaysia to Miri to help\r\n\r\nfight  the fire, supplement whatever resources Sarawak  had  for\r\n\r\nfighting the fires.  And when that was not enough, they  had  to\r\n\r\nfurther send another batch of 500, and I think there are a total\r\n\r\nof   1,000   fire   fighters  now,  from   peninsular   Malaysia\r\n\r\nsupplementing the resources that Sarawak has.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even for Malaysia with all the resources, when the fires\r\n\r\nbroke  out  in Miri, they had so much trouble trying to  control\r\n\r\nit.   And today, the fires are still raging, and this is only  a\r\n\r\nsmall  part of Sarawak, which is again a small part of the whole\r\n\r\nof Kalimantan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Singapore, we look at fires and we say that we should\r\n\r\nput  out  that fire.  After all, whenever there is a fire,  fire\r\n\r\nengines  go there and within a few hours, the fire is  put  out.\r\n\r\nIn  the context of Kalimantan, if we put Singapore on the map of\r\n\r\nKalimantan,  it  is  just  a dot in Kalimantan.   The  fires  in\r\n\r\nKalimantan  are  huge.  Some of the fires there  would  probably\r\n\r\nengulf the whole of Toa Payoh, including Potong Pasir.  That  is\r\n\r\nhow huge it is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expect Indonesia to have the resources, I think it is\r\n\r\nexpecting a little bit too much, which is why we have  to  bring\r\n\r\nit  to the international level, bring in international expertise\r\n\r\nand   know-how  and,  more important, put in place  a  long-term\r\n\r\nmechanism  which  will help the Indonesians to  solve  it  on  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  basis, rather than every year trying  to  fight  the\r\n\r\nfires, and this is what we are trying to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has asked whether there are long-term studies\r\n\r\non  the impact of the haze.  At the moment, we are using the PSI\r\n\r\nas  a  measurement  of  the haze level.  PSI  which  stands  for\r\n\r\npollutants standard index, is a system that was devised  by  the\r\n\r\nUS  Environmental  Protection Agency, and the  system  has  been\r\n\r\nderived  after  many years of extensive study on the  impact  on\r\n\r\nhealth  when people live in environments of a certain  level  of\r\n\r\npollution.   They  have a system where if you measure  and  find\r\n\r\nthat  the level of pollution there is within the PSI of 50, this\r\n\r\nis  a  healthy environment.  Between 50 and 100, it is moderate.\r\n\r\nBetween  100 and 200, it is unhealthy.  This study is  based  on\r\n\r\nlong-term  observations.  But studies are not available  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of what we are facing or what we had last year, 12  days\r\n\r\nwhere PSI was between 100-150.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have been in contact with the World Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation and the WHO has informed us, not just Singapore but\r\n\r\nalso  Malaysia and the other countries, that they will  be  very\r\n\r\nkeen  to  do a long-term health impact study from the haze.   We\r\n\r\nhave informed WHO that Singapore would be very keen to work with\r\n\r\nthem.  When  the  results are out, I will  definitely  keep  the\r\n\r\nMembers informed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen has said that Singaporeans are still at a\r\n\r\nloss as to what to do when the haze hits and whether we can have\r\n\r\na  larger  publicity programme.  This year, realising  that  the\r\n\r\nlikelihood  of  a  haze is very high, in fact  my  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nalready embarked on a public education programme.  Members  will\r\n\r\nprobably  have  read  in the papers a few weeks  ago  about  the\r\n\r\ninformation that we have released on the use of air cleaners and\r\n\r\nfilters.   We  cannot clean the entire atmosphere in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  way  for  us to go out and have  a  giant  vacuum\r\n\r\ncleaner.   But we can reduce the personal space to be  protected\r\n\r\nto  either  the home or the office, because that is  where  many\r\n\r\npeople spend much of their time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office, office owners can install filters in the air-conditioning systems because most of the offices in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  air-conditioned. We have written to most  of  the  building\r\n\r\nowners and we hope that they will be doing something.  At  home,\r\n\r\nthose  families  whose  homes  are air-conditioned  can  install\r\n\r\nfilters.  For others, whose homes are not air-conditioned,  they\r\n\r\ncan  purchase  air cleaners, and the price of the  air  cleaners\r\n\r\nwould  vary  from about $300 to $900 and above.  So there  is  a\r\n\r\nbroad  range  and  there are products that will  fit  into  each\r\n\r\nperson's budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are working outdoors, Mr Chiam was saying,\r\n\r\n\"Well, because the particles are so fine, we need to wear a  war\r\n\r\ntime  gas  mask.\"  I  am glad to inform Mr Chiam that technology\r\n\r\nhas  actually gone a lot further than that, and that  respirator\r\n\r\nmasks  are  now  available.   They  are  very  light  but  still\r\n\r\neffective  enough  to  filter out most of  the  fine  sub-micron\r\n\r\nparticles.   They are not very comfortable and this  is  why  we\r\n\r\nhave been advising the public that for those with chronic cardio-respiratory illnesses, it may be advisable for them to wear one,\r\n\r\nbut they should only do so with the advice of their own doctors.\r\n\r\nFor those who are working outdoors, if the PSI does get up above\r\n\r\n200,  it may be useful for them to also wear a respiratory  mask\r\n\r\nif they have to work outdoors for a very long period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to publicise the different measures.\r\n\r\nAs  suggested by Mr Kenneth Chen, we will also continue to  give\r\n\r\ntalks to the schools as well as give talks over the mass media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I  would like  to  ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nclarification regarding the matter of haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether it is possible for us to\r\n\r\ninitiate  some sort of international agreement within ASEAN,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the culprit, who started the fire and caused the  haze  to\r\n\r\nus, besides being punishable under the local law, could also  be\r\n\r\nsummoned to the country affected and be answerable to the damage\r\n\r\nthat   he   has  caused  to  the  country  concerned   and   pay\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to ask the Minister is about\r\n\r\ncertain  companies which started fire in a foreign  country.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it is not easy to find out which are these companies  and\r\n\r\nwho  are the directors.  Can we consider blacklisting this  kind\r\n\r\nof  companies and the directors?  Also, at the same time, we can\r\n\r\nprevent them from entering Singapore and also from tendering for\r\n\r\npublic sector jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, before one can have a regional\r\n\r\nagreement  on trans-boundary pollution, there must  first  be  a\r\n\r\nconsensus  amongst the countries involved that there is  a  need\r\n\r\nfor such an agreement.  I have informally mooted the idea to  my\r\n\r\ncounterparts,  but,  unfortunately,  there  was  absolutely   no\r\n\r\nsupport for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the meantime, we have been doing some research. We\r\n\r\nhave  reviewed similar agreements elsewhere to see what sort  of\r\n\r\nprovisions  they  have.   I  must  say  that  whilst  there  are\r\n\r\ninternational  agreements, they are quite disappointing  because\r\n\r\nwhat we have found is that all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreements  contain no provisions for penalties  or  payment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation,  and  they  are mainly statements  of  intent  and\r\n\r\ncommitment.  Therefore, they are not enforceable at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the companies, Sir, in the first place, we have\r\n\r\nto wait for the Indonesians to investigate and then to prosecute\r\n\r\nthem.   Once  they  have prosecuted them and the  companies  are\r\n\r\nconvicted,  we  can  proceed  to  get  information  about  those\r\n\r\ncompanies.  And even then, I do not think it is really our  role\r\n\r\nto blacklist them.\r\n\r\nAnd  neither  should we be involved in enforcing their  law  for\r\n\r\nthem.   It  is  better that those penalties and  punishments  be\r\n\r\nmeted  out in Indonesia under their laws.  If our companies  are\r\n\r\ninvolved, they should pay the penalties as well.  And, in  fact,\r\n\r\nif  we are aware of those companies in which Singapore companies\r\n\r\nhave part share in, we will be very happy to also, in Singapore,\r\n\r\nadvise  those  Singaporeans involved to comply  with  Indonesian\r\n\r\nlaw.  And the Indonesian law is very clear - burning of land for\r\n\r\nclearing  purposes, for conversion into plantations, is illegal.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  have  always  insisted that  Singaporeans,  when  going\r\n\r\nabroad, should comply with all the laws of the host country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I would like to\r\n\r\ntalk  about  is  vehicle pollution.  In 1989,  I  spoke  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  energy  conservation  through  the  use  of  diesel\r\n\r\nvehicles.   Precisely because a diesel vehicle is  significantly\r\n\r\nmore  efficient compared with a gasoline powered vehicle, almost\r\n\r\nall  trucks  and  taxis in Singapore which have very  high  fuel\r\n\r\nconsumption choose to use diesel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite being energy efficient, poorly maintained\r\n\r\ndiesel powered vehicles pollute the air by emitting soot in  the\r\n\r\nexhaust.   Every  day,  we  could spot  a  few  diesel  vehicles\r\n\r\nemitting  black smoke that pollutes the air and the particulates\r\n\r\nfrom  the  soot could have bad health effect to the  other  road\r\n\r\nusers and also to those who live near the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many diesel vehicles\r\n\r\nwere  caught last year for emitting black smoke.  How does  this\r\n\r\nfigure compare with that of the previous year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on modern technology, diesel design could easily meet\r\n\r\nthe  stringent pollution control we implement in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  of  diesel  smoke  is due  to  poor  maintenance,  poor\r\n\r\nworkshop  practice  and  a  lack of  knowledge  on  modern  fuel\r\n\r\ntechnology.   In my Budget debate speech last year, I  mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  the  diesel detergent additive which was really  good  in\r\n\r\nreducing diesel smoke through its keep- clean ability.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest to the Ministry to have a publicity programme to\r\n\r\nlet  the  diesel fleet operators and the truck and taxi  drivers\r\n\r\nunderstand,  first,  what is the role of engine  maintenance  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  pollution;  second, what are  the  wrong  workshop\r\n\r\npractices  which  should be avoided and  watched  out  for;  and\r\n\r\nthird,  how does the fuel affect or shorten the duration  before\r\n\r\nthe next maintenance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of programme could be taught on a different\r\n\r\noccasion, like at the time when a driver receives his Class 3 or\r\n\r\nClass  4  driving licence, or when a new taxi licence is issued.\r\n\r\nIt  can  also  be  taught to persons who were caught  repeatedly\r\n\r\nviolating the soot emission regulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long term, when we no longer have problem with\r\n\r\nthe  soot  emitted from diesel vehicles, we should then consider\r\n\r\nprogressively  allowing  more  diesel  vehicles,  in  particular\r\n\r\ndiesel  cars,  on the road with some favourable regulations  for\r\n\r\nthe sake of energy conservation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I take the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next cut I would like\r\n\r\nto  talk about is noise pollution.  Recently, the residents have\r\n\r\ncomplained in The Straits Times about the construction noise  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chestnut  housing estate in my constituency.   I  had  also\r\n\r\npersonally  experienced similar construction  noise  in  my  own\r\n\r\nhousing estate where work was carried out at night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is regulation on the control of noise from\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites.  This is in terms of the noise  level  they\r\n\r\ncould  emit from the boundary of the construction site and  when\r\n\r\nthe noisy work should not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  carried out.  All the construction companies understand  the\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations.  Despite warnings and fines that  could\r\n\r\npossibly  be imposed by the Ministry, work was still carried out\r\n\r\nand  it disturbed the peaceful life of the people who live  near\r\n\r\nthe  construction site.  One of the reasons, I was told, was the\r\n\r\nheavy penalty imposed by the developer for late delivery of  the\r\n\r\nproject,  which  was much more severe than a  fine  which  could\r\n\r\npossibly be imposed by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether we have adequate\r\n\r\nlaws  to deal with the construction companies or developers  who\r\n\r\nbreak  the  noise  regulations.  Are the  punishments  or  fines\r\n\r\neffective enough to deter repeated offenders?  If not, will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider revising the level of penalty or  introducing\r\n\r\nother  new  punitive measures to make it more effective?   Could\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  have the power to stop work at the  site  if  the\r\n\r\nconstruction company defies the existing law?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, since 1984, the world has\r\n\r\ngenerally experienced higher temperature.  During this period it\r\n\r\nrecorded  13  years of the warmest weather in  history.   It  is\r\n\r\npredicted  that the world will be getting warmer and  warmer  in\r\n\r\nthe  future.   In  Singapore, in the last  few  weeks,  we  have\r\n\r\nexperienced  some of the highest temperatures  in  the  last  50\r\n\r\nyears.   Some have attributed this unusual condition to  the  El\r\n\r\nNino phenomenon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a hot and humid country, if the mean\r\n\r\ntemperature  goes  up by even 1 or 2 degrees,  it  will  greatly\r\n\r\naffect  our  comfort level and make our hot and humid  air  that\r\n\r\nmuch  more unbearable.  The decision to make Singapore a  Garden\r\n\r\nCity  by extensively greening our city has created some positive\r\n\r\nresults.  Not only psychologically we feel that we are living in\r\n\r\na  more  pleasant and cooler environment, it is  also  estimated\r\n\r\nthat  our  mean temperature might have gone down by one  or  two\r\n\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there plans to further intensify this environmentally\r\n\r\nfriendly measure to our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncity?   For example, can we introduce more water-scape into  our\r\n\r\npublic  area,  because water is a very effective cooling  agent?\r\n\r\nAs  heat intensifies in hard concrete surface, can we limit  the\r\n\r\nextent  of open paved area in our city and provide as much  lawn\r\n\r\narea  as  possible?   The concept of huge open  paved  plaza  is\r\n\r\nenvironmentally unfriendly to a tropical country like ours.   In\r\n\r\nHong  Kong's  CBD  area, the buildings are connected  by  either\r\n\r\nunderground   passages   or   overhead   bridges    which    are\r\n\r\nenvironmentally  controlled, so that  one  can  walk  for  miles\r\n\r\nwithout having to be exposed to the external weather.  We should\r\n\r\nhave   more   water-protected  people  movers   connecting   our\r\n\r\nbuildings.   All these, together with keeping our air  pollution\r\n\r\nfree,  should help to lessen the warming effect in  our  weather\r\n\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment has done any study on the effect of global  warming,\r\n\r\nhow  does  it affect our general weather condition in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  in  what way can we condition our environment so  that  the\r\n\r\neffect of this warming condition can be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, we have a very clean Singapore and\r\n\r\nwe  must all be grateful to the Ministry of the Environment  for\r\n\r\nhaving  maintained such a high standard.  Few cities  can  boast\r\n\r\nthis as we can.  Our roads are clean and our backlanes are swept\r\n\r\nevery  day.  But there is one aspect which is rather disturbing,\r\n\r\nand  this  is  littering  by not only the  illiterate,  but  the\r\n\r\nliterate.   If  one were at the bus stops, or  in  MRT  stations\r\n\r\nwhere  a lot of pamphlets are distributed, we find papers  lying\r\n\r\nall over.  The worst culprits are the bus commuters.  They leave\r\n\r\ntheir  tickets  everywhere.   Then the  next  culprits  are  the\r\n\r\nsmokers.   After smoking they will throw the cigarettes  in  the\r\n\r\ndrain where it is an open drain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite large amounts of money being spent on\r\n\r\neducation and social condemnation of this act by asking them  to\r\n\r\ndo  corrective work, it has not worked.  I think we have to find\r\n\r\na  solution.   And  I urge the Minister that perhaps  we  should\r\n\r\nreconsider the position and appoint what I call voluntary  based\r\n\r\nofficers  or friends of the environment who should be  empowered\r\n\r\nto book these people and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  them  appear  in court rather than compound  the  offence.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the town councils, more of such officers could  be\r\n\r\nappointed.  And I think every Government agency should be  asked\r\n\r\nto help in this process because if we do not check this, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  will have to pay a lot of money in keeping  our  city\r\n\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know the Minister has taken pains to see that things\r\n\r\nare maintained clean, but I think something has to be done if we\r\n\r\nwant  to  maintain our reputation.  Especially  the  people  who\r\n\r\ndistribute pamphlets, they go around HDB flats and distribute  a\r\n\r\nlot  of things.  If you go to any of the estates, you will  find\r\n\r\nlitter all over the litter boxes.  Sir, both HDB as well as  the\r\n\r\nother departments have to work out a solution.  And I appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to take whatever steps to socially disgrace  these\r\n\r\npeople  and  to  make  them realise that it  is  not  worthwhile\r\n\r\nlittering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Choo is not here. Mr Rai, you can\r\n\r\nproceed with the next topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Sir. First of all, I must\r\n\r\ndeclare my interest. I am the owner of a private property in one\r\n\r\nof the very old housing estates with open drains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has gone on record that he would\r\n\r\nhelp  the private property owners to upgrade, not internally  of\r\n\r\ncourse.   But surely something could be done to the environment,\r\n\r\nlike  the  example  I am going to quote.  Many  of  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates  which  were  built in the 1960s  and  1970s  have  open\r\n\r\ndrains.  I am urging the Ministry to consider this proposal.  As\r\n\r\nI have seen that in some older HDB estates like Hougang, where I\r\n\r\nused  to live some time back, HDB has actually closed the drains\r\n\r\nand  they are very tidy and neat.  If the same could be done  to\r\n\r\nthe private housing estates, it would beautify the estate.  They\r\n\r\ncould  put some potted plants and it would be greener and nicer.\r\n\r\nThe   Minister  must  bear  in  mind  that  these   people   pay\r\n\r\nconsiderable  income  tax as well as property  tax,  unlike  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  which  HDB flat owners get.  I do not think  they  are\r\n\r\ngiven any benefit at all so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would urge him to proceed by stages and surely he\r\n\r\ncould get some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney from some other funds and try it out in one estate.  If it\r\n\r\nis  feasible,  I would urge him to do it all over Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nknow  the  new  estates  do not require this  because  it  is  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  the Environment Ministry.  But I  am  concerned\r\n\r\nthat  some of these old estates are in fact worse off than  some\r\n\r\nof  the  HDB  estates.  Let us not treat these private  property\r\n\r\nowners  as  untouchable Brahmins.  They have  contributed  quite\r\n\r\nwell  to the coffers.  Let us compensate them and at least  give\r\n\r\nthese things to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my speech is on pasar malam. Sir,\r\n\r\npasar malams are part of the way of life in HDB housing estates.\r\n\r\nThe  pasar malams are a sort of flea market where residents  can\r\n\r\nbrowse and buy goods at very reasonable prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment is the Government body that\r\n\r\nissues  the main permit to hold pasar malams although if  cooked\r\n\r\nfoods  are  sold,  a  permit is required from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth.  Permits to hold pasar malams are issued only to the PAP\r\n\r\ngrassroots    organisations   and    some    other    charitable\r\n\r\norganisations.  Opposition Members of Parliament have no  formal\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations.  They apply for pasar malam permits to\r\n\r\nhold  these  fairs  in  the  name of their  town  council.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Environment recognises this kind of application\r\n\r\nby  the  town councils.  In the past, the town council at Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  had no problems getting the necessary permits to organise\r\n\r\npasar  malams.   But  commencing 1995,  the  Potong  Pasir  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil  has been completely denied the opportunity  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nAll  the  quotas to hold pasar malams at Potong Pasir for  those\r\n\r\nthree  years up to 1997 were allocated to the Potong  Pasir  CCC\r\n\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this sense, the MOE has not been fair in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the  allocation of quotas to hold pasar malams  at  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir.   First, it changes the rules and, secondly, it has  been\r\n\r\nunfair  in  implementing the rules.  When the Potong Pasir  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil  applied to hold pasar malams in 1995, it was  surprised\r\n\r\nto  learn  that  the CCC had been allocated the  quota  for  two\r\n\r\nyears, that is, the full 32 days to hold a marathon pasar  malam\r\n\r\nfor more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  one  month.  Pasar malam permits are normally  issued  for\r\n\r\nonly  one  year  but for that year, the MOE bent its  rules  and\r\n\r\nfavoured  the CCC and gave it a two-year quota in one year.   In\r\n\r\n1997,  the permit to hold a pasar malam was also issued  to  the\r\n\r\nCCC.   The  Potong  Pasir  Town Council  again  was  denied  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  hold pasar malam that year.  I hope  ENV  would\r\n\r\nchange  its  rules  and allocate permits to  hold  pasar  malams\r\n\r\nfairly  to  the  Opposition  and the  PAP-controlled  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our national pledge says that we believe in justice\r\n\r\nand  equality.   But  as far as ENV is concerned,  they  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  justice and equality in the issue  of  pasar  malam\r\n\r\npermits at Potong Pasir.  ENV should respect the elected  Member\r\n\r\nof Parliament for that constituency and at least allocate to him\r\n\r\na few days a year for his town council to organise pasar malams.\r\n\r\nIn  Potong  Pasir,  I,  as  the elected  MP,  have  been  ridden\r\n\r\nroughshod over and pushed aside.  I am deprived of organising  a\r\n\r\npasar  malam  for  three  years.  Such  a  situation  should  be\r\n\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I will first answer the cuts from\r\n\r\nProf.  Low  Seow  Chay.  Prof. Low in his cut talked  about  the\r\n\r\ndiesel  powered vehicles, that they tend to be smoky even though\r\n\r\nthey  are  more fuel efficient and asked what is the  number  of\r\n\r\ndiesel  vehicles  that were found to be smoky and  were  caught.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  1997,  about 2.7% of the diesel driven  vehicles  were\r\n\r\nfound to be smoky and this is a vast improvement from 1989 where\r\n\r\nabout 8% of the vehicles which were smoky were actually caught.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked that we give some publicity programme to\r\n\r\ndrivers, especially when they are getting their licence, on  the\r\n\r\nproper  use  of  the  engine  of  the  vehicles  and  on  engine\r\n\r\nmaintenance.   Sir, I believe this has already  been  done.   As\r\n\r\npart  of the training programme, the learner drivers are  taught\r\n\r\nnot  just how to drive but also the theory behind the use  of  a\r\n\r\ndiesel  driven vehicle and part of that theory includes how  the\r\n\r\nengine  works, the maintenance and how they should not over  rev\r\n\r\nwith their engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he also talked about the choice of fuel. I like to\r\n\r\ninform Prof. Low that in Singapore, all the diesel that is  sold\r\n\r\nfor  vehicles  at the fuel pumps are all already  provided  with\r\n\r\nadditives.  I understand that the diesel additives help to clean\r\n\r\nthe  fuel injector and therefore make the burning process a  lot\r\n\r\nmore  efficient, thereby reducing the risk of smoke.  And I also\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  some fleet owners do not buy from  the  petrol\r\n\r\nstations.  They contract directly with the oil companies to  buy\r\n\r\nin  bulk and that the diesel provided to them is also similar to\r\n\r\nthe  diesel  provided to the petrol stations, ie,  most  of  the\r\n\r\ndiesel used in Singapore is already provided with the additives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his second cut was on noise pollution. What are the\r\n\r\nlaws  against  contractors who work at night and who  break  the\r\n\r\nnoise  regulations?   Sir,  I agree  with  Prof.  Low  that  the\r\n\r\npenalties  at  the  moment  are  fairly  low  compared  to   the\r\n\r\nliquidated  damages the contractor will have to pay  if  he  was\r\n\r\nlate  in  completing the project.  However, what  we  have  also\r\n\r\navailable  to  us is a heavier tool which is a stop-work  order.\r\n\r\nSo  far,  we have not applied that.  But recently, we have  been\r\n\r\ngetting more complaints about noise and I have asked my officers\r\n\r\nto  look  into  using that as a final measure.  If a  contractor\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  works  at night and breaks the regulation  on  noise\r\n\r\nafter three or four times, we should tell him that, \"Look,  this\r\n\r\nis  the  final warning.  We will compound it this time but  next\r\n\r\ntime, we will give you a stop-work order.\"  This will force them\r\n\r\nto plan their work better and make sure that the noisy works are\r\n\r\nall  done  in  the day and that the work that does not  generate\r\n\r\nmuch noise can then be done at night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will answer the points made by Chiam. Sir, he said that\r\n\r\nENV  does  not believe in justice and equality and that  we  are\r\n\r\nvery unfair to Potong Pasir Town Council and I am very unfair to\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam  himself.   Sir,  let me first  explain  the  need  to\r\n\r\nregulate  pasar malams, as he called it.  Pasar malam is  not  a\r\n\r\nway  of life.  It may have been a way of life when we were small\r\n\r\nkids.   Then  the  shops were poorly stocked  and  therefore  we\r\n\r\nneeded  the pasar malams, which moved from one place to another.\r\n\r\nToday, the housing estates are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell-provided with shopping centres.  In fact, in  some  of  the\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  the shopkeepers have already  complained  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  too many shops and that their businesses  are  badly\r\n\r\naffected.   Therefore, we have to control the  proliferation  of\r\n\r\npasar  malams.   That  is why ENV came out with  the  change  in\r\n\r\nregulations  in  1994  whereby Residents' Committees  are  given\r\n\r\nthree  days in a year for pasar malams and that the constituency\r\n\r\norganizations like CCCs, CCMCs, the town council,  of  which  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  is the Chairman, I presume, are all entitled to one pasar\r\n\r\nmalam session a year, a maximum of 16 days.  But in applying the\r\n\r\nrules,  we also have introduced some flexibility.  Town councils\r\n\r\nand constituency organizations like CCCs and CCMCs can now apply\r\n\r\nto  combine two years' quota into one for the simple reason that\r\n\r\nmany  of the pasar malams are now no longer small little things.\r\n\r\nThey  have  kiddy  rides, they have Ferris  wheels,  with  heavy\r\n\r\nequipment.   If they are only brought in for 16 days,  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  viable.  And having listened to the grassroots leaders,  we\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  that  we should be flexible.   Town  councils  and\r\n\r\nconstituency  organizations  can therefore  apply  to  have  two\r\n\r\nyears' quota combined into one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ENV unfair and has ENV been unfair in the past? Sir,\r\n\r\nthe answer is no.  Other town councils have managed to run their\r\n\r\ntrade fairs and Mr Chiam may wish to know that Bukit Gombak  had\r\n\r\ndone  it  two years in a row, ie, 1995-1996, when it  was  still\r\n\r\nunder  SDP.  Nee Soon Central Town Council also got their  quota\r\n\r\nin 1996.  So it is not a matter that ENV is being very selective\r\n\r\nin approving the applications.  If Mr Chiam had applied based on\r\n\r\nthe  guidelines,  he  would have got his approved  as  well.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that he applied very far in advance and he  was  told\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  to  apply within two months and not  further.   I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the next time, he makes sure that he applies within\r\n\r\na  stipulated time and it will definitely be approved.  There is\r\n\r\nno  reason  for us not to approve if he complies  with  all  the\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask my Senior Minister of State to reply to the\r\n\r\nother questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik\r\n\r\nSidek  bin  Saniff):  Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen  asked  about  global\r\n\r\nwarming.  The recent warm weather was the result of dry  weather\r\n\r\nconditions  and the general lack of clouds over Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nwarm  spell  is  a  short-term  variation  and  is  most  likely\r\n\r\nattributable  to  the impact of the El Nino phenomenon.   Global\r\n\r\nwarming,  on the other hand, is very gradual, long-term process.\r\n\r\nIt   has  generally  been  projected  that  the  average  global\r\n\r\ntemperature  may rise between 1-3.5 Celsius by  the  year  2100,\r\n\r\nshould greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous\r\n\r\noxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) continue to be released  at\r\n\r\ncurrent rates\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also suggested tree planting and water\r\n\r\nschemes  to help cool the city.  Such efforts will provide  some\r\n\r\nlocalised  relief.   In fact, tree planting  is  an  established\r\n\r\npractice  in Singapore.  Given the scarcity of land,  Mr  Chen's\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of  water  schemes such  as  ponds  may  not  be  as\r\n\r\nworkable.  It is perhaps best to leave the provision of features\r\n\r\nsuch  as  ponds  and  water fountains to the developers.   While\r\n\r\nlocal actions help to provide some relief, the key to overcoming\r\n\r\nthe  global warming problem is to address it at source,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also mentioned the ban on CFCs. Apart from\r\n\r\nthe  global  warming  potential, CFCs are also  ozone  depleting\r\n\r\nsubstances and they are controlled under the Montreal  Protocol.\r\n\r\nSingapore is a party to the Montreal Protocol and complied fully\r\n\r\nwith her full ob1igations to phase out CFCs.  The import of CFCs\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore has, in fact, been prohibited since 1st  January\r\n\r\n1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on littering, Mr Shriniwas Rai had put the following\r\n\r\nquestion.  I cannot agree more with the NMP that it takes only a\r\n\r\nfew   irresponsible   litterbugs   to   undermine   our   living\r\n\r\nenvironment.  In addition, litter is a health hazard, as  litter\r\n\r\nthat  holds  water  is  one  of the  main  sources  of  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding, and this makes littering even more objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On anti-littering campaigns and public education\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  these go back many, many years and every  one,  the\r\n\r\nstudents  in school, the community at large, is aware that  they\r\n\r\nshould  not litter.  There is no excuse.  Litter bins are always\r\n\r\nat  hand for people to use.  There is at least one in every  bus\r\n\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the corrective work order, Sir, we introduced it in\r\n\r\n1992.   To  date,  1,975  litterbugs  had  served  their  order.\r\n\r\nAlthough  a number of them served for a second time,  many  have\r\n\r\nsaid that they would not litter again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for friends of the environment, we have friends of the\r\n\r\nenvironment, from school children and the public at  large,  but\r\n\r\nto  take them to court, I would like to inform the House and  Mr\r\n\r\nRai,  in  particular, in this era of Internet and cybernet,  the\r\n\r\nfinding  of  two cyberneticists, namely, Ludwig van  Bertalanffy\r\n\r\nand  Norbert Weiner.  They are Dutch.  According to them,  after\r\n\r\nwe have taken all these measures and feedback including comments\r\n\r\nin  the House, at the end of the day, the person must have  this\r\n\r\nesteem  of  self-organisation, self-regulation.  And that  every\r\n\r\nindividual  must  self-organise himself, self-regulate  himself,\r\n\r\nrather  than  further regulation.  Nevertheless, we are  already\r\n\r\nimposing slightly higher penalties, including the number of days\r\n\r\nfor CWO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other question by Mr Rai is on housing estates\r\n\r\nwith open drains.  The Ministry will consider the covering up of\r\n\r\ndrains  only  in  private housing estates situated  on  elevated\r\n\r\nground where the drains can have a good gradient and water  will\r\n\r\nnot  stagnate.  This is to prevent mosquito breeding.   We  will\r\n\r\ntherefore consider the proposal to cover the drains selectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the greenery, I think there are two parts. One will\r\n\r\nbe  looked  after  by the Government, and the other  is  by  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, as the Minister has said that\r\n\r\nfinancial  measures are not important in influencing responsible\r\n\r\nenvironmental behaviour, I look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforward  to  the day when he comes to this House to abolish  the\r\n\r\nfines   and  other  financial  measures  enacted  to  discourage\r\n\r\nlittering.   Otherwise, I thank him and the Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState for the replies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Heng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MC 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, illegal dumping on vacant land, mainly State land in\r\n\r\nthis  case,  is becoming a serious issue.  All kinds  of  debris\r\n\r\nsuch as construction material, marine clay and,  more seriously,\r\n\r\ntoxic  and  hazardous  wastes  are some of  the  rubbish  dumped\r\n\r\nillegally.   Often, such illegal dumping is done  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  such as in Jalan Kayu or in Punggol.  Not only  do  they\r\n\r\ngive  rise to additional land maintenance work and waste  public\r\n\r\nfunds  in  removing  them, but also affect the  environment  and\r\n\r\npersonal health of residents living in and near these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the increasing level of illegal dumping and the skill\r\n\r\nand speed of the illegal operators, I suspect that it is more an\r\n\r\norganised  activity  carried  out  by  syndicates  than  ad  hoc\r\n\r\nactivities by unrelated parties.  Sir, this is not surprising as\r\n\r\nthere  are good profits to be made in this illegal business.   I\r\n\r\nwas  informed that the price per lorry load for illegal  dumping\r\n\r\nwas  about $200, whereas one had to pay about $470 for a similar\r\n\r\nlorry  load  at the Government's dumping grounds.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nreal  reason is that the penalties are not heavy enough to deter\r\n\r\nthis illegal activity, given the potential profits to be made in\r\n\r\nthis  business.  When caught, usually, only the lorry driver  is\r\n\r\nfined.   The master-mind is seldom caught, as officers from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the Envrionment lack the powers to detain  and  to\r\n\r\ninterrogate the offenders.  Hence, they are unable to trace  the\r\n\r\noffence back to the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that the penalties for illegal\r\n\r\ndumping be increased\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  reflect  the  seriousness of this activity, especially  when\r\n\r\ntoxic  or  hazardous wastes are involved.  The  Ministry  should\r\n\r\nalso be given police assistance to help them with detention  and\r\n\r\ninterrogation so as to enable the officers from the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nstem illegal dumping at its source.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A.

Through their hard work,  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  their  standard of living has changed from non-comfortable\r\n\r\nto  comfortable.  I am of the opinion that perhaps this  is  the\r\n\r\nway  we could narrow the gap between the low and the high income\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned several times that those who receive\r\n\r\nassistance from the Ministry of Community Development and  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  in the low income group be given a stall so that  they\r\n\r\ncould change and improve their standard of living.  I still hope\r\n\r\nthat  allotting  of stalls through the tender  system  could  be\r\n\r\nmodified so that those in the low income group could also have a\r\n\r\nchance of getting stalls.  And I will keep on fighting for this.\r\n\r\nI   hope   the  Minister  could  review  the  system  and   give\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I continue with my next topic?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you may.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A. Ghani:</b> Sir, the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nhas  implemented  various programmes and projects  to  curb  the\r\n\r\nspread of dengue fever.  However, the Ministry's efforts seem to\r\n\r\nbe  less  effective as the number of people infected  by  dengue\r\n\r\nfever  from  1995 to 1997 shows no improvement.  It has  instead\r\n\r\nincreased as follows: 2,008 cases in 1995, 3,128 cases  in  1996\r\n\r\nand  4,300  cases in 1997.  Worse still, recently, the newspaper\r\n\r\nreported that within the last two and a half months, there  were\r\n\r\n1,291  cases.   I think at the end of the month,  there  may  be\r\n\r\n6,000 cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the figures that I have quoted, it clearly shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  general public is still not aware of the  dangers  of\r\n\r\ndengue  fever.  Perhaps they believe that it is not  as  bad  as\r\n\r\nother sickness.  In actual fact, if the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfever is left untreated, it would make the victim go into shock,\r\n\r\nas  manifested  by  a rapid and weak pulse rate  and  low  blood\r\n\r\npressure.  Hence, death can also occur.  Therefore, what is  the\r\n\r\nfollow-up action the Environment Ministry is planning to take in\r\n\r\nthe future?  I hope the Minister will enlighten us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, we have just heard that for the\r\n\r\nfirst two and a half months this year, there were 1,291 cases of\r\n\r\ndengue  fever.  And one of the worst hit areas, as reported,  is\r\n\r\nthe  construction  site of the new Tan Tock Seng  Hospital.   So\r\n\r\nfar,  15  hospital  staff are down with  dengue  fever.   It  so\r\n\r\nhappens  that the Minister in charge of the environment is  also\r\n\r\nin   charge   of  health,  which  is  overseeing  the  hospital.\r\n\r\nApparently, the mosquitoes did not choose where to breed and who\r\n\r\nto  bite,   so long as there is stagnant water, and so  long  as\r\n\r\nthey smell human blood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my constituency also experienced a surge in dengue\r\n\r\nfever  cases  for the month of August last year.   There  was  a\r\n\r\nrecord  high  of 74 cases, and together with the  Marine  Parade\r\n\r\nTown Council which is managing my ward, we literally combed  the\r\n\r\nwhole ward and found that the main source of dengue outbreak was\r\n\r\nfrom a HDB construction site at Serangoon Central.  ENV together\r\n\r\nwith  HDB  intensified the source reduction at the  construction\r\n\r\nsite  and  brought the situation under control.  This experience\r\n\r\nled  us  to  think  that identification of the  main  source  of\r\n\r\nmosquito breeding ground is an effective way of eradicating  the\r\n\r\nhazard posed by dengue fever.  Based on the recent feedback from\r\n\r\nmy  constituents,  we  feel that the construction  site  at  the\r\n\r\nNortheast  MRT  line  will be a potential  source  for  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding and if it is not effectively controlled, there will  be\r\n\r\nfuture outbreaks of dengue cases in my ward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand from the Marine Parade Town Council that\r\n\r\ncurrently the Ministry of the Environment is conducting a  joint\r\n\r\nproject  with the Town Council with the aim of total eradication\r\n\r\nof mosquito breeding grounds, which I fully support.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve  this  is a more systematic way of bringing  the  dengue\r\n\r\ncases  under control.  Basically, this project involves engaging\r\n\r\na   pest  control  company  for  routine  mosquito  control  and\r\n\r\nchecking.   I  was  told  that  the  initial  result  was   very\r\n\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above background information, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the Ministry of the Environment identified the root\r\n\r\ncause of the seemingly uncontrolled increase in dengue cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) With the alarming record of high dengue cases reported\r\n\r\nover  the  last two years, what is Ministry of the Environment's\r\n\r\nshort  term  and long term strategies to combat this undesirable\r\n\r\ntrend?  And  what is the Minister's prediction of the  trend  in\r\n\r\n1998?  Is it going to level off, going down or continue to rise?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, as my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Encik  Harun  Ghani said,  despite  the  Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry   being  extremely  vigilant  in  keeping   mosquitoes,\r\n\r\nespecially  the Aedes  mosquitoes, under control,  dengue  cases\r\n\r\nstill persist.  In fact, it has increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry has encouraged owners of landed\r\n\r\nproperties  to  do away with the provision of gutters  in  their\r\n\r\npremises  and  request all Town Councils to take  away  all  the\r\n\r\ncovers of the open drains.  Have these measures been found to be\r\n\r\neffective  in  reducing mosquito breeding grounds?   Or  is  the\r\n\r\nMinistry contemplating introducing any new measures so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  lessen or even eradicate this serious nuisance?   How  does\r\n\r\nthis  decision to remove all covers of the open drains reconcile\r\n\r\nwith the earlier decision to cover all drains, especially in the\r\n\r\ncatchment area in order to maximise the collection of water  for\r\n\r\nrecycling?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know the latest profile of dengue\r\n\r\ncases.  Is East Coast still the most vulnerable area?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, originally, dengue\r\n\r\nhaemorrhagic fever which was supposed to have vanished\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore has reappeared.  According to reports, the number\r\n\r\nof  such  cases  is on the rise.   I know that  the  Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry's  officers  are trying their best  to  wipe  out  this\r\n\r\nproblem.   But,  of  late,  their efforts  do  not  seem  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever are on the rise.\r\n\r\nRecently, because in the increase in cases reported in  the  Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng  Hospital  area, ENV officials conducted  a  thorough\r\n\r\nsearch of the area and discovered that there were about 18 sites\r\n\r\nwhich   were   breeding  grounds  for  the   Aedes   mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nConstruction works have been going on in this area  for  over  a\r\n\r\nyear.   It is only now that they have discovered that there  are\r\n\r\nso  many breeding grounds for the Aedes mosquitoes.  Is  it  not\r\n\r\ntoo late?  According to the Annual Report of the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  in  1992,  7,052 mosquitoes  breeding  sites  were\r\n\r\ndiscovered.   By  1992, the number of breeding sites  discovered\r\n\r\nwas  25,530.    On the average, more than 20,000 breeding  sites\r\n\r\nwere  discovered.   So I want to ask, since  there  is  a  clear\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  breeding sites, apart from  fumigation,  what\r\n\r\nother measures are taken against this kind of situation?  I feel\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of the Environment should cooperate with other\r\n\r\nGovernment Ministries and agencies to have an overall  plan  and\r\n\r\nscheme to stop the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, before PWD and URA approve the permits for\r\n\r\nconstruction  work to commence, the contractors  concerned  must\r\n\r\nfirst engage vector control agencies approved by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment to regularly inspect the construction sites  to\r\n\r\nprevent  mosquito breeding.  Together with URA and the Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Architects (SIA), the Ministry of the  Environment\r\n\r\ncan  stipulate the minimum gradient of the drains so that  water\r\n\r\nwill  not  accumulate  and  remain stagnant  to  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nbreeding of mosquitoes therein.  Likewise, there should also  be\r\n\r\nstipulations  that  no  gutters should be  constructed  for  the\r\n\r\nhouses in new development projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I shall take the last set of cuts first\r\n\r\non vector control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of dengue fever is a major concern to my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  As pointed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  by  Mr  Harun Ghani, the trend has been quite a frightening\r\n\r\none.  The number of people down with dengue increased from 2,000\r\n\r\nin 1995 to over 4,000 last year, a doubling in two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the cause of this? Firstly, dengue arises\r\n\r\nonly   when  we  have  Aedes  mosquitoes.   When  the   mosquito\r\n\r\npopulation  increases, the risk of dengue also  increases.   One\r\n\r\nproblem  is  that over the years the Aedes mosquito has  adapted\r\n\r\nvery,  very well to our urban setting.  In the past,  the  Aedes\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  tended  to breed mainly indoors  in  stagnant,  very\r\n\r\nclean  water.   But  now the Aedes mosquitoes  have  also  moved\r\n\r\noutdoors and also they are able to breed in water that  is  less\r\n\r\nthan  clean.  So the number of breeding sites available  to  the\r\n\r\nmosquito  has now increased, which is why this is a battle  that\r\n\r\ncannot be fought by the Ministry of the Environment alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a battle that must involve every Singaporean,\r\n\r\nbecause our studies have shown that in a neighbourhood, all  you\r\n\r\nneed  is,  out  of  100  homes,  two  homes  which  breed  Aedes\r\n\r\nmosquitoes, and there will be a dengue outbreak risk  there.  98\r\n\r\nfamilies  who are very, very vigilant but two families are  very\r\n\r\ncomplacent, and you will get dengue in the neighbourhood,  which\r\n\r\nis why the cooperation of the general public is important.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  the public education programme must continue to be  the\r\n\r\nlinchpin.   It  is  not  possible  for  the  Ministry   of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment to go and inspect each and every home in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not have the people.  This is not a police state.  Every\r\n\r\nfamily  must  be  responsible for inspecting its  own  premises.\r\n\r\nFines  are not really the solution. We have increased the  fines\r\n\r\nlast  year to $150.  But that is really not a solution.  To fine\r\n\r\na  family is after the fact.  I would rather that they  have  no\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other source of mosquito breeding is the construction\r\n\r\nsites.  Here I must say the trend has been a good one because of\r\n\r\nthe  heavy  penalties  being imposed  against  the  construction\r\n\r\ncompanies.  If they are caught breeding, the first time we  fine\r\n\r\nthem, the second time we will have a heavier fine, and the third\r\n\r\ntime we will ask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem to shut down.  A stop-work order is issued until they clear\r\n\r\nup  the entire site.  It may be two or three days.  The cost  to\r\n\r\nthem  runs  into tens, if not hundreds of thousands of  dollars.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  that, most construction companies now have  engaged\r\n\r\npest  control  companies to help them because they realise  that\r\n\r\nlooking after mosquitoes is not really their forte.  So many  of\r\n\r\nthem have their own pest control companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my other point that we are now\r\n\r\nintroducing  a  programme  to  better  train  the  pest  control\r\n\r\ncompanies on, firstly, looking for mosquito breeding sites  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,   how   to  advise  the  construction   companies   on\r\n\r\neradicating and preventing mosquito breeding sites.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  with  this  effort, we should see further  improvement  in\r\n\r\neradicating mosquito breeding in construction sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked about the roof gutters. There is\r\n\r\nreally  no  need  for  us  to ban roof gutters.   For  old  roof\r\n\r\ngutters,  we  have  asked  that  they  either  paint  them  with\r\n\r\ninsecticide  paint or they find some other ways of  making  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  water does not stagnate in the old gutters or,  worse\r\n\r\ncomes to the worse, remove the gutters.  But what we would  like\r\n\r\nthe architects to do is to see whether they can come out with  a\r\n\r\nbetter roof gutter design which will prevent stagnation of water\r\n\r\nover  time.  If they can do that, they would have contributed  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal to our fight against dengue fever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the measure to remove drain covers reconcile with\r\n\r\nthe  earlier measure, which is to ask that drains be covered up?\r\n\r\nSir, we have asked for the drains to be covered up earlier on in\r\n\r\norder  to  prevent littering of the drains.  But  what  we  have\r\n\r\nfound  is that the covered drains actually lend themselves  even\r\n\r\nbetter  to mosquito breeding.  Between the two problems,  it  is\r\n\r\nmore  important that we tackle the mosquito problem.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  have asked for the drain covers to be removed.  We have come\r\n\r\nout  with  other  measures  which should  help  us  prevent  the\r\n\r\nlittering  problem from getting out of hand and  preventing  the\r\n\r\nlitter from getting into our water reservoirs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the earlier cuts. Mr Heng Chiang Meng\r\n\r\ntalked about illegal dumping.  Yes, I agree with him.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nbig  problem.   It is a problem we are very concerned  with  and\r\n\r\nwhich  is  why  we  have  increased the  penalties  from  $1,000\r\n\r\npreviously  to $10,000, or a jail term of up to 12 months.   For\r\n\r\nrepeat offenders, the previous penalty was $2,000.  We have  now\r\n\r\nincreased  it to $20,000, and a mandatory jail term  of  between\r\n\r\none  and 12 months.  I would like to inform Mr Heng Chiang  Meng\r\n\r\nthat we are still not satisfied that the penalties are adequate,\r\n\r\nand  we will be taking steps later this year to raise the  fines\r\n\r\nfurther  and to make it mandatory for the vehicles used  in  the\r\n\r\nillegal dumping activity to be forfeited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Harun Ghani has asked about hawkers. Sir, he talks about\r\n\r\nthe  60s  and 70s, I agree with him.  In the 60s and  70s,  with\r\n\r\nrampant unemployment, it was very difficult for people to get  a\r\n\r\njob  and  therefore the hardship cases had to be helped somehow.\r\n\r\nSome  of  them were lucky enough to get hawker stalls.  But  the\r\n\r\nsituation  today  has  totally changed.   In  our  labour  short\r\n\r\nsituation, anyone who wants a job can easily get one.  Those who\r\n\r\nthink  they can cook but do not have the capital to start  their\r\n\r\nown business, or who are unable to join in the tender process, I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that they get a job as a cook, and maybe work as a\r\n\r\ncook in one of the hawker stalls and establish their reputation.\r\n\r\nOnce  they  have done that, they can go and join in  the  tender\r\n\r\nprocess  and get themselves a stall.  We have to make sure  that\r\n\r\nour  limited  number of hawker stalls is used efficiently.   Our\r\n\r\nexperience  has been that this is best accomplished through  the\r\n\r\nmarket mechanism.  They tender for it.  They must make sure that\r\n\r\nit is being efficiently used from morning to night.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A clarification from the Minister, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  mentioned  in my speech that the number of cases of  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding  has shot up from over 7,000 cases in 1992  to  25,000,\r\n\r\nand subsequently an average of 20,000 cases.

Yet, Sir,\r\n\r\n10  years of planning and hard work could easily be destroyed by\r\n\r\nonly  a  few months, or even a few weeks, of neglect.  Pollution\r\n\r\nof  the  rivers is never ending.  The sources of river pollution\r\n\r\nare  extremely  widespread.  River pollution can come  from  any\r\n\r\nland  area which drains into the rivers, regardless of  how  far\r\n\r\nthat land area may be from the rivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, the Ministry of the Environment installs\r\n\r\nvertical  gratings at selected outlet drains and float booms  at\r\n\r\nstrategic  locations  in the rivers and canals  to  protect  the\r\n\r\naesthetics of the water bodies.

More  importantly, I hope that  the  members  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  those  that are interested,  will  come  forward  to\r\n\r\nvolunteer for this very exciting project.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, spending just one evening in a\r\n\r\ndiscotheque  can  leave  a young person with  a  severe  hearing\r\n\r\nimpairment and very definite threat of deafness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Hazell, head of medical research at the Royal\r\n\r\nNational  Institute  for  the Deaf, said  that  nearly  all  his\r\n\r\npatients\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith problems caused by clubbing had done it for just one night.\r\n\r\nUp  to 80% of night-club patrons would end up with some kind  of\r\n\r\nhearing damage.

And more importantly, can  we\r\n\r\nprotect  the  public, especially the young, from  this  type  of\r\n\r\ndeafness through public education?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, haze\r\n\r\nis a problem which the people are very concerned about.  Because\r\n\r\nof  the big forest fire in Indonesia, there was a heavy haze  in\r\n\r\nSingapore last year, resulting in the pollution of our air,  and\r\n\r\nthe  health  of  our people was affected.  The Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  took a serious view of the matter.   It  not   only\r\n\r\nhelped  the Indonesian government to control the forest fire  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  effect of the haze, but also explored the  possible\r\n\r\ncauses of air pollution in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, it was discovered that the giant joss-sticks and candles burnt during the Seventh Moon festival and\r\n\r\nat  religious  ceremonies of the temples was  also  one  of  the\r\n\r\ncauses  of  air  pollution.  For this reason, the Government  is\r\n\r\nregulating  the burning of giant joss-sticks and  candles,  with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1st  March  this  year.   The  regulation  clearly\r\n\r\nprovides  that the giant joss-sticks to be burnt  shall  not  be\r\n\r\nlonger  than  2 metres, and not more than two sets,  that  is  6\r\n\r\nsticks, of these joss-sticks shall be burnt at any one time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new regulation which takes effect from 1st March,\r\n\r\nprovides that anyone who violates the regulation may be fined up\r\n\r\nto  $2,000.  In order to avoid any misunderstanding arising from\r\n\r\nthe enforcement of this new ruling, I would like to suggest:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we should explain such measures to the people\r\n\r\nthrough  an education campaign.  The Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nshould coordinate with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations and relevant religious bodies to invite\r\n\r\nthe  organisers  of  the Seventh Moon festival  to  a  talk  and\r\n\r\nexplain  the  new rules to them,  so that they could  understand\r\n\r\nthe need for such regulations.  I think it is better to get them\r\n\r\nto  abide  by the law through education rather than  by  way  of\r\n\r\nfines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should prohibit the import of such giant joss\r\n\r\nsticks.  Most of these are imported from other countries.  Under\r\n\r\nthe new regulations, only those who burn the joss-sticks will be\r\n\r\nfined  but  not those who sell them. Sir, Singapore  is  a  free\r\n\r\nentrepot.   If  such joss-sticks are imported for  re-export  to\r\n\r\nother  countries,  then it is all right.   But,  we  should  ban\r\n\r\ntraders  from  importing such joss sticks for use in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nOnce  the  supply of these over-sized joss-sticks is  banned  at\r\n\r\nsource,  it  will  not  be necessary for  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment officials to check on the illegal burning  of  over-sized joss-sticks, and the precious resources can be better used\r\n\r\nfor other purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should be more liberal in implementing such new\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Burning  joss sticks is part of the  religious  rites\r\n\r\namong  the Chinese community in Singapore.  We should allow  the\r\n\r\npeople  more time to understand these new measures.   We  should\r\n\r\nunderstand  the Seventh Moon festival is part of the culture  of\r\n\r\nthe Chinese people in Singapore, and burning of joss sticks is a\r\n\r\nreligious  rite practised  at such festivals.  So, in  order  to\r\n\r\nensure  that people do not break the law, we hope the Government\r\n\r\nshould  explain  to the people first.  We must not  forget  that\r\n\r\nthese  organisers  of  the  Seventh  Moon  festivals  are   also\r\n\r\ncontributing  to  our  charitable  organisations.    They   have\r\n\r\ncontributed  quite  a lot to our charitable  organisations.   So\r\n\r\nthey  must  first  understand what the  benefits  of  these  new\r\n\r\nmeasures are, and then I believe all the organisers and devotees\r\n\r\nwould do their best to comply with the regulations laid down  by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that during this first year of implementation of\r\n\r\nthis   new  regulation,  we  could  be  more  liberal   in   our\r\n\r\nenforcement actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I would like to talk\r\n\r\nabout  the  topic  of  benzene in  petrol.   On  more  than  one\r\n\r\noccasion,  readers of The Straits Times wrote in the Forum  page\r\n\r\nabout  the  benzene  level in automotive  gasoline  (petrol,  in\r\n\r\nshort).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, benzene is classified as a carcinogen and it can cause\r\n\r\nblood  disorder cancer, called leukemia, if there  is  prolonged\r\n\r\ncontact  of  about 20 parts per million.  Regarding the  benzene\r\n\r\nlevel  in the petrol, to my understanding, it is not a mandatory\r\n\r\ncontrol  item.  However, the oil companies and the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe   Environment  agreed  among  themselves  not  to  have   it\r\n\r\nexcessively dosed in  petrol.  However, due to competition,  oil\r\n\r\ncompanies might use higher research octane number, in short RON,\r\n\r\nto  attract  customers.  One of the ways  to  boost  the  octane\r\n\r\ngrading  of petrol is to increase the level of benzene component\r\n\r\nin the brand of petrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every car is designed to consume a certain grade of\r\n\r\npetrol.  The RON of petrol which is higher than what the car  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  for, normally it is about 95 RON, has no advantage  in\r\n\r\nperformance of a properly maintained car.  The rise of  the  RON\r\n\r\nin  petrol  at the expense of more benzene component,  which  is\r\n\r\nharmful  to  human  health, is really unnecessary.   The  people\r\n\r\nwhose health could be affected are the petroleum workers, petrol\r\n\r\ntruck drivers, petrol station attendants and the motor mechanics\r\n\r\nwho  frequently  use  petrol  as a cleaning  agent  for  certain\r\n\r\nsensitive engine components.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask, firstly, whether the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  consider  the  control of benzene in automotive  gasoline.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  would  he  consider initiating a  consumer  education\r\n\r\nprogramme  on research octane number (RON), so that  the  higher\r\n\r\nthan necessary RON product promotion gimmicks at the expense  of\r\n\r\nhaving  more benzene component in the fuel could be discouraged?\r\n\r\nThirdly, would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  consider setting an upper limit of  RON  for  all\r\n\r\nnewly  registered cars and ban petrol that exceeds the limit  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the limit for benzene?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me respond to Mr Heng. Sir,\r\n\r\nindeed,  I  would like to thank Mr Heng and his GPC members  for\r\n\r\ncoming out with a concept paper.  We agree with him that keeping\r\n\r\nthe  rivers clean should also be a national effort involving  as\r\n\r\nmany   people   as   possible,  and  I  look  forward   to   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the scheme in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deafness from discotheques raised by Dr Lily Neo, there\r\n\r\nis  no  restriction  at the moment on the  volume  of  music  in\r\n\r\ndiscotheques.   Although I agree with the Member that  prolonged\r\n\r\nexposure  to  very loud noise may cause noise induced  deafness,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  no other country has implemented  similar  noise\r\n\r\ncontrol measures.  I will ask my Ministry to take a further look\r\n\r\ninto  this subject and do a more thorough study on the  measures\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  adopted by other countries in the  control  of\r\n\r\nnoise.  Sir, in terms of publicly educating our youngsters, yes,\r\n\r\nwe will do that and we will get the non-Government organisations\r\n\r\nthat are interested to join us in this effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng spoke on the burning of giant joss sticks.\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to inform Mr Ang that since October last year,\r\n\r\nwe  have been in active discussion with the key parties involved\r\n\r\nin  the  burning of giant joss sticks.  We have been  discussing\r\n\r\nwith  the merchants involved but, more importantly, we have also\r\n\r\nbeen discussing with the religious bodies - the Singapore Taoist\r\n\r\nAssociation and the Singapore Buddhist Association.   And  I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to  say that both the Taoist Association and the  Buddhist\r\n\r\nAssociation  have  supported the move by the  Government.   They\r\n\r\nhave  informed  us that giant joss stick is not  part  of  their\r\n\r\ntradition  and that a smaller joss stick would do equally  well,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of conveying their prayers to the gods. As  such,  we\r\n\r\nhave  decided  to proceed with the ban on the burning  of  giant\r\n\r\njoss  sticks.  We have actually been a little bit more  flexible\r\n\r\nbecause the original proposal which we discussed with the bodies\r\n\r\nwas to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch smaller joss sticks.  But in response to their appeals,  we\r\n\r\nhave agreed to allow them to have a 2-metre joss stick and a  75\r\n\r\nmm diameter.  So in actual fact, we have acceded to the requests\r\n\r\nof  the  relevant  people.   There is  no  need  to  do  a  soft\r\n\r\nintroduction  this  year.   This  is  especially  so  since  the\r\n\r\nlikelihood of the haze hitting us will be quite high this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked us to perhaps ban the trade in re-export\r\n\r\nof  giant  joss sticks to other countries.  Sir, we  should  not\r\n\r\ninterfere  in  the  general trade of joss sticks  or  any  other\r\n\r\nmatter.   There  is  a market for that.  It is  legal  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Let our traders continue with their trading but they\r\n\r\nshould know that in Singapore, we do not allow such giant  joss-stick to be burned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On benzene in automotive fuel, Sir, I would like to inform\r\n\r\nProf. Low that there is a maximum limit on the amount of benzene\r\n\r\nin  fuel, and that is 5% by volume.  We have a regulation.   And\r\n\r\nthis  5%  limit is the same as that adopted by the EU countries,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  Japan,  Hong  Kong, and South  Korea.   My  Ministry\r\n\r\nconducts  regular tests on petrol to see what is  the  level  of\r\n\r\nbenzene   because,  as  he  has  pointed  out,  benzene   is   a\r\n\r\ncarcinogenic  item and I am glad to say that today,  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen no cases of benzene content exceeding the 5% limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the raising of the octane rating and that he\r\n\r\nfears  that  this  is done through additional  benzene  content.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  true that benzene can help to increase the  octane\r\n\r\nrating  but there is an alternative, and that is by using methyl\r\n\r\ntertiary butyl ether (MTBE).  And this is the route being  taken\r\n\r\nby  the  oil  companies for raising the octane rating  of  their\r\n\r\nfuel.   I am glad to say that MTBE has also been shown to  be  a\r\n\r\nnon-carcinogenic item and therefore it does not pose any  threat\r\n\r\nto public health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked us to initiate education to inform Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  they  really do not need such a high octane rating.   Sir,\r\n\r\nsince  the  benzene  content does not pose a  threat  to  public\r\n\r\nhealth, we should leave it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto market forces as to whether we should opt for a higher octane\r\n\r\nrating or a lower octane rating.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nreply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $361,798,920 for Head M ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,012,148,200 for Head M ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head S -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head S - Ministry of Manpower.

One\r\n\r\nclear disappointment among the delegates was that the unions had\r\n\r\nnot  been involved in policy and decision-making in the  efforts\r\n\r\nto  handle  the  serious  economic crisis  in  the  region.   It\r\n\r\nappeared  that  the  trade union movement had  no  role  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis.   It  was only lately  that  some  governments\r\n\r\ninvited  the  trade  unions to be involved in  IMF  discussions.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation exists because in those countries, there is  no\r\n\r\ntripartite mechanism which enables the viewpoints of the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement to be an important input in all negotiations.  The lack\r\n\r\nof  this is detrimental to industrial peace.  For example,  when\r\n\r\nKorea amended the Employment Act, workers went on strike because\r\n\r\nof a lack of a well-established tripartite relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.50 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fortunate for Singapore that we have a strong\r\n\r\ntripartite working relationship.  However, we must not take this\r\n\r\nrelationship  for  granted but must instead, during  this  time,\r\n\r\ntake  the opportunity to strengthen it.  I would therefore  like\r\n\r\nto call\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupon  the  Minister  to look into how we could  invoke  existing\r\n\r\nmechanisms  or, if need be, set up new channels for  discussions\r\n\r\namong  the  three  parties on how to prepare  ourselves  and  to\r\n\r\nrespond to the challenges that are fast taking place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that there is already a Retrenchment\r\n\r\nCommittee.   I  hope that the Committee would take  a  proactive\r\n\r\napproach  by  looking  into measures such  as  job  redesigning,\r\n\r\nidentifying new jobs and job replacement for retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nand matching retrenched workers with available training schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has set up a blueprint called NTUC 21. Some of its\r\n\r\nkey  mission  objectives are employability,  competitiveness  of\r\n\r\ncompanies,  promoting productivity and strengthening  tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership for better industrial relations.  SNEF also has SNEF\r\n\r\n21  which will also benefit both employers and workers.  I  call\r\n\r\nupon the Ministry of Manpower to incorporate the aspirations  of\r\n\r\nboth unions and employers in the formulation of its mission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the Ministry of Manpower is timely.\r\n\r\nWith  keen  international competition, our workforce has  to  be\r\n\r\nglobally  competitive if we want to retain our  competitiveness.\r\n\r\nIt  is  important  that we have one Ministry to  coordinate  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  an  integrated  and  comprehensive  strategy  for   the\r\n\r\nplanning, development and management of human resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there are several agencies like NTUC, PSB, EDB\r\n\r\nand  ITE which are involved in training.  With the establishment\r\n\r\nof  MOM, the roles of these agencies would have to be clarified.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to suggest that MOM set up a tripartite committee\r\n\r\non  training to look into training and overall manpower planning\r\n\r\nand human resource development in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of MOM has generated a lot of interest\r\n\r\nand  expectations.  Many would like to know what key initiatives\r\n\r\nMOM will be working on once it is launched.  One key concern  is\r\n\r\ntraining for the existing workforce.  I call upon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOM   to   support  programmes,  such  as  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme,   Back-to-Work  Programme  and  Skills  Certification\r\n\r\nProgramme, and to develop these programmes into national schemes\r\n\r\nto cover all workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area of training that MOM should look\r\n\r\ninto.   This  is  the building up of skills in  areas  of  human\r\n\r\nresource  management and industrial relations.   Human  resource\r\n\r\nmanagement  training is important for helping  companies  manage\r\n\r\ntheir  human  resource.  And industrial relations training  will\r\n\r\nenable  officers  who  are involved in industrial  relations  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  job  better and thus be  more  effective.   The\r\n\r\ntarget  of such training will be MOM staff who handle industrial\r\n\r\nrelations,  trade  union staff, employers and management  staff.\r\n\r\nThis will complement training currently provided by NTUC and the\r\n\r\nSingapore Institute of Labour Studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the issue of foreign talent. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister to elaborate on the kind  of  schemes\r\n\r\nthat will be put in place to attract foreign talent and how this\r\n\r\nfits into our overall manpower planning.  There is no dispute at\r\n\r\nall that to remain competitive, we need talents from outside  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  capabilities   of  our  own  workforce.   This  is\r\n\r\ninevitable  given our small size and manpower constraints.   But\r\n\r\nat the same time, we must not overlook Singaporeans' concerns on\r\n\r\nthe impact that an influx of foreign talents would have on their\r\n\r\njobs  and  standard of living.  To get rid of  such  fears,  the\r\n\r\nmessage  transmitted must be clear: that every Singaporean  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  given  full  opportunities  to  develop  their\r\n\r\npotential.  Could the Minister ensure that sufficient safeguards\r\n\r\nare  put in place to prevent employers from abusing this  scheme\r\n\r\nby  bringing  in  talents  from  outside  even  when  there  are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  fill the jobs?  We must also ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ntransfer   of   skills   and  competence  from   foreigners   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  takes  place so as to avoid  continued  and  over-dependence on foreign labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these workers are in our workforce, we must help them\r\n\r\nadjust and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadapt to our work environment and society.

We  could  use  the  CDCs, CCs  and  other  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and even NTUC to provide the network  of  support\r\n\r\nand  assistance needed to run such programmes.   All  these  may\r\n\r\nhelp  the  foreign talent become integrated, if not, assimilated\r\n\r\ninto  our  society  because  it  is  important  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nformation of unhealthy enclaves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, come 1st April,\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Ministry  will  become  MOM  to  conceive  quite  a\r\n\r\nformidable  task to deliver, and that is no joke.  As stipulated\r\n\r\nin  the mission statement, Sir, the Ministry of Manpower will be\r\n\r\nentrusted  with  the  role of developing a globally  competitive\r\n\r\nworkforce  for our Singapore.  This will be done through  proper\r\n\r\nmanpower  planning and development and this will  also  be  done\r\n\r\nwith the support of selected international talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question that comes to mind is how much different will\r\n\r\nthis  new  Ministry be from the former Ministry of Labour?   The\r\n\r\nbudget shows a 13.8% increase in manpower and 14.5% increase  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure.    What  does  the  Ministry  see  as   its   major\r\n\r\nchallenges?   Will  the Ministry of Manpower  set  training  and\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  the  local workforce as its  main  priority?   In\r\n\r\ntrying to augment local manpower with international talent, does\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  see  conflicts of interests?  And  how  does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry intend to balance the needs and interests of the  local\r\n\r\nworkforce and foreign talent?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has also identified the need to\r\n\r\nenhance  Singapore's  international image and  interest  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of labour.  This is also an area which is of interest  to\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC.  How does the Ministry of Manpower see the two,  that\r\n\r\nis,  the Ministry and NTUC, collaborating in this field?   Would\r\n\r\nMOM  consider  working  with Singapore International  Foundation\r\n\r\n(SIF)  and other related agencies which leave visitor programmes\r\n\r\nto facilitate their visitors to observe and understand the state\r\n\r\nof industrial affairs here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, one important area that could enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's  image is the way Singaporeans treat  their  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  and  talents.  Would the Ministry of Manpower  consider\r\n\r\norganising programmes that would help Singaporeans to understand\r\n\r\nwhy  we  need  foreign workers and talents and  also  to  assist\r\n\r\nforeign  workers in urgent need of help and those treated  badly\r\n\r\nby irresponsible Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I am not persuaded\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry  of Manpower terminology.  While  I  certainly\r\n\r\nagree  that we have to develop a globally competitive knowledge-based  workforce and hence the need for an overarching strategy,\r\n\r\nI find the term \"Manpower Ministry\" a little outdated.  I am not\r\n\r\neven  thinking  of  gender neutrality.  In the next  millennium,\r\n\r\nsurely  brain  power and portable skills are going  to  be  more\r\n\r\nimportant  in the global market challenge.  Our people  must  be\r\n\r\nwell  educated and well trained.  Those who reach a certain  age\r\n\r\ngroup should even be retrained.  Those who are well-qualified or\r\n\r\nskilled  will  be able to find a market for their  skills,  even\r\n\r\nacross  borders.  And our regionalisation effort,  which  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  facet  of  our necessary capital export  strategy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  will  have  to  integrate  with  our  overall  human\r\n\r\nresource development to enable Singaporeans to go world-wide, to\r\n\r\ninvest and to work, and to build a second wing for our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing our human resource and networking the region or\r\n\r\nthe  world for the right kind of investment to build our  second\r\n\r\nwing  point to the right way to go for our future.  In  a  world\r\n\r\nwhere  industries  or technologies can get obsolete  very  fast,\r\n\r\nemphasising  portability of skills, training and transferability\r\n\r\nof  skills and the learning culture are crucial and defining for\r\n\r\nour success.  Hence, I find the Ministry of Manpower a bit of  a\r\n\r\nmisnomer.  Perhaps we have even gone a step backward.  At  least\r\n\r\nlabour  is a factor input in macro-economic terms.

The\r\n\r\nthrust  of  today's  labour  market  policies  is  towards  less\r\n\r\nrigidities,  facilitating mobility of skills and flexibility  in\r\n\r\nwages, in order to be competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope we should be looking for foreign talents and skills\r\n\r\nonly to supplement what we lack, after we have done all our best\r\n\r\nto train, cross-train and to retrain our people, and not to plan\r\n\r\nto  fill up the foreign manpower gap even when we have not  done\r\n\r\nall  these.   It  is  foreign talents and skills  we  want,  not\r\n\r\nforeign manpower per se.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest it is not too late to change the name of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  the  Ministry  of Human Resource  Development,  to\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves for the challenge of the 21st century  market\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where knowledge and skill intensity in product\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  services will be  the  critical  factors  in\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, we should always remind ourselves that our  own\r\n\r\nhuman  resource must be valued, and the utmost be done  for  its\r\n\r\ndevelopment  so  that  our  workers  will  be  employable,  with\r\n\r\ntraining  to upgrade their skills and knowledge.  We always  say\r\n\r\nthat  human resource is all we have, knowing that it can achieve\r\n\r\nwonders  with training.  We never say manpower is all  we  have,\r\n\r\nknowing full well it is not very much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will not consider I am nit-picking on a\r\n\r\nname, but a name is everything.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to thank Mr Chay for making a pitch for womanpower.  But if\r\n\r\nthere is any comfort at all, the new acronym for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower is MOM, and mum is a woman!  And we were told also that\r\n\r\nmum knows best because she has delivered all these years of hard\r\n\r\nlabour.  So in that sense, I think let us not quibble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to focus on three areas. First, is the\r\n\r\nimmediate impact of the economic downturn on women.  In the last\r\n\r\nfew  weeks, we debated on the impact of the economic  crisis  on\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the need for retraining of workers.   There  is  a\r\n\r\ngender blindness in the discussions, and I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister if there is a disproportionately high tendency  towards\r\n\r\nretrenchment  of women workers, for example, and  whether  women\r\n\r\nworkers have any great difficulties in finding jobs after  their\r\n\r\nretrenchment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women who are sole breadwinners feel the immediate impact\r\n\r\nof the financial crisis.  Does the Minister have figures on this\r\n\r\nsituation  and help us assess the severity of the impact?   What\r\n\r\nsort  of employment related strategies is MOM prepared to extend\r\n\r\nto such families?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second area is on long-term strategic planning for women\r\n\r\nworkers.   It appears that more men than women workers  use  the\r\n\r\nSkills Development Fund.  Could the Minister explain why this is\r\n\r\nso,  and  whether  there  is  any strategic  planning  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to encourage women to use this fund for upgrading  and,\r\n\r\nif so, in what sectors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1994 Department of Statistics Report showed that 84% of\r\n\r\ndual  career  wives were under 45 years old.  The trend  towards\r\n\r\nyounger  women and paid employment will persist.   We  are  less\r\n\r\nsure,  however, that they will stay in employment after  45.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to reinforce Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon's call for focused\r\n\r\neffort  on the Back-to-Work programme.  The Ministry has done  a\r\n\r\ngood  job  in the last few years.  I hope that it will  continue\r\n\r\nwith  this effort.  We have to recognise that young women  today\r\n\r\ndesire  both  work and family.  The notion of role contradiction\r\n\r\nis  no  longer applicable.  The problem is one of role overload.\r\n\r\nThey  work long hours at work and they also work long  hours  at\r\n\r\nhome,  sometimes with little help from husbands  who  also  work\r\n\r\nlate in the office.  We need to find new solutions if we want to\r\n\r\nkeep all in employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider setting up a special task force\r\n\r\nconsisting   of   multi-disciplinary   experts   -   economists,\r\n\r\nsociologists, family therapists, psychologists and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  forth  -  to  examine nationally the impact of  dual  career\r\n\r\nfamilies  on  family  cohesion and  identify  appropriate  human\r\n\r\nresource strategies to tackle the problems?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third area is work integration of vulnerable groups.\r\n\r\nCommunity   agencies   which  are  taking   care   of   mentally\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  and disabled young specifically  request  if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  could  give  some  attention  to  the  issue  of  work\r\n\r\nintegration  of these groups.  They would like to  know  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's manpower planning for the next millennium if it could\r\n\r\nidentify  the  kind  of  skills which  are  suitable  for  these\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bizlink, for the information of Members of this House, is a\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisation supported by MCD.  It has been set up  to\r\n\r\nservice  the  disabled by matching their skills  and  employment\r\n\r\nneeds,  but they lack the information on skills requirement  for\r\n\r\nspecific   job  types.   So  they  cannot  really  provide   the\r\n\r\nappropriate  training to the clients.  Can  MOM,  MCD  and  VWOs\r\n\r\ncombine efforts to identify and enhance employment opportunities\r\n\r\nfor the disadvantaged?  This will help VWOs to better plan their\r\n\r\nwork  rehabilitation programmes and equip clients with  suitable\r\n\r\nskills to be employable in the community.  The argument is  that\r\n\r\nthese  groups  have  much to gain by participating  directly  in\r\n\r\ncommunity,  instead  of being isolated in  sheltered  employment\r\n\r\ncentres.   For the society, this is an additional human resource\r\n\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, foreign talents have\r\n\r\ncontributed  to the leadership and manpower that have  developed\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Our policy to open Singapore to foreign talents is a\r\n\r\ncorrect one.  Their contributions will continue to be important.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we are not without local talents, but our people  fear\r\n\r\nbeing  overlooked  or ignored.  They want to be  considered  for\r\n\r\nopportunities that arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans want to be assured that when everything is\r\n\r\nequal  or near equal, they will be given preference.  We  should\r\n\r\nuse  our  own talents first and then turn to foreign talents  to\r\n\r\naugment  the pie.  This must be so.  Otherwise, our people  will\r\n\r\nfeel  disenfranchised and being a citizen of a country must mean\r\n\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers must not view the foreign talent policy as a\r\n\r\nlicence to hire foreign talents when local talents are available\r\n\r\nto  do  the  job.   This  should be  made  clear  to  employers,\r\n\r\nespecially  our  Government Ministries,  departments,  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and Government-linked companies.  We must not  make  our\r\n\r\npeople feel second class.  If our people feel this way, we  will\r\n\r\nfind  our own talents moving overseas in search of opportunities\r\n\r\ndenied to them in their own country.  This will indeed be a  sad\r\n\r\nday for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign talent to augment our talents in Singapore is an\r\n\r\nimportant policy.  But for the policy to work, we must make sure\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans accept that as important.  I think if we  can\r\n\r\nassure Singaporeans that their interests are taken care of, that\r\n\r\nthey will not be denied opportunities, then the support will  be\r\n\r\nforthcoming.  Sir, this assurance is extremely important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to another point. I want to add that\r\n\r\ntalent  does not just appear in a person.  The potential of  our\r\n\r\npeople must be nurtured and helped to surface.  On this point, I\r\n\r\nmust  give credit to the Government which recognises this desire\r\n\r\nof  our people for opportunities to educate themselves.  This is\r\n\r\nmost evident in the funds allocated for education.  In spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  difficult  time, the Government has not only  not  cut  the\r\n\r\nallocation for education but has increased it by some  30%  over\r\n\r\nlast  year's  budget.  A substantial part of it  will  fund  our\r\n\r\ntertiary educational institutions, especially our universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure for university education will increase\r\n\r\nfurther  when  the  Singapore Management University  is  up  and\r\n\r\nrunning  in  the year 2000.  The Government is thus  giving  our\r\n\r\ncitizens more opportunities to get not just a tertiary education\r\n\r\nbut a good one.  This foresight is highly commended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has also the foresight to see the importance of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to upgrade themselves, their skills and  knowledge\r\n\r\nto  keep  themselves relevant to the changing times.   NTUC  has\r\n\r\ngiven flesh to the ideas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  instituting several programmes.  I call upon Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ntake  the  many  opportunities that are  available  to  them  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves.  If we do, we will reduce  the  chances  of\r\n\r\nopportunities passing us by.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, since the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nfirst spoke on the subject of attracting foreign talent at  last\r\n\r\nyear's  National  Day  Rally, the issue of  foreign  talent  has\r\n\r\nbecome  topical,  prompting  comments  from  many  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nForeigners brought in under the talent scheme have now become  a\r\n\r\nconspicuous  presence  in Singapore.  We meet  them  everywhere.\r\n\r\nWith  their  greater presence, the subject has increasingly  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  inevitably become a gut issue.  Voices of concern  were\r\n\r\nalready heard from the beginning when the Prime Minister  called\r\n\r\nfor  a  national effort to draw and embrace talent from  abroad.\r\n\r\nThere  were questions about the implications of such  a  policy.\r\n\r\nSome  were  worried  that  more foreigners  meant  more  intense\r\n\r\ncompetition   for  limited  resources,  be  it  jobs,   schools,\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities, or simply space.   Others  saw  social\r\n\r\nproblems  that might arise as a result of an in-rush of  foreign\r\n\r\ninfluence  or  a  clash of cultural values.  As NTUC  chief  and\r\n\r\nMinister without Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon Heng, said last October,\r\n\r\nour  workers  were a little bit cheesed off by the  Government's\r\n\r\nmove  to  bring  in  more foreign talent.  He  had  formed  this\r\n\r\nimpression after a dialogue session with some 200 union leaders.\r\n\r\nThat  initial  \"little bit cheesed off\" feeling  seems  to  have\r\n\r\nrubbed  off on more and more Singaporeans, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nlight of the current regional crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to some people about foreign talent and the gut\r\n\r\nreaction  is  quite  revealing.   They  question  the  perceived\r\n\r\nfavourable treatment of foreigners over locals.  They  ask:  why\r\n\r\nis  JTC subsidising foreign talent by renting out flats to  them\r\n\r\nat  below  market  rates?   Why is the Government  still  giving\r\n\r\ncompanies tax incentives to defray the costs of bringing in more\r\n\r\nforeigners  at  a time when the job security of Singaporeans  is\r\n\r\nuncertain,  and  indeed a number of our citizens  have  actually\r\n\r\nbeen retrenched?  Some even ask:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy is the Government cheapening our citizenship by making it so\r\n\r\neasily  available to foreigners working here?  Why do foreigners\r\n\r\nwho  have acquired our citizenship and thus enjoy privileges not\r\n\r\nhave to perform national service, or at least a modified form of\r\n\r\nnational service or any reservist service?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions perhaps betray an acute and deep sense of\r\n\r\nfrustration.  I do not think that such frustrations suggest that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are becoming xenophobic.  We have always  been  an\r\n\r\nopen  and  cosmopolitan  society which welcomes  foreigners  and\r\n\r\nimmigrants.   We are, after all, a very young country  built  by\r\n\r\nimmigrants.   I believe that the disgruntlement lies  more  with\r\n\r\nthe  manner  in  which the question of foreign talent  has  been\r\n\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will outline two factors which I believe contribute to\r\n\r\nthat  disgruntlement.   First,  a  number  of  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\npuzzled  over  the definition of \"foreign talent\"  itself.   Few\r\n\r\nwould object to bringing in what the Prime Minister described as\r\n\r\nthe best and brightest to Singapore in the same way that the top\r\n\r\nbrains  are attracted to Silicon Valley.  But the foreign talent\r\n\r\nthat  our citizens mingle with in the HDB heartlands or in their\r\n\r\nwork  places are very much like the people who live  next  door.\r\n\r\nThey  could be nurses, train operators, teachers, counter  staff\r\n\r\nand  so on.  For the Singaporean who holds a similar job, it  is\r\n\r\nincomprehensible why a foreigner doing the same job is  labelled\r\n\r\na  talent and accorded privileges which one who is born and bred\r\n\r\nhere does not enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a sense that the foreigner who is termed\r\n\r\n\"talented\"  takes  maximum advantage of  Singapore  without  the\r\n\r\nintention of making Singapore his or her home.  The male foreign\r\n\r\ntalent does not do national service nor reservist training.  Our\r\n\r\nyounger people feel that this gives an unfair advantage  to  the\r\n\r\nforeign  talent  in  the  work place. A  foreigner  starts  work\r\n\r\nyounger  and employers prefer employees who have no disruptions.\r\n\r\nThere  is also a feeling that a number of young foreign  talents\r\n\r\nsimply use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore as a springboard to take advantage of the system,  get\r\n\r\nan education, live in cheap JTC rental flats, acquire skills and\r\n\r\nthen  leave for what they perceive to be greener pastures.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  a  number  of our citizens appear to resent  what  they\r\n\r\nperceive  to  be the Government's disregard for the feelings  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in the all-out effort to lay the  red  carpet  for\r\n\r\nforeigners.   It is now not uncommon to hear Singaporeans  speak\r\n\r\nof emigration, and then returning as foreign talent to feel more\r\n\r\nwelcome here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be in the longer term interest of Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to ensure that it addresses these concerns.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  do  something  to  ensure  that  Singaporeans,  in\r\n\r\nparticular younger Singaporeans, do not feel disadvantaged vis-a-vis foreign talent.  The policy of attracting foreign talent  is\r\n\r\na  sound  one.   Without it, our future must be that  much  less\r\n\r\nbright.   I therefore speak as a strong supporter of the policy.\r\n\r\nBut  even sound policies have to be sold on the ground.  If  the\r\n\r\npolicy creates unease among younger Singaporeans, then that is a\r\n\r\ncause   for   legitimate  concern.   We  cannot   take   younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  for granted.  They are, like the  foreign  talent,\r\n\r\nalso mobile.  We have to consider their views, perhaps relook at\r\n\r\nour   definition  of  foreign  talent  and  bear  in  mind  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will be evaluating the quality of  the  foreigners\r\n\r\nand compare them with the privileges that are accorded.  This is\r\n\r\nnot a problem that will simply go away when the economy recovers\r\n\r\nand strong growth returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation building is not merely about keeping the country\r\n\r\nahead  of global competition or achieving higher and higher  per\r\n\r\ncapita  income.   It is also a question about making  sure  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans feel for Singapore with their hearts.  The  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  question is a gut issue that concerns hearts  and  minds\r\n\r\nand  the Government has to address the hearts and minds so  that\r\n\r\nour younger Singaporeans will treat Singapore as a home, and not\r\n\r\nas a hotel.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the mission of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower was touched on in great detail by speakers\r\n\r\npreceding me, including Mrs Yu-Foo and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Zainul  Abidin.

For  instance,  MOE uses its own manpower  forecast  to\r\n\r\nidentify allocation of resources with the various institutes  of\r\n\r\nhigher learning, which in turn determines how many students will\r\n\r\nbe  enrolled each year, in what discipline, and in what classes.\r\n\r\nSince  education  is  very  important to  our  future,  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  then  directly  influences the  future  of  all  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  To make my point, let me use an illustration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have to go too far back to come up with examples\r\n\r\nof  forecasting which cause great emotional stress  to  students\r\n\r\nand  parents.  I am referring to the restriction imposed on  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  doctors  trained  each  year  in  Singapore.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment directly controls the number of doctors trained  each\r\n\r\nyear.  This number is derived from a very logical doctor/patient\r\n\r\nmodel.   Mr  Yeo Cheow Tong, then Minister for Health  in  1993,\r\n\r\nannounced  a  set  of policies restricting the  medical  student\r\n\r\nenrolment every year that Singaporeans should have.  It does not\r\n\r\njust   apply  to  NUS  but  also  as  a  standard  for  overseas\r\n\r\nuniversities.  We can understand that enrolment in NUS is funded\r\n\r\nby the Government, but in the enrolment overseas, those students\r\n\r\nare funded by the parents.  On top of that, in fact, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestriction  excludes  some very famous  and  prominent  medical\r\n\r\nschools.  All this is done in the name of manpower planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many aspiring doctors were denied the opportunity to\r\n\r\npursue,  some of them, life-long dreams to become a  doctor,  to\r\n\r\nserve  their  fellow human beings.  Several have  approached  me\r\n\r\nduring  my meet-the-people sessions in the past regarding  their\r\n\r\nappeal  to be given exemption, not just to get into NUS  but  to\r\n\r\ncontinue their enrolment with overseas universities, but  to  no\r\n\r\navail.    As   a   Government  policy,  I  still  support   this\r\n\r\nrestriction,  which was logical and rational at  that  point  of\r\n\r\ntime.   But  only  a  few years later, the  Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nstarted  to  hire  overseas doctors to meet its  own  shortages.\r\n\r\nOnly  a  few  days  ago,  Mr Yeo Cheow  Tong  gave  a  reply  to\r\n\r\nParliament  during  the  debate on his Ministry  justifying  the\r\n\r\nhiring  of foreign doctors based on the shortages.  It seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that the restriction imposed by MOH  now does not make  very\r\n\r\ngood common sense.  Worse, the suffering and emotional stress of\r\n\r\nall those who were denied a career in medicine have been all for\r\n\r\nnought.  This sudden reversal of the forecast reflects poorly on\r\n\r\nthe   accuracy  and  points  to  the  pitfalls  of  implementing\r\n\r\nGovernment policies based on poor forecasting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that manpower forecasters always err on the\r\n\r\nsafe  side.   In  fact, there is very little or no  penalty  for\r\n\r\nunder-estimating.  But over-estimating would  lead  to  wasteful\r\n\r\nGovernment spending and potential social problems as a result of\r\n\r\nunemployed graduates, etc.  So, it seems to me intuitively  that\r\n\r\nit  will be very difficult to obtain accurate manpower forecast.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand, the consequences of a poor  one  are  also\r\n\r\nhighly undesirable.  Yet, with the establishment of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Manpower,  this  is exactly what will  be  expected  of  it.\r\n\r\nWhatever forecast it produces, there will be even greater  faith\r\n\r\nin  using  this information.  After all, they are the  full-time\r\n\r\nexperts in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to ask the Minister to enlighten this\r\n\r\nHouse, how he would be addressing this issue and how he would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that  MOM will be able to discharge its responsibilities\r\n\r\nwhen it comes to manpower planning for the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> First, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank the hon. Members who have spoken on the  various\r\n\r\ntopics  concerning the Ministry of Manpower and other  manpower-related  issues.  In particular, I wish to thank Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee\r\n\r\nShoon,  Member  for Bukit Timah, who welcomed and supported  the\r\n\r\nformation of the Ministry of Manpower.  Mrs Yu-Foo and Mr Zainul\r\n\r\nwould  like to know what are the key initiatives of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Manpower after April 1998, because the Ministry  will  start\r\n\r\nfunctioning on 1st April 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly established Ministry of Manpower aims to develop\r\n\r\na world class workforce to spearhead Singapore's growth into the\r\n\r\n21st  century.  It will undertake manpower planning, development\r\n\r\nand  carry  out  the  regulatory roles in meeting  our  national\r\n\r\nmanpower  needs.  The Ministry's new role will include  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  to  balance the demand and supply of manpower  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels  of  the  economy,  meaning  manpower  requirements  from\r\n\r\nunskilled,  semi-skilled to skilled and  talented  workers.   It\r\n\r\nwill  develop a framework and programme for continuing education\r\n\r\nand  training  for workers in order to build up  a  capable  and\r\n\r\nknowledge-based workforce.  We will also develop  strategies  to\r\n\r\nattract foreign talents to supplement local talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing roles of the Ministry of Labour, such as\r\n\r\nregulating  and  managing  the  admission  of  foreign  workers,\r\n\r\nensuring  a workplace environment conducive to productivity  and\r\n\r\nefficiency, and ensuring continuous harmonious labour  relations\r\n\r\nwill be enhanced to reinforce the Ministry's overall mission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower will formulate national manpower\r\n\r\npolicy  in consultation with principal economic agencies of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and also the National Trades Union Congress  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National Employers' Federation.   We  will  certainly\r\n\r\ntake note of the efforts already put in by the National\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrades  Union  Congress  and the Singapore  National  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation  to chart a vision for the future.  We will  consider\r\n\r\nthe  ideas, suggestions and the concerns that they have  already\r\n\r\ndrawn  up  in their NTUC 21 and SNEF 21 in drawing  up  our  own\r\n\r\nmanpower  policy.   While  the Ministry of  Manpower  undertakes\r\n\r\nmanpower  planning and capability development  at  the  national\r\n\r\nlevel,  the  current  statutory boards that  are  already  doing\r\n\r\nmanpower training and manpower development work will be able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   this  work.   For  instance,  the  Productivity   and\r\n\r\nStandards  Board, ITE and EDB will continue to administer  their\r\n\r\nrespective  manpower training programmes.  But it will  be  done\r\n\r\nwithin the overall framework of a national manpower policy.  MOM\r\n\r\nwill  focus on strengthening existing institutions and  training\r\n\r\nnetworks,   coordinate   and  streamline   manpower   management\r\n\r\nfunctions  and develop a new framework and programme to  achieve\r\n\r\nour mission of developing a world class workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also lent her support to the allocation of\r\n\r\nmore  funds to the Ministry of Manpower so that it can give more\r\n\r\nsupport to the various skills upgrading programmes, and I  thank\r\n\r\nher for this support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul has asked whether the budget, as it stands in the\r\n\r\nBudget  book, reflects the financial support that the Government\r\n\r\nis  giving to the new Ministry of Manpower in order to allow  it\r\n\r\nto  carry  out its duties.  I would like to point out  that  the\r\n\r\nbudget  estimates for the Ministry of Manpower, as reflected  in\r\n\r\nthe  current  Budget book, are actually the old budget  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  to perform the current  functions  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour.  This was because the budget was  finalised\r\n\r\nprior  to  the  recent  decision  to  establish  a  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower.   Obviously, in order for the Ministry of Manpower  to\r\n\r\ncarry   out   the  enlarged  functions,  with  a   much   bigger\r\n\r\nresponsibility, we will require additional funding.  This is not\r\n\r\nreflected  in  the  present budget.  To  determine  the  overall\r\n\r\nbudget needs of the Ministry of Manpower, we will engage various\r\n\r\nmanpower-related  agencies such as the  Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry, EDB, PSB and the Ministry of Education in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoint  planning  exercise to determine the full scope  of  work,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  overall budget requirements for  both  1998  and\r\n\r\n1999.  We will put up a supplementary budget to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.   In the meantime, the Ministry of Manpower, after  1st\r\n\r\nApril this year, will proceed to carry out its new functions and\r\n\r\nprogrammes with the MOL budget as well as the existing programme\r\n\r\nbudgets of the various agencies and statutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next month, the new Ministry will embark on a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive exercise to develop a strategic manpower blueprint\r\n\r\nfor Singapore in the next century.  This blueprint will be known\r\n\r\nas  the  Manpower  21 Plan.  Mrs Yu-Foo has  asked  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will involve the trade unions and the employers in such\r\n\r\nan  effort.  Let me assure all Members that,  apart from  inputs\r\n\r\nfrom  other key Government economic agencies, we will  certainly\r\n\r\nconsult   the  National  Trades  Union  Congress  and   employer\r\n\r\norganisations  in  order  to  draw  up  the  Manpower  21  plan.\r\n\r\nManpower  21 will, in fact, bring together tripartite  resources\r\n\r\nto   focus  on  national  manpower  planning,  development   and\r\n\r\nmanagement issues.  This will help to strengthen the  spirit  of\r\n\r\ntripartism  to  help us face up to economic  challenges  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, we are not waiting for Manpower 21 to be\r\n\r\ncompleted  before  taking  any  initiatives  because   it   will\r\n\r\nobviously take quite some time to go through the whole  exercise\r\n\r\nof  identifying the key issues and the priorities,  and  mapping\r\n\r\nout  a  strategy  to cope with each of these  areas  or  special\r\n\r\nneeds.   We will, in fact, start work immediately in April  this\r\n\r\nyear.   And  one of our first tasks will be to study,  integrate\r\n\r\nand  coordinate existing manpower programmes, such as the Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme,  the Back-to-Work  Programme  and  the\r\n\r\nSkills   Certification  Programme,  with  our  overall  manpower\r\n\r\nvision.  In particular, Sir, we will be looking at how to expand\r\n\r\nthe Skills Redevelopment Programme which had started in December\r\n\r\n1996.  This is particularly urgent because of the economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslowdown  and the prospect of increased retrenchment  among  our\r\n\r\nworkers.   We  will have to speed up the process  of  reskilling\r\n\r\nworkers who are likely to face retrenchment so that they can  be\r\n\r\nredeployed effectively to other sectors of the economy which are\r\n\r\nstill in need of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I understand correctly, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon suggested\r\n\r\nthat there is also a need to train Ministry of Manpower's staff,\r\n\r\ntrade   union  leaders  and  employees  in  companies  who   are\r\n\r\nresponsible for human resource management duties.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nher.   I  think  there is a need to train such  people  who  are\r\n\r\ngenerally grouped as the human resource practitioners.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  her  that the Ministry of Manpower, as a national manpower\r\n\r\nagency,  should ensure that our own staff are also well trained,\r\n\r\nkept  up  to date with the latest development in human resource,\r\n\r\nmanagement and also issues concerning manpower.  We will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be ample training opportunities  for  our  own\r\n\r\nstaff and we will support any national programme to create  more\r\n\r\nopportunities for training of human resource managers and  trade\r\n\r\nunion   leaders.   For  instance,  the  Government  is   already\r\n\r\npresently  supporting the Singapore Institute of Labour  Studies\r\n\r\n(SILS).  Government has given the Institute a substantial  grant\r\n\r\nto  start  up  their endowment fund and this will help  them  to\r\n\r\nfinance their operations.  We will continue to give the SILS the\r\n\r\nsupport  that  they require in order to fulfil  its  mission  of\r\n\r\nproviding training for union leaders to improve their ability to\r\n\r\nmanage industrial relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I have to respond to the hon. Member, Mr Chay,\r\n\r\nfrom  Tanjong  Pagar  GRC.  He made a  very  eloquent  and  very\r\n\r\npersuasive  argument why the name \"Ministry of Manpower\"  should\r\n\r\nbe  reconsidered.  I would like to tell him that, in fact,  when\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  expanding the roles and responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour was first mooted, we did actually  consider\r\n\r\nthe name \"Ministry of Human Resource\".  It was certainly one  of\r\n\r\nthe  alternatives.  As Mr Chay has pointed out, the term  \"human\r\n\r\nresource\" appears to sound more progressive and modern and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin keeping with the IT and knowledge-based era.  It also applies\r\n\r\nto  a wider range of issues such as individual welfare, personal\r\n\r\ndevelopment and personal fufilment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that the name \"human resource development\"\r\n\r\nis quite relevant to the mission and duties of the new Ministry.\r\n\r\nActually for this reason, we had to think over the choice of the\r\n\r\nname  very  carefully.   We took a long time  in  deciding  what\r\n\r\nshould be the name for the new Ministry.  Should we call it  the\r\n\r\n\"Ministry  of Human Resource\" and appears to be fashionable  and\r\n\r\ncorrect in keeping with the age?  Or should we call it \"Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Manpower\"?   However, when we looked back  on  why  the  new\r\n\r\nMinistry  was being established in the first place,  the  choice\r\n\r\nbecame   clear.    The   new  Ministry  has   been   given   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of harnessing the full potential of our  national\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources so that, firstly, we can ensure  Singapore's\r\n\r\npool of human capital or talent capital will become an engine of\r\n\r\ngrowth in a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new Ministry is to ensure that our people,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  only resource, will become a strategic  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage  in the next phase of our development.   With  such  a\r\n\r\nstrong  economic  agenda to produce a world-class  and  globally\r\n\r\ncompetitive  workforce, we felt that the term \"manpower\"  better\r\n\r\nconveys  the  economic linkage and economic  force  of  the  new\r\n\r\nMinistry's  responsibility.  Manpower is also a  term  which  is\r\n\r\nclear and easily understood by the people.  Needless to say,  to\r\n\r\nbe  effective  as  a  national manpower agency,  we  will  adopt\r\n\r\npractices  and concepts of human resource development which  are\r\n\r\nappropriate to the Singapore context.  Calling the new  Ministry\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Manpower will certainly not detract  from  its\r\n\r\ndynamism and dedicated pursuit of its mission.  As the old adage\r\n\r\ngoes, \"the test of the pudding is in the eating\".  Whether it is\r\n\r\n\"manpower\" or \"human resource\", what matters eventually  is  how\r\n\r\nsuccessful we are in nurturing a world-class workforce to ensure\r\n\r\nSingapore's long-term competitiveness and prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in anticipation of such queries which are quite\r\n\r\nnatural, I looked up several\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndictionaries.  The Oxford English Dictionary defines  \"manpower\"\r\n\r\nas: \"The power or agency of man in work or the number of persons\r\n\r\navailable for a purpose.\"  I should also point out that the same\r\n\r\ndictionary also provided an explanation that \"man\" can  be  used\r\n\r\nas \"a human being irrespective of sex and age\".  In other words,\r\n\r\nthe  \"man\"  in \"manpower\" is the same as the \"man\" in \"mankind\".\r\n\r\nChamber's  Twentieth Century Dictionary defines  \"manpower\"  as:\r\n\r\n\"The  agency  or  energy of man doing work.\"  Sir,  the  meaning\r\n\r\nclosest to the use of \"manpower\" in this case came from Collin's\r\n\r\nCobuild English Dictionary (New Edition) which I understand from\r\n\r\nthe cover blurb is based on an \"unrivalled in-depth analysis  of\r\n\r\nthe  language of the 90s\".  So it is very current, very topical.\r\n\r\nCollin defines \"manpower\" as: \"Workers are sometimes referred to\r\n\r\nas  manpower  when  they are being considered  as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nprocess of producing goods or providing services\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, in our context, workers are all we have as\r\n\r\nindigenous inputs to our goods and services output.   Hence,  it\r\n\r\nis  not inappropriate to call the new Ministry the \"Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower\"  to strengthen the links between our efforts  and  the\r\n\r\nviability and competitiveness of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the points made by the Nominated\r\n\r\nMember,  Mdm  Claire  Chiang.  She has  made  several  excellent\r\n\r\nsuggestions and observations.  To begin with, she asked  whether\r\n\r\nin  the context of current economic downturn, what is the impact\r\n\r\non  women,  particularly retrenchment of  women.   There  is  an\r\n\r\nobvious  difference in the rate here in the sense that when  you\r\n\r\nsee  most of the retrenchment in the electronic sector, and most\r\n\r\nof  the  retrenchment taking place at the production level,  and\r\n\r\nalso if you note that there are more women working as production\r\n\r\noperators, both Singaporeans and also female foreign workers  on\r\n\r\nwork  permit,  it  is not surprising to find that  if  you  have\r\n\r\nhigher  retrenchment  in the sector, you will  find  more  women\r\n\r\nthere being affected by the retrenchment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether retrenched women, in this case it would be,\r\n\r\nof course, resident Singaporean women who have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretrenched from the electronic sector, have greater difficulties\r\n\r\nfinding  jobs,  I do not have the specific information  on  hand\r\n\r\nright now.  But I gather that if they are actively looking for a\r\n\r\njob,  there is very minimal difference in time lag, because  the\r\n\r\naverage time taken for a retrenched worker to get a job  -  this\r\n\r\nis  for  1997  -  was 1.8 months, and there was  no  significant\r\n\r\ndifference  between male and female, or between  young  and  old\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also suggested that we look at the long term\r\n\r\nstrategy or specific plan to cater to the needs of the women  in\r\n\r\nthe  economy  and  how  to  attract  the  women  back  into  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  Let me assure the Member that we will certainly take\r\n\r\nthis approach in conjunction with our effort to map out Manpower\r\n\r\n21  plan.  Within the Manpower 21 Plan, we will certainly  study\r\n\r\nthe specific needs of women, including upgrading their skills in\r\n\r\norder  to prepare them for the higher value jobs that are  going\r\n\r\nto be created in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also noted that in the labour force, there are\r\n\r\nfewer  women, particularly above the age of 45.  In  fact,  from\r\n\r\nage  30 and above onwards, the female labour force participation\r\n\r\nrates  start  to decline, and we have also observed this  trend.\r\n\r\nThat is why we have launched the Back-to-Work programme about 18\r\n\r\nmonths  ago.   We  understand the difficulties  faced  by  women\r\n\r\nbecause they have to balance the needs of the family and also  a\r\n\r\ncareer.  That is why we have convened an Advisory Committee  for\r\n\r\nthe  Back-to-Work  programme.  The Advisory Committee  has  held\r\n\r\nquite  a  number  of meetings already to study  how  to  further\r\n\r\ndevelop  this Back-to-Work programme so that it will be able  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  needs  of  the  housewives who  want  to  rejoin  the\r\n\r\nworkforce in particular, or the kind of training  that  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  in order to enable some housewives who have  left  the\r\n\r\nlabour force for quite some time already to be re-equipped  with\r\n\r\nthe skills, so that they can take on the jobs that are available\r\n\r\nin the job market today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will certainly convey her suggestions to the Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Back-to-Work programme, and we will see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  further expand this programme  and  make  it  more\r\n\r\nrelevant to the needs of the women, particularly in light of the\r\n\r\npotentially  higher  retrenchments among  women  in  the  labour\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke about the needs of those who are\r\n\r\nphysically  handicapped, I believe, in trying to look  for  work\r\n\r\nfor this group of Singaporeans.  I share her concern and I agree\r\n\r\nthat   we   should  not  overlook  the  needs  and  the  special\r\n\r\nrequirements of this group of Singaporeans.  They can also  make\r\n\r\na  contribution  in  their  own way,  and  we  should  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunities for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry presently works with Bizlink Centre to provide\r\n\r\nemployment  assistance  to  Singaporean  job  seekers  who  have\r\n\r\ndisabilities.  This Bizlink Centre was set up under the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Community  Development and the National  Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nServices.  They specialise in looking into the employment  needs\r\n\r\nof the disabled.  It offers job-matching services to people with\r\n\r\ndisability who are found suitable for general employment.  Those\r\n\r\nwhose  disabilities are so severe that they  cannot  cope  in  a\r\n\r\nnormal working environment, we try to find them appropriate jobs\r\n\r\nin   sheltered  workshops,  activity  centres,  as  well  as  in\r\n\r\nBizlink's own production workshop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on feedback from Bizlink, if people with\r\n\r\ndisability are prepared to work and have the basic capabilities,\r\n\r\nwe could train them and prepare them for a job which could be as\r\n\r\nrewarding as those of a normal Singaporean.  So my Ministry,  or\r\n\r\ncome  April the Ministry of Manpower, will continue to work with\r\n\r\nBizlink   and  other  Ministries,  like  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  to  look  into  ways  to  enhance  the  employment\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  the disabled.  This would include  encouraging\r\n\r\nand  helping employers to create suitable jobs which  will  meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs and constraints of persons with disability.  And here\r\n\r\nI  want  to  emphasise that this is a very important point.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  get employers to cooperate with us, employers who  are\r\n\r\ngenerous and willing enough to take the extra step to cope  with\r\n\r\nthe   challenge  of  employing  those  who  have  some  physical\r\n\r\nhandicap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to several Members who spoke on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  to attract foreign talents  to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  have spoken generally in support of the policy.  I do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve any one of them had questioned the wisdom of this policy\r\n\r\nto  attract  talent  to  Singapore.  But they  have  urged  that\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy or attitude towards foreign  talent  should\r\n\r\nnot disadvantage local talents or the homegrown talents.  First,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to stress that local talents will always  be  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  of  our  manpower  pool.   Without  adequate   local\r\n\r\ntalents,  we  will not be able to compete in the global  market.\r\n\r\nForeign  talents  and workers will be welcomed to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nsupplement and add value to the Singapore workforce.   They  are\r\n\r\nhere  to supplement our own talent so as to enhance our economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 10 years, the Singapore economy has outpaced\r\n\r\nthe growth of our own workforce.  As a result, the labour market\r\n\r\nhas become much tighter until very, very recently.  We have seen\r\n\r\nunemployment remaining at low levels for many years.  Last year,\r\n\r\nthe  unemployment  rate was 1.8%.  Without the  contribution  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  and workers, we would not have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nsustain  the  growth rate of 8.9% on average  between  1987  and\r\n\r\n1997.   So  foreign  talents and workers make  a  very  valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution to our economy and they allow us to grow at a  much\r\n\r\nhigher rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we should look at the issue perhaps from the perspective\r\n\r\nof  stock  and the flow.  We have a stock of indigenous talented\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who can contribute to the economy.  But as long  as\r\n\r\nwe just live within this stock, then our economic growth and the\r\n\r\nopportunities  for prosperity would be limited to  what  we  can\r\n\r\nproduce with our own stock.  But if we were to stimulate a  flow\r\n\r\nof talent from all over the world towards Singapore and we bring\r\n\r\nin the right kind of talent who would supplement what we have in\r\n\r\nour  stock, then we would be able to achieve much more  than  we\r\n\r\ncan  with our own people alone.  We will be able to have  higher\r\n\r\ngrowth,  as has been seen in the last decade.  We have  achieved\r\n\r\nmuch higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth  because of the injection of foreign talents and  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   So  the flow of foreign talents into  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nsupplement our own resources and help us to achieve much  higher\r\n\r\ngrowth rate than otherwise possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider some of the recent trends that have been\r\n\r\nreported in the various business magazines and newspapers in the\r\n\r\nUS.   Consider a labour force of the size of the US.  Even today\r\n\r\nin  the  US,  the top executives in the electronic  industry  in\r\n\r\nparticular are lobbying their government in Washington to  relax\r\n\r\nthe  quota  for  the  H1B  visa,  which  is  meant  for  foreign\r\n\r\nprofessionals  to  enter  the US to work.   They  have  done  so\r\n\r\nbecause  the  labour  market in the US has  become  very  tight.\r\n\r\nThere is a serious shortage of talents, particularly, in the  IT\r\n\r\nindustry.  Unemployment rate in the US has dropped to 4.6% which\r\n\r\nI  believe is an all time low.  The industries, particularly the\r\n\r\nIT  industry,  desperately need foreign talents  to  meet  their\r\n\r\nmanpower  needs in view of this very tight labour  market.   And\r\n\r\nhere  is  a  huge nation with over 200 million people  and  vast\r\n\r\nresources,  and  they are still recruiting  foreign  talents  to\r\n\r\nsupplement their own workforce.  Compared to the United  States,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  with its unemployment rate of only 1.8% and  a  very\r\n\r\nmuch smaller workforce of about 1.9 million workers only, surely\r\n\r\nour  need  for  top-up talents must be much  more  pressing  and\r\n\r\ncritical than the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign talents certainly will help us to enlarge our\r\n\r\neconomic pie and create greater wealth for all.  Let me give  an\r\n\r\nexample.   In some high-tech electronic companies in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nforeign skilled workers make up 50% to 70% of the skilled labour\r\n\r\nforce.  The employers are simply unable to hire enough from  the\r\n\r\nlocal talent pool to meet their needs, either due to an outright\r\n\r\nshortage  of such people or the locals find other jobs are  more\r\n\r\nattractive and unwilling to take on these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without access to the skilled foreign workers, these high-tech companies would not have been able to operate in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe would not have been able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  attract them to invest in Singapore.  And at the end of  the\r\n\r\nday,  we  would not have been able to have such investments,  we\r\n\r\nwould  not have been able to create the employment opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  another  15%  or  30% of the company's  workforce  who  are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  So by making available a steady flow  of  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  and workers to investors in Singapore, we are  actually\r\n\r\nhelping   to   create   more   employment   opportunities    for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While figures show that there is a shortage by sheer\r\n\r\nnumbers,  the question is how do we ensure that foreign  talents\r\n\r\nand  workers are not coming in and displacing Singaporeans  from\r\n\r\nthe  same  desired  positions.   Several  Members  including  Mr\r\n\r\nShanmugam  and  Mr Zainul have spoken on this.  We  have  always\r\n\r\nsubscribed   to   a   free   market   policy   which    promotes\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and greater efficiency.  This would apply  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent  to the manpower arena in the  labour  force  as\r\n\r\nwell.   Protectionist measures, whether it is in trade or labour\r\n\r\nforce,  would  hamper the upgrading of our local  workforce  and\r\n\r\ncreate  a false sense of complacency and security.  If Singapore\r\n\r\nwants to become a world-class workforce, our local workers  must\r\n\r\nbe  able  to match up and compete with workers anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  We must be able to measure up to global standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry of Manpower does not intend to flood\r\n\r\nthe labour market with foreigners.  Foreign talents are actively\r\n\r\npursued  when they bring critical skills which we lack  or  when\r\n\r\nthey  bring intellectual and entrepreneurial capital  that  will\r\n\r\nsharpen the competitiveness of our economy.  Our priority  would\r\n\r\nremain  on  fully  developing  the talent  and  capabilities  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   This  begins with the  Ministry  of  Education's\r\n\r\neffort  to  provide  a  sound and relevant  education  to  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in  schools, polytechnics and  universities.   The\r\n\r\nprocess  carries  on  when  the  young  Singaporeans  join   the\r\n\r\nworkforce   through  programmes  on  continuing  education   and\r\n\r\ntraining.  The key issue here is to ensure that national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources  are  focused and applied optimally  to  enable  local\r\n\r\ntalents to develop to their highest potential and to fully reach\r\n\r\nthis potential in order to be able to compete and capitalise  on\r\n\r\nthe contributions of foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam has asked if the Government will assure that\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  will not be given special  privileges  and  as\r\n\r\nsuch, they would move up faster or why is it that foreign talent\r\n\r\ncoming  to  work  in  Singapore and  enjoying  the  benefits  of\r\n\r\nSingapore do not have to do National Service.  I think  we  have\r\n\r\nto  take  a wider perspective when we set out to attract talents\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  Our policy will not discriminate against our own\r\n\r\ntalents,  ie, our own workers.  For instance, we will  certainly\r\n\r\nnot  encourage  our employers to pay foreign talents,  with  the\r\n\r\nsame  qualifications and capabilities as local talents, more  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  monetary compensation or benefits.  It will just  not\r\n\r\nmake  commercial sense to begin with.  However,  most  employers\r\n\r\nwho  need to bring in foreign talents would need to provide one-time  relocation  assistance to facilitate the foreign  talents'\r\n\r\nrelocation to Singapore.  I think this is unavoidable.   And  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  context, a Government scheme to set  aside  some  HDB\r\n\r\nflats to house foreign talents is necessary in view of the  high\r\n\r\ncost  of  private  sector housing in Singapore.   Such  specific\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  facilitate the relocation of talents to  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  be expected in view of the global competition for talents.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do not make any effort to overcome the intrinsic  hurdle\r\n\r\nand  difficulties  that we face, then very few  foreign  talents\r\n\r\nwill actually come to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget, Sir, that the talents that we want to\r\n\r\nattract  are also being courted by employers in other countries.\r\n\r\nI  have  mentioned earlier that the IT industry  in  the  US  is\r\n\r\nplanning  to attract many more foreign talents.  But  we  should\r\n\r\nalso  take note that many other countries are also scouring  the\r\n\r\nworld  for  talents  to  boost their  competitiveness.   As  for\r\n\r\nNational Service, we should not view it as a stumbling block  or\r\n\r\na  disadvantageous factor against our own talents in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nRather,   National  Service  enhances  each   and   every   male\r\n\r\nSingaporean's overall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment through the knowledge and values acquired during the\r\n\r\ntraining  and, more importantly, a dedicated service  to  defend\r\n\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to point out\r\n\r\nthat  if  foreign talents who come to Singapore choose  to  sink\r\n\r\nroots in Singapore, then their children, being second generation\r\n\r\nmigrants, will of course have to serve National Service like any\r\n\r\nother born and bred Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the globalised economy, there will be strong\r\n\r\ncompetition  for  top  talent.  We  have  to  create  the  right\r\n\r\nenvironment to attract some of the talents to come to  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  help  us to become more competitive.  Here, I would like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that I agree with Mr Zainul that we have  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat our international image remains conducive in our effort  to\r\n\r\nattract foreign talents.  Because talented foreigners would want\r\n\r\nto  work  and  live  in  a dynamic, secure and  culturally  rich\r\n\r\nsociety.   I  think we can offer such an environment to  attract\r\n\r\nthe best to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other foreign workers, we can offer safe, secure and\r\n\r\nrewarding  employment opportunities.  The Ministry  of  Manpower\r\n\r\nwill continue to enhance the workplace environment so that local\r\n\r\nand  foreign workers and talents will be able to give their best\r\n\r\nin  rewarding  jobs.   In particular, we  must  make  them  feel\r\n\r\nwelcome  and  motivate some of them to sink  their  roots  here.\r\n\r\nThey  will make a significant contribution and add value to  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  The Ministry of Manpower will be willing to work  with\r\n\r\nNTUC  and  the Singapore International Foundation and any  other\r\n\r\norganisation to realise this vision to ensure that  we  will  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  our  effort to recruit talents  to  top  up  and\r\n\r\nsupplement our own talent and manpower resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the coordinated approach to manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment in Singapore, the new Ministry of Manpower will take\r\n\r\non  the overall attraction and management of foreign talents and\r\n\r\nworkers.   These  will include all the policies, programmes  and\r\n\r\noperations related to the flow of foreign talent into Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  will  also  put up a supplementary budget in due  course  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there are sufficient resources  for  managing  the\r\n\r\nforeign talents and workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, as Singapore aims for a world-class\r\n\r\nworkforce,  we  need to position Singapore as  a  global  talent\r\n\r\ncapital  or  a talent hub.  Singapore is where the  best  talent\r\n\r\nwill  converge,  both  local and foreign.   We  will  create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  for talent, local and foreign, to  excel  in  their\r\n\r\nareas  of  expertise  and add value to  our  economy.   We  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  employment training, especially for Singaporeans  at\r\n\r\nall  levels,  so  that  they are able to  compete  with  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will respond to Dr Wang, the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  GRC.   Dr  Wang is correct in pointing out that  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning will be a complex task.  It is not an easy task.  Some,\r\n\r\nin  fact, may argue that because of rapid technological changes,\r\n\r\nand the changing skills that are required by employers, manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  might become less relevant.  However, we  differ.   In\r\n\r\nthe context of Singapore's small labour force, manpower planning\r\n\r\nis   crucial.   We  have  seen  that  this  small  workforce  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient to meet the demands of the economy, and hence there\r\n\r\nis a need to supplement with foreign talents and workers.  Faced\r\n\r\nwith  such  a situation, we need to have a coordinated  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  to  ensure that manpower demands are met and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  retain  the  desired social  fabric  and  cohesion.\r\n\r\nManpower  planning is important to bring about an efficient  and\r\n\r\nsustainable balance of manpower demand and supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move Singapore up the development ladder, we must be\r\n\r\nconscious  of  the  rapid   changes in technology  and  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of this.  Manpower planning will hence take  a  demand\r\n\r\ndriven approach, to keep abreast of the new industry trends  and\r\n\r\nencourage  training in new areas of specialised skills  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  ever  changing needs of the globalised economy.   To  some,\r\n\r\nmanpower  planning  may  be  a very  mundane  and  very  complex\r\n\r\nprocess.   But  let  me  point out that  in  the  demand  driven\r\n\r\nmanpower  planning process, it is very dynamic, and it  aims  to\r\n\r\nanticipate and better prepare for the changes in technology  and\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Council of Professional and Technical\r\n\r\nEducation (CPTE), which is chaired by the Ministry of Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  gives broad recommendations to tertiary  institutions\r\n\r\non  their  student intakes, based on demand and supply analyses.\r\n\r\nDr  Wang quoted the example of the restriction on the number  of\r\n\r\nmedical  students.   I  would not go into the  details  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject because it has been extensively debated and discussed in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber  by the Minister for Health, the argument  on  why\r\n\r\nthere  should be some restriction on the number of doctors  that\r\n\r\nare   trained  in  NUS  and  also  on  the  number  of   foreign\r\n\r\ninstitutions  whose graduates will be recognised.   But  what  I\r\n\r\nwant to point out here is that manpower planning in general does\r\n\r\nnot  always  aim  to  limit enrolment of  students  at  tertiary\r\n\r\neducational  institutions,  but rather  to  ensure  an  adequate\r\n\r\nsupply of skilled manpower in critical areas of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, sometimes manpower planning do actually increase\r\n\r\nthe  range  or the spectrum of choice available to students,  by\r\n\r\nencouraging  institutions to take on new  areas  of  specialised\r\n\r\neducation and training which they may not have been doing in the\r\n\r\npast.  Because through the process of manpower planning, we have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to anticipate the economic development in a  certain\r\n\r\ndirection, the emerging needs of new industries and that we  are\r\n\r\nable then to transmit these messages to the tertiary educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions and encourage them to prepare their students or  to\r\n\r\nstart  up  new opportunities for their students to  prepare  for\r\n\r\ncareers in these industries.  For example, in the past, the CPTE\r\n\r\nhad  recommended that the university broaden the  curriculum  of\r\n\r\ntheir science courses to make it more technology based, so  that\r\n\r\ntheir graduates will be able to do a much wider range of jobs in\r\n\r\nthe industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnics have also come up with new multimedia courses\r\n\r\nas  a result of emerging demand in the IT industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  move  initiated  through a process of integrated  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning, supplemented by coordinated manpower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  will  help  to ensure  that  our  local  workforce\r\n\r\npossess the right mix of skills and experience required  by  the\r\n\r\nglobal market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long run, manpower planning aims to move\r\n\r\nSingapore towards a globally competitive workforce.  Through the\r\n\r\nupgrading of the economy, Singapore would reduce our reliance on\r\n\r\nunskilled foreign workers and increase the overall skill profile\r\n\r\nin  the  economy, including both local and foreign  workers.   A\r\n\r\ndynamic   and   skilled  workforce  will  enhance  the   overall\r\n\r\ninternational image of Singapore, one with a world-class economy\r\n\r\nwith a world class workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the subject of\r\n\r\ntripartite partnership was discussed at length recently when the\r\n\r\nNominated  Member, Mr Cyrille Tan, moved a motion in this  House\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government  to  recognise  it  as  a  key  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage of Singapore.  Sir, I feel the adoption of the  motion\r\n\r\ncould  not have come at a better time in the wake of the current\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown arising from the regional financial crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a private and manufacturing sector employer, allow me to\r\n\r\nprovide   my  perspective  of  tripartism  from  the  employer's\r\n\r\nviewpoint.  We all recognise that we currently live in an era of\r\n\r\npervasive change.  Companies and organisations will have to keep\r\n\r\nreshaping  itself,  shifting  and flexing  to  fit  the  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging world.  This is the only way we can hope to survive  in\r\n\r\nthis fiercely competitive environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed is another crucial element for business survival\r\n\r\nthese  days.   Slowness kills companies and this  translates  to\r\n\r\nalso   the  death  of  many  careers.   Workers  must  therefore\r\n\r\nrecognise that many changes going on are designed to help  their\r\n\r\ncompanies pick up speed.  Everyone is expected to operate with a\r\n\r\nstronger sense of urgency to get things accomplished.  I believe\r\n\r\nspeed  even  ranks  higher than perfection in  this  challenging\r\n\r\nbusiness  environment we are operating today.  High  quality  is\r\n\r\nimportant  but it must come quickly.  Even if it means  failure,\r\n\r\nwe need to learn to fail fast, fix it and race on.   The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndays  of solely relying on incremental step-by-step improvements\r\n\r\nare  over.   We need to seek radical breakthroughs  and  quantum\r\n\r\nleaps  to remain relevant.  Our workers, therefore, must  expect\r\n\r\nand be prepared for flexible waves of working.  Duties and tasks\r\n\r\nwill be regularly realigned to suit changing conditions.  Short-lived  assignments will be more common.  Workers can  expect  to\r\n\r\nhave a constantly new set of co-workers, work for more than  one\r\n\r\nboss or switch bosses more often.  Companies will prefer workers\r\n\r\nwho  show a high capacity for adjustment and want those who  can\r\n\r\nadapt fast, not those who resist change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic crisis sets the stage for even more\r\n\r\nrapid  changes  within  companies  and  organisations,  as  they\r\n\r\nrestructure  their operations to stay competitive and  relevant.\r\n\r\nOur unions have demonstrated their responsibility in the past by\r\n\r\nacting positively to assist companies become more productive and\r\n\r\nefficient and, as a result, enable both employers and workers to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  higher profitability.  I see no reason  why  this\r\n\r\ncordial partnership could not be put to beneficial use at a time\r\n\r\nwhen  companies are faced with difficult business  decisions  in\r\n\r\nthe wake of the financial crisis taking its toll on our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our priority must be to preserve jobs. I think\r\n\r\nemployers should recognise that our responsible unions have  the\r\n\r\ncapacity and expertise to assist companies in trouble and  those\r\n\r\nhaving cash flow problems due to their business exposure in  the\r\n\r\nregion.    They  could therefore be pro-active by sincerely  and\r\n\r\nhonestly  sharing their difficulties they face with the  unions.\r\n\r\nTrust  could be strengthened and built by having management  and\r\n\r\nunion  leaders sitting down together to sort through the various\r\n\r\noptions  to save jobs, such as moderating expectations,  cutting\r\n\r\ndown  on  the  variable components of wages  wherever  possible,\r\n\r\nimplement wage freezes or working short weeks, depending on  the\r\n\r\nissues afflicting the troubled companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been so much talk and emphasis given to\r\n\r\nupgrading  the skills of employees but, unfortunately,  this  is\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly  met with concrete and swift  action  to  tackle\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  With activity tapering off in the light  of  the\r\n\r\npresent   economic   slowdown,  it   presents   an   outstanding\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  employers to conduct the much needed  training\r\n\r\nand  skills  upgrading which many employers have kept postponing\r\n\r\nduring  peak periods.  This is where employers and unions,  with\r\n\r\nthe  assistance of the newly set up Ministry of Manpower,  could\r\n\r\nquickly  act to get our workers trained up so that they will  be\r\n\r\nmore  knowledgeable, productive and efficient when better  times\r\n\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, as already asserted by NMP Cyrille\r\n\r\nTan and the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC, Mr Sinnakaruppan,\r\n\r\nduring the February 1998 debate on this subject, I would like to\r\n\r\necho  their  sentiment  on  the  urgent  need  to  establish   a\r\n\r\nstructured  programme to ensure life-long employability  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers.  I am glad to note that the Minister, Dr Lee Boon Yang,\r\n\r\nhas  just announced that the Ministry of Manpower will make this\r\n\r\nas one of its key priorities when it begins functioning from 1st\r\n\r\nApril 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our unique tripartite setting which I am certain is\r\n\r\nthe  envy of many countries has worked marvellously for us.  The\r\n\r\nunion movement has demonstrated its value and usefulness to  not\r\n\r\nonly  help companies and businesses become more productive,  but\r\n\r\nalso contributed in steering our industries to become one of the\r\n\r\nmost  competitive in the world.  Companies, workers  and  nation\r\n\r\nhave collectively benefited from the peaceful harmony created by\r\n\r\nthe  tripartite partnership.  However, past success should never\r\n\r\nbe  taken  for granted.  The three partners in this relationship\r\n\r\nwill  be  tested  in  the  wake of the constantly  changing  and\r\n\r\nincreasingly competitive global business environment.  There is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a corresponding need to also constantly nurture  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  this  tripartite partnership to  suit  the  changing\r\n\r\nlandscape  as  we endeavour to build a world-class and  globally\r\n\r\ncompetitive workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, with your indulgence on the\r\n\r\nquestion of names\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween MOHR and MOM, my choice, of course, is clear.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe word \"MOHR\" reminds me of Oliver who is asking for more.  In\r\n\r\nthe  tradition of our training and retraining, I thought MOM  is\r\n\r\nbest  and  wise too, with due respect to my colleague, Mr  Chay.\r\n\r\nAnd  as  suggested by Dr Lee, the test of the pudding is in  the\r\n\r\neating,  so while we wait for MOM's pudding, allow me  to  share\r\n\r\nsome   food  for  thought  on  tripartism  to  strengthen  MOM's\r\n\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see that MOM has included and I quote, \"to\r\n\r\nharmonise   workers  and  employers'  interests  in  employment,\r\n\r\nsafeguard  workers' rights and provide advisory and  promotional\r\n\r\nservices in labour-management relations as part of its terms  of\r\n\r\nreference  for  its  labour  relations  department.\"   From  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  point of view, what are the possible minefields  one\r\n\r\nneeds   to   look   out  for  in  terms  of  future   tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationships,  particularly  in the  context  of  the  economic\r\n\r\nturmoil in the region and possible economic restructuring?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour MP, I dare say that the union leadership, and\r\n\r\nthe  labour  movement as a whole, will play  its  part  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies meet the challenges of the region's economic turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mere rhetoric. The NTUC and our workers have\r\n\r\nproved   themselves  to  be  positive  and  made  the  necessary\r\n\r\nsacrifices  to  help Singapore move out of the  1985  recession.\r\n\r\nThe  CPF  cut then was proof that the unions were ready to  take\r\n\r\ninitiatives and make tough decisions when the situation  demands\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another instance, for example, Straits Steamship of the\r\n\r\nKeppel  Group, there was agreement then to cut wages across  the\r\n\r\nboard so that retrenchment could be avoided, helping workers  to\r\n\r\nkeep their jobs back in the mid 80s.  We have been told that the\r\n\r\nsituation today is not as bad as in 1985, and there is  no  need\r\n\r\nto  cut  CPF contributions, and that is only an option  of  last\r\n\r\nresort.   We are reassured, Sir.   But workers must be ready  to\r\n\r\naccept tough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecisions to make the companies and the economy as a whole a lot\r\n\r\nstronger.  After all, there must be a strong commitment to  work\r\n\r\nas a team for the longer term interest of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, Sir, is: how does MOM see her role to ensure\r\n\r\nthere  is  that understanding and that employers too  will  play\r\n\r\ntheir part and not take advantage of the situation, say, to  get\r\n\r\nrid  of  older workers as a way to reduce cost?  I am  reassured\r\n\r\nalso,  as  Mr  Ahmad  Magad has spoken,  that  on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nemployers  they  have to play their part to help  us  form  this\r\n\r\nformidable team in facing the economic turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, over the years, our workforce\r\n\r\nprofile has changed drastically.  In 1992, there were only 15.8%\r\n\r\nexecutive, managerial and professional staff.  Today, there  are\r\n\r\n21.5%  of  them.   With  60% of every  PSLE  cohort  going  into\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  the  polytechnics,  this  group  will   further\r\n\r\nincrease.   All these have serious implications for  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement.  It will mean that the membership and leadership  pool\r\n\r\nwill  decline.  It will mean that those who are eligible to join\r\n\r\nunions will decline to 40% of the total workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not by accident that we have a harmonious industrial\r\n\r\nrelations climate which had enabled employers to get on with the\r\n\r\ntask  of  managing  their companies with no disruption.   A  key\r\n\r\ncontributing factor for the industrial peace that we had enjoyed\r\n\r\nis  because of the quality of our trade union leadership.   This\r\n\r\nwould be compromised if we cease to have leaders of such calibre\r\n\r\nbecause  they  fall  outside  the  scope  of  our  trade   union\r\n\r\nrepresentation.   More so than in the past, we  will  need  such\r\n\r\nleaders  now, because of the changing nature of our economy  and\r\n\r\nthe  demands  of global competition.  This requires trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders who understand the ground well but at the same time have\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge  and sophistication to deal with  complex  issues\r\n\r\nwhich are global in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the issue from another angle, executives and\r\n\r\nmanagers are also employees of a company and do need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  kind  of  assistance  when they  have  problems.   Seeking\r\n\r\nredress  in  the  courts  can  be a costly,  time-consuming  and\r\n\r\ngenerally  damaging experience for the individual  arising  from\r\n\r\nthe   attendant  publicity  that  arises.   Litigation  is   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily the best option for employers either.  It results in\r\n\r\na  workplace  that is hostile and will cause loss of  productive\r\n\r\nmanhours  when  a  company has to defend against  expensive  law\r\n\r\nsuits.   Therefore,  we  would like to encourage  executives  to\r\n\r\nbring   their  grievances  to  the  Ministry  of  Manpower   for\r\n\r\nconciliation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that there are presently guidelines to help\r\n\r\nweed out bogus titles.  These guidelines were passed in 1992 and\r\n\r\nwere  an  attempt to overcome some of the difficulties faced  in\r\n\r\norganising executives.  Instead of amending section 16(3) of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Act, we agreed that one alternative  would\r\n\r\nbe  to  try  out these guidelines and gauge their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  guidelines have resolved part of  the  problem,  the\r\n\r\nrestriction  on  a  rank  and  file union  representing  genuine\r\n\r\nexecutives  remains  unresolved.  It is time  that  we  reviewed\r\n\r\nthese  guidelines  and  come out with more effective  solutions.\r\n\r\nThis review could be done through tripartite efforts and through\r\n\r\nthe  good  office of MOM, so that a consensus may be reached  on\r\n\r\nthis issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, we have come a long\r\n\r\nway from the days of industrial strife, of strikes and riots, of\r\n\r\neconomic  stagnation.  Today, in a workplace dispute, our  union\r\n\r\nleaders try to settle them through negotiation.  But if there is\r\n\r\na  deadlock,  the disputes would be referred to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour for conciliation.  And if no settlement is reached,  they\r\n\r\nare sent to the Industrial Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that when it is set up, the Ministry of Manpower\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  play  an  active  conciliatory  role.   With\r\n\r\nexperienced conciliation officers,  handling of disputes will be\r\n\r\nsmoother.  In my view, we need more experienced hands  to  serve\r\n\r\nas conciliation officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers posted to the conciliation department need time to\r\n\r\nbecome familiar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  labour  laws  and  industrial relations  practices.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  they  need  to  get to know  industrial  relations\r\n\r\npractitioners on both the management and the union  sides.   All\r\n\r\nthis knowledge goes to waste if they are transferred out of  the\r\n\r\nconciliation department too frequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of settling disputes was put in place by\r\n\r\nthe  older generation of PAP leaders who did not want to see the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions put in a disadvantageous position.  This symbiosis\r\n\r\nbetween  the  PAP  and  the  NTUC has  since  developed  into  a\r\n\r\ntripartite  relationship among the Government,  the  unions  and\r\n\r\nemployers.  Tripartism has helped Singapore to forge ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not be complacent simply because we have a\r\n\r\ntripartite  relationship that works.  Other countries  are  also\r\n\r\nmoving  in this direction.  In the 17th February 1998  issue  of\r\n\r\nthe Financial Times, Mr John Monks, General Secretary of British\r\n\r\nTrades Union Congress said,  and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the 1970s and 1980s, everyone talked just about rights.\r\n\r\nNow  we  know  that with rights go responsibilities.   Employers\r\n\r\nneed  to  accept  that with the right to employ staff  goes  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to deal with them collectively if that  is  their\r\n\r\nstaff's  wish.   Employees and their unions know that  with  the\r\n\r\nright to negotiate goes the responsibility to work for the  good\r\n\r\nof the enterprise in partnership.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Zealand and Australia too, there have been changes\r\n\r\nin dealings between unions and management.  For quite some time,\r\n\r\nAmerican  unions have, under extenuating circumstances, accepted\r\n\r\nwage  cuts  so as to preserve jobs.  If the developed  countries\r\n\r\nget  their tripartite act together, they could siphon off a huge\r\n\r\nchunk of investments now heading for countries like ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do everything possible to maintain industrial\r\n\r\nharmony.  One good way is for unionists and management personnel\r\n\r\nto  attend  the  same  courses, as  they  do  at  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Labour Studies.  Then each will be able to  better\r\n\r\nappreciate the problems faced by the other.  Perhaps, it is time\r\n\r\nwe allowed management personnel from the non-unionised sector to\r\n\r\njoin in such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourses  so that they can better understand what trade  unionism\r\n\r\nis all about in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of industrial relations will be severely tested\r\n\r\nduring an economic downturn.  While retrenchment is management's\r\n\r\nprerogative, I would like to repeat a call made by Mr  Lim  Boon\r\n\r\nHeng,  NTUC's  Secretary-General.  Mr Lim  said  that  employers\r\n\r\nshould  not  cut  back on training during an economic  downturn.\r\n\r\nInstead,  we  should not stop training and upgrading  so  as  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our competitiveness.  Then we will be in a  position\r\n\r\nto benefit when there is an upturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure this House that our unions have been working\r\n\r\nwith  management to solve company problems, and make  them  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   For example, members of a union  worked  overtime\r\n\r\nduring  the  weekends to help an MNC meet an urgent order,  thus\r\n\r\npaving the way for more new orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realising that its workers need to have their skills\r\n\r\nupgraded,  the  company signed up for the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme,  a  scheme initiated by the NTUC  with  support  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  and employers.  With certificates that  the  workers\r\n\r\nwill  get  at  the end of the course, they can look  forward  to\r\n\r\nlifelong employability.  Armed with such certificates, they  can\r\n\r\nget jobs much easier should they be retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, union and management are working together\r\n\r\nto  retrain  workers,  re-engineer the  production  process  and\r\n\r\ninculcate  a  new mindset so that the company could realise  its\r\n\r\nVision   of   Excellence  2000  in  quality,  productivity   and\r\n\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in difficult times, unions and workers are willing to\r\n\r\nmake  sacrifices  and moderate expectations.  When  the  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers, I am confident that employers will reward workers  for\r\n\r\ntheir commitments and sacrifices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, may I,\r\n\r\nat the commencement of my speech, ask the Minister the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion, which is the whole purport and import of my amendment:\r\n\r\nDoes  his Ministry have any intention to restore to the  workers\r\n\r\ntheir  rights,  which they took away from the  workers  back  in\r\n\r\n1968?   Or  is  it the intention of the new Ministry,  with  its\r\n\r\nshift  on  emphasis, to bury workers' rights altogether  and  to\r\n\r\nforget them?  I would like a clear answer from the Minister when\r\n\r\nhe  replies at the end, whether the Ministry proposes to restore\r\n\r\nto  the workers these rights which were taken away from them, as\r\n\r\nI said, in 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of those Members who were perhaps not old\r\n\r\nenough, and who may not have studied the old legislation, let me\r\n\r\nremind  them that under the Lim Yew Hock administration,  before\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  Government took power in 1959, our  workers  had  some\r\n\r\nrights.   The trade unions had their rights.  But after the  PAP\r\n\r\ntook  over, in 1967/68, after we came out of Malaysia,  and  the\r\n\r\nBritish government announced its intention to withdraw its bases\r\n\r\nfrom  here, the Government decided to restrict and cut  down  on\r\n\r\nworkers' rights and the rights of trade unions.  And Mr Lee Kuan\r\n\r\nYew  who  was  then the Prime Minister openly said  this  in  an\r\n\r\ninterview  with  the  BBC.  He said, \"I told  the  workers  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be experiencing a difficult  time  and  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  now for us because of the withdrawal of  the  British\r\n\r\nbases  that  we  should build our own industries  and  build  up\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy.\"  And he said the workers  and  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  were  prepared to do that for Singapore.  So  there  you\r\n\r\nhave  an attitude displayed by the workers then, an attitude  of\r\n\r\ntheir  acknowledging their responsibility for Singapore and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   But Singapore has come a long way since  then.   We\r\n\r\nwere  told  that Singapore has progressed economically  and  yet\r\n\r\nnone  of  the rights that were taken away from the workers  have\r\n\r\nbeen restored to them.  Is that not a betrayal of the workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot has been talked about tripartism, how wonderful\r\n\r\nit is.  But may I repeat, what I think I read Mr Chiam as having\r\n\r\nsaid,  it  is  hollow, because the trade union participating  in\r\n\r\nthis  tripartism  is not there as an equal partner.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to  pretend that the trade unions have the muscle and  the\r\n\r\nclout that they possessed at one time.  I am not just advocating\r\n\r\nrights for rights' sake.  Everyone acknowledges that with rights\r\n\r\ngo  duties.  And I am sure our workers know that and  they  have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  their willingness to do their duty  for  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  community.  But rights are important.   In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  they  give  dignity  to  the  working  man.   He   feels\r\n\r\nprotected, not because of assurances given by a Ministry  or  by\r\n\r\nan  official.   He  feels  protected because  he  says  the  law\r\n\r\nprotects his rights.  He can look at the law, he can point to it\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"There  we  have it.\"  And if their  rights  are  not\r\n\r\ngranted  or  broken, they can challenge those rights.   So  they\r\n\r\ngive  dignity to the worker, and that is important, to  motivate\r\n\r\nthe  worker into working his best, into giving his best for  the\r\n\r\nemployer  and helping in the economy of Singapore.  Without  any\r\n\r\nrights, he is completely, as I said sometime this week,  at  the\r\n\r\nmercy  of the employer, and that is no way to treat our workers.\r\n\r\nWe have got to give them an equal footing with the employers and\r\n\r\nassure  them  that  their  rights will be  protected,  not  just\r\n\r\nbecause  we  say  so,  but  because the  law  provides  for  the\r\n\r\nprotection of their rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So may I ask the Minister whether it is the intention of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to restore these rights?  May I  ask  him  again,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  the intention to set up an Industrial  Tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich will deal with any problems or complaints from the workers\r\n\r\nthat  their  rights have been violated.  We had  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court, but I have not heard or  seen  any  decision\r\n\r\nfrom  the Industrial Arbitration Court for many a long year.   I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  it  still  functions.  Is it  not  time  we  had  an\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Panel or Tribunal, as they do  in  almost\r\n\r\nall other countries?  They have one in Malaysia which listens to\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  the  workers  and  hears  them  through  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  and then adjudicates on their  rights  against\r\n\r\nthe employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well for the Ministry and for other labour\r\n\r\nleaders here to say about the employers cooperating or they look\r\n\r\nto the employers to cooperate.  It is not good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenough.   The  employers have to understand  that  workers  have\r\n\r\nrights.   It is not a question of charity.  It is not a question\r\n\r\nof magnanimity, but a question of the rights of the workers.  So\r\n\r\nwill the Minister answer these questions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Eusofe):</b> Sir, first, let me take the issues which have been\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by the Member for Pasir Ris GRC and the Member  for\r\n\r\nCheng  San GRC, Mr Ahmad Magad as well as Mr Zainul Abidin,  and\r\n\r\nalso the points made by Mr Cyrille Tan, the Nominated Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have spoken about the issues of tripartism and labour\r\n\r\nmanagement  relations.

Tripartism  is  a  key  competitive  advantage  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and in discussing this motion we had got  resounding\r\n\r\nsupport from Members and also from Parliament that it is  a  key\r\n\r\nadvantage and we have made big steps as we go along to  see  how\r\n\r\nwe  could  further enhance it, so that Singapore  will  be  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive as we face the challenges of the 21st century.  They\r\n\r\nhave  raised this issue again.  I think it shows by  itself  how\r\n\r\nimportant the issue of tripartism is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently we are facing regional financial turmoil and\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown.  And I think the question of tripartism  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  very much more important.  Members have spoken,  and\r\n\r\neven  quoted experience, of what happened in 1985 and 1986  when\r\n\r\nwe had a recession.  When the onset of recession came about, the\r\n\r\ntripartite  framework  was swift in its response.   Through  the\r\n\r\nNWC,  an  extensive  package of anti-recessionary  measures  was\r\n\r\nformulated and implemented successfully with strong support from\r\n\r\nthe  employers,  the  trade unions and  the  workers.   I  think\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware  that  there  was  a  drastic  reduction  in\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF and there was acceptance of severe wage restraint\r\n\r\nand  wage  cuts.  Now all these had been done because there  was\r\n\r\ntrust  and confidence between management and the unions.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, the prompt and effective implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the cost-cutting measures helped companies and the economy to\r\n\r\nturn  around  quickly.   And when growth resumed  and  Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinued  to achieve strong economic growth from 1987,  workers\r\n\r\nhave  been  rewarded  with substantial wage increases  and  good\r\n\r\nbonuses.   All  these were made possible as the social  partners\r\n\r\nwere able to pull together to overcome difficulties in times  of\r\n\r\neconomic adversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cyrille Tan has pointed out that workers are prepared to\r\n\r\nmake  sacrifices for the long term good.  So on the part of  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and workers, they are prepared  to  put  national\r\n\r\nobjectives  above  sectional interests, and  go  for  long  term\r\n\r\nbenefits  over short term gains.  On the part of the  employers,\r\n\r\nthey  are prepared to share their gains when the business  picks\r\n\r\nup and prospers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with the three Members, who have spoken, on the\r\n\r\nneed  for the social partners to work closely together  to  pull\r\n\r\nSingapore  through  the  current  difficulties  caused  by   the\r\n\r\nregional  financial  crisis and the  expected  slowdown  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our strong tripartite foundation has been built over\r\n\r\nmany years.  And it will certainly provide us with the mechanism\r\n\r\nand  commitment  to ride out the storm.  Tripartite  efforts  to\r\n\r\nhelp deal with current problems will certainly be stepped up, at\r\n\r\nleast in the following areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the area of cost, particularly wage cost. The\r\n\r\nNWC,  which is a tripartite body, could deliberate and come  out\r\n\r\nwith  recommendations on how employers, unions and  workers  and\r\n\r\nthe   Government  could  work  together  to  help  maintain  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of our economy, and of our  companies,  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  difficult period, and how to safeguard  the  long  term\r\n\r\ninterest  of  our  workers.   And  to  assist  workers  who  are\r\n\r\nretrenched  as a result of this economic slowdown, Members  have\r\n\r\nbeen  informed  by  my  Minister that we already  had  formed  a\r\n\r\ntripartite panel and it has already started working.  The  panel\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  find  ways to facilitate the  re-employment  of\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers and to encourage employers to also  consider\r\n\r\nalternatives to retrenchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the areas of skills upgrading and training, my Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  work  closely  with the tripartite partners  to  formulate\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  upgrade the skills of our workers,  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  low  skilled ones, to ensure that they continue  to  remain\r\n\r\nemployable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the company level, management, trade unions and\r\n\r\nworkers  should also work closely together to help the companies\r\n\r\nto improve productivity and help them to be more competitive, so\r\n\r\nthat  the  companies are in a better position to cope  with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  difficulties,  and  they can  achieve  their  corporate\r\n\r\nobjectives when the business environment improves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with all these efforts in the strong spirit of\r\n\r\ntripartism, I am confident that we will be able to ride out  the\r\n\r\nstorm and emerge stronger for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the points which were made by ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Othman, we have got one more minute.
