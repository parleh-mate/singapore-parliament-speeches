He argued that it\r\n\r\nshould  not be viewed as introducing age discrimination.   He\r\n\r\npointed out, rightly, that the CPF rate for workers above  55\r\n\r\nwas already lower than the rate for younger workers.  This is\r\n\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if I recall correctly, the main reason why the CPF\r\n\r\nrate  was  lowered  for  workers above  55  was  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wanted to extend the retirement age from 55 to 60,\r\n\r\nand  then  to  62.  It would be raised to 67 eventually.   At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  55 is considered the age when all workers  would\r\n\r\nstop  work  and  retire, with zero employment  income.   And,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it is at this age that they can start withdrawing\r\n\r\nfrom  their  CPF for retirement purposes.  In  this  context,\r\n\r\nreducing  the  employer's  CPF rate  to  keep  these  workers\r\n\r\nemployed past\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55  was  considered  reasonable,  and  does  not  offend  our\r\n\r\nsensibilities.   But this is not the case for  workers  below\r\n\r\n55.   Many  in their 40s are still in their prime, and  still\r\n\r\nsaving  for their retirement years.  To cut the CPF  rate  of\r\n\r\nworkers between 40 and 55 is to send the unintended signal to\r\n\r\nthe  market  that this group of workers can be  discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many unemployed people above 40 say that they find\r\n\r\nit  very  hard  to  re-enter the job market  because  of  age\r\n\r\ndiscrimination at the hiring process.  This is a very serious\r\n\r\nissue  for  middle-aged  and older workers,  a  barrier  that\r\n\r\ncannot  be  removed  simply  by  offering  more  job-matching\r\n\r\nschemes  or excellent training programmes.  Older job seekers\r\n\r\nwho  cannot find work because their wage expectations are too\r\n\r\nhigh  can learn to reduce their expectations.  Those who lack\r\n\r\nthe  required  skills can retrain.  In both cases,  they  can\r\n\r\nadapt  and  find  work.  But in the case of an  age  barrier,\r\n\r\nolder  job  seekers have no recourse, no matter  how  willing\r\n\r\nthey are to adapt.  If this problem is not addressed, it will\r\n\r\nbecome  even more severe in time, as our population continues\r\n\r\nto age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just last week, an employer came to see me to seek\r\n\r\nmy  help  in  getting 20 work permits for foreign workers  to\r\n\r\nwork  at his food stalls all around the island.  He asked  me\r\n\r\nto  write  to the Ministry of Manpower.  I dutifully  did  so\r\n\r\nbut,  at the same time, I also grilled him about why  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  employ Singaporeans who are out of work.  I told  him  I\r\n\r\nhave  many  residents who do not have a job and asked  if  he\r\n\r\nwould consider them.  I asked him what were the criteria  for\r\n\r\nthe job.  Is there an age limit?  He said, yes, below 45.  He\r\n\r\nsaid that frying over a wok requires a lot of energy.  I  was\r\n\r\nnot  persuaded.  It so happened that the very  next  resident\r\n\r\nwho came to see me was looking for a job, any job.  He looked\r\n\r\nstrong,  he is able, but he is 48.  I dashed out  of  my  MPS\r\n\r\noffice,  grabbed the employer, who was on his  way  out,  and\r\n\r\nmade him give an on-the-spot interview to this resident.  The\r\n\r\nemployer was not obliged to hire this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nolder  worker, but I think I registered my point with  him  - older Singaporeans should be given an equal shot at the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth will not take care of the situation\r\n\r\ncompletely,  as  it has to do with employers' perceptions  of\r\n\r\nthe  elderly.  And it is particularly during a downturn  that\r\n\r\nolder  workers need extra protection.  Is there  a  mechanism\r\n\r\nfor  the Ministry to ensure that employers who apply for work\r\n\r\npermits do so only after they have trawled from MOM's bank of\r\n\r\njobless  workers who can do the same job?  It  is  true  that\r\n\r\neven  this  will not mean that older workers will  be  hired.\r\n\r\nBut  it  will send a strong signal to employers that we  take\r\n\r\nseriously  our  mission  of creating jobs  for  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not to discourage employers from hiring  foreigners\r\n\r\nthat  they need to run their businesses.  Rather,  it  is  to\r\n\r\nencourage them to give Singaporeans an equal chance to get  a\r\n\r\njob.  There is a difference in nuance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister earlier said that the Ministry had received\r\n\r\nonly  a  few  complaints  from older  workers  regarding  age\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.   He said that in 2000 and 2001,  there  were\r\n\r\nfour and five complaints respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is running out, Ms Ng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  how  these cases were resolved.  The  only  way  to\r\n\r\nfight age discrimination, short of legislating it, is to make\r\n\r\nclear that our labour mechanisms do not tolerate bias against\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, there are many\r\n\r\nadvantages  of flexible work arrangements.  Through  flexible\r\n\r\nwork arrangements and flexible working hours, other than pro-family   and   enhancing   the   employees'   welfare,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  such arrangements can actually  strengthen  the\r\n\r\ncompany's competitiveness and workers' employability.  On the\r\n\r\npart  of  employers, however, it seems that they are  pushing\r\n\r\nfor  flexibility  more on the basis of cost  savings.   As  a\r\n\r\nlabour  MP, my view is that, while there may be cost savings,\r\n\r\nthey need not necessarily come from wage cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good example is ST Aerospace. ST Aerospace had,\r\n\r\nwith  the  endorsement of the MOM, implemented  a  scheme  of\r\n\r\ncompensatory time-off.  The exercise involved the union  very\r\n\r\nearly in the development.  It also incorporated safeguards to\r\n\r\ncheck  against abuse, eg, half yearly reviews to see  if  the\r\n\r\nscheme  could be improved further.  At the same  time,  there\r\n\r\nwas ample communication to ensure that all workers understood\r\n\r\nthe  implications  of  the changes.  Under  the  scheme,  the\r\n\r\ncompany  releases  employees on full pay when  they  are  not\r\n\r\nneeded  at work.  These employees make up the credited  hours\r\n\r\nand time off from their future overtime. The workers continue\r\n\r\nto receive regular pay while having flexibility in their time\r\n\r\nschedules  and enjoy more leisure time.  The company  is  now\r\n\r\nable   to   improve  its  competitiveness,  with  a  manpower\r\n\r\ndeployment plan that was more aligned with the job  schedule.\r\n\r\nThis  enabled  it to free up its resources so that  it  could\r\n\r\ngarner more jobs.  The gains in profits arising from this new\r\n\r\narrangement were also shared amongst the staff.  I  am  aware\r\n\r\nthat  KK Hospital is another good example that also has  good\r\n\r\nflexible work arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, todate, the examples I have cited are the\r\n\r\nexceptions rather than the norm.  Does the Ministry have  any\r\n\r\nplan to amend the legislation to facilitate greater workforce\r\n\r\nflexibility?  I urge the Ministry of Manpower to do  more  to\r\n\r\nencourage  companies  to  adopt flexible  work  patterns  and\r\n\r\nflexible working hour arrangements that will strengthen their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and  enhance their employees'  employability\r\n\r\nand welfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement will support flexi-work\r\n\r\narrangements,  provided  certain fundamental  principles  are\r\n\r\nadhered  to.  For example, it should not solely  be  a  cost-cutting  measure.   Rather, it should make the  company  more\r\n\r\nproductive and the gains must be shared with the workers.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  to  see a significant swing  in  the  workers'\r\n\r\nincome.   Clear guidelines must also be given.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower to do more to encourage  companies  to\r\n\r\nadopt flexible work patterns and flexible working hours  that\r\n\r\nwill strengthen their competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, over the last few\r\n\r\ndays,  we  have  heard quite a number of  points  made  about\r\n\r\nworkers being fussy about jobs.  Yesterday, the Minister said\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  jobs in the marine and hotel  sectors,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, but there are no takers because workers are  fussy.\r\n\r\nThat  may be one perspective.  On the other hand, I  want  to\r\n\r\noffer  another perspective, ie, basically, it is the way  the\r\n\r\njobs are designed that makes it very difficult for workers to\r\n\r\nwork  in  these sectors.  We seriously need to look  at  this\r\n\r\narea  of how to redesign jobs for three reasons: one, is  the\r\n\r\naging  workforce; second, the negative image of some sectors;\r\n\r\nand, third, the need for flexibility to accommodate different\r\n\r\nlife cycle needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just elaborate on the first point, ie, the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  an aging workforce.  If we were to look  at  the\r\n\r\nmedian  age of workers, we will notice that it has  increased\r\n\r\nfrom 33.6 years in 1991 to 37.8 in 2001.  The pool of workers\r\n\r\naged  40 years and above has also increased by 90%, from  31%\r\n\r\nin  1991  to  43% in 2001.  Clearly, if jobs are still  being\r\n\r\nstructured and designed in a way that only take care  of  the\r\n\r\nneeds of a younger workforce, the older workers will find  it\r\n\r\nvery difficult to do the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example of a resident who came to see me.\r\n\r\nShe is in her 50s and she is working in a hospital.  She told\r\n\r\nme  that her job involves having to take care of 7-8 patients\r\n\r\nin a day, cleaning them up and bathing them.  She feels that,\r\n\r\nvery  soon, she will not be able to do that job and she  will\r\n\r\nbe  sacked,  because she will not be able to  perform  up  to\r\n\r\nstandard, as it is a very physically demanding job.   In  the\r\n\r\ncourse of my work, I also came to know of another worker  who\r\n\r\nworks in a factory producing TV mainframes.  Her job requires\r\n\r\nher  to  move  the  mainframe from one workbench  to  another\r\n\r\nworkbench  for  a  minimum period of eight  hours.   She  had\r\n\r\nworked for 10 years, and she said that she does not think she\r\n\r\ncan continue working in that way anymore, because it requires\r\n\r\nher  to  stand and to carry these heavy mainframes  from  one\r\n\r\nworkbench to another.  She is really looking forward  to  the\r\n\r\nday when she gets retrenched and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngets her retrenchment benefits, and she can take a break  and\r\n\r\nlook for a lighter job more suited for her age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not believe that such jobs cannot be\r\n\r\nredesigned to make it easier for people to work.   If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  look  at this issue, and then we make it very  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans to work and allow employers to tap into  an\r\n\r\neverlasting pool of young foreign workers, there will  be  no\r\n\r\nincentives  for them to redesign jobs to meet  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nolder Singaporean workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of image, this is a serious problem\r\n\r\nbecause, if we were to look at jobs in the marine sector,  it\r\n\r\nis  usually categorised as jobs that attract the three  Ds  - demanding,  dangerous and also dirty.  Sir,  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether any Member in this House has gone to a shipyard.  But\r\n\r\nif  you  have gone to a shipyard, you will really  understand\r\n\r\nwhat  working in a shipyard means in the marine sector.   Can\r\n\r\nwe  imagine a worker coming for a job interview in a shipyard\r\n\r\nand, for the first time, looking at the work in the shipyard?\r\n\r\nMost  definitely,  the worker will get  very  frightened  and\r\n\r\nworried.   So  there  is clearly a need for  us  to  try  and\r\n\r\nimprove  the image of jobs in these sectors which workers  do\r\n\r\nnot  find  attractive at all.  For instance, we can say  that\r\n\r\nthe   safety  record  in  the  marine  sector  has   improved\r\n\r\nconsiderably, so there is no fear for people to work  in  the\r\n\r\nshipyards.  Safety is taken care of.  There could also be  an\r\n\r\norientation programme, etc, to get them acclimatised to  work\r\n\r\nin  a shipyard.  We really have to do a lot more in order  to\r\n\r\nenhance the image of jobs in these sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is about flexibility - flexibility to\r\n\r\ntake   into   account  the  needs  of  people  in   different\r\n\r\nlifecycles.   We  have heard what the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  a  few  days  ago.  He said that we  are  very  much  a\r\n\r\npatriarchal society.  Women have to perform certain tasks and\r\n\r\nwe  see a lot of women staying at home.  But there are  still\r\n\r\nmany  women who want to come out to work.  As the jobs become\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintermittent  and there is less job security,  we  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  a lot more women will have to come out to work in order\r\n\r\nto  supplement the family income.  If we look at  the  survey\r\n\r\ndone by the Ministry of Manpower about two years ago, it says\r\n\r\nthat  40% of those women who wanted to go back to work  could\r\n\r\nnot go back to work because they said that there was just not\r\n\r\nenough part-time work.  That means that if there is more part-time work available, then, obviously, they would want to come\r\n\r\nout  to  work.  And it is not just a question of them  coming\r\n\r\nout to work in order that they can buy more ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, could you complete your\r\n\r\nthird point, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> My point is that there must be a\r\n\r\ndefinite  attempt and there must be serious efforts  made  to\r\n\r\nredesign jobs.  And we need to redesign jobs to take care  of\r\n\r\nthese  three  areas:  one, the aging  workforce;  second,  to\r\n\r\nredesign jobs to take care of the poor image in some sectors;\r\n\r\nand, third, to redesign jobs to enable more women to get into\r\n\r\nthe  labour  market and, therefore, to supplement the  family\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, workers are badly affected when\r\n\r\nthey  are  retrenched.  To help them tide  over  a  difficult\r\n\r\nsituation, it is necessary to give the affected workers  some\r\n\r\nform  of  retrenchment benefits.  Recently, our  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefit  system  has  come  under scrutiny.   Are  there  any\r\n\r\nweaknesses  with the present system?  I think the  answer  is\r\n\r\nyes,  there are.  While the law states that those  with  more\r\n\r\nthan   three   years   of  service  can  claim   retrenchment\r\n\r\ncompensation,  the  payment  of  such  compensation  is   not\r\n\r\nmandatory,  neither is the sum.  Indeed,  we  know  of  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  workers  are retrenched without compensation  in  non-unionised companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system is unfunded, which means no funds are\r\n\r\nset aside for retrenchment.  When the time comes, the company\r\n\r\nlooks for money to pay for these retrenchment benefits.  This\r\n\r\ncauses a drain on the company's financial resources, and even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nendangers the jobs of the remaining workers. For example,  it\r\n\r\nis   possible  that  a  company  is  able  to  pay  all   the\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits to the workers who are laid off  first,\r\n\r\nbut  yet  still  finds  that  it is  not  viable  and  ceases\r\n\r\noperation.  The workers who remain after the first  round  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment, who may be the better lot, end up with  nothing\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as business cycles become shorter, if we stick\r\n\r\nto  the  approach that workers with less than three years  of\r\n\r\nservice  are not entitled to claim any retrenchment  benefits\r\n\r\nat all, we will have problems because there will be more such\r\n\r\nworkers  who are under this category, as the job market  will\r\n\r\nget more volatile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible suggestion put forward by some of the union\r\n\r\nleaders  is an enhanced bonus system.  Under the system,  the\r\n\r\nemployers and employees put aside a certain amount of  money,\r\n\r\nsay,  from the performance bonuses when the company is  still\r\n\r\ndoing  well and in good health.  The money is vested in their\r\n\r\nemployees' names over a period of time.  It could be  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  unit  trust.  Over the years, it will be  gradually\r\n\r\nbuilt  up. Then, when the worker is retrenched, the fund  can\r\n\r\nhelp the worker to tide over financially until he finds a new\r\n\r\njob. Such an arrangement does not add to the financial burden\r\n\r\nof  a  company during retrenchment, and it is portable.   The\r\n\r\nfund can be built up as the worker moves from job to job.  In\r\n\r\nthe current system, service with a previous employer does not\r\n\r\ncount for retrenchment benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I - and I am sure many workers - would like to know the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  thinking with regard to our current  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits   system,  and  the  practices.  Does  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nacknowledge   these  weaknesses?   What  is  the   Ministry's\r\n\r\nthinking on how we are going to improve the system?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, it looks like the\r\n\r\ndays  of  full  employment  are  over.   Like  all  developed\r\n\r\neconomies,  we may have to accept that there will  always  be\r\n\r\nsome  form  of structural unemployment, because  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmismatch between the skills of laid-off\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers and the skills requirements of new job openings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it has been forecasted by many economists that\r\n\r\nthe  longer  term natural rate of unemployment  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  rise  to  about  4%-5%.  Sir, if  this  rate  stays  or\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the  long run, there could  be  an  increasing\r\n\r\nburden on society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible way out is to look into having some form of\r\n\r\nunemployment  insurance  for  workers  or  for  employees  in\r\n\r\ngeneral.   This would help the unemployed workers  tide  over\r\n\r\ntemporarily,  whilst  they  seek  retraining  or  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment.   Sir,  for the private sector  to  run  such  an\r\n\r\nunemployment scheme alone without it being made compulsory by\r\n\r\nlaw  for  all  employees may not be economically  viable,  as\r\n\r\nthere is a lack of economies of scale and the problem of what\r\n\r\nis   often   called   in  the  insurance  industry   \"adverse\r\n\r\nselection\",  in that only those most at risk  would  take  up\r\n\r\nthis  form  of  insurance.  Those who have relatively  secure\r\n\r\njobs, like in the civil service, would not take up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme could be similar to the concept of Medisave\r\n\r\nor medical insurance where individuals may be mandated by law\r\n\r\nto contribute, say, 2-3% of their CPF contribution towards an\r\n\r\nunemployment insurance scheme.  Since all employees will have\r\n\r\nto contribute on their account to this scheme, it can also be\r\n\r\nadministered  privately, instead  of  being  State  run.   An\r\n\r\nunemployed  individual  may draw on these  balances  and  the\r\n\r\ninsurance  for a period of time to help him meet his  or  her\r\n\r\nfinancial obligations during this period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could prevent abuse of the scheme by, say, tying\r\n\r\nthe  payment of unemployment benefits during this  period  to\r\n\r\nskills  training or retraining and/or active job search.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, we could avoid inadvertently promoting the welfare\r\n\r\nstate mentality and the disincentives to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see the introduction of this kind of unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance as a possible extension of our CPF scheme,  ie,  to\r\n\r\nexpand the coverage of our social security to meet unforeseen\r\n\r\nunemployment circumstances.

While their immediate needs\r\n\r\n-  feeding their family and paying household bills are indeed\r\n\r\npressing  - what I am equally, in truth, more concerned  with\r\n\r\nis  whether  the jobs that were lost would ever return,  even\r\n\r\nwhen  the  economy recovers.  Some will never return,  having\r\n\r\npermanently  migrated  from our shores.   New  jobs  will  be\r\n\r\ncreated.

How many  jobs  were\r\n\r\nlost  since  2001 when the slowdown began?   If  we  were  to\r\n\r\nclassify the jobs that were lost as low-skilled, skilled  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  and managerial, how many would there  be  in  each\r\n\r\ncategory?   How  many  of the jobs that were  lost  are  lost\r\n\r\npermanently?  What are the job prospects for this year?

Our  experience\r\n\r\nshows  that  it is not an easy task.  Many are still  waiting\r\n\r\nand  hoping  for  assistance but they are disappointed.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of those who are assisted has been increasing but  is\r\n\r\nstill  under 20%.  This is a serious problem and  MOM  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  help with greater effort.  I  have  found  that\r\n\r\nthere are many more job mismatches than job matches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, I would like to give\r\n\r\ntwo examples that I had experienced.  A 45-year-old father of\r\n\r\ntwo  school-going children used to receive a salary of $4,200\r\n\r\nand  did  not  want any other job except in the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector.  We had suggested that he work in the IT sector  with\r\n\r\na  salary  of $3,500 but he refused because he said he  liked\r\n\r\nthe  experience  and the skill that he had  learnt  from  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector. The job that he had  lost  will  never\r\n\r\ncome back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person, an Eurasian who used to get $3,600 had\r\n\r\nbeen  retrenched.  He tried to apply for many  jobs,  by  the\r\n\r\nhundreds  but was not successful.  Finally, he said  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  a  victim  of discrimination because he  came  from  the\r\n\r\n\"others\" group.  I have always heard many Malays saying  that\r\n\r\nthey  were discriminated against because of language or race,\r\n\r\nbut  this  is  the first time that I heard of a person  being\r\n\r\ndiscriminated for being under \"others\".  Actually, he  had  a\r\n\r\ncolleague  at the same place, a Chinese, who did not  get  an\r\n\r\nalternative  job.  I convinced him that his case  was  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  discrimination because his Chinese friend  also\r\n\r\nfaced the same problem.  Finally, he and his friend agreed to\r\n\r\nattend  a  diploma course on Freight Management with  funding\r\n\r\nunder the Northeast CDC's surrogate scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still the problem of people being too choosy in\r\n\r\nfinding  jobs  but  there are still employers  who  are  also\r\n\r\nchoosy  in  selecting workers, especially those 45 years  and\r\n\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chairman, in the past, you could still get\r\n\r\nhawker  stalls.   Presently, there is no such opportunity  as\r\n\r\neverything  is  done by tender.  The opportunity  to  open  a\r\n\r\nstall  in the school canteen is also lesser. So what  is  the\r\n\r\nfate  of such individuals?  It is true that the only way  out\r\n\r\nis  to  go for training and retraining.  But I must say  that\r\n\r\nthis process takes a long time and it is a difficult task due\r\n\r\nto  the mindset of the workers and the employers.  As we  try\r\n\r\nto convince others to go for retraining, MOM should cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  ENV  to find out ways to provide new job opportunities,\r\n\r\nwhich  include  hawking and setting up small  businesses  for\r\n\r\nmore  workers who have been retrenched and might be difficult\r\n\r\nto be retrained in the short-term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Sir, Members have expressed concern regarding the welfare of\r\n\r\nour  workers especially in this downturn.

Sir, the law, specifically the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct,  protests  against unfair dismissal, and MOM  reiterates\r\n\r\nthat workers who have been unfairly dismissed or denied their\r\n\r\nbenefits  should  inform my Ministry.  We  will  investigate,\r\n\r\nseek appropriate remedies and compensation.  Nevertheless, Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  will  be heartened to note that unfair dismissals  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  three years, at least those reported to MOM,  were\r\n\r\nstable - 32 last year, compared to 29 in the year 2000 and 33\r\n\r\nthe year before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked what about the plight of\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.   In this regard,  let  me  applaud  the\r\n\r\nunions' efforts.  Our data shows that many retrenched workers\r\n\r\nin   unionised  companies  were  paid  reasonable   sums   of\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits,  while those who  were  non-unionised\r\n\r\nwere  reported  to  have received little or  no  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits.  Mr Yeo suggests an enhanced bonus system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere a proportion of the company's profits is put aside  and\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  over  the years to be utilised  when  workers  get\r\n\r\nretrenched.  It is a good idea, but may be better  encouraged\r\n\r\non   a   voluntary  basis,  rather  than  through  Government\r\n\r\nintervention.  Unions and employers could negotiate for  such\r\n\r\narrangements based on individual circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since employment will be more disruptive, should we\r\n\r\nprotect  and  provide even more in the form  of  unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance,  as  suggested by Mr Chew Heng  Ching?   He  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  MOM  has studied this.  Yes.  Other  countries  that\r\n\r\nhave  instituted unemployment insurance have regretted  doing\r\n\r\nso.   As  expected, there were abuses.  In Japan,  the  claim\r\n\r\nrate  in  a recession is so overwhelming that the scheme  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a severe financial burden to the state.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nmoral  hazard inherent in unemployment insurance.  In Canada,\r\n\r\n'brunching'  occurs  - brunch, between breakfast  and  lunch.\r\n\r\nWorkers  abuse and game the system by working for the minimal\r\n\r\nqualifying  period and then resign to claim the  unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance   benefits.    The  well-intentioned   unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance system deteriorates into unemployment handouts.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the counter argument of those who say that\r\n\r\nhaving  seen  and  presumably learnt  from  the  mistakes  of\r\n\r\nothers, we can craft our own version to avoid the pitfalls by\r\n\r\ntying  up  unemployment insurance with job search,  training,\r\n\r\netc.  This argument is enticing, but we should remain wary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me of the latent alcoholic who rationalises\r\n\r\nthat  since  most alcoholics are addicted to hard liquor,  he\r\n\r\nwould  remain immune if he stuck to fine wines.   The  latent\r\n\r\nalcoholic   would  be  quite  wrong,  and  with   devastating\r\n\r\nconsequences.  Once introduced, unemployment insurance  would\r\n\r\nbe  difficult  to roll back.  MOM's view is  that  we  should\r\n\r\navoid introducing unemployment insurance at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have quite rightly pointed out that we need to\r\n\r\nenhance the employability of older workers.  I agree with  Mr\r\n\r\nSeng  Han  Thong,  Ms  Irene Ng and Mdm  Ho  Geok  Choo  that\r\n\r\nnegative attitudes towards older workers are unwarranted  and\r\n\r\nunjustified.   Mr  Seng remains puzzled  about  how  the  age\r\n\r\nbarrier  for a mature worker got shifted from 60 to  50,  and\r\n\r\nnow rests at 40 years old.  I am equally puzzled and I am not\r\n\r\nsure  how the age 40 cropped out.  I thought perhaps  because\r\n\r\nwe  started our People-for-Jobs Traineeship at that age.  But\r\n\r\nwe  chose that age 40 barrier to compensate in part  for  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based  wage system, where older  workers  found  it\r\n\r\nharder  to  compete  with younger counterparts  commanding  a\r\n\r\nlower  salary.  We certainly did not mean to send the message\r\n\r\nthat  at  40 your brains go ga-ga and your body goes goo-goo.\r\n\r\nThis myth flies against the face of reality where, as Mdm  Ho\r\n\r\nand Ms Irene Ng rightly pointed out, many workers because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  skill  sets, experience and networking, peak  at  that\r\n\r\nage.   Sir, at this juncture I have to confess that I have  a\r\n\r\nvested  interest in supporting this argument.  But I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  if  I put the motion to this House that life begins  at\r\n\r\n40, the ayes will have it.  Many here, who are above 40, will\r\n\r\nconfidently attest that they are better now than they were 10\r\n\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more serious note, no single remedy will quite work\r\n\r\nas  the difficulty for older workers finding re-employment is\r\n\r\nmulti-faceted.   To quote my Minister, there  is  \"no  single\r\n\r\nmagic  bullet'  and  we  will have to approach  this  problem\r\n\r\nholistically.   To alleviate the problem,  we  will  have  to\r\n\r\naddress  the issues relating to disparity in skills sets  and\r\n\r\nthe  seniority based wage system.  Ms Irene Ng asked:  should\r\n\r\nwe  move  by way of legislation?  Other countries which  have\r\n\r\ntried  that  have realised that there were severe  rigidities\r\n\r\nintroduced, such that the overall pie shrank.  We do have  in\r\n\r\nplace,  for example, certain policies which actually  protect\r\n\r\nagainst  age  discrimination.  I talked about this  yesterday\r\n\r\nwhen  replying to Mdm Halimah in terms of anti-discriminatory\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong and Mr Seng suggest that we should further \"ring\r\n\r\nfence\"  certain  public  sector contracts  or  vocations  for\r\n\r\nlocals,  or  tighten  foreign  manpower,  to  protect  mature\r\n\r\nworkers.   I would like to inform the House that our workers'\r\n\r\npolicy does have in place a dependency scheme.  If we use the\r\n\r\nexample  that Ms Irene Ng brought up, where one had to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  20  foreign  workers, he would have  to  hire  about  50\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in  order to get the 20  foreign  workers.   So\r\n\r\nthere  are  some measures in place.  Should we  further  ring\r\n\r\nfence it?  Should we further tighten foreign worker policies?\r\n\r\nIt may solve one problem, but would create many more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we introduced the People-for-Jobs Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme.  As at April this year, about 2,000 workers  above\r\n\r\n40  have jobs under this programme.  It is premature,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  unwise,  in  this recession to judge  the  success  or\r\n\r\nfailure of any programme.  We will have to wait till when the\r\n\r\neconomy  recovers and with a tighter labour market  to  gauge\r\n\r\nthe level of discrimination against older workers and at what\r\n\r\nage  that  discrimination is most apparent.  We will  monitor\r\n\r\nthe  situation closely and introduce more measures,  if  need\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do though agree with Mr Seng and Mdm Halimah that we\r\n\r\nshould be looking at work redesign.  Some cited McDonalds  as\r\n\r\na  model  that others can emulate as to how they successfully\r\n\r\nintegrated a more mature workforce.  MOM is now working  with\r\n\r\nSPRING to identify specific industries for redesigning  work,\r\n\r\nwhether it is for elderly or females.  We have been trying to\r\n\r\nchange  the  image  of  certain industries,  as  Mdm  Halimah\r\n\r\nsuggested, for example, in the marine industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that the solution to unemployment is a\r\n\r\nvibrant  economy.   Can  we  facilitate  this  through   more\r\n\r\nflexible  wage and work arrangements, asked Mr Gan,  Mr  Heng\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Yeo.   I  think this is a more enlightened  path  to\r\n\r\npursue.  I agree with Mr Gan and Mr Heng that the CPF cut for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of helping companies to reduce cost is  a  blunt\r\n\r\ninstrument.  The National Wages Council has recommended  that\r\n\r\nthe Monthly Variable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComponent  be  part  of  our wage  structure.   How  is  this\r\n\r\nproceeding?    Some   34%   of   unionised   companies   have\r\n\r\nimplemented, but for non-unionised companies only  3.4%  have\r\n\r\nimplemented  this.   The current recession  has  impeded  the\r\n\r\nprogress of implementation.  The ERC is studying further ways\r\n\r\nto enhance its progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM also agrees with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in  work  arrangements  will  help  our  overall\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and increase jobs.  The ERC is  studying  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  \"Quarterly work hours scheme\"  to  help  companies\r\n\r\nadjust  to peaks and lulls due to seasonal demand.   We  will\r\n\r\nstudy  this  carefully,  as he has advised,  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nworkers'  interests and health are still  looked  after  with\r\n\r\nrespect to overtime, rest days and safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Dr Tan Boon Wan's specific queries, we\r\n\r\nhad  about 26,000 workers who were retrenched in 2001.  About\r\n\r\n41%  were  production and related workers, another  39%  were\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  managers  and  executives,   and   19%   were\r\n\r\nclerical, sales and service workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to change mindsets. We will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to help Singaporeans adjust.  This will take  time,\r\n\r\nbut our efforts will continue unimpeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, my question was not\r\n\r\nanswered,  whether there is a mechanism for the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nensure that employers, who apply for work permits, do so only\r\n\r\nafter  they  have gone through MOM's bank of jobless  workers\r\n\r\nwho can do the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, it was indeed answered, and this is\r\n\r\nthe  question of ring fencing, however you call it.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  can we introduce certain barriers before they applied\r\n\r\nfor work permits?  I said that if we did that, we could solve\r\n\r\none  problem, but probably create more problems.   There  are\r\n\r\nother  mechanisms that we can use.  I think we will  want  to\r\n\r\nmove  slowly on that because, it will be onerous  on  certain\r\n\r\nindustries  and we might end up reducing the overall  pie  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy one sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister to let\r\n\r\nme  know  how  many  of  the jobs that were  lost  were  lost\r\n\r\npermanently,  because this is a reflection of the  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment?  If the Minister does not have the figures now,\r\n\r\nperhaps at some other time the figures could be released.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, certain sectors that have moved out\r\n\r\nmay  not  come  back.   For example, yesterday,  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nPhilips and Hitachi.  Certain production operations that have\r\n\r\nmoved  out  of Singapore may find it not cost competitive  to\r\n\r\ncome  back to Singapore.  The overall picture will take  time\r\n\r\nto  emerge.  I think the lesson is that we have to be nimbler\r\n\r\nand  respond to training, again the point that I  brought  up\r\n\r\nyesterday.   We  will have to monitor the situation  and  see\r\n\r\nwhich  skills  sets are more relevant and  help  our  workers\r\n\r\ntransit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, with the Minister's\r\n\r\nindulgence, I asked a question about whether we can  look  at\r\n\r\nthose who are not trainable, and whether we can recreate some\r\n\r\nof  the older jobs like small businesses and stalls, and  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Manpower to work with the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, it is indeed an option that we have\r\n\r\nexplored.  The question is: can we create an informal  sector\r\n\r\nformally?   We  have  gone through  the  arguments.   We  tie\r\n\r\nourselves in knots.  It will be a difficult exercise, but  we\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  work on training,  trying  to  adapt  our\r\n\r\nworkers, trying to change some flexible work arrangements, to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  overall pie before we move  on  that.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that we want to look at, but we will  look  at  it\r\n\r\ncarefully.   It is not that we do not want to do it,  but  it\r\n\r\ncreates so many distortions that we are not sure how it  will\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although\r\n\r\nour  unemployment  rate has gone up, we  should  continue  to\r\n\r\nattract and retain foreign talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of Warring Kingdoms, the Kingdom of\r\n\r\nYan often suffered defeats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the hand of the Kingdom of Qi.  So the King of Yan  asked\r\n\r\nhis  cabinet minister, Guo Wei, how he could recruit  talents\r\n\r\nto  help  build  up the country to fight the Kingdom  of  Qi.\r\n\r\nMinister  Guo  Wei told him the story:  \"Once  upon  a  time,\r\n\r\nthere was a King who wanted to find a horse which can race  a\r\n\r\nthousand miles - Qian Li Ma.  When he heard of one such  Qian\r\n\r\nLi  Ma, he quickly dispatched his most entrusted official  to\r\n\r\ngo and bid for it.  However, when the official reached there,\r\n\r\nthe  horse was dead but, nevertheless, he paid 500  taels  of\r\n\r\ngold  to  buy the dead horse.  As expected, he got a scolding\r\n\r\nwhen he went back to the King with a dead horse.  He replied,\r\n\r\n\"If  a dead horse could be worth 500 taels of gold, how about\r\n\r\na  live Qian Li Ma?\"  True enough, when the news spread, many\r\n\r\nQian Li Mas were brought in front of the King.  King Yan Zhao\r\n\r\ntook the message and started treating his talents well and in\r\n\r\nno time, his Kingdom was able to beat the Kingdom of Qi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking our Minister to go and buy a dead\r\n\r\nhorse.  However, we need international talents more than they\r\n\r\nneed us.  Talented human resources are globally mobile.  Even\r\n\r\nChina  is trying its best to woo back its outflow of talented\r\n\r\nChinese.  Our Malaysian neighbour is courting our talents  as\r\n\r\nwell.   I  understand  there  are a  number  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nworking in the tech park in Penang and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with our current unemployment situation, we should\r\n\r\ncontinue to attract them to Singapore, to enhance our limited\r\n\r\nhuman  capital, and to treat them well.  This will  send  out\r\n\r\nthe right signal to the global talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must not stop here. For our country to\r\n\r\nbenefit maximally from these talents, we must help them  sink\r\n\r\nroots and become an integral part of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans view foreign talents with mercenary\r\n\r\nsuspicion that they are here only for economic self-benefits.\r\n\r\nI  believe some of them are.  But we are partly to be  blamed\r\n\r\nif we deal with foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalent  purely  on an economic basis.  That being  the  case,\r\n\r\nwhen we pay well, they work for us.  When someone, somewhere,\r\n\r\npays better, they move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to retain them, we have to make them feel at home,\r\n\r\ngive  them  a  strong sense of belonging, and integrate  them\r\n\r\nwell into our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote the Prime Minister who said this\r\n\r\nduring the debate on Singapore 21 on 5th May 1999:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To sustain our economy and to let our society flourish,\r\n\r\nwe  need to import foreign talents and offer some of them  PR\r\n\r\nand   citizenship.    Our   population   will   become   more\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan.   The  city  will  become  more  international.\r\n\r\nNewcomers every year have to be integrated into our  society.\r\n\r\nWe  have to create in them the same strong sense of belonging\r\n\r\nto Singapore as the thoroughbred Singaporeans.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singaporeans working overseas miss our \"char kway\r\n\r\nteow\" and \"roti prata\", our foreign colleagues here are human\r\n\r\ntoo,  and miss the creature comforts, their friends  and  the\r\n\r\nenvironment that they grew up with.  Therefore,  it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant to help them feel at home and feel as if  they  are\r\n\r\npart of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has many things to offer. As a society, our\r\n\r\ncore  values  of  \"meritocracy,  equal  opportunities,  clean\r\n\r\ngovernment  and racial/religious harmony\" are  attractive  to\r\n\r\nmany of them, including our Senior Minister of State, Mr Khaw\r\n\r\nBoon Wan and hon. Member, Ms Irene Ng.  This is the soft side\r\n\r\nof selling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the practical aspect, we should make life easier for\r\n\r\nthem.   For  instance, I propose that the  Manpower  Ministry\r\n\r\ncould  perhaps  set  up a one-stop agency to  assist  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  relocate.  The agency could help  in  the  following\r\n\r\nareas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Visa applications for spouse and dependants;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Housing problem; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Education for children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After helping them settle in, we could have a programme\r\n\r\nto  systematically integrate them into our community such  as\r\n\r\njoining in the grassroots activities.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould also encourage them to join in national events such as\r\n\r\nNational  Day Parade.  For example, a contingent  of  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  or  a performance by them would be a recognition  of\r\n\r\ntheir  contribution  to Singapore and render  them  a  strong\r\n\r\nsense of belonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): For\r\n\r\nthe  last  three  years, foreign workers have  made  a  great\r\n\r\ncontribution to our economy in sectors such as manufacturing,\r\n\r\nshipbuilding,   the  health  service  and  the   construction\r\n\r\nindustry,  thus  playing a significant role in  our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and in enhancing our productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these workers go overseas to earn a living, they\r\n\r\ninvariably  have to cough up huge sums of money  to  pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir  passage.   Some of them told me that a skilled  worker\r\n\r\nhas  to pay more than $10,000, while an unskilled worker  has\r\n\r\nto  fork out at least $2,000, depending on which country they\r\n\r\ncome from.  Besides, when they leave their native villages to\r\n\r\ngo  to  a strange land to make a living, they have to  endure\r\n\r\nmuch  emotional  trauma.   For  them,  this  is  an  enormous\r\n\r\nchallenge.  Hence, whenever I come across stories about their\r\n\r\nbeing  swindled and cheated of their hard-earned  savings  by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous persons here, I feel sorry for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, there have been a spate of newspaper\r\n\r\nreports  about some unfortunate incidents which have happened\r\n\r\nto  these  foreign workers.  Such reports are quite sensitive\r\n\r\nand  will, in the long run, impair the image of our  country,\r\n\r\nas  they would create the impression that it is not safe  for\r\n\r\nforeigners  to come here to work and they would  be  unfairly\r\n\r\ntreated.   Currently, more than 600,000 foreign  workers  are\r\n\r\nbeing  employed in Singapore, and only less than 1%  of  them\r\n\r\nare  alleged  to  have been ill-treated by  their  employers.\r\n\r\nGoing  by  press reports, one would be misled to  think  that\r\n\r\nemployers  in Singapore are a bunch of immoral crooks.   This\r\n\r\nis  far from the truth.  As a matter of fact, there are  many\r\n\r\ngood  employers who provide suitable accommodation, amenities\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelfare  for their workers.  However, these go unreported  in\r\n\r\nthe media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our press should make it a point to highlight such good\r\n\r\nbehaviour on the part of the employers and not lay out a  few\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  and  unprincipled  employers  in   their   news\r\n\r\nreports.  We have in our midst bad employers just as we  have\r\n\r\nbad  foreign  workers  here.  As I  mentioned  earlier,  many\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  had to incur huge debts to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\npassage  to  come here to work.  Many of them are  unable  to\r\n\r\nearn  enough  to pay back their loans.  Hence, they  have  to\r\n\r\nmoonlight  or resort to some illegal activities to make  more\r\n\r\nmoney.   When they are found out, they would just  disappear.\r\n\r\nThis  results  in  many  law-abiding employers  having  their\r\n\r\ndeposits  forfeited.   This is very unfair  to  most  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  So I hope when such cases are being dealt with by\r\n\r\nMOM,  there  should  be  some kind of flexibility  and  human\r\n\r\ntouch.  While I fully support Government's firmness in  going\r\n\r\nafter  employers  who  ill-treat and  exploit  their  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  we should also take equally stern measures  against\r\n\r\nthose foreign workers who bunk off without any reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are morally bound to look after the interest of these\r\n\r\nforeign  workers and we would not like to see them march  and\r\n\r\nprotest  in the street, because this will cause very  serious\r\n\r\ndamage  to our country.  Therefore, I would urge the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  formulate some measures to make sure that foreign  worker\r\n\r\nagencies  follow certain rules and regulations.  They  should\r\n\r\nhave  enough  financial resources to pay for  their  workers'\r\n\r\nsalaries for at least 2-3 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are more than 1,000 foreign worker\r\n\r\nagencies.   We  see  a  lot  of newspaper  advertisements  on\r\n\r\nforeign  worker  agencies.  We ought to have  a  very  strict\r\n\r\nevaluation  system to verify whether these  agencies  operate\r\n\r\nunder  basic  ethical standards.  Otherwise,  their  licences\r\n\r\nshould  be  revoked.   This will act as a  deterrent  against\r\n\r\nerrant agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is morally bound to look after the interests of\r\n\r\nall  foreign  workers.   Foreign workers  who  work  in  some\r\n\r\nshipyards and in the construction industry have opted to join\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  to safeguard their interest.   They  are  also\r\n\r\nentitled  to  join  various  training  courses  and   welfare\r\n\r\nbenefits  provided  by the NTUC.  I would urge  the  relevant\r\n\r\ndepartments, especially MOM, to continue exercising stringent\r\n\r\ncontrol  over employers and foreign worker agencies  to  make\r\n\r\nsure that they maintain basic ethical standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have three\r\n\r\ndifferent  issues  to raise.  First, is on  the  issuance  of\r\n\r\nemployment passes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many companies, especially the smaller ones, face a\r\n\r\ndilemma  when  they  try  to bring  in  foreign  talent  into\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially from developing countries.  Good people\r\n\r\nfrom these countries have many capabilities, sometimes better\r\n\r\nthan our locals, but do not demand very high salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, many start-ups cannot afford to pay\r\n\r\nhigh  basic salaries, even if the employee deserves  it,  but\r\n\r\ninstead  they  issue  stock options or variable  compensation\r\n\r\nlike  bonuses, commissions or profit sharing as  alternatives\r\n\r\nto make up for lower salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both cases, with our restrictive employment pass\r\n\r\nissuance  practices, we create great problems  for  companies\r\n\r\nhiring  such  people  from overseas.  The  issue  is  one  of\r\n\r\nminimum  salary  requirement for employment  pass  approvals.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry should exercise flexibility, in my opinion,  to\r\n\r\ngive  the benefit of doubt to the companies when they declare\r\n\r\nthat  such people are indeed talented, despite the fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  paying lower basic salaries.  Currently, to  cover\r\n\r\nall  eventualities, the rules have become very tight.  I hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister would consider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on the termination of employment\r\n\r\npasses.   When employment pass holders lose their  jobs,  and\r\n\r\nthey have to leave Singapore, they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  given about a couple of weeks, I believe, two or  three\r\n\r\nweeks,  to leave.  In the last few years, there are  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of them who have lost their jobs.  Many of them  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in  Singapore for many years too and have families  and\r\n\r\nchildren comfortably studying in our local schools, and  they\r\n\r\nhave  other  commitments in Singapore.  Giving  them  a  very\r\n\r\nshort time to wrap up, pack up and leave the country is not a\r\n\r\nfair  and humane thing to do.  It does not give a good signal\r\n\r\nto  future  potential  talent whom  we  want  to  bring  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Ministry work with the Home Affairs\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  issue  such people with a six-month  Transition\r\n\r\nVisa, so that they can either look for alternative employment\r\n\r\nor have enough time to organise themselves before they leave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is on work permits for non-domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.  We have a few levers to control this.  The first is\r\n\r\nthe  quota  system  and the other is on the  levies.   Can  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that,  for  the sake of employers  who  cannot  find\r\n\r\nenough local employees and for the sake of reducing cost,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a multi-tier system of levies?  Because we already have\r\n\r\nquotas to control foreign workers, perhaps for the first  50%\r\n\r\nof  the foreign workers, we could issue a lower levy.  And as\r\n\r\nthey  hire more, we can gradually increase the levy.  In this\r\n\r\nway,  companies will still be compelled to hire locals first.\r\n\r\nThe  cost  of  business will be kept low, and  we  can  still\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  number  of foreign workers by  controlling  the\r\n\r\nquota.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support that we should hire local workers first.\r\n\r\nBut the truth of the matter, as many Members have brought up,\r\n\r\nis  that there are some jobs which are not attractive enough,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  that  require shift  work  or  those  that\r\n\r\nrequire  employees to work in clean rooms, and the reason  is\r\n\r\nof  discomfort.  I would like to qualify myself that  I  have\r\n\r\nalways  believed in hiring locals first in all the  companies\r\n\r\nthat I have worked in.  My own record is that I have hired  a\r\n\r\n66-year  old retiree, a drug addict, who despite 200-300  job\r\n\r\napplications, no one wanted to give him a chance, and I hired\r\n\r\nhim.  I would like to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhire locals.  I also have the opposite experience with locals\r\n\r\nwho, after taking the job and working for a few days, because\r\n\r\nof  the discomfort that I mentioned earlier, left in a hurry.\r\n\r\nFor  the  sake of employers being able to carry  on  business\r\n\r\nhere, I hope that the Minister will consider this request.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng Chee How is not here. Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, first, I would like to commend\r\n\r\nthe  Government  for ratifying Convention 182  on  the  Worst\r\n\r\nForms  of Child Labour last year.  This year, based  on  what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  had  announced  at  the  International  Labour\r\n\r\nConference last year, the Singapore Government is considering\r\n\r\nratifying  Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration for  Work  of\r\n\r\nEqual  Value.  These are very important conventions and  will\r\n\r\nsend a very strong signal about our Government's stand on the\r\n\r\neradication of child labour and gender inequality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International labour standards provide an important\r\n\r\nbenchmark  against which countries can measure  their  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation  and practices on key areas affecting  rights  at\r\n\r\nwork, conditions of employment and health and safety.   As  a\r\n\r\nmember state of the ILO, there are certain obligations  which\r\n\r\nwe  are expected to fulfil.  Since 1998, with the adoption of\r\n\r\nthe  Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights  at\r\n\r\nWork,  there has been mounting pressure for states  to  adopt\r\n\r\nthe  eight  core  conventions covered under the  Declaration.\r\n\r\nThis  being  the  case,  I  certainly  look  forward  to  our\r\n\r\nGovernment ratifying more ILO conventions as a signal of  our\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  the  ILO  and  to  show  that  we  take   our\r\n\r\nobligations seriously.  I am not suggesting that just because\r\n\r\nwe  are under pressure internationally, therefore we ought to\r\n\r\nratify  conventions, but rather that if we feel our standards\r\n\r\nand  practices are up to par, then we ought to  ratify  those\r\n\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, Sir, Singapore is rated well, because of the\r\n\r\ntremendous  improvements that we have made to workers'  lives\r\n\r\nand also because of our huge investments in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuman capital, which is often cited - I am proud to say -  in\r\n\r\nmany ILO publications.  In many ways, we are looked upon as a\r\n\r\ndeveloped country that can act as a role model for others  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.   I  have  sometimes heard criticisms  that  our\r\n\r\nlabour  standards  and practices are pro-employer,  and  that\r\n\r\nthey are more beneficial to employers rather than to workers.\r\n\r\nI  have also heard criticisms that the laws make it difficult\r\n\r\nto  organise and do not provide basic protection to  workers,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  security of employment and in terms  of  their\r\n\r\nbasic terms and conditions of employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I have two points to make and two questions I would\r\n\r\nlike  to put to the Minister.  One, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  inform  the  House  as to whether our  labour  standards,\r\n\r\nlabour  laws  and practices are up to par and  in  line  with\r\n\r\ninternational labour standards and conventions,  despite  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  we  may  not  have  ratified  all  the  key   ILO\r\n\r\nconventions.  Secondly, I would like to ask the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nshare with us the Ministry's long-term plans on ratification,\r\n\r\nand  whether  the  Ministry  will consider  reactivating  the\r\n\r\ntripartite  committee  that  was  previously  established  to\r\n\r\nfurther study this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi Daipi is not speaking. Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat Kwang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, last year, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  fatal  industrial accidents in Singapore  was  52\r\n\r\ncases,  ie, an average of one per week.  The total number  of\r\n\r\naccidents has also gone up to 3,790 cases last year.  I think\r\n\r\nwe have to work harder to bring this figure down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of our tripartite cooperation, we have\r\n\r\nalready raised safety consciousness among our workers in  the\r\n\r\nwork  sites  and  much improvement has been achieved  in  our\r\n\r\noccupational health and safety standards.  But I think  there\r\n\r\nis  still room for further improvement.  MOM should have more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  plans  to  prevent industrial  accidents  from\r\n\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we read in the newspapers that there are a\r\n\r\nnumber of workers falling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  their death from a height, and there seems to be a rising\r\n\r\ntrend in this type of cases.  MOM should also do something to\r\n\r\nfind remedies to prevent such incidents from happening again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the work environment is so different from the\r\n\r\npast.  Work site is not confined to factories, and many union\r\n\r\nleaders have pleaded with us to raise the issue with  MOM  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  definition  under the relevant  legislation,  to\r\n\r\nextend  the coverage of occupational health and safety beyond\r\n\r\nthe confines of the factories to cover all workplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  will  consider  reviewing  the  income\r\n\r\nceiling  of  $1,600  that is stipulated under  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Act and also under the Employment  Act.   As  we\r\n\r\nknow, the Workmen's Compensation Act provides for payment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation to workers who are injured in the course of work\r\n\r\nor who suffer from occupational diseases.  The Employment Act\r\n\r\nprovides for the basic terms and conditions of employment  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   But both Acts only apply to non-manual workers  if\r\n\r\ntheir salary ceiling does not exceed $1,600 per month.  As we\r\n\r\nknow,  the  ceiling was reviewed in 1996, and it  was  raised\r\n\r\nfrom  $1,500 to $1,600.  The ceiling of $1,600 is  pegged  to\r\n\r\nthe  median wage of workers in Singapore.  Today, the  median\r\n\r\nwage of workers in Singapore is $1,874.  Therefore, there  is\r\n\r\na  need  for  us to look at reviewing the ceiling; otherwise,\r\n\r\nthe number of people covered will be significantly less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which I wish to raise concerns the\r\n\r\ndefinition   of   \"earnings\"  found   under   the   Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Act.   The Workmen's Compensation  Act  defines\r\n\r\nearnings  to  include  overtime  payments  or  other  special\r\n\r\nremuneration  for  work  done,  whether  by  way  of   bonus,\r\n\r\nallowance  or otherwise.  In other words, the $1,600  ceiling\r\n\r\nunder  the Workmen's Compensation Act is based on gross  pay.\r\n\r\nThis  is disadvantageous to the workers and deprives quite  a\r\n\r\nsignificant number of workers from the protection of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkmen's Compensation Act.  It is also a definition that  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  line  with the Employment Act, which has  a  similar\r\n\r\nsalary  ceiling  but which excludes overtime payments,  bonus\r\n\r\npayments  or allowances.  In other words, the Employment  Act\r\n\r\nsalary  ceiling  of  $1,600 is based on basic  pay,  but  the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Compensation Act ceiling of  $1,600  is  based  on\r\n\r\ngross  pay.  There is clearly an anomaly here.  Because  what\r\n\r\nwould  happen is that we could have a worker who  is  covered\r\n\r\nunder the Employment Act, but because the term \"earnings\"  is\r\n\r\ndefined differently under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the\r\n\r\nsame  worker who is covered under the Employment Act  is  not\r\n\r\ncovered under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  So if we  have\r\n\r\na  clerk  in  a  shipyard earning $1,600  and  he  does  some\r\n\r\ninspection  work,  he  is still covered under  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Act.  But if he is injured, he is  not  covered\r\n\r\nunder the Workmen's Compensation Act.  So there is an anomaly\r\n\r\nthere.   And  I really hope that the Minister can  look  into\r\n\r\nrectifying this anomaly and to bring the Act in line with the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act's definition, that means, the gross ceiling of\r\n\r\n$1,600  should be based on basic salary and not on the  gross\r\n\r\nsalary.   And secondly, I would also like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto consider reviewing the ceiling of $1,600 under both Acts.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Just following up on\r\n\r\nMdm Halimah on anomalies, this is the point that I had raised\r\n\r\nin  my  speech  in  the debate on the Budget,  which  is  the\r\n\r\ndifference in the legislation to the Employment Act employees\r\n\r\nand non-Employment Act employees as far as maternity leave is\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act allows for paid maternity leave of\r\n\r\ntwo  months and protection against termination of employment.\r\n\r\nThis   covers   all   employees  except  for   professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives,   managers,  and  those   in   the   confidential\r\n\r\npositions.  For the Employment Act employees, they  also  get\r\n\r\nprotection for the third child under the Children Development\r\n\r\nCo-Savings Act. For women though, who are not covered by  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act, they do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  get this protection for the first and second child  but,\r\n\r\noddly  enough, they get it for their third child and that  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  legislation used there is  a  tool  for  social\r\n\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to ask the Minister whether he would\r\n\r\nconsider  correcting this anomaly by extending paid maternity\r\n\r\nleave and protection against termination to professionals and\r\n\r\nwomen  in  executive  positions for their  first  and  second\r\n\r\nchild.   There  are  two reasons.  One, it will  achieve  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of having more babies.  But, secondly,  and,  much\r\n\r\nmore importantly, just for humane reason, because having gone\r\n\r\nthrough  what  they have to go through for nine months,  they\r\n\r\nare  tired  at  the end of it and I think they do  need  that\r\n\r\nrest.

What  help  is\r\n\r\nthere  from  the  Ministry  for pregnant  employees  who  are\r\n\r\nearning  higher than $1,600?  In today's economy, where  many\r\n\r\nwomen are highly educated and earning higher salary, I wonder\r\n\r\nif  this amount is considered too low.  Can the Minister look\r\n\r\ninto reviewing this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that pregnancy is a very\r\n\r\nstressful  and difficult time, as what Ms Indranee  has  also\r\n\r\nsaid.

Since  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  forge a close synergistic relationship between  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  actors of the workforce, it is important  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower to also incorporate the  concerns  and\r\n\r\ncontributions of our professionals, executives and  managers.\r\n\r\nBy  acknowledging  their  role  and  contributions,  we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly be able to better engage their commitment to propel\r\n\r\nSingapore in a global competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this, Sir, I beg to propose that the mission\r\n\r\nstatement takes on a more global tone to read something  like\r\n\r\nthis:  \"To  develop a globally competitive workforce  and  to\r\n\r\nfoster   a   highly   favorable  workplace  environment,   in\r\n\r\npartnership    with   workers,   employers,    professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives  and  managers,  to achieve  sustainable  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth for the well-being of Singaporeans.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second question, Sir, I refer to Code Head S of\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Estimates on page 384 of Paper  Cmd.  3  of  2002.\r\n\r\nLooking  through  the  estimates of the  Ministry's  Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Programme, I note that the amount earmarked  for\r\n\r\nthe  operating  budget  for the next fiscal  year  is  $47.65\r\n\r\nmillion.   I suppose that most of that amount would be  spent\r\n\r\non   the   Skills   Redevelopment  Programme   and   on   the\r\n\r\nimplementation   of  employment  assistance  and   retraining\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the unemployed under the Manpower Action Plan.\r\n\r\nI  am  given  to  understand that these  two  programmes  are\r\n\r\nbasically intended to retrain blue-collar and manual  workers\r\n\r\nwho  have been retrenched, or who need to upgrade their skill\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, I proposed setting up the Higher\r\n\r\nEducation  Endowment Development (HEED) Fund for PEMs  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  done  so for workers.  Today, I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  in respect of our Manpower Development  Programme,\r\n\r\nwhether  there are funds that are specifically  earmarked  to\r\n\r\nhelp  upgrade the skills and education of our executives  who\r\n\r\nhave been displaced through company retrenchment exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be unreasonable to suppose that many of\r\n\r\nthese  displaced executives need help either to update or  to\r\n\r\nre-orient   their   skills.   As   an   example,   with   the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of our banking sector, there is an urgent need\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  some  of  the  knowledge  and  skill  levels  of\r\n\r\nprofessionals in this sector so that they come up to par with\r\n\r\ntheir counterparts in more developed financial centres.   Are\r\n\r\nthere  funds from the Manpower Development Programme to  help\r\n\r\npeople  like them make that critical switch up the  knowledge\r\n\r\nladder?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also note in the same page of the Main Estimates\r\n\r\nthat  $54.56  million have been earmarked  for  the  Manpower\r\n\r\nAugmentation  Programme.  As outlined in the estimates,  this\r\n\r\nprogramme   is   primarily  meant  to  attract   and   manage\r\n\r\ninternational  talent into this country.  I  have  no  qualms\r\n\r\nabout  the  amount spent on the attraction and management  of\r\n\r\ninternational talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I like to raise, though, is, if there is\r\n\r\nprovision in the Manpower Development Programme, then whether\r\n\r\nthere are other types of grants earmarked for the development\r\n\r\nof  PEMs,  particularly those who have  been  displaced.   If\r\n\r\nthere are indeed such grants set aside for the development of\r\n\r\nPEMs,   are  they  specifically  targeted  at  our   domestic\r\n\r\nmanagers, professionals and executives, or are they also made\r\n\r\navailable to the foreign talent in our midst?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, while the emphasis given to the attraction\r\n\r\nand  retention of international talent is not wrong, I  think\r\n\r\nthat  more can be done to nurture our own domestic talent  by\r\n\r\nallocating   more   funds  to  the  training   of   our   own\r\n\r\nprofessionals, executives and managers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my third question, Sir, I note that on page 384 of\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Estimates  the Ministry has  set  aside  some  $75\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the development of a new NTUC Building  at  the\r\n\r\nMarina  South  New  Downtown.  Sir, I  like  to  applaud  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for setting aside this sum of money to  subsidise\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading of the physical infrastructure of  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the workforce also constitutes a fairly high\r\n\r\nproportion of professionals, executives and managers and with\r\n\r\nincreasing  levelling up of the workforce  to  the  ranks  of\r\n\r\nPEMs, we must also begin to accord support to PEMs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last May, the Singapore Professionals, Executives\r\n\r\nCooperative  (SPEC)  was  registered  as  a  co-operative  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate mutual self help for professionals, executives and\r\n\r\nmanagers who have been displaced.  Today, SPEC has about  750\r\n\r\nmembers  from  across the industry.  Being relatively  young,\r\n\r\nSPEC's  mainstream  of revenue is from subscriptions  of  co-operative  shares of members.  SPEC is also today engaged  in\r\n\r\nsome   recruitment,   training  and   consultancy   services.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,  these activities have not earned  enough  gains\r\n\r\nfor  SPEC to be able to afford expanding resources on  office\r\n\r\nspace.   At  this  point, Sir, I would  like  to  declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest in SPEC, being one of the founders of SPEC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, SPEC is being hosted and housed in the\r\n\r\npremises of the Singapore Human Resources Institute which  is\r\n\r\nalready  bursting at the seams.  As this new co-operative  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged to be an on-going concern, it needs to have  access\r\n\r\nto  a  more  permanent  place to house  its  activities.   By\r\n\r\nallocating some space for their use in the NTUC Building, the\r\n\r\nGovernment and union movement will be sending a strong signal\r\n\r\nto   PEMs   that   their  needs  are  being  recognised   and\r\n\r\nacknowledged.   I  would  like to request  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower and the Chief of the NTUC to consider setting  aside\r\n\r\nsome  subsidised  rental space in the new  NTUC  Building  to\r\n\r\nhouse this co-operative.  I urge MOM to do more to help PEMs,\r\n\r\nin  terms of initial seed funding or subsidy in their  search\r\n\r\nfor a roof over their heads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nthank  all  hon. Members who have spoken on a wide  range  of\r\n\r\nsubjects  under my Ministry.  I propose to give the  response\r\n\r\nin the order of their speeches as they came along.  So I will\r\n\r\nbegin with Dr Ong Seh Hong.  I thank him for giving us a very\r\n\r\ncolourful lesson in the warring states and the dos and don'ts\r\n\r\nof buying dead horses.  The valid point that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  made  was  that, despite the economic  downturn  and  the\r\n\r\nincrease in unemployment, we still need international talent.\r\n\r\nAnd I thank him for supporting this position because there is\r\n\r\nalways  the tendency when you are faced with some  crisis  or\r\n\r\ndifficulties, for instance, rising unemployment, people  will\r\n\r\nthink  that  that  is the time to shut the door  and  try  to\r\n\r\npreserve  jobs  for our own citizens.  We have  explained  on\r\n\r\nmany other occasions why in fact we should not do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in this age of globalisation, capital and talent\r\n\r\ndo  not  recognise  any borders and boundaries.   For  us  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  this  more competitive, global  environment,  we\r\n\r\nreally need to supplement our domestic talent, our home grown\r\n\r\ntalent,  with  those that we can recruit  from  the  flow  of\r\n\r\ntalent  in the international labour market.  There is an  ebb\r\n\r\nand  flow of talent going around.  And our mission at MOM  is\r\n\r\nto  try  to  attract  and  recruit  a  fair  share  of  these\r\n\r\ninternational  talents to Singapore.  They  can  help  us  to\r\n\r\nbecome  more competitive.  They can help us to reach  out  to\r\n\r\nnew  opportunities.  They can in fact create jobs for  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong emphasised that there is a need for us, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  just bringing them here, to try to help them to  settle\r\n\r\nin  quickly.   He  proposed that we should  have  a  one-stop\r\n\r\nagency  to help these international talents when they freshly\r\n\r\narrive  in  Singapore.  I am glad to inform Dr Ong  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  we do have such a facility, we do have such a service.\r\n\r\nThis  is  our  Contact Singapore.  Contact  Singapore  has  a\r\n\r\nnetwork of offices in the world and they do offer advice  and\r\n\r\nassistance to international talents who are keen to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore to take on jobs.  They also offer a wide  range  of\r\n\r\nsettling-in  services, once the international talent  arrives\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Contact Singapore has a local office here that\r\n\r\nwill  provide assistance to international talent.  The  local\r\n\r\nContact  Singapore  office  also works  with  other  economic\r\n\r\nagencies  to organise events to help international talent  to\r\n\r\nnetwork with Singaporeans, to get to know more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans since they are total strangers here, and also to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  contacts with members of their  own  community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At MOM, we also work in partnership with other\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies,  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Sports, the People's Association and  various\r\n\r\nother  organisations of foreign nationals  here,  to  provide\r\n\r\nopportunities   for   foreign  talents   to   interact   with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and for them to also participate  in  community\r\n\r\nwork.  This is a point that Dr Ong also mentioned, that  they\r\n\r\nshould be involved in community life, so that they can  start\r\n\r\nto  sink roots in Singapore and, hopefully, more of them  may\r\n\r\nbe persuaded to stay on for good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, we do hold regular get-together,\r\n\r\ndialogue sessions and feedback sessions for the international\r\n\r\ntalents,  who  are  here  on  employment  passes,  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  issues  that they face  when  they  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,   and   to  help  them  overcome   some   of   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties, if there are any.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to Mr Inderjit Singh's points\r\n\r\non  the  dilemma faced by some of the smaller companies  when\r\n\r\nthey  apply  for employment passes.  We welcome international\r\n\r\ntalents,  regardless of who in Singapore is trying to  employ\r\n\r\nthem.   Employers  in Singapore, whether they  are  large  or\r\n\r\nsmall,  if they recruit well-qualified international  talent,\r\n\r\nthey   will  find  that  the  application  process  is  quite\r\n\r\nstraightforward.   The  processing  time  is  actually  quite\r\n\r\nshort.   For hon. Members' information, more than 90% of  the\r\n\r\napplications  for \"P\" employment passes, ie, for  top-quality\r\n\r\ninternational  talents, are processed and approved  within  a\r\n\r\nweek.   Although  salary  is an important  criterion  in  the\r\n\r\noverall assessment, it is not the only criterion that we  use\r\n\r\nto  decide whether an employment pass should be issued to the\r\n\r\ninternational   talent.   We  also  have  to   consider   the\r\n\r\napplicant's  background, as well as  the  background  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   But  let me assure the Member that we  are  always\r\n\r\nflexible and, if employers feel that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  a  very special case, they have  a  very  special\r\n\r\nperson  whom they should bring in, who warrants exception  or\r\n\r\ndeviation  from  the rules to be made, let me assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat  we are prepared to consider such appeals.  And we have,\r\n\r\nin  fact, made such exceptions and deviations, on appeal from\r\n\r\nvarious employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, however, I have to caution Members\r\n\r\nthat  while we are prepared to make exceptions, we must  also\r\n\r\nguard against abuses by some employers.  Some companies  make\r\n\r\nfalse declaration either as to educational qualifications  or\r\n\r\nsalaries  in  order to bring in foreigners of  a  work-permit\r\n\r\ncalibre masquerading as international talents.  They do so to\r\n\r\ncircumvent  the  restrictions on  the  entry  of  low-skilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers of the work-permit holder type.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of employment pass holders investigated for\r\n\r\nemployment pass abuses went up by more than 55%, from 247  in\r\n\r\n2000,  to 384 in 2001.  The majority of these abuses  involve\r\n\r\nfalse  declaration of salary, followed by forged  educational\r\n\r\ncertificates,   and  illegal  employment  or  deployment   of\r\n\r\nemployment  pass  holders.  A total  of  152  companies  were\r\n\r\ninvolved in these abuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent recession showed that lower-skilled\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  most  adversely affected  in  an  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.  If we make no effort to check those who abuse  the\r\n\r\nemployment  pass  system  to  bring  in  low-skilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  masquerading as international talent,  then  we  are\r\n\r\nonly doing a disservice to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barrier-free system means that more Singaporeans are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  face unfair competition for jobs.  So,  while  our\r\n\r\nrules and procedures should not obstruct companies in need of\r\n\r\ngenuine international talent, we will always need some checks\r\n\r\nand  balances.  Since our present system already sees 90%  of\r\n\r\nthe  \"P\"  pass applications being approved within a week,  we\r\n\r\nfeel  that the system is adequately serving the needs of  the\r\n\r\nvast majority of employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also brought up the problem of employment\r\n\r\npass  holders whose employment passes are terminated  or  not\r\n\r\nrenewed,  that  they are given a very short period  of  stay,\r\n\r\ncurrently  about two weeks, to settle their  affairs  and  to\r\n\r\nwind  up.   Let me first point out that if the  pass  is  not\r\n\r\nrenewed,  very  often the employment pass  holder  will  know\r\n\r\nabout it well in advance.  The company does not just spring a\r\n\r\nsurprise  on the employment pass holder because, if they  are\r\n\r\nnot  renewing their contract, they will have to let them know\r\n\r\nin  advance  so they will have a chance to make arrangements.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if the employment pass holders need  more  time\r\n\r\nto  settle  their  affairs in Singapore, we are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider.  They just have to let us know.  We are prepared to\r\n\r\neven  grant an extension up to six months for them to  settle\r\n\r\ntheir affairs here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Mr Inderjit Singh's point on work permit,\r\n\r\nsuggesting that since we have a dependency ratio or  a  quota\r\n\r\nsystem,  we  should  consider lowering  the  levies  for  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, or have multi-tier levies, to reduce  costs\r\n\r\nfor  the employers.  I would like to point out that the quota\r\n\r\nor  dependency  ceiling system is in place  to  prevent  over\r\n\r\nreliance  on  foreign  workers.  Levy,  on  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  will moderate demand on the part of  employers,\r\n\r\nalso  serves another useful purpose, ie, to narrow  the  wage\r\n\r\ngap   between  work  permit  holders  coming  from   low-wage\r\n\r\ncountries and Singaporean workers who are basically doing the\r\n\r\nsame  kind of job.  Therefore, we have to maintain a balance,\r\n\r\nso as not to result in increasing replacement of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nby low-wage work permit holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do recognise that levies add to the cost of\r\n\r\nemployers.   That  is  why, during the economic  downturn  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1999,  we reduced the levy across the board,  except\r\n\r\nfor  the construction sector, and these lower levies will  be\r\n\r\nmaintained  until  December this year, as  announced  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister and Minister for Finance  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Inderjit Singh's point about having a multi-tier\r\n\r\nlevy system, we already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  such a system in the manufacturing sector.  There is  a\r\n\r\ntwo-tier system.  If the employer employs foreign workers  up\r\n\r\nto  40%  dependency ceiling, he pays a lower levy.   When  he\r\n\r\nexceeds  40%, for additional foreign workers employed between\r\n\r\n40%  and 50%, which is the maximum allowed presently, he pays\r\n\r\na higher levy.  So we have such a system.  When we review the\r\n\r\nlevy  system  towards the end of the year, we  will  look  at\r\n\r\nwhether  this multi-tier system should remain  as  it  is  or\r\n\r\nshould be refined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Ong Ah Heng, also on work-permit\r\n\r\nrelated matters.  His concern is that employers whose foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  abscond  or run away will result  in  the  employers\r\n\r\nlosing  their security bond, ie, the security bond posted  by\r\n\r\nthe employer will be forfeited if the employer is not able to\r\n\r\nrepatriate  the foreign workers.  I understand this  concern.\r\n\r\nEmployers say that they cannot be 100% responsible for  their\r\n\r\nforeign workers while they are here, and some of them do  run\r\n\r\naway.   They  are  not in a position to monitor  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers' activities round the clock.  This is true.   On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, if we do not have a requirement that the employer\r\n\r\nwho  brings in the foreign worker gives this undertaking that\r\n\r\nhe  will  repatriate the foreign worker at  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\ncontract, or when the work permit is terminated, we could end\r\n\r\nup  with  a  situation where there would be large numbers  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  brought in to work and then  end  up  being\r\n\r\nabandoned by the employer on the streets of Singapore.   That\r\n\r\nis  why  the security bond is important.  It serves a  useful\r\n\r\npurpose.   There  is a hold on the employer, that  he  cannot\r\n\r\nabandon  these foreign workers and leave them  to  their  own\r\n\r\ndevices, find their own way around, and then he goes off  and\r\n\r\nrecruits some other foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bond makes sure that the employer knows that he\r\n\r\nstands  to  lose a substantial sum of money if  he  does  not\r\n\r\nrepatriate  the  worker.  In the process, it means  that  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker would receive better welfare, better treatment\r\n\r\nfrom  the  employer, because the employer does  not  want  to\r\n\r\njeopardise his bond by ill-treating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  foreign worker to the point that he will run away.   The\r\n\r\nresult  speaks for itself because, over the last 10 years  or\r\n\r\nso,  if  I remember correctly, we have only about a thousand-odd  cases of employers who lose their bonds, which works out\r\n\r\nto  about  a  hundred-odd cases a year.  This is for  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers who absconded and caused their employers  to\r\n\r\nlose their bonds.  So the numbers are not large, which should\r\n\r\nmean  that,  in  fact, the bond system does work.   The  vast\r\n\r\nmajority   of   employers  are  conscientious   about   their\r\n\r\nundertaking  to the Government, and they do repatriate  their\r\n\r\nworkers at the end of the period of working in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also expressed concern about the employment agents,\r\n\r\nand  whether they have treated the foreign workers fairly  or\r\n\r\nnot.   Here,  I would like to make clear that there  are  two\r\n\r\nsides  to  the coin, because while the foreign workers  claim\r\n\r\nthat  they  pay  enormous sums of money to agents,  they  are\r\n\r\nreferring to the agents in their own country who extract huge\r\n\r\nsums of money from people wanting to leave their home country\r\n\r\nto work in Singapore.  These agents' activities are obviously\r\n\r\nbeyond our control.  They are outside our jurisdiction.   But\r\n\r\nfor  the  employment agents that are in Singapore, of course,\r\n\r\nwe  do  license  them and we do regulate their activities  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  they serve the interests of both the  employers\r\n\r\nand the foreign workers who are here to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the Member that my Ministry is\r\n\r\nworking  with CASE to introduce an accreditation  system  for\r\n\r\nemployment  agencies, especially those  that  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nplacement of foreign domestic workers.  More than 80% of  the\r\n\r\nforeign   domestic  workers  who  come  into  Singapore   are\r\n\r\ncurrently employed through employment agencies.  We feel that\r\n\r\nif  we  have an accreditation system, it will help to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  professionalism  and  the  ethical  standards  of  these\r\n\r\nemployment   agencies,  and  also  provide   employers   with\r\n\r\ninformation  that they need to make decisions when  they  are\r\n\r\nselecting the employment agencies for their services.   Under\r\n\r\nthe accreditation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem, the employment agencies will be assessed on a  number\r\n\r\nof  factors,  including  adopting fair  and  ethical  trading\r\n\r\npractices,  having  well-trained  staff,  providing  accurate\r\n\r\ninformation on the foreign workers, the nature of the foreign\r\n\r\nworkers' training, and providing after-placement services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of this accreditation system will be\r\n\r\nannounced  by CASE in due course.  The scheme initially  will\r\n\r\nstart  off  as a voluntary scheme.  So employment agents  are\r\n\r\nwelcomed  to  participate,  to  have  themselves  graded  and\r\n\r\nevaluated.   But  my Ministry intends to eventually  make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory for all employment agencies that deal with foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  worker placements to be accredited when they  renew\r\n\r\ntheir  licence.  We hope that through such a system we  will,\r\n\r\nover  time,  be  able to raise the ethical standards  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mdm Halimah Yacob who asked whether our\r\n\r\nlabour  standards are up to par.  Let me assure her that  our\r\n\r\nlabour  standards  are  up  to  par.   In  fact,  our  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation has been rated quite highly every year by BERI in\r\n\r\nits assessment of our labour force.  The fact that our labour\r\n\r\nlegislation  is rated highly must mean that we  have  a  good\r\n\r\nframework for managing or regulating the labour market.  I am\r\n\r\nquite  confident that our labour standards will stand  up  to\r\n\r\nscrutiny by any international organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what are our plans for ratifying more\r\n\r\nConventions.   At  the moment, we have ratified  a  total  of\r\n\r\nthree  out  of the eight core Conventions, namely, Convention\r\n\r\n29  on  Forced Labour, Convention 98 on the Right to Organise\r\n\r\nand  Collective Bargaining, and Convention 182 on  the  Worst\r\n\r\nForms of Child Labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have announced that we will ratify Convention 100 on\r\n\r\nEqual  Remuneration.   We  will  convey  the  Instrument   of\r\n\r\nRatification  at this year's International Labour  Conference\r\n\r\nin  June.   With  this  latest ratification,  we  would  have\r\n\r\nratified a total of 22 ILO Conventions, including four of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neight   core  Conventions.   I  think  this  compares   quite\r\n\r\nfavourably to many countries, including some of the developed\r\n\r\ncountries.    We   will  continue  to  evaluate   the   other\r\n\r\nConventions and consider ratifying those that are relevant to\r\n\r\nus.   In  the  process, we will consult both the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement and also the employers' federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has raised some questions on\r\n\r\noccupational  safety and health at the workplace.   He  noted\r\n\r\nthat the number of fatal accidents had dropped, but the total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  accidents had, in fact, increased.   But  over  a\r\n\r\nlonger  period of the last 10 years, the number of  accidents\r\n\r\nin  factories had in fact declined quite significantly.  This\r\n\r\nimprovement can be attributed to measures that were taken  by\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry,  such  as  the  implementation  of  the  Safety\r\n\r\nManagement  System  for construction, shipbuilding  and  ship\r\n\r\nrepair industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced other measures to inculcate and\r\n\r\ninstill  greater awareness of occupational safety and health.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, we have a debarment scheme for contractors  in\r\n\r\nthe  construction  industry.  If they fail  to  meet  certain\r\n\r\nstandards,  they could be debarred from tendering for  public\r\n\r\nprojects.   We have also introduced safety training  for  all\r\n\r\nlevels  of personnel and also, last but not least, through  a\r\n\r\nrange  of stringent enforcement exercises.  I think  we  have\r\n\r\nbrought the point home to many of the employers, so they  are\r\n\r\npaying  much  more  attention to this  area  of  occupational\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health.  Our experience shows  that  the  Safety\r\n\r\nManagement System is an effective tool in improving safety in\r\n\r\nfactories.   Hence,  last  year,  my  Ministry  extended  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the Safety Management System  to  process\r\n\r\nplants,  wafer fabrication plants and metal working factories\r\n\r\nemploying more than 100 workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Yeo's concern about fatal accidents\r\n\r\nresulting  from a fall from heights, this is a concern  which\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry also shares.  In fact, two of the main causes of\r\n\r\nfatal  accidents are due to workers falling from heights,  or\r\n\r\nbeing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstruck by falling objects.  These accidents usually arise  at\r\n\r\nthe  edge  of  buildings under construction, or in  shipyards\r\n\r\nwhere  scaffoldings have to be used in the  course  of  their\r\n\r\nwork.  My Ministry will introduce regulations to ensure  that\r\n\r\nscaffoldings  used  at  workplaces  are  safe  and  of  sound\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have informed this House in the last Parliament, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  planning to amend the Factories Act  to  extend\r\n\r\ncoverage  to  more  workers  at  other  workplaces.   In  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  we  have embarked on an extensive consultation  and\r\n\r\nfeedback  programme from the affected workplaces.  Our  staff\r\n\r\nhave  met  with  organisations, such as the Singapore  Dental\r\n\r\nAssociation,  National Healthcare Group,  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nEmployers'  Federation,  Singapore  Hotels  Association,  the\r\n\r\nRestaurants   Association  of  Singapore  and  also   several\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.  This feedback is being considered in\r\n\r\nfinalising  the draft Bill to extend occupational safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth  protection  to more workers at different  workplaces.\r\n\r\nThis process of consultation and gathering feedback has taken\r\n\r\nmore   time  than  expected,  because  many  employers   have\r\n\r\nexpressed  a  lack  of  understanding  about  how   the   new\r\n\r\nlegislation  will  impact  on them and  have  raised  certain\r\n\r\nconcerns  which  my  Ministry  is  addressing.   Hence,   the\r\n\r\ntimeframe  for  introducing the Bill to Parliament  has  been\r\n\r\ndelayed.    We   hope  to  complete  this  whole   cycle   of\r\n\r\nconsultation  and addressing their concerns and feedback  and\r\n\r\nfinalise  the Bill and introduce it in Parliament later  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to Mdm Halimah's request on the income\r\n\r\nceiling  under  both  the Employment Act  and  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Act is yes, we will review the salary ceiling in\r\n\r\nthese  Acts.  We  will  also rationalise  the  difference  in\r\n\r\ndefinition  between the Workmen's Compensation  Act  and  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act in terms of salaries or the earnings  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we will have to implement a new ceiling at a\r\n\r\npoint in time when the economy has sufficiently recovered  in\r\n\r\norder to be able to absorb this additional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncost  on employers.  We will review and find a suitable  time\r\n\r\nto introduce this new ceiling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On anomalies, again as Ms Indranee has mentioned, on\r\n\r\nmaternity leave, there is a segment of the workforce that  is\r\n\r\nnot  covered, mainly the managers and the executives who  are\r\n\r\nexcluded from the Employment Act.  But it does not mean  that\r\n\r\nfemale  managers or executives, who are not  covered  by  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act, do not receive the maternity leave  benefits\r\n\r\nthat  are received by those who are covered by the  Act.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  Singapore, the employment terms of managerial  and\r\n\r\nexecutive  staff, who are not covered by the Employment  Act,\r\n\r\nare generally equal, if not better than those who are covered\r\n\r\nthrough  a  process  of individual contract  negotiations  or\r\n\r\nthrough the market forces at work.   Even though they are not\r\n\r\ncovered,   they  have  been  able  to  arrive  at  individual\r\n\r\ncontracts that provide equal or better benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia also raised the same point. We are able\r\n\r\nto  assist  those  who  feel that  they  have  been  unfairly\r\n\r\ndismissed  by  the  employer or their  employment  terminated\r\n\r\nunfairly as a result of pregnancy.  If there are such  cases,\r\n\r\nhe is free to inform us or advise the employees who feel that\r\n\r\nthey  have been unfairly dismissed to appeal to the Ministry.\r\n\r\nWe will certainly look into their case to help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next turn to Mdm Ho's comments on our Ministry's\r\n\r\nMission  Statement.  Yes, we use the word  \"workers\"  in  our\r\n\r\nMission  Statement.  But when we use the word  \"workers\",  we\r\n\r\nwere not thinking of blue collar workers. We were thinking of\r\n\r\nworkers  in a wider sense, perhaps workers as being equal  to\r\n\r\nemployees.   It was not meant to be workers in the  way  that\r\n\r\nshe  defines  it  where we have excluded  the  professionals,\r\n\r\nmanagers, executives and the technicians.  That was never the\r\n\r\nintention.  We will certainly take note of her comments.   If\r\n\r\nthere  is this implication, if there is this perception  that\r\n\r\nwe have excluded this group, my Ministry is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually  in the process of reviewing our Mission  Statement.\r\n\r\nIt  was  crafted  sometime ago when we were transformed  from\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour to Ministry of Manpower.  I think  it  is\r\n\r\ntimely for us, in the light of these few years of experience,\r\n\r\noperating as the Ministry of Manpower, to review our  Mission\r\n\r\nStatement.  We will certainly take note of her comments.  But\r\n\r\nlet  me  assure her that it was not the intention to  exclude\r\n\r\nthis group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, in fact, when she asked whether there is\r\n\r\nany specific fund under the Manpower Development Programme to\r\n\r\nassist the professionals, managers and executives, the answer\r\n\r\nis  yes.  We do have programmes that are designed to help the\r\n\r\nPMEs,  especially  those who have been retrenched.   We  have\r\n\r\nprogrammes,   such  as  the  Strategic  Manpower   Conversion\r\n\r\nProgramme,  where we can help professionals to  be  retrained\r\n\r\nfor  redeployment in a different sector.  Not only are  there\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in the MOM's Manpower Development framework,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are  also  programmes  in  EDB,  Infocomm  Development\r\n\r\nAuthority  (IDA) and in MAS where they have seed funds  which\r\n\r\nare  targeted  to  help develop professionals,  managers  and\r\n\r\nexecutives   within  their  particular   area   of   economic\r\n\r\nactivities.   There are quite extensive programmes  available\r\n\r\nto  help  the PMEs.  It is not as if that MOM had  overlooked\r\n\r\nthis group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme was\r\n\r\ndesigned to be able to reach out to the younger group of PMEs\r\n\r\nbecause  we crafted the salary support, 50% of the salary  of\r\n\r\nanybody  who  is aged over 40, at the level of  $2,000,  that\r\n\r\nmeans   anyone  earning  $4,000  can  benefit.   The  middle-management group, who is earning around $4,000, and  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen retrenched, can perhaps benefit from the People-for-Jobs\r\n\r\nTraineeship  Programme.  When they get a  job,  the  employer\r\n\r\nwill  receive  50% of his salary for six months offsetted  by\r\n\r\nthe Government.  It will help them get jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced a Work Skills Training Programme\r\n\r\nto help executives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequip  themselves with better career planning and job  search\r\n\r\nskills   so   that  they  can  cope  with  this   period   of\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  We have even introduced a programme  of  self-employment  training so that retrenched  PMEs,  who  want  to\r\n\r\nstart  up a new business, can sign up for this programme  and\r\n\r\nlearn how to start up a small business on their own and  make\r\n\r\nuse  of their past working experience to start up a business.\r\n\r\nWe do have programmes that are focused at meeting some of the\r\n\r\nneeds of the PMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Ho asked whether SPEC, which is a\r\n\r\ncooperative  of  professionals, managers and executives,  can\r\n\r\nalso share the space at the new NTUC Building.  May I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  she  put  her  proposal directly to  NTUC  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has subsidised the building of a new NTUC Building\r\n\r\nat Marina South Downtown, in recognition of the contributions\r\n\r\nmade  by  the trade union movement in helping us to  mobilise\r\n\r\nour  workforce, participating in workers' training and  also,\r\n\r\ngenerally,  looking after the welfare and well-being  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers.  This is a very important contribution that has made\r\n\r\na very significant contribution to strengthening our economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  In return, the Government  has  given  NTUC\r\n\r\nthis special recognition.  We have alienated land for them to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  new  headquarters and we have also  subsidised  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of the NTUC portion.  If SPEC wants to co-locate\r\n\r\nits operation/premises with NTUC, I think SPEC should make  a\r\n\r\nproposal to NTUC to see whether this is feasible or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I think I have addressed most of the\r\n\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

However,  the  NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperative  has become the small shopkeepers' nemesis.   The\r\n\r\nNTUC   group  of  cooperatives  has  stretched  itself   very\r\n\r\naggressively  in  the  last  two  decades,  into   too   many\r\n\r\ndiversified  commercial  activities.   Consequently,  it  has\r\n\r\nedged  out  many local business persons and small shopkeepers\r\n\r\nand  endangered the viability of many more.  As we all  know,\r\n\r\nthe  small  business enterprise plays a very  large  role  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  Singaporeans employed.  Can the Minister  look  into\r\n\r\nthis  matter and see how it can restrain the NTUC's ambitious\r\n\r\ncommercial  empire,  so  as  not to  cause  greater  business\r\n\r\ndifficulty and unemployment in the small business sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Does the NCMP mean\r\n\r\nthat  NTUC  Fairprice and other cooperatives should  withdraw\r\n\r\nand give way to the small shopkeepers?

I  am  asking  the\r\n\r\nMinister what kind of solution can be given.  I am not saying\r\n\r\nto  let Carrefour come in and take over, or that NTUC is  not\r\n\r\ngiving employment.  Yes, they are giving employment, but  the\r\n\r\nSMEs,  the small shopkeepers, are actually having a lot  more\r\n\r\nemployment,  and if NTUC is coming in aggressively,  it  will\r\n\r\ncause   these  small  businessmen  to  close  shop  and   the\r\n\r\nunemployment figure will actually go up.  So I am asking what\r\n\r\nkind  of  solution can be given.  Maybe it is a  question  of\r\n\r\nbalance, rather than stopping them totally.  It is a balance,\r\n\r\nan issue which I would like the Minister to address.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Steve Chia sees NTUC as part of the\r\n\r\nproblem.   Many others would see it as part of the  solution,\r\n\r\nparticularly as other Members have rightly pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nNTUC   has  gained  considerable  goodwill  from  their  past\r\n\r\npractices.  Recently, they said they would absorb next year's\r\n\r\nincrease in GST for one year.  Mr Chia seems to suggest  that\r\n\r\nif  NTUC  moves out of the way, then our SMEs would  survive.\r\n\r\nThat is clearly not the case.  The competition will come, and\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of competitors who would likely charge  higher\r\n\r\nprices,  and  who are not likely to pass on  the  rebates  to\r\n\r\ntheir  members.

They had to offer  all  sorts\r\n\r\nof incentives to attract workers to work there.  But now, the\r\n\r\nsituation is reversed. It was reported in the newspaper  that\r\n\r\nsomeone  has  claimed  to  own a factory  which  manufactures\r\n\r\nhandphones  and pagers, and placed an advertisement  inviting\r\n\r\njob-seekers to go for interview at a HDB flat.  A few hundred\r\n\r\napplicants  actually went to the HDB flat and found  that  it\r\n\r\nwas a hoax.  In the past, if you asked job-seekers to go to a\r\n\r\nHDB  flat  to be interviewed for a factory job, nobody  would\r\n\r\nfall  for  it.   Yet, in this instance, a few hundred  people\r\n\r\nwere  fooled.   It  just shows that they were  desperate  for\r\n\r\njobs, as jobs are hard to come by nowadays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to hear cases of employment agencies cheating on\r\n\r\nforeign workers, but now even our own local workers are being\r\n\r\nfooled.  I hope the Ministry of Manpower would look into  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, actually I want to raise my\r\n\r\nconcern  about  the quality of service of maid agencies,  but\r\n\r\nthe  answer  was given by the Minister just now  and  here  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  thank the Minister for giving the  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  the service quality of maid agencies will be accredited\r\n\r\nthrough the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong brought up a\r\n\r\nrelevant  point.   MOM empathises with those  who  have  been\r\n\r\ncheated.  There are currently, as Mr Ong Ah Heng pointed  out\r\n\r\nearlier, 11,000 licensed employment agencies in Singapore, of\r\n\r\nwhich  the  majority, about 700, deal with  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.  My Minister has made the point that we are going to\r\n\r\nstrengthen that particular sector by working with CASE on the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers.  In terms of the other  employment\r\n\r\nagencies,  we  will  continue  to  increase  our  enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies, as well as to facilitate these agencies to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir performance.  But I think a word of caution is required\r\n\r\nfor  the public.  There will always be companies who will try\r\n\r\nto  capitalise on aspirations and hope, especially  when  the\r\n\r\ndownturn is severe.  I think the public will have to be  wary\r\n\r\nbecause sometimes these fly-by-night operators can do it very\r\n\r\nquickly  and  you get cheated.

Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, Concept Plan 2001 has\r\n\r\nidentified  the  need  to focus on the  identity  of  places,\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods which are of distinct character or centres  of\r\n\r\nsocial and commercial activity.  This is a welcome move.   It\r\n\r\nis  a  clear  acknowledgement of the fact that  Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nsense of ownership, rootedness to this place derives not just\r\n\r\nfrom  kinship  ties and other experience of growing  up,  but\r\n\r\nalso from the physical relief or landscape of our country.  I\r\n\r\nknow  that  this  is  a  challenge, especially  in  an  urban\r\n\r\ncontext.   We do not have large natural reserves or mountains\r\n\r\nand valleys, and yet we seek to at least capture some element\r\n\r\nof nostalgia and the history of our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that being said and acknowledging the good\r\n\r\nintention embodied in the Concept Plan, there are a  few  key\r\n\r\nquestions that have been raised.  They fall into three  broad\r\n\r\ncategories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is criteria. The question really is what\r\n\r\nqualifies a neighbourhood as, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquote  the  URA,  \"a one of a kind neighbourhood\",  which  is\r\n\r\nworthy  of  such preservation.  The URA has identified  Jalan\r\n\r\nLeban in Upper Thomson and Anak Bukit, Beauty World area,  as\r\n\r\nexamples  of these \"one of a kind\" neighbourhoods.   Yet,  we\r\n\r\nhave  also  seen places like, say, Taman Serasi, being  ruled\r\n\r\nout  as  worthy of conservation.  And yet it could be  argued\r\n\r\nthat   those   areas   have  similar   emotional   ties   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what is the criterion in identifying\r\n\r\nsuch neighbourhoods?  If it can be made more transparent,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  helpful for all Singaporeans in  having  a  common\r\n\r\nlevel   of   understanding.   That  would  also   help   them\r\n\r\nparticipate more meaningfully in the process, which brings me\r\n\r\nto  my  next point - how are Singaporeans able to participate\r\n\r\nin this process, to be meaningfully involved?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The URA has done a good job in terms of consultation on\r\n\r\nits  Master Plan, Development Guide Plans, Concept Plan,  and\r\n\r\nso  on,  through various channels (feedback sessions  and  so\r\n\r\non).  But it could be argued that Singaporeans feel left out,\r\n\r\npartly  because these macro plans do not quite resonate  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We  do not really think in such  big  picture\r\n\r\nterms,   in  general.   We  worry  about  what  is   in   our\r\n\r\nneighbourhood,  in  our  immediate  locality,  what  we   are\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with.  At the same time, it could also  be  said\r\n\r\nthat  this is a rather intimidating way of seeking legitimate\r\n\r\nviews on what people consider to be worthy of preservation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what can we do, in terms of process, to\r\n\r\nenhance  the involvement of Singaporeans - active citizens  - who  would like to preserve certain nostalgic neighbourhoods,\r\n\r\nbecause   they  think  that  would  add  to  the   collective\r\n\r\nexperience of Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, there is a question of what will happen\r\n\r\nafter  we  have identified such neighbourhoods.  I think  the\r\n\r\nfear  in  the  hearts  of  many is  that  in  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments,  there is a rather clinical perspective  of  the\r\n\r\nterm \"preservation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce  a  place  has been identified as an  area  we  want  to\r\n\r\npreserve,  we  clean it up, we white-wash the  buildings,  we\r\n\r\nsanitise the place, and in the process we render it devoid of\r\n\r\nthe  very  character perhaps that it had, which  merited  the\r\n\r\ntreatment of it as a special place.  And that is the question\r\n\r\nthat  needs  to  be  addressed clearly, which  requires  some\r\n\r\nstoicism  on  the part of the URA officials  to  be  able  to\r\n\r\ntolerate some level of messiness in the environment, so  that\r\n\r\nwe can still carry on and enjoy messiness, which is a part of\r\n\r\nthe character of these neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know, therefore, how we are going to be\r\n\r\nable to preserve that character and what sort of measures are\r\n\r\nin  place  to  ensure that we do not lose that charm  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of identifying and preserving old neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Amy Khor, you have got two cuts. You\r\n\r\ncan take them together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nowns   an  estimated  90%  of  land  in  Singapore  and  this\r\n\r\nproportion is set to grow due to reclamation and acquisition.\r\n\r\nIn  this  light, the Government's Land Sales (GLS)  programme\r\n\r\nhas  been a crucial tool of the macro-economic management  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLS has been frozen for the past one year in\r\n\r\nrecognition  of weak market conditions.  When announcing  the\r\n\r\nfreeze  in  GLS last year, the Ministry also implemented  the\r\n\r\nReserve  List system which allows developers to apply  for  a\r\n\r\nsite  on the list by indicating a price.  If this price meets\r\n\r\nthe  URA's reserve price, then the land would be released for\r\n\r\ntender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should be commended for the Reserve List\r\n\r\nwhich  has proven to be a very effective and efficient  tool,\r\n\r\nwhere the market dictates when a site is to be released,  not\r\n\r\nunlike  the  HDB's build-to-order system.  The  Reserve  List\r\n\r\nallows  supply to be triggered by demand and is thus  a  more\r\n\r\nresponsive system of land allocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It thus injects flexibility into the GLS programme which\r\n\r\nhitherto has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlargely  rigid  and lags behind fluctuations  in  the  market\r\n\r\nbecause  the  programme is underpinned by  prior  assumptions\r\n\r\nabout   market   demand  which  may  not  materialise.    The\r\n\r\nconsequences of a demand and supply mismatch are most clearly\r\n\r\nillustrated in the more than 16,000 private residential units\r\n\r\nwhich have been launched or are ready to be launched and have\r\n\r\nnot been sold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how the Ministry\r\n\r\nintends to determine the supply of land for each use  in  the\r\n\r\nimmediate future when it resumes its GLS programme next  year\r\n\r\nand  in  the medium and long term.  I would also like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister what form the GLS is likely to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the supply of State land for various\r\n\r\nuses, it is important for the Government to take into account\r\n\r\nall land and real estate that will be put into the market  by\r\n\r\nthe  various Government agencies, such as JTC, HDB,  SLA  and\r\n\r\nLTA, besides URA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"infamous\" Turf City project, which drew much flak\r\n\r\nfrom developers and retailers in the area, as well as the One\r\n\r\nNorth  project and most recently the Ang Mo Kio  Centre  site\r\n\r\nwhich  was  directly allocated to the SLF,  are  examples  of\r\n\r\nmajor  projects  launched  or  announced  recently  that  are\r\n\r\noutside  the  GLS  programme, but  which  constitute  a  very\r\n\r\nsignificant supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to coordinate such releases and include\r\n\r\nsuch projects into the URA's published statistics to give  an\r\n\r\naccurate picture of supply conditions.  These numbers  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  taken into account in the GLS programme.  The  Turf\r\n\r\nCity  project, for instance, added approximately one  million\r\n\r\nsquare feet of retail space into the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by the Prime Minister recently in a press\r\n\r\ninterview with Asian editors, there is a need for a more  and\r\n\r\neven  better statistics on real estate so that investors  and\r\n\r\ndevelopers do not overbid for property thinking that there is\r\n\r\nstrong demand and/or lack of supply, and then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards not just inflation but over-inflation  in\r\n\r\nproperty prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, I would like to suggest that all land\r\n\r\nsupply   allocation  policies  be  coordinated  by  a  single\r\n\r\nGovernment body, at least for each major property sub-market,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, URA for housing and commercial,  and  JTC  for\r\n\r\nindustrial.  This will yield a more coherent policy for  each\r\n\r\nproperty  sector, better accountability, more  certainty  and\r\n\r\ntransparency  on  total supply from both private  and  public\r\n\r\nsectors  and  allow for quicker responses to changes  in  the\r\n\r\nspecific markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in determining the form that the GLS\r\n\r\nprogramme will take when it is re-launched, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Ministry to consider enlarging the role of the\r\n\r\nReserve List system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, the Reserve List should rightly be considered\r\n\r\nas  actual  land  supply  since the sites  on  the  list  are\r\n\r\navailable for sale at any time as long as there is  at  least\r\n\r\none  interested party willing to pay at or above the  reserve\r\n\r\nprice.   The Reserve List is useful as it injects flexibility\r\n\r\ninto  the GLS programme by allowing demand to be directed  by\r\n\r\nthe   market.   The  Reserve  List  should  thus  remain  and\r\n\r\ncomplement the GLS programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the largest land owner in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nGovernment is for good or ill the single most dominant player\r\n\r\nin  the property market.  The GLS programme is the key  means\r\n\r\nby  which the Government supplies land to the private  sector\r\n\r\nand thus must be managed carefully, so that volatility in the\r\n\r\nproperty market can be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go on to my second cut, Sir. Before I forget,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  did  earlier, let me, first, declare  my  interest,\r\n\r\nbecause I am actually in the property industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's system of selling land via tender\r\n\r\nor   auction,  with  a  minimum  reserve  price,  has  always\r\n\r\nattracted   much   attention  from   investors,   developers,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and the public alike, and has been the  brunt  of\r\n\r\nmuch criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  surprising, given that the Government  is  the\r\n\r\nsingle  largest  land owner in Singapore  and  also  the  key\r\n\r\nsupplier of land, as I had noted earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, much attention has again been given in the\r\n\r\npress  and  in this House on the Government's land  sale  and\r\n\r\npricing policies.  These policies have been much maligned  as\r\n\r\nthe ultimate cause of high costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fellow MP, Mr Inderjit Singh, had on Monday\r\n\r\nidentified  the  Government's  land  sales  policy  and   the\r\n\r\napproach  of  reserve pricing as one of the three  Government\r\n\r\npolicy  levers that has created a vicious cost  circle,  with\r\n\r\nthe  high  cost  of owning properties driving  the  need  for\r\n\r\nhigher  wages, which add to business costs.  This is  also  a\r\n\r\ncommon  refrain among many businessmen, especially SMEs,  who\r\n\r\nfeel  that the recent tax measures do not help them  if  they\r\n\r\nare  not making a profit and that they are being squeezed out\r\n\r\nby high costs, including land costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not fully subscribe to Mr Singh's argument\r\n\r\nbut,  nevertheless, think that the Government's land  pricing\r\n\r\npolicy  formula  should be revised.  Under  the  Government's\r\n\r\nland tender system with reserve prices, the land is generally\r\n\r\nnot   awarded  unless  it  hits  the  predetermined   minimum\r\n\r\nthreshold  price,  which the URA has said is  15%  below  the\r\n\r\nreserve   price.   This  reserve  price  implies   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   setting  a  benchmark  for   land   prices.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen often question why the land cannot be awarded  to\r\n\r\nthe  highest bidder as long as there is more than one bidder.\r\n\r\nThe  reply, as I understand it, has been that the State land,\r\n\r\nbeing  a  scarce resource, should be optimally  utilised  and\r\n\r\nawarding the site at less than reserve price (within the  15%\r\n\r\nmargin)  is  fiscally impossible.  Why should the  Government\r\n\r\nlet  the  private  sector gain at the expense  of  the  State\r\n\r\nbecause he gets it for a \"song\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, developers and investors have also\r\n\r\ncommented that the Government should be more transparent and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreveal  the reserve price at the outset, which is already  in\r\n\r\nplace for many private land tender and auctions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to ask the Ministry if it would be\r\n\r\nrefining  its  land  tender  system  in  response  to   these\r\n\r\nconcerns.   I  would like to suggest that  as  a  first  step\r\n\r\ntowards  more transparency and efficiency, as well  as  avoid\r\n\r\nunnecessary  waste of resources, the Ministry could  consider\r\n\r\nhaving and publishing reserve prices for the sites under  the\r\n\r\nGLS  programme when the sites are launched for  sale.   After\r\n\r\nall,  developers  would already have  an  indication  of  the\r\n\r\nreserve  price  of a site under a Reserve  List  when  it  is\r\n\r\nlaunched  for sale upon a successful application.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nas  noted  earlier, reserve prices are also largely in  place\r\n\r\nfor private land tenders and auctions.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Minister could also adopt a more\r\n\r\nflexible policy and widen the band around the reserve prices,\r\n\r\nsay, from 15-25% particularly for sites which serve strategic\r\n\r\nobjectives  and where there is more than one bidder  so  that\r\n\r\nactual supply will not be stifled and developers will not  be\r\n\r\ndenied  the opportunity to earn their rewards for  taking  on\r\n\r\nrisks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that this has already been done in\r\n\r\nthe case of the two sites at Marina South that have been sold\r\n\r\nby tender.  I would therefore urge the Minister to adopt this\r\n\r\nas a more sustained policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, the Singapore property\r\n\r\nmarket  has  declined significantly over the last  few  years\r\n\r\nfrom  its  peak.   Many owners who had bought their  property\r\n\r\nduring  the  few  years  before 1996  are  now  saddled  with\r\n\r\nnegative equity.  There is concern that prices should not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to fall further as this would affect the net worth of\r\n\r\nall  home  owners.  The relevant Government agencies  -  MND,\r\n\r\nSLA, URA, JTC, HDB and CPF Board - must therefore be cautious\r\n\r\nnot  to  trigger  another  drop from  these  levels,  thereby\r\n\r\nbursting  the property bubble and bringing about a  prolonged\r\n\r\ndownward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspiral and asset deflation, like in the case of Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the word \"bubble\" is meaningful. It is not a\r\n\r\nballoon where one can let out air when it is too inflated and\r\n\r\nlet in air when it has room to grow.  One cannot say, let  us\r\n\r\nlower property prices by 30% and be certain that prices  will\r\n\r\ncome  down  30%, and no more, no less.  A bubble is  fragile.\r\n\r\nThere  is a real danger of this bubble bursting in our faces.\r\n\r\nBut  being  cautious does not mean the Government  should  be\r\n\r\nparalysed from acting for fear that the property bubble  will\r\n\r\nburst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property prices are still relatively high. High land\r\n\r\nprices  will translate into higher costs for everything  that\r\n\r\nis  related to land, add to our business costs and erode  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  The issue we have to tackle is  how  do  we\r\n\r\nensure that the stability of the market is maintained and yet\r\n\r\nintroduce  lower  cost land use so as to  bring  about  lower\r\n\r\nusage cost.  For one, URA can be more flexible on the use  of\r\n\r\nspace  and have a lighter touch on its rules and enforcement.\r\n\r\nWe  should also study other countries, like the United States\r\n\r\nand Hong Kong, to see how they use space flexibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our planning norms need to be changed. We need\r\n\r\nto push as far to the margins as possible to maximise the use\r\n\r\nand  the returns on our land resources.  High land cost is  a\r\n\r\nreal  concern.  I think we can slice this problem in a number\r\n\r\nof  ways  and come out with creative ways to solve  it.   The\r\n\r\nExecutive  Condominium concept was a brilliant  solution,  at\r\n\r\nthat  time,  to  bridge  the  gap  between  HDB  and  private\r\n\r\ncondominium.   It  means buying an apple  now  and  10  years\r\n\r\nlater,  when  the restrictions are lifted, it turns  into  an\r\n\r\norange.   There  is an element of subsidy.  By modifying  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions  and the title of the land, the  Government  has\r\n\r\nsold  a piece of land, which physically is the same property,\r\n\r\nfor  lower price by artificially imposing man-made rules  and\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for his views on the\r\n\r\npresent state of the property market and whether his Ministry\r\n\r\nhas any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  or  plans to bring about better and more  competitive\r\n\r\nusage of land.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my key point is one of keeping\r\n\r\nproperty prices affordable.  There have been recent calls  by\r\n\r\nsome  section of our society to allow property prices to rise\r\n\r\nagain, particularly, developers.  The Government on its  part\r\n\r\nhas  been party to trying to keep the property prices  higher\r\n\r\nthan  necessary by, first of all, slowing down  the  sale  of\r\n\r\nland  and, secondly, by lifting the anti-speculation measures\r\n\r\nfirst  put  in place after the property bubble of  the  1990s\r\n\r\nbecame untenable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-speculation measures were a good move. The\r\n\r\nintention  at that time in 1996 was to remove the speculative\r\n\r\nelement  in property prices and allow market forces to  rule.\r\n\r\nI  was  therefore  disappointed when the Government  got  the\r\n\r\n'cold  feet'  and  went on to remove all the anti-speculation\r\n\r\nmeasures  in an attempt to prop up property prices.   As  the\r\n\r\nphrase  \"prop up\" indicates, it is an artificial measure  and\r\n\r\nby  propping,  it  does  not  allow  true  market  forces  to\r\n\r\ndetermine and settle property prices.  I have dealt at length\r\n\r\non  the  impact of the asset enhancement policy of the  1990s\r\n\r\nand  will  not repeat it again.  I am afraid that removal  of\r\n\r\nthe  measures seems to indicate that the Government  has  too\r\n\r\nshort a memory of the property bubble problem of the 1990s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not denying that, in land scarce Singapore, prices\r\n\r\nof  land  and properties have to go up, but in our  case  the\r\n\r\nprices went up a little too much.  The Government has all the\r\n\r\nlevers  to fix the problem.  The first lever is the  rate  of\r\n\r\nrelease  of land for development; the second is the price  of\r\n\r\nnew  HDB  flats; the third is the limit on the proportion  of\r\n\r\nCPF  that  can be used for investing in properties;  and  the\r\n\r\nfourth   is   putting  in  place  permanent  anti-speculative\r\n\r\nmeasures.  For the last lever, the Government should stick to\r\n\r\nits  original  objectives and that the  fundamental  strategy\r\n\r\nshould be to curb speculation in the property market, whether\r\n\r\ntimes are good or bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply to the Member's questions on the use of CPF\r\n\r\nfor housing, the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Manpower highlighted that some Singaporeans over-invested\r\n\r\nin  properties for the purpose of speculative gains  (and  he\r\n\r\nused the words \"speculative gains\" when he replied) and it is\r\n\r\nthis  category of people who are now in real difficulties  as\r\n\r\ntheir property values have decreased.  I therefore wonder why\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for National Development has once again created\r\n\r\na   \"death  trap\"  for  Singaporeans  by  lifting  the  anti-speculative measures.  There seems to be a disconnect in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's thinking on this issue.  I urge the Minister  to\r\n\r\nrelook  at  the whole issue and put in place once  again  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  anti-speculative measures  so  that  we  can  avoid\r\n\r\ngetting  into  the same problem again down the  road.   After\r\n\r\nall,  speculation  is undesirable for any situation,  or  for\r\n\r\nanything that we do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, let me, first of all, address the Members' concerns\r\n\r\nabout  the Concept Plan and our land use policy.  Then  after\r\n\r\nthat, I will deal with the issue of property prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, let me explain the purpose of the\r\n\r\nConcept Plan and what the Concept Plan is all about.  It is a\r\n\r\nstrategic  land use plan that helps us to map out  the  long-term  physical development of Singapore.  By long term, I  am\r\n\r\ntalking about 40 to 50 years, and it will affect, to a  large\r\n\r\nextent,  how  Singaporeans live, work and play.   Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  when  URA prepared the Concept Plan, it  undertook  an\r\n\r\nextensive part of the consultation exercise in preparing  for\r\n\r\nthis plan.  In addition to this, there were also considerable\r\n\r\ninputs  gathered from professionals, both locally as well  as\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Concept Plan is not an exercise in forecasting\r\n\r\nthe  future.  We cannot forecast the future.  Rather it is  a\r\n\r\nkind  of  road map that guides us as we move into the future.\r\n\r\nSo as the road takes unforeseen twists and turns, so too must\r\n\r\nwe  adjust.   This is the reason why we say that we  have  to\r\n\r\nreview  the Concept Plan every 10 years, and the last  review\r\n\r\nwas done in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having completed this Concept Plan review, the next step\r\n\r\nis  to now proceed to review the Master Plan.  Let me explain\r\n\r\nwhat the Master Plan is as opposed to the Concept Plan.   The\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan is reviewed once every five years.  And what  it\r\n\r\ndoes  is  that  it  translates the strategic  vision  of  the\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan  into a specific actual land use plan  for  the\r\n\r\nwhole of Singapore.  And this is not for 40-50 years, we  are\r\n\r\ntalking  about the immediate as well as the medium term.   So\r\n\r\nfrom  the Concept Plan, we break it down into land use  plans\r\n\r\nfor  the various districts in Singapore and we call this  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan.   And  this Master Plan is revised  every  five\r\n\r\nyears.   The last one was done in 1998.  So the next  one  is\r\n\r\ndue next year, 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the Master Plan is of considerable interest to\r\n\r\nthe  general  public  and,  in particular,  to  the  property\r\n\r\nowners.  Because if you are a property owner, from the Master\r\n\r\nPlan you will be able to establish what you can use your land\r\n\r\nfor,  how intensively you can develop that land and also  the\r\n\r\nkind  of land use in your neighbourhood so that you will know\r\n\r\nwhat is going on around you.  As Members have noted, URA,  in\r\n\r\npreparing   the   Concept   Plan,  underwent   an   extensive\r\n\r\nconsultation exercise and it is going to do the same for  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan  review,  in  other words,  consult  the  public\r\n\r\nextensively so that the Master Plan can take the interest  of\r\n\r\nvarious parties into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, in the course of consulting the public, what\r\n\r\nis  going  to  happen is that there will  be  many  different\r\n\r\npoints   of   view   that  will  surface  between   different\r\n\r\nindividuals and different groups.  For example, an owner in a\r\n\r\nlanded  housing estate wants to have a higher plot ratio  for\r\n\r\nhis  land.  In fact, we constantly receive many requests from\r\n\r\nlanded  property  owners  asking  for  plot  ratios   to   be\r\n\r\nintensified.  But his neighbour may not agree, his  neighbour\r\n\r\nmay  not  want  to  have  a  taller  building,  changing  the\r\n\r\ncharacter of his estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the point that Mr Ong Kian Min brought up about\r\n\r\nchange of use, this is a common issue.  Many small businesses\r\n\r\nwant to convert, they want to use residential properties  for\r\n\r\ncommercial use, etc,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  they  ask  for flexibility in their land use,  with  good\r\n\r\nintention.  Because what they want is to be able to keep  the\r\n\r\ncosts  of  business  down.  But, inevitably,  there  will  be\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  neighbours.  It causes  disamenity  to  the\r\n\r\nestate.  It brings more traffic into the estate, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nSo  there  is always this constant tussle between  one  group\r\n\r\nwanting  one  thing and another group wanting  another.   One\r\n\r\ngroup  may  lobby strongly for conservation.   They  want  to\r\n\r\npreserve  the social memory of the place, they want to  leave\r\n\r\neverything untouched.  But the owners of the property may not\r\n\r\nbe  interested in conservation and preserving  memory.   What\r\n\r\nthey want is to be able to redevelop their land, to bring  in\r\n\r\nmore activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these examples go to show the dilemma that\r\n\r\nconfronts  URA  when we review the Master Plan, particularly,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  have  many diverse interests which are conflicting.\r\n\r\nAfter  considering all these views, URA must make a decision,\r\n\r\nand  this  decision  has  to strike a balance  between  these\r\n\r\ndiverse  views in as fair a manner as possible  and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, assure that the needs of competing land uses and,\r\n\r\nof   course,   the   national  interests   are   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I come to a point raised by Mr Iswaran on\r\n\r\nthe  question about identity, how do we preserve heritage and\r\n\r\nidentity,   how   do   we  choose,  how  would   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the process and what happens  after  we  have\r\n\r\nidentified  various areas.  Do we run the risk of  making  it\r\n\r\noverly  clinical,  rendering it devoid of  character,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran  mentioned just now?  I am pleased to inform both  Dr\r\n\r\nTeo  and Mr Iswaran that the new Master Plan 2003 will  place\r\n\r\nits  greater  emphasis  on the issues  of  identity  and  the\r\n\r\nquality of our living environment.  Let me elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, on the identity plan. Yes, I agree that,\r\n\r\nas  Singapore develops, as Singapore grows into a world-class\r\n\r\ncity,   we  need  to  establish  certain  things  which   are\r\n\r\ndistinctive and unique to Singapore, familiar places,  places\r\n\r\nwhich represent our shared identity and our social memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the Master Plan Review 2003, an island-wide identity plan is being prepared which will take stock of\r\n\r\nall  such  significant roads across the  island.   Guidelines\r\n\r\nwill  be proposed to reinforce the existing character so that\r\n\r\nwhoever  develops these areas must ensure that the  character\r\n\r\nof  these places is not inadvertently eroded.  Some of  these\r\n\r\nareas  naturally spring to mind: Anak Bukit is one  of  them,\r\n\r\nalong  Bukit Timah Road.  Those of you who are familiar  with\r\n\r\nAnak  Bukit will know that this is a place which is  rich  in\r\n\r\nlocal  identity  and significance.  It is  a  little  village\r\n\r\ncentre, a little kampong for people living in the Upper Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah area.  It has got a sizable cluster of shophouses.   It\r\n\r\nhas got many popular eating places, many retail shops.  It is\r\n\r\nalso a place where many of Singapore's older shopping centres\r\n\r\nare.  So URA is proposing to retain the character of the area\r\n\r\nby  retaining  the low-scale developments and  allowing  more\r\n\r\nspace for outdoor dining.  Hopefully, this will reinforce the\r\n\r\nliveliness of the area.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at similar plans for other areas, such as\r\n\r\nKatong, and Jalan Leban along Upper Thomson Road.  Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\nasked  how  do we choose such places.  Why not Taman  Serasi?\r\n\r\nWhy  not,  indeed?  If there are other places which can  lend\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  such  efforts, by  all  means  surface  them,\r\n\r\nbecause  the process does not start and stop with  URA.   The\r\n\r\nidentification of these places is not the end of  the  story.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is to be able to create more vibrancy, more buzz\r\n\r\nin these areas, while retaining their existing charm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, yes, I also agree with Mr Iswaran that we must be\r\n\r\nmindful  that we do not, as he put it, be too clinical  about\r\n\r\nit  such that we render these places devoid of character.  We\r\n\r\nwill  be  mindful that we do not overdo it, that we will  not\r\n\r\nover-plan,  and that we will not destroy the very essence  of\r\n\r\nthe place that we are trying to preserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also explain to the House what else we are doing,\r\n\r\nin terms of trying to enhance the quality of our environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere   is  a  Parks  and  Waterbodies  Plan  that  will   be\r\n\r\nincorporated as part of the Master Plan review, and  this  is\r\n\r\nnow being prepared, the idea being to make our existing parks\r\n\r\nmore  accessible  and  also to open up previously  unexplored\r\n\r\nareas  for recreational activities.  I remember Dr Teo making\r\n\r\nthis  point earlier about how inaccessible some of our  parks\r\n\r\nare.  That is a valid point.  To the extent possible, we will\r\n\r\ntry  to  open  up  more of our existing  parks  but,  equally\r\n\r\nimportantly, there is an opportunity for us now  to  open  up\r\n\r\npreviously  inaccessible  areas.  For  example,  the  Central\r\n\r\nCatchment  area.   One  proposal is to open  up  the  Central\r\n\r\nCatchment area by introducing more trails through the forests\r\n\r\nand  boardwalks along the waterfront.  There will  be  a  new\r\n\r\ncanopy  walk,  which  we constructed  to  offer  a  different\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the Central Catchment area.  Of  course,  all\r\n\r\nthese  plans  will  have  to be discussed  with  the  various\r\n\r\nrelevant  agencies,  to  make sure  that,  for  example,  the\r\n\r\nenvironment of the Central Catchment is protected,  in  order\r\n\r\nnot  to  compromise our water quality.  There will  be  other\r\n\r\nparks being planned.  Woodlands will see a new regional park.\r\n\r\nIn  Sengkang, along Sungei Ponggol, there will be a  riverine\r\n\r\npark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are trying to create different types of parks to\r\n\r\ncater  to  different interests and with different facilities.\r\n\r\nAs  these  plans  are intended to reflect  the  character  of\r\n\r\nplaces that are meaningful to our people, I assure Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\nthat  URA  will  consult  widely.  It  will  consult  a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum  of Singaporeans when we put together this  Identity\r\n\r\nPlan and the Parks and Waterbodies Plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April this year, URA has begun seeking inputs from\r\n\r\nadvisers  and  grassroots  leaders  in  preparing  the  draft\r\n\r\nproposals.   But, as we are well aware, such  things  can  be\r\n\r\nvery subjective.  Things like social memory and identity mean\r\n\r\ndifferent things to different people.  It has to depend  very\r\n\r\nmuch  on individual experiences.  So what we are going to  do\r\n\r\nis  to  prepare  the  draft plans and,  thereafter,  we  will\r\n\r\nexhibit these plans sometime towards the middle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  later part of this year, and people will be encouraged to\r\n\r\ncome  and visit these exhibitions and to give us their  views\r\n\r\nand  inputs.  This public feedback that is gathered will then\r\n\r\nbe  incorporated into a Draft Master Plan.  This Draft Master\r\n\r\nPlan  will then be exhibited, region by region, because as  I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier, these are rather detailed plans.   So  we\r\n\r\nare  going to exhibit them, region by region, probably in the\r\n\r\nfirst half of next year.  This is another opportunity for the\r\n\r\npublic  to  offer their views.  After all this is  done,  URA\r\n\r\nwill  finalise the Master Plan, and that will be towards  the\r\n\r\nend of next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can see, Sir, that this is a rather lengthy but\r\n\r\nimportant, worthwhile and necessary process because,  through\r\n\r\nthis process, I hope that the final plan can truly be a joint\r\n\r\nproject of the URA and its stakeholders.  By stakeholders,  I\r\n\r\nam  talking of course of Singaporeans, people who live,  work\r\n\r\nand play in these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the comments made by various Members\r\n\r\nabout  the property market and, particularly, about the  role\r\n\r\nof the Government in the property market.  Mr Inderjit Singh,\r\n\r\nin  particular, suggested that changes be made to  Government\r\n\r\npolicies in order to lower land and property costs, so as  to\r\n\r\nboost  our  economic competitiveness.  He said  that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has all the levers in place, it will be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontrol property prices.  Can the Government control property\r\n\r\nprices?  On the surface of it, the answer is yes.  One way is\r\n\r\nfor  us to flood the market with land, and prices will  react\r\n\r\nimmediately.  We may even bring property prices down by  30%,\r\n\r\nas suggested by Mr Inderjit Singh as being a desirable target\r\n\r\nto achieve.  However, as Mr Ong Kian Min rightly pointed out,\r\n\r\nis it going to stop there at 30%?  But that is another story.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the outcome of this, if we were to do\r\n\r\nthat,  assuming  we wanted to do that?  Some businesses  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  in  the short term from lower property  prices,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  not property owners currently will  rejoice.\r\n\r\nBut many existing land and property owners will face a sudden\r\n\r\ndrop in the value of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  assets,  with  serious  financial  consequences.    Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh, I think, acknowledges this.   But,  just  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  rough  idea  of  what I mean  by  serious  financial\r\n\r\nconsequences.    I   did   a   rough   back-of-the   envelope\r\n\r\ncalculation.  If we just take HDB flats, for example.   There\r\n\r\nare  800,000 flats and, very conservatively, we value it  at,\r\n\r\nsay,  about $200,000 per flat.  There are 3-room flats  which\r\n\r\nare about $150,000, 4-room flats, about $200,000-250,000, and\r\n\r\n5-room   flats,  $350,000.   But  if  I  just  take  a   very\r\n\r\nconservative $200,000 per flat, for 800,000 flats, a 30% drop\r\n\r\nin  prices means that we wipe out $48 billion worth of value!\r\n\r\nAnd that is not a laughing matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the end of the story. Because land is\r\n\r\nlimited  in  Singapore, no matter how much we  reclaim  land,\r\n\r\neven with all the current reclamation that we are planning to\r\n\r\ndo  and,  if possible technically, we can reclaim  even  more\r\n\r\nland. [Interruption.]  Even if we were to be able to do  that\r\n\r\nand  -  if Mr Low has any good ideas, he could let me know  - eventually,  our  limited land supply will mean  that  prices\r\n\r\nwill  start  moving up again as the supply is used  up.   And\r\n\r\nwhat  do we do then to bring down land prices, if indeed that\r\n\r\nis  the  key  to  our competitiveness?  Mr  Inderjit  Singh's\r\n\r\nsuggestion is a well-intentioned one.  His point is  that  if\r\n\r\nwe bring down land prices we will regain our competitiveness.\r\n\r\nBut I suggest to him that his medicine will probably kill the\r\n\r\npatient before he cures him.  Sir, we need to be mindful that\r\n\r\nwe  are  a  nation  of homeowners.  90% of  Singaporeans  own\r\n\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with Mr Ong that it is very important that we\r\n\r\nmaintain a stable property market in Singapore and, in  order\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  do  so,  we  need to have  a  right  balance  of\r\n\r\nGovernment measures to achieve this desirable objective.  The\r\n\r\nquestion then is: what are these measures?  What role can the\r\n\r\nGovernment play in the property market?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been very specific comments made by various\r\n\r\nMembers,  Dr  Amy Khor particularly, about the  GLS  and  the\r\n\r\nreserve  price, the use of the Reserve List,  etc.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to address some of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissues  now  when talking about what role the Government  can\r\n\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let us start from basics. What is the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  the  Government?  The  key  objective  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  surely  must be to sustain economic  growth.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, our land policy must be to make available  land\r\n\r\nfor  development through the Government Land Sales programme,\r\n\r\nsuch  that we are able to sustain economic growth and not  to\r\n\r\njust control property prices.  Dr Amy Khor asked how land  is\r\n\r\nsupplied  under  the  Government Land Sales  programme.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment Land Sales programme seeks to ensure that there is\r\n\r\na  steady supply of land to meet the demand for various parts\r\n\r\nof the economy, for various uses - commercial, industrial and\r\n\r\nresidential.  How do we determine the supply?  We  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  factors, such as household formation rate, potential\r\n\r\nsupply  in the pipeline, and the average take-up rate.   And,\r\n\r\nif  we  have  a  sufficient and steady supply of  land,  then\r\n\r\nprices will not escalate sharply, and the market will be more\r\n\r\nstable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all realise, there will be circumstances when the\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  have  to intervene.  These  are  exceptional\r\n\r\ncircumstances when there are abnormal trends in  the  market.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in the mid-90s, when speculation became  rife,\r\n\r\nthe  Government introduced anti-speculation measures in 1996,\r\n\r\nbecause we recognised that it is not healthy when speculation\r\n\r\ncauses  a  property bubble to build up.  After  the  property\r\n\r\nbubble was pricked, some of these measures were removed.  Why\r\n\r\nwere  they removed?  For the simple reason that there was  no\r\n\r\nlonger  any  evidence of property speculation and  there  was\r\n\r\nample  supply  in the market.  By releasing sufficient  land,\r\n\r\nand  by  intervening when necessary, the Government  aims  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  stable property market environment for businesses\r\n\r\nto   operate  in.   And  some  of  the  desirable   operating\r\n\r\nconditions for businesses are stability and predictability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we recognise that it is difficult to determine\r\n\r\ndemand accurately because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket  is  dynamic.  This is why we introduced  the  Reserve\r\n\r\nList  system last year, in order to enable the GLS  programme\r\n\r\nto  be more responsive to market demand, as Dr Amy Khor said.\r\n\r\nWith  this system, reserved sites will be released  for  land\r\n\r\nwhen developers apply for them.  So our GLS system allows the\r\n\r\nmarket  the flexibility to adjust the amount of supply  which\r\n\r\nit  can  readily absorb.  Dr Amy Khor did allude to the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  expand the Reserve List.   I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  she  meant  getting rid of the Confirmed  List.   We\r\n\r\nalready  have a substantial Reserve List, but we would  still\r\n\r\nlike  to  keep the Confirmed List, because it is not  just  a\r\n\r\nmatter of supplying land through the GLS programme.  The  GLS\r\n\r\nprogramme is also a tool for the Government to steer  private\r\n\r\ncapital to achieve certain specific development objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one example: the new Downtown. It is our\r\n\r\nintention  to  expand the existing Central Business  District\r\n\r\ninto the new Downtown area in Marina South.  In so doing,  we\r\n\r\nwant  to develop Singapore into a business and financial hub.\r\n\r\nWe  have put in a lot of infrastructure into the new Downtown\r\n\r\nto  support this expansion.  For example, the common services\r\n\r\ntunnel  has  been laid, the MRT is going in there,  and  many\r\n\r\nother  services are going in, in order to allow  us  to  move\r\n\r\ndevelopment into this area.  So, the Confirmed List will help\r\n\r\nus  to steer office development towards the new Downtown, and\r\n\r\nthat  will  align  it  with  our plans  for  a  business  and\r\n\r\nfinancial hub in the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to manage the overall supply through both\r\n\r\nthe Confirmed List and the Reserve List.  I do agree with  Dr\r\n\r\nKhor when she says that when we have allocations of land, eg,\r\n\r\nTurf  City  as well as the SLF land in Ang Mo Kio, we  should\r\n\r\ntake  these into account in our overall land supply.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure  her  that we do.  The  SLF  land  has  been\r\n\r\nallocated because the Government wants to redevelop  the  Ang\r\n\r\nMo  Kio Interchange area.  There is a lot of quantum which is\r\n\r\nbeing provided for the unions to use.  Whatever is left  over\r\n\r\nis being used by the private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector, but that quantum is minimal.  Even then, that quantum\r\n\r\nis  being adjusted and taken into account in the GLS.  So  we\r\n\r\nwill do this in order to make sure that the market knows  how\r\n\r\nmuch  land is available.  Giving you another example, we have\r\n\r\nindicated  that we are looking into the release  of  a  large\r\n\r\nsite for an integrated development at the new Downtown.   The\r\n\r\ndetails  are  still being worked out by the  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.   But  I can say that we will not be  implementing\r\n\r\nthe  project this year but when we do, again, the supply from\r\n\r\nthis development will be factored into the GLS programme.  It\r\n\r\nwill take into account the floor space that is generated from\r\n\r\nthis  integrated development.  We will, of course, also  make\r\n\r\nsure  when  the  project is implemented,  that  it  will  not\r\n\r\ndestabilise the property market.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the reserve price. Dr Khor\r\n\r\ncommented  that  the  GLS  does  not  give  us  an  idea   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's reserve price and that, to a certain extent, the\r\n\r\nreserve  price  system has caused prices to go  up.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  why we set a reserve price for our land  sales.   It\r\n\r\nagain goes back to the fundamental principle that State  land\r\n\r\nis  an  asset that belongs to the people.  As a custodian  of\r\n\r\nthe people's assets, the Government has the responsibility to\r\n\r\nensure that land is disposed of at its true market value  and\r\n\r\nthis means setting a reserve price to ensure that our land is\r\n\r\nnot sold off for a song.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But reserve prices are not cast in stone. They change\r\n\r\nwith  market conditions. So when the economy goes up,  prices\r\n\r\ngo  up,  and when the economy is not doing well, prices  come\r\n\r\ndown.   I think she is aware, for example, that when we  sold\r\n\r\ntwo  sites  in the new Downtown, one was sold in March  2001,\r\n\r\nthe  price was $3,100 per square metre of floor area.   Then,\r\n\r\njust earlier this week, we awarded the second site for $2,400\r\n\r\nper  square metre of floor area.  In other words, the  market\r\n\r\nrecognises  that  prices  have  come  down.   Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nreserve  price has also come down and this is the reason  why\r\n\r\nwe were able to award both these sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor also proposed that perhaps we should not have\r\n\r\njust  one  reserve price - we should have a  band.   This  is\r\n\r\nalready  being  done.  We recognise that the  Chief  Valuer's\r\n\r\nreserve price is not an absolute figure, it is not absolutely\r\n\r\nprecise.   This  is the reason why we have a  band.   If  the\r\n\r\ntender  price  is above 85% of the Chief Valuer's  price,  we\r\n\r\nwill  award the site.  This 15% band is considered to  be  an\r\n\r\nacceptable range by valuers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by assuring the House that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  fully  conscious  of  the  need  to  maintain\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic competitiveness.  We will make sure that\r\n\r\nthere  is sufficient land to meet the demand from all sectors\r\n\r\nof  our economy.  To ensure that we remain price competitive,\r\n\r\nwe  regularly  benchmark  our  property  values  and  rentals\r\n\r\nagainst other major cities.  Just to give you an example.  In\r\n\r\nthe case of commercial properties, there was a survey done in\r\n\r\nJanuary this year and Singapore ranked 31st amongst the major\r\n\r\nworld  cities in terms of cost of office space.   Our  office\r\n\r\nrentals were cheaper than several major Asian cities, such as\r\n\r\nTokyo,  Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing.  Admittedly,  we  were\r\n\r\nmore expensive than Shanghai, Delhi and KL.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore will never be as cheap as some other\r\n\r\ncountries which have a large land mass, and we cannot compete\r\n\r\non  property prices and those alone.  We have many  strategic\r\n\r\ncompetitive advantages. We have a stable political and social\r\n\r\nenvironment.  We  have a world-class business infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe   have   a   highly  trained  workforce  and   unsurpassed\r\n\r\nconnectivity to business opportunities regionally and beyond.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time, we have a Government that is responsive,\r\n\r\npro-business  and willing to change, whether it is  reviewing\r\n\r\nour  tax regime or attracting high value-added industries  or\r\n\r\nfacilitating   business  opportunities,  both   locally   and\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a lot going for us. It is not necessary to\r\n\r\ndeliberately  depress  the  true market  value  of  land  and\r\n\r\ndestabilise the property market and it is not in our interest\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, can I seek some clarification?\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister whether he is now  willing\r\n\r\nfor  a  speculation to once again take place in the  property\r\n\r\nmarket  since he says that it is no longer an issue  and  all\r\n\r\nthe  measures have been lifted, and whether he is willing  to\r\n\r\nwait for another bubble to build up before doing something to\r\n\r\nmoderate future prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, if and when such a development\r\n\r\ntakes place, the Government will act appropriately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, our present HDB housing policy is\r\n\r\ntoo rigid and lacks flexibility to promote family members  to\r\n\r\nstay  together.  The Registration for Flats System  does  not\r\n\r\ngive  home-buyers  much choice to select a  flat  near  their\r\n\r\nparents or siblings. The five-year minimum occupation  period\r\n\r\nprevents  home-owners to sell their new flats when they  need\r\n\r\nto  move  near  their  family members.  The  10-year  minimum\r\n\r\nqualifying period does not allow parents to upgrade and  stay\r\n\r\nwith  their children applying for new flats.  There are  many\r\n\r\nother  restrictions which do not facilitate families to  stay\r\n\r\nnear one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to review our housing policy to make them\r\n\r\nmore family-friendly.  If families were to be a pillar of our\r\n\r\nsociety,  we must facilitate Singaporeans to stay  within  or\r\n\r\nnear  their  family members. This will be  crucial  when  our\r\n\r\npopulation ages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What percentage of HDB dwellers is staying within\r\n\r\ntwo kilometres of their family members?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the long-term plan of HDB to facilitate\r\n\r\nfamilies to stay near one another?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will HDB provide more flexibility for families to\r\n\r\nconvert their flats to accommodate multi-tier family living?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, in view of concerns that\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans  are over-investing  in  housing  and  the\r\n\r\nalready\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh percentage of public home ownership, there is a need  to\r\n\r\nre-evaluate some aspects of our housing policy which may have\r\n\r\nbecome  less  relevant.  The increasing recognition  that  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial culture is needed for the new  economy  would\r\n\r\nalso  make  it desirable to separate the investment component\r\n\r\nof  home  ownership from the utility component of a  dwelling\r\n\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While home ownership helps to give a sense of\r\n\r\nrootedness,  asset enhancement policies, which emphasise  the\r\n\r\ninvestment   component  of  home  ownership,  may   encourage\r\n\r\nspeculation.   Put differently, why bother to work  hard  and\r\n\r\ntake  risk  in  business when one can potentially  make  more\r\n\r\nmoney  punting  on  properties, like punting  on  stocks  and\r\n\r\nshares?  This was a phenomenon we witnessed in the run-up  to\r\n\r\nthe  1996 boom when even HDB flat owners sold their flats  to\r\n\r\nunlock cash and then purchased another flat with CPF monies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to propose two specific\r\n\r\nrecommendations for the Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the role of HDB. The role of HDB needs to be\r\n\r\nreviewed.   Towards this end, I am pleased to note  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has already announced that it would be  undertaking\r\n\r\nthis.  I would thus like to urge the Ministry to undertake  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and thorough review of the role of the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB was created in the sixties with the noble aim of\r\n\r\nhousing the masses.  Indeed, it has more than fulfilled  this\r\n\r\nmission,  with  some 86% of the population living  in  public\r\n\r\nhousing.   Since its inception, its reach and influence  have\r\n\r\ngrown.  In fact, it has scope-crept from low cost housing  to\r\n\r\nmiddle income housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, building flats, particularly to house over 80%\r\n\r\nof  the  whole population, is exceedingly onerous  since  the\r\n\r\nHDB,  like  everybody else, can never perfectly forecast  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   There  are constant risks of the HDB over-building,\r\n\r\nsuch as the 17,500 unsold flats in non-mature estates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreported  at  the  beginning of the year, and under-building,\r\n\r\nsuch as in 1997 when the queue swelled to 146,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, HDB currently has a labyrinth of rules and\r\n\r\nregulations,  such  as  the single  scheme,  extended  family\r\n\r\nscheme, walk-in selection, BTO, resale levies, contra  rules,\r\n\r\nand  so  on  and  so  forth.  It would  probably  not  be  an\r\n\r\nexaggeration to say that the HDB rule book must be about  two\r\n\r\ninches  thick!  As at 2nd March 2001, the HDB has  more  than\r\n\r\n8,000 employees.  Such a large bureaucratic organisation  may\r\n\r\nnot  be ideally suited for the rapidly shifting economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial landscape.  Hence, it would be appropriate for HDB  to\r\n\r\nre-look at its role and streamline its operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HDB's role as a provider of affordable mass\r\n\r\nhousing remains relevant, it should perhaps shrink its target\r\n\r\nmarket at the higher end.  It could, for instance, sell  more\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominium sites as a step towards increasing  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of this housing type.  It can then  re-focus  its\r\n\r\nmission  and  efforts on low-income housing.  It  could  also\r\n\r\nextend the qualifying criteria for renting its flats so  that\r\n\r\nthe  needy  do  not  fall through the gaps.  To  redress  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   imbalance  of  over  investment  in   housing   and\r\n\r\ncomplaints  about high accommodation costs, it could  perhaps\r\n\r\nalso  look  at offering flats with shorter lease tenure,  not\r\n\r\nunlike the granny HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next recommendation, which is tenure\r\n\r\nchoice.   The tenure of public housing has an effect  on  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of the home as an investment.  The 99-year  standard\r\n\r\nhousing term, while giving security of tenure, encourages the\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  housing  as  an  investment  more  than  as  a\r\n\r\nconsumption good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of shorter tenure homes will provide\r\n\r\nmore  housing  choice  at  different  price  levels  to  suit\r\n\r\ndifferent  income  households. There are already  precedents.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, like I mentioned earlier, HDB's  granny  flats\r\n\r\nhave  a  15-year old tenure, renewable for another 15  years.\r\n\r\nElsewhere  in Hong Kong and China, 50 or 70-year  leases  for\r\n\r\nhousing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  common.   Hence, shorter tenure, especially  for  public\r\n\r\nhousing,  should be considered as an option to  increase  the\r\n\r\nhousing  choice  and  help  to decouple  the  investment  and\r\n\r\nconsumption function of housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  order  to understand the single persons'  need  for\r\n\r\nhousing,  I  have  carried out a survey  among  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens, professionals, and even Members of Parliament.  The\r\n\r\nresult of the survey is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.6% of those surveyed knew their girlfriends or\r\n\r\nboyfriends while they were schooling, 17.6% at the  place  of\r\n\r\nwork,  and 28% through introduction by friends and relatives.\r\n\r\nAs  to the ages at which they knew their partners, from  ages\r\n\r\n16  to  20:  16.5%, 20 to 30: 80.2%.   It would  appear  that\r\n\r\nbetween  the  ages of 16 and 30 is the best  time  for  young\r\n\r\npeople to get to know their future spouses.  As for those who\r\n\r\nare  still unattached after the age of 31, the vast  majority\r\n\r\nof  those  surveyed remarked that they were  too  preoccupied\r\n\r\nwith their work that they had no time to court or be courted.\r\n\r\nIn  the  process, they missed the boat - the  love-boat,  and\r\n\r\nhence have to remain single.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to create more opportunities for the\r\n\r\nsingle  persons to socialize, to fall in love and to  set  up\r\n\r\nfamilies,  I suggest that HDB work out a scheme whereby  each\r\n\r\nsingle person would be allowed to apply for a flat, say, a 3-room  or 4-room flat, and subsequently when two single  flat-owners get married, they would sell back one of the flats  to\r\n\r\nHDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single residents can also set up some social clubs\r\n\r\non  the  void deck, like the Residents' Committee Centre,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  young people could inter-mingle among  themselves,\r\n\r\nwith  the prospect of leading to future development,  thereby\r\n\r\nreducing  the number of singles in our society.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister would consider my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> I would also\r\n\r\nlike to ask about the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrole  of  the  HDB.  The HDB has done well  to  provide  good\r\n\r\nquality  homes to Singaporeans.  But I think there is  now  a\r\n\r\ndecrease in the demand of new purchase flats and also  rental\r\n\r\nflats.   In  fact,  in  the recent  offer  of  new  flats  in\r\n\r\nSengkang,  I  am told that there was a low take-up  rate.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve HDB is now scaling down its development of new flats,\r\n\r\nand  for  many of the projects, like Main Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\n(MUP) and Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP), I think a number\r\n\r\nof these projects have been farmed to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of these developments, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether he envisages a new  role  for  HDB  in\r\n\r\nproviding  housing to Singaporeans.  And, in this connection,\r\n\r\nif  the  HDB  is  to be downsized, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister for an assurance that the well-being of the  current\r\n\r\nHDB staff will be adequately looked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, affordability of HDB homes. I believe one of the\r\n\r\nmain reasons for the decrease in demand for HDB flats is  the\r\n\r\npricing  of the new flats.  Many are concerned that  the  new\r\n\r\nflats  are  moving  beyond  their affordability.   While  the\r\n\r\nproperty market is softening, the prices of new HDB flats are\r\n\r\nsteadily increasing.  So I would like to ask the Minister  to\r\n\r\nclarify  the pricing policy of the new HDB flats.   Sir,  not\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans are able to purchase their own flats and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister to ensure that the  HDB  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to provide sufficient rental housing, up to  3-room\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, the strong aspiration\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans towards home ownership and  the  increasing\r\n\r\nwealth  of many Singaporean families in land-scarce Singapore\r\n\r\nover the past few decades, have resulted in an escalation  of\r\n\r\nhome prices, in the view that the home is an investment whose\r\n\r\nvalue  will increase with time.  The Asian financial  crisis,\r\n\r\nfollowed  shortly  by  the  global economic  recession,  were\r\n\r\ninstrumental   in   making  many  Singaporeans   review   the\r\n\r\naspiration  to  buy new flats or upgrade their  homes.   With\r\n\r\nuncertainties  in the disposable income of families  and  the\r\n\r\ndownward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npressure  on  home  prices, queues for  public  housing  have\r\n\r\nvirtually  evaporated, and the visit to  the  Meet-the-People\r\n\r\nsessions  to  appeal  for early allocation  of  HDB  flat  is\r\n\r\nvirtually unheard of now.  Buying a public flat is no more an\r\n\r\ninvestment with guaranteed increase in the value of the flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highly illiquid nature of homes and the high\r\n\r\npercentage  of  home ownership present new problems.   In  an\r\n\r\neconomy  where  many have lost their jobs and are  unable  to\r\n\r\nservice  their  loans, the absence of a  pent-up  demand  for\r\n\r\npublic housing, and the presence of a glut in public housing,\r\n\r\npresents  an  opportune time for the housing policies  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.  There are a few areas I would wish the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, reviewing the role of HDB. HDB was created to\r\n\r\nmeet  the housing needs of Singapore during its early  years.\r\n\r\nIt  no  longer builds 1- or 2-room flats, but has now evolved\r\n\r\nto  build public flats, which are not too far in quality from\r\n\r\nthat  of  private flats.  This is most evident in  new  towns\r\n\r\nlike  Punggol  21.  With the queues for public  housing  fast\r\n\r\ndisappearing, and most Singapore families owning a home,  HDB\r\n\r\nhas  to  ask itself what is its role in this current economic\r\n\r\nand social milieu.  HDB should focus on becoming a regulatory\r\n\r\nbody, ensuring that the supply, standards, quality and design\r\n\r\nof public flats are both in keeping with the aspirations of a\r\n\r\nmodern  Singapore  family, and to accommodate  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nfamily  units which have become smaller.  It should focus  on\r\n\r\nproviding  affordable housing for those  who  need  it  most,\r\n\r\nincluding young and low income families.  It should  consider\r\n\r\nhiving most of the development and building of high-end flats\r\n\r\nto other entities or the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, making public housing more affordable. The\r\n\r\nboom  years  of  the mid-1990s, coupled with the  demand  for\r\n\r\nbigger and newer flats have resulted in the escalation of the\r\n\r\nprices  of public housing flats.  Families which have  placed\r\n\r\nbookings for flats find that the flat prices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  escalated by more than 50% by the time they  reach  the\r\n\r\nfront  of  the  queue, but their incomes have  not  increased\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly.   In  the  past  few  years,  the   battered\r\n\r\nSingapore economy has seen significant job layoffs.   It  has\r\n\r\nalso seen significant depreciation of flat prices.  Over  the\r\n\r\nlast  year, I have had many new flat owners coming to see  me\r\n\r\nbecause  they  were  unable to service their  housing  loans.\r\n\r\nMany  of these families have breadwinners who have lost their\r\n\r\njobs.   They  are in a quandary and are unable to sell  their\r\n\r\nflats because they have not met the 5-year occupation period.\r\n\r\nThey have difficulty meeting their mortgage payments, utility\r\n\r\nbills,  conservancy  charges,  and  even  school  fees.   The\r\n\r\nproblems of these families cannot be resolved so easily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for HDB to review its policy to make public\r\n\r\nhousing more affordable.  For many of these once proud  home-owners,  their  homes  have become a millstone  around  their\r\n\r\nnecks.   The  house  which has been their largest  asset  and\r\n\r\ntheir largest investment has now become their largest burden.\r\n\r\nTo  address this, HDB should consider making available  flats\r\n\r\nwith  a shorter tenure for these lower income families.   HDB\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps consider 30-year leases, with  an  option  to\r\n\r\nrenew  for  another 30 years, for lower income  families  and\r\n\r\nlower-middle  income families.  30 years would be  about  the\r\n\r\ntime  when  flats  might  be suitable for  consideration  for\r\n\r\nSelective  En-bloc  Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).   This  will\r\n\r\nmake the cost of housing much more affordable.  Replacing the\r\n\r\n99-year  old  tenure with a shorter tenure can  perhaps  help\r\n\r\nthese families retain their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB should also review its policy of not allowing owner-occupied flats to be sold in the open market within five\r\n\r\nyears.  Those who are in dire financial straits, and who  are\r\n\r\nunable to meet their mortgage payments, should be allowed  to\r\n\r\nsell  their  flats  in  the open market  and  be  allowed  an\r\n\r\nallocated rental flat upon sale of their flat.  Forcing  them\r\n\r\nto keep their flat will result in further default in mortgage\r\n\r\npayments  and repossession of the flat, which will  be  worse\r\n\r\noff  for  the family.  HDB will need to take a major paradigm\r\n\r\nshift to meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe challenges of the new economic and social environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, making housing available for singles. While we\r\n\r\nadvocate  marriage, there is an increasing number of  singles\r\n\r\nwho  are unmarried or who have divorced.  Not all of them can\r\n\r\nafford a private home.  While our policies are pro-family, we\r\n\r\ncannot  ignore  that  the  changing social  milieu  has  made\r\n\r\nsingles a significant minority in our population.  Given  the\r\n\r\nslack  demand for public flats, it is time for us to consider\r\n\r\nthe  needs of this group, many who are highly mobile and  are\r\n\r\nalso  important  contributors to  our  economy.   HDB  should\r\n\r\nconsider  making available smaller flat units for singles  to\r\n\r\nmeet this demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the rental market. HDB has a stringent policy\r\n\r\nfor rental flats.  HDB should review their rental flat policy\r\n\r\nto meet the needs of families who have lost their homes as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of financial reasons, or families which have  had  to\r\n\r\nsell  their  flat because of court ordered sale of  the  flat\r\n\r\nfollowing  a divorce.  For these categories, HDB  should  not\r\n\r\nput a time bar on them, as their public flat was not sold  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  profit, but because they have to do so.   We  should\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  while home ownership is  actively  promoted,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  some families who will be  better  off  with\r\n\r\nrental flats in the interim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no better time than now to review our public\r\n\r\nhousing  policy.  We must make bold changes.  I do  not  fear\r\n\r\nfor those who can buy private homes, but I worry for those on\r\n\r\nthe  lower end of the social ladder, who find that their once\r\n\r\nprized asset has now become their greatest burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, a review of the public housing\r\n\r\npolicy is timely and I think the Minister has announced  this\r\n\r\nrecently.   There  are many reasons for this.   I  think  key\r\n\r\namong  them  is,  first,  by  and large,  the  public  policy\r\n\r\nobjective  of  home  ownership has  been  achieved.   85%  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's   resident  population  are   in   HDB   estates.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  there are questions about whether we are  spending\r\n\r\ntoo much on housing.  A recent NUS study suggests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans spend about 37% of their household  income\r\n\r\non  property  and insurance, property tax and  other  related\r\n\r\nexpenses, compared to about 15% for the US and about 12%  for\r\n\r\nGermany.   This in turn has an impact on incentives  to  take\r\n\r\nrisks and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, we have been reminded by the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  on our funding constraints going forward, and  what\r\n\r\nwould be available in the way of money for building new flats\r\n\r\nand  upgrading existing flats.  So, that being the  case,  in\r\n\r\ngoing forward, clearly there are several issues that need  to\r\n\r\nbe dealt with and I would like to raise a few key points upon\r\n\r\nwhich  I hope the Minister would be able to give some insight\r\n\r\non the Ministry's thinking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is on whether we should decouple the role of the\r\n\r\ndeveloper from the role of the planner with the oversight  of\r\n\r\nthe   public  housing  market.   Both  these  functions   are\r\n\r\nencompassed within the HDB today, and there is some merit  to\r\n\r\nthe argument that this should be separated.  A Public Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority, for example, could be established which would have\r\n\r\noversight  on  issues such as supply, demand, price,  quality\r\n\r\nand other policy objectives, which might emanate from time to\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is whether we could create a\r\n\r\ncompetitive market for public housing development.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, the Public Housing Authority could create a tender  or\r\n\r\na  bidding  system, where parcels of land are opened  up  for\r\n\r\nvarious  developers, private or public, to then bid in  order\r\n\r\nto develop certain types of housing.  The nature of the flats\r\n\r\nand the type of mix to be offered can all be specified in the\r\n\r\nprocess of inviting the bids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, is whether we can retain HDB as a core\r\n\r\ndeveloper,  a developer who can focus on certain  aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe  housing  range, perhaps at the lower end  certainly,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  rental and in terms of 3-room flats, perhaps,  but\r\n\r\nalso  because  we want to harness HDB's vast experience  over\r\n\r\nthe  years  as  a developer.  And we want to make  sure  that\r\n\r\nthere is a certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquality  assurance and price stability in  the  market.   One\r\n\r\ncould  draw  an  analogy, say, with the cooperatives  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of grocery business, and so on.  So I think we  need\r\n\r\nto   seriously  consider  retaining  HDB's  role  as  a  core\r\n\r\ndeveloper in any revised public housing market going forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this score, in relation to a subsequent cut I\r\n\r\nhave,  I just want to make one important point, echoing  what\r\n\r\nMr  Othman Haron Eusofe has said.  I am an Advisor to the HDB\r\n\r\nStaff  Union and I have received feedback that the staff  are\r\n\r\nquite  concerned,  largely because of uncertainty  about  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of HDB's role, and then, of course, on the impact  it\r\n\r\nwill  have  on their own livelihood.  I think it is important\r\n\r\nthat  we address the issue reasonably fast, and we give  them\r\n\r\nsome  level  of assurance on, first the future of HDB's  role\r\n\r\nand,  at  the  same  time,  on  how  their  welfare  will  be\r\n\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, whether we could move away from subsidies to\r\n\r\nthe  developer,  in this case, HDB, towards  a  voucher-based\r\n\r\nsystem in our public housing.  Once we have got a competitive\r\n\r\npublic  housing  market, where various  developers  might  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the process of building and offering new  units,\r\n\r\nthen   perhaps  what  we  ought  to  be  doing  is   offering\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  vouchers which they can then  use  in  deciding\r\n\r\nwhich  houses  they  want to buy, done by  which  developers.\r\n\r\nThat  would also give important feedback, it seems to me,  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry on the quality and type of housing Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that in bringing up these points, there is a\r\n\r\nrisk of being somewhat simplistic about a very complex issue.\r\n\r\nBut  I  have a healthy regard for the calibre of the Minister\r\n\r\nand his team, and I know this is a matter that has been under\r\n\r\nheavy  discussion in the Ministry for quite some time  and  I\r\n\r\nwould appreciate some clarity on the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah:</b> I would like to ask the Minister if\r\n\r\nthe Ministry would consider a review on housing policy, vis-a-vis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsingles.   At  the present time, of course, one  cannot  rent\r\n\r\nunless it is under the Joint Singles Scheme, which means that\r\n\r\nthey must find somebody as a partner, and also be over 35.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, singles cannot purchase unless they are 35 and\r\n\r\nabove, and this is for resale flats.  This policy ignores the\r\n\r\nchanging demographics, and therefore the changing aspirations\r\n\r\nin  our  society and, in some cases, actually causes hardship\r\n\r\nwhere there is genuine need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Lim Boon Heng did mention that there may be\r\n\r\nover-housing in Singapore.  That may be true in  some  cases,\r\n\r\nand  there  may also be cases where people buy for investment\r\n\r\nor  speculation.  But there are other cases where there is  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  need  for housing for singles.  Let me give  Members\r\n\r\nthree examples which I have encountered in my MPS cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a man, over 50, with a low level of\r\n\r\neducation, primary education, I think, and he cannot  find  a\r\n\r\nplace to live.  He needs a place to live but he does not have\r\n\r\na  family and so he needs to have a flat.  He cannot just  go\r\n\r\ninto  the  street and ask some man or woman to come and  live\r\n\r\nwith  him.  Not everybody needs a house as well, but he needs\r\n\r\none.   So he is in a very difficult position.  I have written\r\n\r\non his behalf and I hope something would come out of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second case is a woman, who has been divorced. Her\r\n\r\nmother  is dead, the father would not let her back  into  the\r\n\r\nhouse  because he did not approve of the marriage.  She earns\r\n\r\nsomething  between $700-800.  She cannot go and  get  private\r\n\r\nhousing.  Where is she to go?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third case, unmarried mother, primary 6 education. She\r\n\r\nis  estranged from the family.  Mother is also dead,  and  we\r\n\r\nbegin  to  wonder, after a while, whether there is  a  common\r\n\r\nelement  here, about not being let back into the family  home\r\n\r\nwhere the mother is not there.  The father would not let  her\r\n\r\ncome back because he does not approve of the fact that she is\r\n\r\nan  unmarried  mother.  She is estranged from  her  siblings.\r\n\r\nShe needs to look after her\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nson.   Where is she to go?  Where is she to live?  She cannot\r\n\r\nafford private housing either.  She has been told by the  HDB\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  another policy which is because  she  is  an\r\n\r\nunmarried  mother,  she  cannot  get  a  flat.   And  it   is\r\n\r\ndifficult.  We say we want to be a gracious society,  but  to\r\n\r\nbe a gracious society, sometimes we have to show grace.  So I\r\n\r\nanticipate  the  answer from the Minister will  be  that  for\r\n\r\nexceptional  cases, we can always write in for  a  waiver  of\r\n\r\npolicy.   Well,  my colleagues in this House know  all  about\r\n\r\nwaivers  of policy.  The Minister will forgive me  if  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  sometimes, I think, with a certain lack of originality,\r\n\r\nit is easier for the camel to pass an eye of a needle than to\r\n\r\nget a waiver of policy.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us go back to the issue of policy itself. Why\r\n\r\nthis  policy?   The Minister will say that it  is  subsidised\r\n\r\nhousing,  we must be careful because it is taxpayers'  money.\r\n\r\nI  understand that.  But the singles will also say that  they\r\n\r\npay  taxes  too.  So they are not quite sure why they  cannot\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  this.  If the second reason  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to  get  married,  then the policy  is  not  working.\r\n\r\nBecause  the number of singles is growing and the birth  rate\r\n\r\nis  falling.   If  the objective of the  policy  is  to  give\r\n\r\npriority to married couples, then, no problem.  By all  means\r\n\r\ngive them priority because a family unit would have a greater\r\n\r\nneed.  But then we have a surplus of housing.  So the singles\r\n\r\ndo  not  understand why, because there is a surplus but  they\r\n\r\nstill cannot get their hands on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are rental flats. Because not all married\r\n\r\ncouples  want rental flats, there are obviously rental  flats\r\n\r\navailable.   But  when you apply for it,  you  run  into  the\r\n\r\npolicy, and so you cannot have your rental flat.  In truth, I\r\n\r\ndo not blame the civil servants or those in HDB because their\r\n\r\nhands are tied by the rope of policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I will only take another 30 seconds. We\r\n\r\ncome  back to the original thinking of the need for  housing,\r\n\r\nthe  raison  d'etre  for the HDB, which  is  that  we  wanted\r\n\r\nhousing so that Singaporeans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  have a stake in Singapore.  The singles think or  feel\r\n\r\nthat they are Singaporeans.  They too are entitled to a stake\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and they do not understand why they  should  be\r\n\r\ndiscriminated against.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would just ask for a review on allowing rentals\r\n\r\nfor  people above the age of 21 and perhaps reviewing the age\r\n\r\nat  which  they  can  purchase HDB  flats  and  consider  the\r\n\r\nquestion of subsidised housing for singles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia is not moving. Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\nis also not moving.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, as of end March\r\n\r\nthis year, I learn that 19,400 households have not paid their\r\n\r\nHDB  mortgage loans for three years or more.  Two years  ago,\r\n\r\nthere were some 12,800 households having this problem.  Also,\r\n\r\nI  learn  that there were 18,200 Singaporeans who applied  to\r\n\r\nHDB  for financial assistance.  My question is: is this trend\r\n\r\na  result of the pricing of our HDB flats, ie, pricing it too\r\n\r\nhigh?   As  brought up by Mr Othman and Dr Michael Lim,  they\r\n\r\nalso suggested that the pricing of new HDB flats is extremely\r\n\r\nhigh.   Of  course, they can always blame it on  the  current\r\n\r\ndownturn  as a cause for not paying their mortgages,  but  it\r\n\r\ncould  be both.  Or is it because these flat dwellers  bought\r\n\r\nbigger flats than they required during the good years, hoping\r\n\r\nto  cash in on profits should they decide to sell and are now\r\n\r\ncaught in this property downturn?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those who are having their mortgage problems,\r\n\r\nis downgrading a problem?  As HDB has stopped building 3-room\r\n\r\nflats,  will this restrict their choice to only 4-room flats,\r\n\r\nwhich may still not be affordable to them?  Does the Minister\r\n\r\nsee  a return to building no-frills 3-room or even 2-room HDB\r\n\r\nflats  in  the  future,  to make sure  such  flats  are  more\r\n\r\naffordable for those who are downgrading and for those  cases\r\n\r\nbrought up by Ms Indranee in her speech just now?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim has also touched on rental flats as\r\n\r\nanother  option for those downgrading.  So I would not  dwell\r\n\r\non it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nsurplus  of  16,900 flats, I commend the Ministry  in  taking\r\n\r\nfirm  and  decisive action in introducing the  build-to-order\r\n\r\nprogramme,  that is, to build based on a certain demand,  and\r\n\r\nalso  taking  the  opportunity to  review  HDB's  role.   The\r\n\r\nsurplus is due to the mismatch of supply and demand of flats.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Ministry also take the opportunity to review  its\r\n\r\nmachinery to assess the future demand of flats and see how it\r\n\r\ncould  promptly  respond to changes in the demand  of  flats,\r\n\r\nalthough it is difficult to determine the demand in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe dynamic market situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past trends have indicated a slowness in the\r\n\r\nmachinery in HDB in detecting the future demand of flats, for\r\n\r\nexample,  the large number of surplus of 5-room and Executive\r\n\r\nflats, and the slow response in cutting back the construction\r\n\r\nof  flats, in view of the low numbers in the registration  of\r\n\r\nflats.   The  cutting back of the tender award  of  flats  to\r\n\r\n11,000 was only done in FY 2000/2001 when the registration of\r\n\r\nflats  had  already  dipped sharply in FY  1997/1998  and  FY\r\n\r\n1998/1999, ie, from 67,000 to 24,800, to 7,160.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Ministry is reviewing its role of HDB in the\r\n\r\nsupply  of flats, I would like to urge the Ministry to retain\r\n\r\nthe two primary pillars in the supply of HDB flats, which  is\r\n\r\nmainly  for  the lower and middle-income families.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  assure  the  people that it  will  still  have  the\r\n\r\ncapacity to meet the possible upsurge in demand of flats  and\r\n\r\ngive  a  definite acceptable time period from application  to\r\n\r\ngetting  the keys?  Over the history of HDB's application  of\r\n\r\nflats,   this   stated  period  is  a  roller-coaster   ride.\r\n\r\nSometimes  it is two years, three years, or even  five  years\r\n\r\nduring the peak demand in 1994.  Can the Ministry also assure\r\n\r\nthe people to continue to give good and affordable quality of\r\n\r\nflats to meet the aspirations of our people?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the Ministry ensure that the design-and-build\r\n\r\nflats achieve the design or buildability and have well-chosen\r\n\r\nbuilding  materials  and features and fittings  to  ensure  a\r\n\r\nlower cost of construction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  also  subsequent maintenance?  This is important  as  it\r\n\r\nwould lead to lower affordable flats for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is on spalling concrete of HDB flats. In\r\n\r\nAugust  1995 and July 1998, there was a three-year  programme\r\n\r\nwhere HDB assisted a total of 17,600 households in the repair\r\n\r\nof  spalling concrete of flats.  This constitutes only 2%  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  flats that we have now.  There are about  900,000\r\n\r\nflats  presently, half of which, 450,000, are about 20 years'\r\n\r\nold.  There is a large number of demand now for the programme\r\n\r\nto  be  reactivated.  Can the Ministry again reactivate  this\r\n\r\nprogramme  for all the flat lessees so as to assist  them  in\r\n\r\nthe  repair  of  spalling concrete, especially  families  who\r\n\r\ncould not afford it would have the danger of falling concrete\r\n\r\nover  their  heads?  It could end up as a quiet home  killer.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is  not possible as a separate programme,  can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider including this work under the IUP,  as  it\r\n\r\nwould  target  the  older flats where  the  concrete  quality\r\n\r\nspecification is poorer when the flats were built?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, because of the\r\n\r\neconomic downturn, the number of purchases of resale flats in\r\n\r\nthe  open market  has reduced significantly.  During my meet-the-people  sessions, some residents told me  that  they  had\r\n\r\napplied   for  new  4-room  or  5-room  flats,   to   upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Now that they were allotted the flats  they  had\r\n\r\napplied  for,  they  were  unable to  get  buyers  for  their\r\n\r\nexisting  flats.  They are now having difficulty raising  the\r\n\r\ncash  required to meet the 20% downpayment. Many of them  had\r\n\r\nto cancel their applications for the new flats which they had\r\n\r\nbeen waiting anxiously for the last few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, HDB introduced a buy-back scheme for 3-room\r\n\r\nflats. This was extremely helpful to the upgraders.  The  HDB\r\n\r\ncan also sell these 3-room flats to the other people who want\r\n\r\nto  downgrade,  particularly to those affected  by  the  SERS\r\n\r\nscheme.   This  was  a good policy, but it was  unfortunately\r\n\r\nterminated  in  the  year 2000.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  HDB  would reconsider  the  flat  buy-back\r\n\r\nscheme in view of the present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Mah, you have got less than 20 minutes\r\n\r\nbefore \"guillotine\" time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I do not think I would be able to\r\n\r\ncover all the points in 20 minutes.  So I will take the  main\r\n\r\nones first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, first of all, touch on the review of public\r\n\r\nhousing  which has been a concern of many Members who  spoke.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all, I would like to reiterate that home ownership\r\n\r\nis  the  cornerstone of our public housing policy.   HDB  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the principal agency responsible for implementing  this\r\n\r\npolicy.   The result has been quite remarkable, if  you  take\r\n\r\nthe 40 years of the history of HDB.  In 1960, for example, 9%\r\n\r\nof  the  population lived in public housing.  Today,  86%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are HDB dwellers.  So, from a time when  we  had\r\n\r\n9%  or 10% of Singaporeans living in HDB flats, today we have\r\n\r\na  situation  which  is  a  reverse  where  actually  10%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do not live in HDB housing.  Of those  who  live\r\n\r\nin  HDB  houses, 96% own their own flats.  Sir,  this  is  an\r\n\r\nachievement  that is unmatched in any other country,  whether\r\n\r\nyou are talking of a developed or a developing country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have met our objective of providing\r\n\r\naffordable housing for the vast majority of Singaporeans,  as\r\n\r\nmany  Members  have pointed out, it is now  time  for  us  to\r\n\r\nreview  the future direction of public housing and  also  the\r\n\r\nrole  that  HDB should play in the future.  When  we  do  the\r\n\r\nreview,  we will have to have certain fundamentals  in  mind.\r\n\r\nAnd  two  basic considerations will guide us in this  review.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we  will have to be more responsive to the  housing\r\n\r\nneeds  and aspirations of a new generation of Singaporeans  - more  discerning,  better educated.   Secondly,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nutilise our limited financial resources wisely and prudently,\r\n\r\nso that we can meet these future challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Iswaran pointed out just now, this is something\r\n\r\nthat  is  going to become more and more critical because  the\r\n\r\nphysical  needs of Singapore in the years ahead are going  to\r\n\r\nbecome much more demanding.  Our population is aging;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nglobal  economic competition is increasing.  So  we  have  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  what  is the right balance between expenditure  on\r\n\r\nhousing and expenditure on health care, education, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress at the outset that the Government is\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  providing affordable  public  housing  to  the\r\n\r\nmasses.   I  think that is something that we  will  not  lose\r\n\r\nsight  of.   More new households are being formed each  year,\r\n\r\nnot  all of them can afford private housing, as Dr Tan  Cheng\r\n\r\nBock  pointed  out.  We also need to ensure  that  low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies continue to have access to housing.  By this,  I  am\r\n\r\ntalking about rental housing as well as sold housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I elaborate on the review, let me address some of\r\n\r\nthe comments that have been made by Members about our current\r\n\r\nstock of unsold HDB flats.  HDB started selling its stock  of\r\n\r\n17,000  flats  in the non-mature estates since  January  this\r\n\r\nyear, first of all, to the 11,000 applicants who were in  the\r\n\r\nRegistration  of  Flats  System (RFS)  queue,  which  is  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  queuing system, and then subsequently to members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  through the walk-in selection system.   To-date,\r\n\r\nHDB  has sold more than 5,000 flats, and I expect that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more flats that will be taken up in the  months  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current overhang is a temporary phenomenon. We\r\n\r\nshould  not try to, because there is an overhang, change  our\r\n\r\nrules in order to generate artificial demand for these flats,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  through the buying back of more  3-room  flats\r\n\r\nfrom the open market, as Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested just now,\r\n\r\nin order to help the flat owners to upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened, as a result of the overhang, is\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  highlighted the need  for  us  to  review  our\r\n\r\nallocation  system, particularly, the Registration  of  Flats\r\n\r\nSystem  (RFS).  This system, called the queueing system,  has\r\n\r\nworked well, especially when the demand is high.  It provides\r\n\r\napplicants  with  greater  certainty,  as  Mdm  Cynthia  Phua\r\n\r\nmentioned just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow, you know exactly when you get your flat.  It may not  be\r\n\r\nas  fast  as you would like it, two years, three years,  four\r\n\r\nyears,  even five years.  But it does provide some  certainty\r\n\r\nwhen  you  apply.  But it is not sufficiently  responsive  to\r\n\r\nsudden  changes  in  demand.  For  example,  when  the  Asian\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis broke out in 1997, followed by the  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown  in the last few years, many people dropped  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  queue.   The queue was 146,000 in 1997.  It  dropped  to\r\n\r\n8,800 recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB planned its building programme based on this queue.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of this, despite the reduction in the  building\r\n\r\nprogramme, since 1998, the unsold stocks continued  to  build\r\n\r\nup  because of the contracts that were already tendered.   Of\r\n\r\nthe  8,800 applicants, some 3,300 have been in the queue  for\r\n\r\nfive  years or more,  majority of them are upgraders and they\r\n\r\nhave  many opportunities to select a flat.  But, I guess,  as\r\n\r\nto  be  expected, because there is a lot of choice, the  more\r\n\r\nchoices  you  have,  the more choosy you  become.   And  many\r\n\r\npeople, when they are given many flats to choose from, decide\r\n\r\nnot to select any.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I received a complaint from an applicant who\r\n\r\nwas  on  the queue.  He was asked to select a 5-room flat  in\r\n\r\nPunggol.  He decided that none of the 700 flats that were  on\r\n\r\noffer to him was suitable for him.  700 flats, none suitable.\r\n\r\nBecause  he wanted one on the higher floor.  So he  said,  \"I\r\n\r\ndon't have a flat available that I like, I would like to  get\r\n\r\nmy  registration  fees back.  If in three months'  time,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  allocate me a suitable flat, I want a  refund.\"   But\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  the  end of the story.  More interesting  part\r\n\r\ncomes  now.  He said that we should accord him a  flat  on  a\r\n\r\npriority  basis, priority over other Singaporeans because  he\r\n\r\ntravels frequently overseas on business and, therefore, since\r\n\r\nhe  is a cosmopolitan Singaporean, HDB should favour him over\r\n\r\nothers.  I guess he thinks he is doing a national service for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just give you this example to illustrate how choosy\r\n\r\npeople can become.  It is quite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstandable.  If you are talking about choosing your dream\r\n\r\nhome, you can be a little bit choosy.  But I think we have to\r\n\r\nbear   in  mind  that  public  housing  is  subsidised,   and\r\n\r\nsubsidised housing has enabled Singaporeans to own their  own\r\n\r\nhomes  and for Singapore to be a home-owning nation.  But  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  ask  ourselves how far the Government  can  go  and\r\n\r\nshould go in trying to meet such demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to review our allocation policies, as Mdm\r\n\r\nCynthia  Phua  suggested, and how we assess  the  demand  for\r\n\r\nflats.   Last  year, as Members will recall, HDB piloted  the\r\n\r\nBuild-To-Order (BTO) system to better tailor  supply  to  the\r\n\r\npreference of the applicants and also to better manage change\r\n\r\nin  demand.   Under  this system, applicants  indicate  their\r\n\r\npreference  for  certain sites which HDB is  launching.   HDB\r\n\r\nwill  then call tenders for construction but only when  there\r\n\r\nare sufficient applicants for the flats.  In other words,  if\r\n\r\nthe  number of people who want to book these flats reaches  a\r\n\r\ncertain threshold, then HDB will let out the tenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot project was successful. Of the four contracts\r\n\r\noffered, one was dropped because there was poor demand, so we\r\n\r\ndid not build.  And 92% of the flats in the other three sites\r\n\r\nwere  taken up.  So we proceeded with the other three  sites.\r\n\r\nWe dropped one site and we proceeded with three sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the current supply-demand situation for\r\n\r\nHDB  flats,  we  have decided to suspend the RFS  system  and\r\n\r\nswitch  over  to  a  BTO system from next year,  2003.   With\r\n\r\nimmediate  effect, HDB will stop accepting  new  applications\r\n\r\nunder the RFS. And those who are on the queue now can opt for\r\n\r\na  flat  under the Walk-in Selection System, or the balloting\r\n\r\nexercise for flats in mature estates.  He will also be  given\r\n\r\none  more  chance to select the remaining unsold  flats  that\r\n\r\nhave  not  yet  been  released under  the  Walk-in  Selection\r\n\r\nSystem, in other words, before these flats are offered to the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is demand for 4-room flats in certain areas,\r\n\r\nHDB will offer about 1,300\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4-room flats in Punggol and Sengkang in the fourth quarter of\r\n\r\nthis  year under the BTO system.  Applicants of the RFS queue\r\n\r\ncan  choose  to participate in this offer and  they  will  be\r\n\r\nshortlisted, according to their queue position.   After  this\r\n\r\noffer,  the  queue  will  be expunged.   Those  who  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested  in  any  of the offers, or who  are  successfully\r\n\r\nshortlisted, will have their fees refunded.  HDB will release\r\n\r\nmore details in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans who are not on the queue now and who\r\n\r\nwould  like  to purchase a flat, they have got  quite  a  few\r\n\r\nchoices.   These options include applying under  the  Walk-in\r\n\r\nSelection Scheme, or the regular balloting exercises, or they\r\n\r\ncan  wait  for  new  contracts to be offered  under  the  BTO\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  of course they can also opt for  resale  flats.\r\n\r\nHDB  will  continue to monitor the sale of  flats  under  the\r\n\r\nvarious  modes of sale before deciding if it should start  to\r\n\r\nbuild  any  new flats in 2003 and, if so, how  many  of  such\r\n\r\nflats to build.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now take the questions raised on rising\r\n\r\nprices  of HDB flats and the related issues of affordability.\r\n\r\nI  believe this was raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Mr  Iswaran,\r\n\r\nDr Michael Lim, Encik Othman Haron Eusofe and several others.\r\n\r\nLet  me, first of all, reiterate that affordability has  been\r\n\r\nand will always continue to be a primary consideration in the\r\n\r\npricing  of new HDB flats.  We have publicly stated that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  price  new  HDB  flats  such  that  90%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can afford at least a 3-room flat  and  70%  can\r\n\r\nafford at least a 4-room flat.  In other words, when we  talk\r\n\r\nabout  affordability,  this means that the  maximum  mortgage\r\n\r\ninstalments that a family has to pay to buy either  a  3-room\r\n\r\nor a 4-room flat will not exceed 40% of its monthly household\r\n\r\nincome.   This  is  the  guideline that  HDB  uses  which,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  is  a prudential norm which is also used  by  other\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  But in actual fact, even though we use the 40%\r\n\r\nrule as the norm, in reality, most buyers of our flats today,\r\n\r\nthe  4-room and 5-room flats, do not use more than 25-26%  of\r\n\r\ntheir  household  income.  So it is not 40%,  but  25-26%  of\r\n\r\ntheir  household income.  In other words, they are well  able\r\n\r\nto service their mortgage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstalments  just using their CPF alone because  the  current\r\n\r\nCPF  rules  allow them to use up to 26% of their salaries  on\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last year, for the typical 4-room and 5-room\r\n\r\napplicants,  they  needed  to use only  about  15%  of  their\r\n\r\nhousehold  incomes for the monthly mortgage instalments.   So\r\n\r\nMembers  will realise that, in terms of the price  that  they\r\n\r\npay  for  their flats and in terms of the ability to  service\r\n\r\ntheir  mortgage, it is well within their means.  And this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  we  mean  by  pricing HDB flats  to  be  affordable  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when we are talking about pricing, we also\r\n\r\nhave  to  take  into  account certain  micro  features,  like\r\n\r\nindividual attributes of the flats, facing, floor level,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  We also take into account one very important aspect,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the resale flat prices.  And finally, we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake into account the potential impact of new flat prices  on\r\n\r\nthe HDB resale market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take you back to the time when property prices\r\n\r\nshot  up in the mid-90s as a result of excessive speculation,\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Inderjit Singh pointed out just now.   When  property\r\n\r\nprices shot up in the mid-90s, HDB new flat prices lagged the\r\n\r\nmarket,  in  other words, it increased more slowly  than  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   Between 1992 and 1996, resale flat prices  tripled,\r\n\r\nwent  up  by more than 200%, while new flat prices  increased\r\n\r\nless  than 50%.  While the resale prices were going  up  like\r\n\r\nthat,  the  HDB increased its new flat prices by  much  less.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Because it wanted to ensure that flat prices would  not\r\n\r\nrise beyond the reach of the people, to keep them affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, now that the property market has\r\n\r\nsoftened,  HDB prices are also being adjusted downwards,  but\r\n\r\nmore  slowly than the market.  If you go back to the peak  in\r\n\r\n1996,  and you compare with today, resale prices have  fallen\r\n\r\nby  about  30%,  but  new  flat  prices  have  been  adjusted\r\n\r\ndownwards, on an average by about 10-15%.  So prices  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  are coming down, they are not increasing, as Mr Othman\r\n\r\nsuggested just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to pricing of HDB flats has served us well\r\n\r\nso  far  because, in the process, we have helped to stabilise\r\n\r\nthe  property market and we have helped to preserve the value\r\n\r\nof  the assets of the majority of Singaporeans.  But, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmust admit that this policy and this approach does not please\r\n\r\neverybody because those who have not yet bought a flat,  they\r\n\r\nwant us to reduce prices even further, even faster.  You have\r\n\r\nsuch  a big overhang, why do you not slash prices and have  a\r\n\r\ncheap  sale, lelong.  That is for those who have  not  bought\r\n\r\nthe  flats.   But  those who have already  bought  the  flats\r\n\r\nearlier were extremely unhappy when we reduced prices.   They\r\n\r\nstart  to compare the prices that their neighbours have  just\r\n\r\npaid  with what they paid.  Then, they go and approach  their\r\n\r\nMPs to ask HDB for a refund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tried to explain why we have to raise prices\r\n\r\nwhen the market goes up, but not as fast, and why we have  to\r\n\r\nlower  prices  when the market comes down, but again  not  as\r\n\r\nfast.   In  the process, I suppose somebody would be  unhappy\r\n\r\nwith  this  policy.  But it has served us well  and  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue with this policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Mah, do you like me to end the lelong?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, this is a good point for us to\r\n\r\nstop  because I will touch on the other issues  later  on  on\r\n\r\nMonday, with your permission.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
