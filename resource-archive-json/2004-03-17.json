FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Means Testing</i><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</B>:<B>&nbsp;</B> Sir, the Government has proposed the introduction of means testing in healthcare services.&nbsp; I agree that with the given limited resources, we must refine our subsidy system to ensure that those who need it most will get it.&nbsp; I believe means testing is a workable service.&nbsp; However, the Ministry has not provided sufficient details on the proposed system.&nbsp; It is a bit like watching a mystery movie - you are kept in suspense until the end.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans are confused and concerned.&nbsp; For example, they do not know who will be affected by the change and whether they are in the low income group that will benefit from it, or they are in the high income group that will have to pay more in time to come.&nbsp; They also do not know how much more they have to pay.&nbsp; Sir, this known/unknown is very unsettling, and I hope the Ministry can disclose more details as soon as they are available.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have received feedback from some of my residents.&nbsp; They think that the Ministry is using this means testing to reduce the overall Government subsidy because of the budget deficit.&nbsp; I think the Ministry should clarify its intention so that there will be no misunderstanding.&nbsp; In working out the details of the means testing, I would like to urge the Ministry to define the qualifying criteria clearly.&nbsp; Income should not be the only factor.&nbsp; Family obligations, such as handicapped family members, mortgage obligations, etc, should also be factored in.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, we should adopt a tiered system.&nbsp; I would suggest the Ministry studies similar systems implemented in other countries so that we can develop a comprehensive, fair and transparent system.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry will also leave room for some flexibility to cater for exceptional cases.&nbsp; In the introduction of means testing, the higher income group must expect lower <p align=left>Column: 2136<p>subsidies.&nbsp; It would, therefore, be crucial that they be covered by some form of healthcare insurance.&nbsp; Therefore, it would be timely to review the MediShield scheme for this purpose.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, communication is vital.&nbsp; I would urge the Ministry to conduct extensive public consultation so that the final scheme would take into account feedback from all segments of the population.&nbsp; The Ministry must also take pains to explain the scheme to the people to ensure acceptance.&nbsp; In this regard, I am sure grassroots leaders and MPs like us would be more than happy to help.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, means testing is a means of trying to reduce the subsidy to those who are more able to afford healthcare services.&nbsp; However, knowing how the healthcare system works, I really have very bad vibes about means testing for healthcare services at an acute general hospital.&nbsp; I will give you&nbsp;10 good reasons why we have to think very carefully before considering implementing means testing.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Penalising those who pay the most taxes by increasing their healthcare cost sends the wrong signals.&nbsp; This is not about giving tens of dollars in S&amp;C rebates per household.&nbsp; This is about tens of thousands of dollars in cost per person.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Being hospitalised is not a vacation.&nbsp; It is neither an option nor a choice.&nbsp; You go into the hospital because you have to, and not because you want to.<br></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Using household income or per capita income is not the solution as healthcare cost is personal and we cannot force the person to bear another person's healthcare bill.<br></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp; As families get smaller, the children have to bear a significantly larger<p align=left>Column: 2137<p> burden to support elderly parents, leaving them with little savings and disposable income.<br></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthcare costs are unpredictable, and when a complication arises, the cost can escalate significantly.&nbsp; Every percentage point in subsidy can mean a lot to most middle income families.<br></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe it is going to be a major public relations disaster.&nbsp; The Ministry stands to lose a lot of goodwill that the Ministry has built over the years.<br></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp;&nbsp; There are too many variables and I cannot think of any simple formula.&nbsp; What it means is that there will be a lot of unhappy patients.<br></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The main criterion by which affordability is determined appears to be solely that of income.&nbsp; Sir, the ground has raised, through feedback, a number of concerns with respect to the proposal to make changes to the proportion of subsidies, by the income of the patients and/or their families.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, first, is the question of income and affordability.&nbsp; The assumption that both of them are synonymous appears to be an unwarranted one.&nbsp; The high incomes that some patients earn could very well be spread out across very many family members who are dependent on the income of the breadwinner for their maintenance and sustenance.&nbsp; Whatever is done to change the manner by which hospital fees are to be charged will, in my view, have to take into consideration a whole range of factors, other than income by which to gauge the ability or otherwise of patients to pay.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Sir, is the question of fairness.&nbsp; If high income patients are made to pay for the subsidised wards, then the issue of double payment would crop up for high income patients are paying higher taxes, part of which goes to the subsidies that patients staying in Class C and Class B2 get to enjoy.&nbsp; If they are made to pay a higher fee for their wards, then they would effectively be paying twice for the cost that they incurred.&nbsp; Will the Minister reconsider this scheme to ascertain its desirability from the perspective of ensuring the efficient use of our resources and from that of fairness?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2139<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My other question to the Minister is:&nbsp; if we use income as the main criterion for means testing, are there mechanisms in place for individuals to explain why they should be getting Government subsidies, even though their income would require them to pay more for the class of ward that they are staying in?&nbsp; From what I gather, in some countries that had adopted means testing as a way to determine the amount of subsidy that patients enjoy, mechanisms are put in place that permit patients and their families to explain more fully the specifics of their family situation.&nbsp; I think this is only fair because income alone does not indicate the ability of the family to pay for their healthcare cost.&nbsp; And so my question is:&nbsp; would the Minister adopt a more liberal and open approach to the determination of affordability, with income&nbsp;perhaps as one determinant of affordability and not the only determinant?&nbsp; And would the Minister consider putting in place mechanisms that would allow patients or their family members to explain the financial situation they are in?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But if it is through the IRAS records, many more people will be even more alarmed as these earning figures are very private details of the citizens and IRAS has no right to disclose such figures.&nbsp; What is the Ministry's assurance on this matter?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, citizens pay taxes for Government to provide certain essential services like healthcare.&nbsp; The Government should see subsidising healthcare as part of the essential services it provides to the citizens.&nbsp; How can the Government ask for double payments from the citizens, once, through taxes and then, again, through selective higher co-payment through means testing?&nbsp; Although I concede that it looks unfair for high income patients to enjoy the same 80% subsidy as poorer patients when staying in a Class C ward, I would like to ask the Minister further.&nbsp; How does he intend to define the rich and the high income group?&nbsp; Is it the top 20% earners of our population?&nbsp; Or is it the top 20% plus the middle 50% of our population, making 70% of our total population?&nbsp; Or is it somewhere in between?&nbsp; I hope the Minister can be more specific about the definition of \"high income\".</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

These developments may have prompted the Government to consider the introduction of means testing.&nbsp; However, it must be noted that these developments have a correlation with the prevailing economic condition.&nbsp; I do agree that subsidised medical treatment should go mainly to the low income, the poor and the needy.&nbsp; I wish to strongly suggest that the current subsidy level and cost should remain as it is so as not to deprive the group of citizens of their medical<p align=left>Column: 2141<p> needs.&nbsp; Sir, many Singaporeans have been worried by this term \"well off\".&nbsp; It has not been clearly defined.&nbsp; Different people may mean different things when you say \"well off\".&nbsp; So I think the Government has to clearly explain on this point.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should also not ignore the plight of the middle income workers in managing healthcare cost for themselves and their dependants.&nbsp; A number of such workers have been affected by the economic downturn.&nbsp; At the same time, we should study the reasons deterring such workers from using non-subsidised wards, besides the high cost of such wards.&nbsp; Take, for instance, the B1 Class wards.&nbsp; Even if one were to use Medisave, he still needs to top it up with cash deposit.&nbsp; For example, if one is going for a Table 1 surgery in SGH, the cash deposit needed is about $1,000.&nbsp; And for Table 7 the cash deposit needed is $3,800.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Means testing is also a departure from the current principle of Government providing affordable basic healthcare and the patient decides which class of ward is affordable to him or her.&nbsp; With means testing, the affordability of a patient is now dictated by the Government.&nbsp; Although the Government could argue that the patient could still decide which class of ward he or she wishes to be admitted,&nbsp;the patient who is deemed not qualified for the lower class ward will end up paying more.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government said that it is unfair for high-income patients to enjoy some 80% subsidy as poorer patients.&nbsp; Can we have some statistical data to show what income level of patients use Class C wards?&nbsp; What is the extent of the problem?&nbsp; Could the scenario be that of people who are deemed rich by the Government, but the healthcare cost is too high, and they are not able to afford to go to a higher class ward?&nbsp; In other words, decreased affordability in health care forces more people to opt for&nbsp;Class C wards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPM Lee painted two undesirable scenarios that in order to maintain the current level of healthcare service, either the Government has to spend a lot more, resulting in a tax raise, or the quality of healthcare provided will be lowered.&nbsp; Why must the Government's expenditure on basic healthcare service fall under these two paradigms?&nbsp; Is the self-professed <p align=left>Column: 2143<p>highly capable and thus worth to be paid a million dollars and Government unable to continue to provide basic healthcare?&nbsp; May I know how much is the Government expected to save in this healthcare expenditure by implementing means testing?&nbsp; Is it not the Government's fundamental responsibility after collecting taxes to provide an affordable basic healthcare service for the public good, regardless of social and financial status?&nbsp; Here I am referring to Class C wards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that, eventually, the notion of affordability via means testing will be felt by the bulk of Singaporeans who largely belong to the \"not really in need class.\"&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Subsidised Wards</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade)</B>: Sir, cost issues on healthcare will never go away, as healthcare is a highly skilled and highly personalised service.&nbsp; High standards of medical services never come cheap, especially as new medical equipment and drugs are being introduced regularly.&nbsp; Furthermore, as our population ages, there will be a greater need for more medical services.&nbsp; And with higher expectations, greater costs will be incurred.&nbsp; The minimum level of medical services rises as the population grows to accept a higher level of medical care.&nbsp; Hence, I support subsidised class wards in general, as most people cannot afford modern medical and hospital services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As affordability differs from one person to another, means testing is necessary to determine the level of subsidy that one is entitled to.&nbsp; Means testing has already been practised in restructured hospitals.&nbsp; It is also carried out for patients who need to be referred<p align=left>Column: 2144<p> to community hospitals or who apply for Medifund.&nbsp; Having means testing will ensure that those who are least able to pay have the greatest help from the State.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, medical care is not just about balancing cost and revenue.&nbsp; It requires finesse to manage people's expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest drawback of means testing is that it transfers the power to choose from the individual to the State.&nbsp; Whilst I applaud the Ministry's good intention of making sure that the needy gets the maximum help, the Ministry should also make efforts to reassure the public that their interest will be looked after, no matter which level of income they fall into.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals that fall into the middle income bracket usually end up being squeezed in two ways.&nbsp; They do not qualify for subsidy nor can they afford the high cost.&nbsp; The reasons for Class C wards need to be reiterated and perhaps regularly reviewed to meet changing economic and social norms.&nbsp; It is equally important that at the time of admission, the inbuilt administrative system takes the individual's prevailing circumstances into consideration.&nbsp; Estimated total hospital charges together with hospital fees should be made known to the patient, even if he or she is entitled to a higher subsidy, as the patient's share of cost may be too high even for some to bear.&nbsp; For example, if a patient is out of job and cash poor, this should be reflected when the patient is being considered for subsidy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should be careful against creating excessive bureaucracy in carrying out means testing.&nbsp; Processes should be simplified and patient's interest should be placed first.&nbsp; Perhaps the human touch should be reprioritised to a higher plane of importance.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

To many Singaporeans, this is being viewed as a right of citizenship.&nbsp; To others, it is being viewed as an entitlement that they have earned after a life-time of paying taxes.&nbsp; Of course, if a person chooses not to be treated in a Class C ward, he does so on his own free will.&nbsp; With means testing, this right to medical subsidies is being taken away from him.&nbsp; This is a big step affecting every Singaporean and a step not to be taken lightly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the deliberation of medical subsidies conducted by the Feedback Unit, there emerged a view from the discussions that perhaps the amount of subsidy a patient would have received in a Class C ward should be credited to him whenever he is hospitalised.&nbsp; So, if he so chooses, he could be warded in a better ward in a public hospital or even in a private hospital.&nbsp; Then he could chip in his credit.&nbsp; This is more or less the same concept the Ministry has adopted for some outpatient visits to private clinics.&nbsp; This way, if we adopt it, everyone is happy.&nbsp; There is no need to introduce means testing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think this school of thought is flawed, dangerous and reflects a self-centred view of the individual.&nbsp; I believe healthcare is not a buffet meal.&nbsp; Healthcare subsidy should be targeted at those who really need it.&nbsp; To pursue the viewpoint that healthcare subsidy should be credited would be simply ludicrous because we will be taxing ourselves to pay for our own needs.&nbsp;

As healthcare cost is not likely to<p align=left>Column: 2149<p> decrease, the burden for Singaporeans who are not adequately insured will get worse.&nbsp; So the Ministry of Health should consider allowing the use of Medisave to purchase some healthcare policies to top up the MediShield, subject to whatever safeguards it deems necessary.&nbsp;

As I have said before in this House, the present Medisave system where we save and pay as we go financing for healthcare is becoming less adequate to serve our needs.&nbsp; By retirement stage, healthcare costs are expected to be higher.&nbsp;

Fear of over-consumption can be minimised by adopting best practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH needs to assume this role of \"stewardship\" of healthcare financing urgently to cater for rising health expenditure, demographic change of an ageing society and technical innovation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our health insurance expansion planning, some incentives should be incorporated to rally Singaporeans towards keeping fit and healthy.&nbsp; The other issue in the health insurance expansion is to ensure coverage for Singaporeans when they are in dire need, such as when they are without jobs and between jobs.&nbsp;

Before implementing means testing, we have to first strengthen our medical healthcare social safety net,<p align=left>Column: 2151<p> ie, to put in place a national basic medical insurance scheme.&nbsp; To make our medical benefits portable, the basic infrastructure is again a national basic healthcare insurance scheme.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the same reason that most states require drivers to carry car insurance, the Government should consider a basic tier medical insurance to cover all Singaporeans.&nbsp; For those who can afford, they can add on to enhance its coverage by paying more premiums.&nbsp; For those who cannot afford, the Government should consider giving some public subsidies.&nbsp; This will facilitate fully portable coverage to all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take those who have joined the civil service after 1994, for example.&nbsp; With the additional 1% Medisave contribution as in-patient medical benefit given to them, at the end of 10 years now, the sum comes up to only about one-and-a-half months' salary.&nbsp; Is it enough to cover an in-patient episode?&nbsp; I do not think so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facing the challenges of globalisation, the labour movement in Singapore has been strongly advocating&nbsp; portable medical benefits.&nbsp; In a way, the MediShield scheme is a portable scheme.&nbsp; It covers people up to 80 years.&nbsp; We hope the Ministry will consider the several suggestions that the labour movement put forward to the Ministry for consideration to enhance the MediShield Scheme.&nbsp; The Government should reinforce our healthcare financing system through allowing better use of Medisave, through expanding the scope of MediShield and, more importantly, integrate the existing employer-based medical benefit with MediShield to reduce duplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am particularly concerned that due to the duplication with the employer-based medical benefits, about 270,000 workers, in fact, had opted out of MediShield.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2152<p> What happens when all these \"opt-out\" workers are retrenched?&nbsp;

Member Mr Yeo Guat Kwang mentioned, under the MSO scheme, whatever was contributed in the last 10 years could have been wiped off by one serious episode of medical problem.&nbsp; All this while, the only national medical insurance in place is the MediShield insurance scheme, which is neither comprehensive nor sufficient to replace the current medical benefit provided by employers to workers or cater to the increasing cost and address the needs of an ageing society.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the last&nbsp;couple of years, a number of retrenchments or early retirement are taking place in many industries in Singapore.&nbsp; In fact, restructuring, reorganisation and merging have resulted in workers losing their jobs early.&nbsp; Many of the retrenched workers are older workers and amongst them, a <p align=left>Column: 2153<p>number of them may have medical problems.&nbsp; Such workers are left stranded without the medical benefits provided by their employers.&nbsp; Yes, they could use their Medisave to pay for the inpatient treatment, if they have sufficient funds, but not for costly expensive outpatient treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the economic downturn, workers who have lost their jobs are not covered by a medical benefit scheme.&nbsp; Even for those who are covered by MediShield, the coverage is not comprehensive or adequate to meet their needs.&nbsp; Hence, it is important that workers be covered by medical insurance not only when they are in employment but, more importantly, in between jobs and after their retirement.&nbsp; Such medical insurance should not only cover inpatient but also some major outpatient treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know whether the Government has plans to review the MediShield insurance scheme or introduce other insurance schemes in the immediate future to address the problem faced by many Singaporeans.&nbsp; If the Government has decided to introduce medical insurance, it must have sufficient mechanism to check the abuse of insurance companies and medical professionals for their own self-interest.&nbsp; The Government should act as a strong gatekeeper.&nbsp; Sir, at the same time, I would also like to urge the Government to consider giving a one-time reprieve to those who have opted out of the medical insurance scheme to rejoin the scheme.&nbsp; As mentioned by the hon. Member Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, about 270,000 have opted out, and there are many non-working Singaporeans who are also not covered by MediShield.&nbsp; We should treat this as a national agenda and give a one-time reprieve.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> Sir, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Gan Kim Yong and many others spoke on<p align=left>Column: 2154<p> healthcare cost.&nbsp; In fact, we had just recently, in this House, a short discussion on the same topic.&nbsp; People, all over the world, worry about rising healthcare cost.&nbsp; They want to be sure that, first, good healthcare services are available should they fall sick, and, second, they will have quick access to these services, whether they are rich or poor.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is totally understandable.&nbsp; With advances in healthcare, patients have become accustomed to thinking that death can be avoided, if only good medical services are rendered in time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just last week, I read some media reports about \"doctor bashing\" in one Chinese province, I think, near Chengdu.&nbsp; Some doctors there had received death threats from relatives of patients who died.&nbsp; One doctor was slashed by a woman with a chopper!&nbsp; Some doctors have had to engage bodyguards.&nbsp; As one doctor put it, and I quote him, \"they think we are gods, that we can cure anything\".&nbsp; So when such expectations were not met, the relatives got mad with the doctors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this is an extreme example, the global trend is one of rising expectations for the best possible medical care to provide a good outcome, regardless of the nature of the illness.&nbsp; Now, this is especially troublesome when it is not matched by an equal willingness to co-pay&nbsp; for the care.&nbsp; As a result, Health Ministers all over the world are expected to do the impossible: provide the highest standard of medical care but at the lowest fee, even better, free.&nbsp; Many politicians do make such a promise, and some voters believe them, only to be disappointed when the promises are not fulfilled.&nbsp; But, meanwhile, public healthcare services deteriorate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we make no such promise.&nbsp; Right from the beginning, we persuaded Singaporeans to accept co-payment and shared responsibility in <p align=left>Column: 2155<p>healthcare.&nbsp; This philosophy is institutionalised in our 3M framework of Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.&nbsp; Our 3M framework is far from perfect, but it is probably the best healthcare financing model you can find in the world today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, my Ministry published a paper comparing the utilisation of medical services in Singapore with several developed countries.&nbsp; And we did well.&nbsp; We have lower hospital admissions per capita.&nbsp; Our patients generally do not overstay.&nbsp; I know some media commentaries have pointed out that this may be because healthcare here is so expensive that Singaporeans cannot afford to seek treatment, so they stay away from hospitals, like SARS.&nbsp; The logical extension of that argument is that Singaporeans, so deprived of proper healthcare, must therefore be generally sickly and dying prematurely.&nbsp; But if this was so, our life expectancy would not be one of the highest in the world today, having improved from 76 years in 1994 (10 years ago) to&nbsp;79 years now.&nbsp; Women live longer, past 80 years.&nbsp; We should certainly not get complacent, but I think we can take heart that we have achieved a high standard of health, with lower resources, as compared to others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, of course, there is scope for improvement.&nbsp; I have some ideas on how this can be done and I will use the next few months to discuss them thoroughly with Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, let me just highlight the key strategies and in that process, I will try to address all the points raised by Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Hospitals: Stretch the budget dollar</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, our hospitals have to stretch their budget dollar.&nbsp; They have to learn to do more with less.&nbsp; Among other things, they have to make better use of IT and<p align=left>Column: 2156<p> technology to help cut costs, as suggested by Mayor Zainul Abidin yesterday. They should use generic instead of patented drugs, where possible, without compromising safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, when I launched Singapore-Medicine, I spoke about how we should strive to be the Toyota in healthcare: to produce the Corollas in healthcare, at low cost, with high reliability and zero defects, if possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I was pleasantly surprised to read in last month's issue (February 14th) of <I>Hospitals &amp; Health Networks</I> (which is an American healthcare magazine), an article about how some American hospitals are adopting the Toyota Production System in their hospitals.&nbsp; They are going all out to eliminate waste,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Why is waste seen as the root of all evils?&nbsp; For hospitals, wasteful steps add to cost, increase the time to respond to patients, multiply the opportunities for mistakes.&nbsp; And for patients, waste means long waiting, having to move from pillar to post, unnecessary suffering and additional cost.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">11.45 am</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article went on to describe what some of these \"Toyota-hospitals\" are doing to improve the situation to achieve what they describe as the \"lean turnaround\".&nbsp; And one key strategy is standardisation.&nbsp; As one Chief of Cardiac Surgery put it, \"We are crazy about standardisation.&nbsp; We standardise everything and then we standardise our standardisation.\"</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the article ended with this vision which is worth quoting:&nbsp; \"Imagine our healthcare organisations with errors near zero, where everyone has quick access to diagnosis and treatment, where year by year costs are stable or even decreasing, and where revenues are rising.&nbsp; Sounds like a fantasy?&nbsp; The early pioneers in lean<p align=left>Column: 2157<p> manufacturing envisioned a similar \"fantasy\".&nbsp; Those who were bold enough to embrace the lean revolution early (like <st1:City><st1:place>Toyota</st1:place></st1:City>) have their competitors behind.\"</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I urge our hospitals to get similarly inspired.&nbsp; It is probably difficult for healthcare to match the automobile industry, for the simple reason that patients, unlike automobiles, are not identical.&nbsp; I think we have a short discussion on that also at the last sitting.&nbsp; But I am sure there are valuable lessons that hospitals can learn from the efficient car manufacturers.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we help Singaporeans stretch their Medisave dollars.&nbsp; One of the best things to have happened to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> healthcare is Medisave.&nbsp; Every day we work, we save a few dollars of our income for our future hospital bills.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 20 years of Medisave, we have collectively saved a total of $30,000 million in our Medisave accounts, ie, $30 billion.&nbsp; And it is growing.&nbsp; Every year, about $2.5 billion of Medisave contributions are collected while $800 million, ie, $0.8 billion, are withdrawn to help pay hospital bills and ElderShield/MediShield premiums.&nbsp; Collections exceed withdrawals because we are still a young society, so we are saving for our future aged needs.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although $30 billion sounds like a big amount, the individual balances of most accounts are not that big.&nbsp; For example, 17%, one in five, of all Medisave accounts have less than $1,000.&nbsp; One trip or two to a Class B2 or C ward and everything could be wiped out.&nbsp; It is for this reason that MOH is very reluctant to allow Medisave to be used for home care, as suggested by Dr Chong Weng Chiew.&nbsp; These home care services are generally still affordable after Government subsidies, and Singaporeans should really preserve their Medisave for more expensive hospitalisation.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2158<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the larger Medisave accounts are not that big.&nbsp; And this is because we cap the Medisave balance per account at a maximum of $30,000, which is based on B2/C rates of needs.&nbsp; But a significant portion of Singaporeans in the upper and middle class prefer private or Class A/B1 type of medical services.&nbsp; And they will find their Medisave balances insufficient for their needs.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to help Singaporeans stretch their Medisave dollars.&nbsp; And one effective way is through insurance.&nbsp; Every year, only one in 10 Singaporeans needs to be hospitalised.&nbsp; The trouble is that we do not know whether we are in that 10%.&nbsp; If we were to individually self-insure, in other words, make provisions for this risk of hospitalisation, the cost to each one of us and, also, to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a whole, would be quite large.&nbsp; But if we all chip in to pay for insurance to collectively cover the risk of this 10% of our population who need hospitalisation, then our individual burden can be reduced considerably.&nbsp; This is, of course, the concept of risk pooling.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we do allow some pooling of risk via MediShield.&nbsp; So every year, among the 10% who are hospitalised, a small proportion of the patients develop catastrophic illnesses -&nbsp;cancer, organ failure -&nbsp;which require long hospital care and expensive treatment.&nbsp; And hospital bills for such illnesses, even at B2/C rate can be catastrophic.&nbsp; So 14 years ago, we introduced MediShield to allow Singaporeans to share the risk of catastrophic illnesses.&nbsp; And it has worked generally well.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, many Singaporeans do not quite understand the concept of catastrophic illness insurance, as pointed out by Mr Nithiah and Mdm Halimah.&nbsp; Some Singaporeans think that MediShield would cover all hospitalisation, including the non-catastrophic illnesses.&nbsp; So when <p align=left>Column: 2159<p>they find that their MediShield coverage does not cover their short hospital stay, they get pretty unhappy.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry is studying how we can extend risk pooling beyond MediShield to cover&nbsp;non-catastrophic illnesses with use of Medisave allowed for such premiums.&nbsp; This is an old idea which several MPs, particularly Dr Lily Neo, have been advocating in this House.&nbsp; If implemented, we can tweak it to make employee medical benefits portable, an issue advocated by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, also for several years.&nbsp; And I hope to be able to turn this old idea into reality.&nbsp; This will benefit all Singaporeans, upper, middle, lower income groups.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-catastrophic medical insurance is not new, of course.&nbsp; It is common in the US, <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and many others.&nbsp; But the experience, as pointed out by Dr Gan See Khem yesterday, has often been catastrophic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, the former California Governor, Gray Davis, lost his job partly because of medical insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, for years, the premiums for medical insurance have been rising, double digit percentage, at 12%, 13%, 14%, per annum.&nbsp; Employers are crying out as it adds to their cost and it affects their competitiveness.&nbsp; So they are passing on some of the increases to the employees.&nbsp; Naturally, the employees are crying out too, and they voted in the \"Terminator\".</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why premiums are increasing is that costs and volumes have run wild, and run wild every year.&nbsp; Because of the way they structure their health insurance system, there is very little incentive for patients or doctors to save.&nbsp; As a result, over-consumption by patients and over-servicing by doctors are very common.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2160<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not making this up.&nbsp; In 1995, not too long ago, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region> introduced a National Health Insurance, providing comprehensive coverage, including for outpatient care.&nbsp; So Mr Nithiah should listen to this carefully.&nbsp; But the scheme has now run into problems - wastage, over-consumption.&nbsp; Just some data.&nbsp; Outpatient visits per person per year in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region> is 15.&nbsp; So every month, at least one trip.&nbsp; This is three times the level in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Outpatient expenditures alone account for two-thirds, two in three, of the total claim amounts.&nbsp; The programme therefore went into deficit.&nbsp; In 1998, payouts exceeded premiums collected&nbsp;by NT$2 billion. &nbsp; This deficit increased to&nbsp;NT$16 billion in 2002.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>South Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> implemented a similar programme, a few years earlier than <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and is also facing perennial funding deficits.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So before we rush into this non-catastrophic medical insurance nation-wide, I think we better debate all these downsides thoroughly, make sure we have good mechanisms in place to reduce such risks.&nbsp; And that is why I need a few more months to carefully study the problem and discuss it with Singaporeans extensively.&nbsp; We should take a leaf from motor car repair insurance, which many of us have personal experience with.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For today, let me just lay down the key principles underlying what, I think, a well-designed non-catastrophic illness insurance plan could look like.&nbsp; First, it must have a deductible component.&nbsp; For motor car repairs, insurance does not cover from the first dollar and we have to fork out the first $1,000 before insurance kicks in.&nbsp; Similarly, we should not allow the first dollar coverage for healthcare insurance.&nbsp; In this way, hopefully, we can cut out frivolous claims.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Second, it must have a co-payment element.&nbsp; Patients must co-pay part of the bill.&nbsp; In this way, we cut out abuses like prolonged hospital stays or demand costly<p align=left>Column: 2161<p> implants when cheaper alternatives are available.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Third, the premiums must be affordable.&nbsp; As pointed out by several MPs, large insurance pools are generally cheaper to fund than small insurance pools because of economies of scale.&nbsp; To minimise administrative cost, a compulsory national scheme is the best, as pointed out by Dr Lily Neo.&nbsp; It ensures full coverage with the lowest possible premium.&nbsp; It ensures maximum equity and efficiency, so that insurers cannot cherry pick and leave out all those with preconditions or born congenitally sickly.&nbsp; But if there is no consensus for a national compulsory scheme, then we will have to find compromises, which hopefully do not stray too far away from this ideal.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, it must be financially viable.&nbsp; Premiums collected must more than cover claims, not just for one or two years, but for the long term.&nbsp; Insurers have to build up reserves and this is especially so for a young society like ours.&nbsp; We have an experienced insurance industry in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and we should see how we can leverage on the industry to formulate and operate the schemes.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, it must offer choices.&nbsp; Different people have different needs.&nbsp; Some are satisfied with Class C;&nbsp;others prefer private hospitals.&nbsp; While we should have a national basic medical plan to which all Singaporeans subscribe, we should allow enhancement schemes as riders -&nbsp;I think that was pointed out by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -&nbsp;to the basic medical plan, for Singaporeans with higher needs.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, it should cover only hospitalisation and the equivalent, such as day surgery.&nbsp; I think we better learn from the experiences&nbsp;of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and avoid an extended framework covering all sorts of minor ailments, coughs and colds which can be easily abused.&nbsp; This would also be consistent with our basic<p align=left>Column: 2162<p> approach to Medisave, since the intention is to allow the use of Medisave to cover the premium and Medisave is primarily only for hospitalisation.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have begun the discussion with the industry.&nbsp; Last week, I met a few players from the insurance industry over lunch.&nbsp; And when I shared these views with them, one senior insurer stressed the need to discourage over-charging and over-servicing by doctors and over-consumption by patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, there must be a national fee schedule to control prices.&nbsp; He was speaking from experience in motor car insurance, and I value such insights.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I welcome more debate and more discussion on this important subject.&nbsp; Let us settle the larger picture of this national basic medical insurance plan before we address other details, like Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's query on how existing employer-based medical insurance could accommodate the proposed national health insurance plan, without duplication, or Dr Lily Neo's proposed insurance to cover complicated pregnancies, or Mr Chay Wai Chuen's proposed</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>insurance for home nursing.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.00 noon</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one thing is clear.&nbsp; We should not leave out the self-employed.&nbsp; If they stay out of the 3M framework, they are storing up problems for themselves and their loved ones. CPF Board will be enforcing Medisave contributions by the self-employed, and I hope Singaporeans can accept this need for strict enforcement. Small regular payments via monthly GIRO have helped many taxpayers pay their taxes.&nbsp; Likewise, the self-employed should use GIRO for their Medisave contributions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third strategy is for the Government to stretch our subsidy dollar.&nbsp; As Health Minister, Acting or otherwise, I will do my best to secure the largest<p align=left>Column: 2163<p> possible budget allocation from the Ministry of Finance.&nbsp; But, realistically, Government money is not unlimited.&nbsp; So, my Ministry will have to stretch the subsidy dollar.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Means testing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members have commented on this.&nbsp; Dr Michael Lim gave us 10 reasons why it should not be implemented.&nbsp; On the other hand, Dr Chong Weng Chiew has expressed support and, in fact, urged me to do it as soon as possible.&nbsp; Dr Michael Lim pointed out that the number of well-off Singaporeans opting for B2 and C class wards should be small, and asked if it makes sense to put in place a system to catch such a small minority.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also questioned if the social cost of means testing justifies the benefit. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked for some details, but all of you advised me to be cautious.&nbsp; So, this is clearly a complicated subject and, like non-catastrophic medical insurance, I would take my time to think through the issue, consult widely and hear all views, so that we can come out with a practical scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo and Mr Chay Wai Chuen stressed that medical insurance should be in place before implementing means testing, so as to avoid distressing the affected group.&nbsp; I think that is valid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo and&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong said that the criteria for determining affordability should be multi-dimensional, ie, a range of factors, and not solely dependent on just income level.&nbsp; Family size should be taken into account.&nbsp; At the same time, however, Dr Lily Neo, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Dr Chong Weng Chiew pointed out that the current formula used in nursing homes seems to penalise small families.&nbsp; Dr Chong has two years of ground experience with means testing.&nbsp; That probably explains his confidence and why he recommended that I move faster.&nbsp; But he too noted that the current scheme<p align=left>Column: 2164<p> was not perfect and should be refined.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the various comments, I have distilled several key principles behind what, I think, could be a practical means test scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it must be simple to implement.&nbsp; I agree with Dr Ong Seh Hong and many others that we should not end up with a bureaucratic monster.&nbsp; We will, therefore, need to simplify, but, to simplify, inevitably we will have to use proxies to determine whether it is wealth or income.&nbsp; The scheme should cause minimal inconvenience to patients and not delay their treatment.&nbsp; It should not be costly to administer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, it must provide choices.&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan reminded us that if means test results in taking away freedom of choice from patients, that would not be good, and I agree.&nbsp; So, Class C wards should remain open to all Singaporeans, rich or poor.&nbsp; Patients should continue to have the freedom to choose.&nbsp; In fact, there is nothing wrong about the rich going into Class C.&nbsp; Let us not be judgmental about their decisions.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked just now whether there are data.&nbsp; There are.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I remember, MOH published an occasional paper and there were quite a lot of data in that paper to show the income profile of patients in the various classes.&nbsp; It is a small minority.&nbsp; I think somebody asked the question: who are well off?&nbsp; So it&nbsp;depends on how you define the \"well off\".&nbsp; It is, from my point of view, still a small minority.&nbsp; But it is not insignificant.&nbsp; And what we are trying to do is to, hopefully, nip the problem in the bud,&nbsp;to avoid&nbsp;a&nbsp;larger problem in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Dr Chong Weng Chiew reminded us to ensure an adequate supply of Class B2 and C beds, which I agree.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, it must be fair.&nbsp; The aim of means testing is not to reduce Government subsidies because of the <p align=left>Column: 2165<p>current deficit, as suggested by Mr Gan Kim Yong or some other MPs.&nbsp; The aim is to better target our subsidies to those who need them most.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo and several MPs, eg, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Nithiah Nandan, have spoken about the potential squeeze on the middle income group.&nbsp; I share their concerns, which we will take into account when devising the means test criteria.&nbsp; We will calibrate subsidy levels appropriately, to ensure that hospital bills remain affordable to all Singaporeans.&nbsp; That must always remain the priority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we will be gentle in implementation.&nbsp; With simple rules, there will inevitably be deserving cases which fall through the cracks.&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan made the point that the patient's circumstances prevailing at the time of admission should be taken into account.&nbsp; We must be able to come in promptly when alerted, to sieve out such deserving cases and free them from unnecessary distress.&nbsp; Let me assure Mayor Zainul Abidin that our means test will not be mean.&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah pointed out yesterday, means testing should not be a demeaning process, but should be handled sensitively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, it must be transparent.&nbsp; And you know my view about transparency.&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong and Dr Michael Lim called for transparency in implementation.&nbsp; I fully agree.&nbsp; The scheme must make sense to everyone, such that Singaporeans, if they like,&nbsp;are able to compute their own subsidy status.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this is a complicated subject, let us continue to discuss and suggest more ideas over the next few months.&nbsp; I have created a special section in the Ministry of Health's&nbsp;website to gather all feedback and suggestions.&nbsp; And I intend to continue to work with the Feedback healthcare group to advance this project.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Steve Chia objected to means testing.&nbsp; He asked several details, such <p align=left>Column: 2166<p>as, will we be using IRAS data, therefore, breaching confidentiality.&nbsp; What is the cut-off?&nbsp; What do we mean by \"well off\"?&nbsp; Obviously, those are details that&nbsp;we will have to discuss through over the next few months.&nbsp; He made a point that if we means test out the rich,&nbsp;they will&nbsp;have to pay more.&nbsp; But the rich are also the ones who pay the most in taxes.&nbsp; Are we double taxing?&nbsp; But we are trying to achieve an outcome whereby, because we have to balance our accounts, subsidy is a zero-sum game.&nbsp; So, if I have more subsidy money because I collect more fees, then I can help the poor, I can stretch the subsidy dollar more.&nbsp; If we do not do this, and all rush to&nbsp;go to Class C when they could afford a lower subsidy, then I will first have to raise fees more frequently for all classes, including Class C, or raise taxes more, in which case, we will be going back to this top whatever percent who are the major taxpayers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let us not kid ourselves.&nbsp; We are not magicians here, and my job is to present the facts out into the marketplace so that people can see for themselves.&nbsp; If we are squeezing everybody, making profits, paying doctors and CEOs unrealistic pay and so on, then obviously we are in the wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;But my job is to try to provide a good level of healthcare in a sustainable manner, and we all know a good level of healthcare does not come cheap.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang objected, I think, to means testing.&nbsp; I was flipping through some <I>Hansard</I> records a few months back, when I was asked to take on this job.&nbsp; I am relying on memory here.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am past 50, memory not perfect.&nbsp; I think I recall&nbsp;him making some comments, objecting to the rich becoming subsidised patients through the polyclinics, because our system is, if you are referred by the polyclinics, you are straightaway a subsidised patient.&nbsp; I remember, I think, he made such a comment that those who <p align=left>Column: 2167<p>are rich should not be subsidised.&nbsp; But without means testing, how do I then know whether you are rich or poor?&nbsp; On that score, I thought he would then be supporting means testing.&nbsp; But I agree with him details are what count, and we will spend the next few months debating that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Michael Lim spoke about exporting our medical expertise to the region, especially China and India, and I agree fully with him.&nbsp; He asked how I intend to change the mindset of my colleagues in the Ministry of Health to support such a development.&nbsp; I have already made one major mindset change to incorporate regional medical hub as an MOH priority.&nbsp; Please allow the Ministry of Health to digest that change first.&nbsp; In any case, as the Minister for Health, my priority is to serve the medical needs of Singaporeans first, followed by foreign patients who come here for treatment.&nbsp; And then if I have some time to spare, I will think about how to serve the medical needs of foreigners in their home countries.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I leave it to experts like Dr Michael Lim, to tap that market, championed by MTI and IE Singapore.&nbsp; I will cheer them on the sidelines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Michael Lim also urged a greater relaxation of advertising rules to allow our doctors and hospitals to market themselves better in the region.&nbsp; He described our current regulatory regime as&nbsp;conservative and outdated - although he did not use those words.&nbsp; My instinct, honed in MTI for seven years, is always for light regulation, because every regulation has a cost, and should be put in only after careful thought.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in healthcare, which affects life and death and which has major cost implications, it is better to be slightly conservative.&nbsp; In US magazines, prescription drugs like Viagra and Zoccor are now <p align=left>Column: 2168<p>widely advertised to lay public.&nbsp; I am not exactly sure if this is a good thing.&nbsp; Earlier, we heard comments on how we should educate patients to accept generic drugs so as to save on cost.&nbsp; Such advertisements by patented drug manufacturers&nbsp;must surely lead to patients demanding&nbsp;such prescriptions from their doctors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, better that we move carefully, evaluate the impact, and then take further steps.&nbsp; Meanwhile, rules governing advertisements by hospitals will be loosened.&nbsp; Draft rules are in our MOH website for public consultation, and we will move as soon as we have studied the feedback.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, let me respond to Dr Tan Cheng Bock's passionate call for a greater role for primary healthcare.&nbsp; He felt that primary healthcare is the key to moderating healthcare cost and that, if we remain too hospital-biased, we are barking up the wrong tree.&nbsp; I share his passionate sentiments.&nbsp; That is why, shortly after I joined the Ministry of Health, I appointed a primary healthcare working group, which is still active, with representatives from both the public and private sectors.&nbsp; Their job is to identify gaps in our current systems and come up with innovative ways to manage disease holistically and also to transform primary healthcare services in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our GPs and polyclinic doctors are the unsung heroes and heroines of our healthcare system.&nbsp; They will always get my personal support. &nbsp;I firmly believe that every Singaporean should have a good family physician, ie, someone who knows you, who knows your family well, who will respond to your night calls when warranted, and who will offer you sound advice on which specialist to see and which hospital&nbsp;to go, if you need secondary or tertiary care.&nbsp; A good family physician can help you save money, besides nagging you on your diet, <p align=left>Column: 2169<p>waistline&nbsp;and exercises.&nbsp; If you have yet to have one good family physician, better hurry and look for&nbsp;one.&nbsp; A good family physician can also be a good gatekeeper to the rest of the healthcare delivery system.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I share his observation but I do not think it is because of cluster formation.&nbsp; In fact, one of the objectives of cluster formation is to bridge primary healthcare with the secondary and tertiary healthcare.&nbsp; One example is that I am pushing lifelong Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for every Singaporean:&nbsp; one patient, one medical record, multiple clinics, multiple hospitals.&nbsp; Cluster formation will help us facilitate this transformation.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key is to bring together like-minded stakeholders and leverage on technology to achieve an integrated ecosystem of healthcare services from primary to tertiary, and back to step-down care.&nbsp; The concept is easy and simple.&nbsp; But to operationalise it is a huge challenge.&nbsp; I have some ideas and some plans for a pilot project to try this out.&nbsp; Later this afternoon, when I respond to the next group of cuts, I will use that opportunity to elaborate on this idea and I will definitely want to tap on Dr Tan Cheng Bock to help bring primary healthcare to the next level of excellence.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Dr Tan Cheng Bock's comment on disease outbreaks like SARS, Ministry of Health, post-SARS, is no longer the same as before.&nbsp; We have learnt a lot fighting SARS, we have many battle scars to show for it.&nbsp; While we must not be complacent, we are now more fighting-fit.&nbsp; But Singaporeans must continue to help us out, by doing the simple things&nbsp;like&nbsp;wash your hands, do not touch your eyes, use serving spoon, stretch your body and exercise your heart.</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 2170<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, may I seek clarifications from the Minister?&nbsp; The Minister referred to my previous comment in Parliament about polyclinics.&nbsp; Sir, I wish to clarify that I am not objecting to the basic principle that the subsidies in healthcare should be given to those who are&nbsp;really in need.&nbsp; I am aware of means testing for step-down care in the medical service.&nbsp; I have never complained about it.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, we must understand that we are now talking about C Class ward in the hospitals.&nbsp; We have to bear in mind that the cost of hospitalisation can be very high.&nbsp; No one really knows, whether&nbsp;you are&nbsp;relatively rich, or&nbsp;you are poor, and how much it will cost you.&nbsp; When&nbsp;people go for means testing,&nbsp;and some fall within the category of \"not&nbsp;eligible for Class C ward subsidies\", do they really know that they can afford?&nbsp; But affordability is dictated and determined by the Government that thinks&nbsp;they can afford.&nbsp; Is it fair to them?&nbsp; In my view,&nbsp;C Class ward, as it is now, is&nbsp;the last frontier of our social safety net system.&nbsp; If&nbsp;people are not sure&nbsp;whether they can afford, and they fall sick, they can&nbsp;go to&nbsp;C Class ward,&nbsp;and if they really cannot pay, Medifund will pay. &nbsp;I think people will not have so much anxiety.&nbsp; But the moment we change all this,&nbsp;when people fall within the category of non-eligibility,&nbsp;depending on where we set the benchmark,&nbsp;it will cause them&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;anxieties and it is not being fair to them.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Low Thia Khiang also gave his explanation that he has no fundamental objection to the means test philosophy.&nbsp; In fact, he supported means test for polyclinics and nursing homes.&nbsp; But his worry is Class C ward.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;if you&nbsp;are wrongly means tested out or unfairly means tested out, then - to use his<p align=left>Column: 2172<p> words -&nbsp;this last frontier of safety net will be taken away.&nbsp; I think I got him right now.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this stage, I am quite happy that if, on principles, we can agree&nbsp;on the whole conceptualisation of it, whereby if&nbsp;you are better off,&nbsp;you pay more than those who are less well-off,&nbsp;the rest are details.&nbsp; That is why I wanted the next few months to discuss those things.&nbsp; I do not think the last frontier is Class C subsidised ward.&nbsp; I think the last frontier, in the case of healthcare, has always been Medifund.&nbsp; Medifund is there to protect those who&nbsp;dropped through the safety net. So long as we have a good and sound Medifund in place, everybody can sleep tight.&nbsp; That is the reason why I persuaded DPM Lee and Minister for Finance to raise the Medifund allocation this year by another $100 million, to now make it $1 billion.&nbsp; But, never mind, let us hold the horses&nbsp;and await&nbsp;the details.&nbsp; We will have enough opportunities to discuss those details and then we can judge for ourselves whether they fulfill the various principles that I have outlined just now - simple, fair, etc.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked a question on Medisave and IVF.&nbsp; As there is a related question on this later on this afternoon, I will tackle that later.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong Weng Chiew asked about home care.&nbsp; I thought I have answered that in my reply.&nbsp; The answer is no - it is a consistent reply of \"no.\"&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan Cheng Bock spoke about primary healthcare and said I must demonstrate words with dollars.&nbsp; Indeed, a huge amount of money is in primary healthcare,&nbsp;out of the&nbsp;$2 billion budget -&nbsp;I cannot remember the details&nbsp;- for the Ministry of Health, which is a big chunk.&nbsp; If we look at subsidies - I published an occasional paper a few weeks ago - this was a bit outdated, so the figures should be more by now.&nbsp; About two years back, generally, we subsidised more than $1<p align=left>Column: 2173<p> billion in healthcare, of which $100 million go to primary healthcare.&nbsp; There is an opportunity to discuss more about this very interesting topic of primary healthcare.

Secondly, there is no need for people&nbsp; because they can calculate for themselves - if they think they cannot afford a higher class ward, they can&nbsp;go&nbsp;to C class ward.&nbsp; This is a comfortable social safety net.&nbsp; It is not something which people have to go and apply for it, beg for it and say, \"Please, I am so poor.\"&nbsp; I think it is demeaning for many people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why I am referring to it as the last frontier of our social safety net.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Khaw, do you want to respond?</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> I do not want to prolong this agony other than saying this.&nbsp; Whatever we do, affordability&nbsp;of healthcare to all income groups, rich or poor&nbsp;- that is always an important operating principle in the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; Whatever we design, whatever fees we charge, it must be affordable.&nbsp; How we design means test so that even&nbsp;if we assess that&nbsp;you are clearly in the category who can well afford,&nbsp;the charges<p align=left>Column: 2174<p> remain affordable.

This showed that market manipulation by anyone, including the Singapore Government, is not going to work very well.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, I am indeed&nbsp;heartened that DPM Lee has announced in his Budget speech a further expansion of the approved overseas training universities to about 70-plus, effectively driving the nails into the coffins of protectionism on the supply of medical doctors.&nbsp; But the effect of the old policy lingers on.&nbsp; By and large, the cost of medical care in Singapore is high, especially the fees of specialists. For<p align=left>Column: 2175<p> instance, a cataract operation by a private-sector surgeon would cost close to S$5,000 per eye.&nbsp; I noted that, despite better technology procedures thereby resulting&nbsp;in better productivity, this cost has not come down over the years.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, Sir, the issue of branded drugs in Singapore, being more expensive compared to those just across the Causeway, has been brought up in this House before. Then Minister Lim initiated some actions - I cannot remember what - but we heard nothing about it after a while.&nbsp; Sir, it is well-known that drug companies will price their drugs differently in different countries based on the per capita income or their ability to pay.&nbsp; And this is not just happening in the case of Singapore and Johore.&nbsp; There is a BBC radio report comparing the cost of prescription drugs sold in the US and those sold in Canada, which is just across the border in the state of New York.&nbsp; There was indeed a substantial difference. This has led to grassroots activists among US retirees to call for legislation controlling prices of such drugs in the state of New York.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not very sure whether legislation will be very effective.&nbsp; In any event, my questions to the Minister are:&nbsp; how do we allow greater freeplay of market forces in the demand and supply of medical personnel like doctors, nurses and branded medicine like drugs?&nbsp; How do&nbsp;we remove man-made barriers to foster greater competition?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Competition between Medical Clusters</I><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</B>:&nbsp; Sir, years ago, one of the main objectives of setting up the two health clusters was to inject&nbsp;an element of healthy competition into our public health sector in order to spur us into achieving world-class excellence.

A re-consideration of the role of the two health clusters and a restructure of our public health sector may be timely.&nbsp; What was appropriate earlier may not be suitable for our current situations as our priorities have changed.&nbsp; Right now, with a weaker economy and definitely an ageing population, we are more concerned with keeping healthcare cost down and ensuring the availability of solid basic healthcare to all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Therefore, the possible duplication of some resources as a result of the clustering has definitely become a concern.&nbsp; With that background, I have the following points and questions to raise.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">12.30 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, I read the National Healthcare Group Annual Report 2002-2003 and understand that the NHG employs about 1,600 staff in pure administration.&nbsp; Can I find out from the Minister the roles and duties of these 1,600 staff?&nbsp; I do not have the exact number for SingHealth, but I believe they would have a figure close to NHG.&nbsp; How much duplication of work is there actually?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we have a limited pool of medical personnel in Singapore and the clusters have to compete for talents in order to attract patients, driving up remuneration and adding to cost.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the Acting Minister has said that there is always good and bad competition.&nbsp; But how can we differentiate one from the other?&nbsp; Based on the following knowledge I have,&nbsp;I do know that staff in both clusters are rewarded bonuses based on the revenue and not on the level of service or efficiency.&nbsp; Last year, staff of the clusters were paid a <p align=left>Column: 2177<p>group bonus, based on a group profit, on top of their basic pay package.&nbsp; So this motivates revenue-generating behaviour among the staff of the clusters.&nbsp; Thus, with this profit-oriented mentality, how can we ensure good competition to bring down healthcare cost?&nbsp; Things and circumstances, as I have mentioned, have changed and I do hope the Minister will review the situation and, hopefully, reshape our healthcare foundation by abolishing the two groups system in our healthcare system currently.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I share the sentiments of Dr Chong that clustering does not improve the efficiency.&nbsp; Someone actually lamented to me that with the clustering - with this additional administrative structure put in place -&nbsp;they now have to deal with three MOH headquarters.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;actually suggest that efficiency can be driven through open market competition, not between the clusters, but between public and private hospitals.&nbsp; MOH should consider buying more services from the private sector, whichever can deliver the services at the cheapest.&nbsp; With that, MOH would be better able to set its own benchmark of what is the actual cost of any services.&nbsp; Like Dr Chong, I would like to ask: what is the underlying rationale behind rewarding hospital managers' performance based on profitability?&nbsp; With this orientation, the result would be that only the Government subvention portion of the total bills would be managed better, but the increase in the cost may be simply passed on to the patients.&nbsp; So the Ministry should review the underlying principles and set better yardsticks for<p align=left>Column: 2178<p> rewarding public hospital managers.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more accurate measure of hospital efficiency should consist of comparing the total medical bill, which includes Government subvention and patient co-payment portion, against the total patient's bill of a similar procedure in other hospitals in Singapore, as well as in other regions.&nbsp; This will uncover the misalignment in the perception that our public hospital is cheap.&nbsp; Just a quick illustration.&nbsp; The cost of operation in a private hospital may be $4,000 and the patient pays $4,000.&nbsp; But the cost in a public hospital may&nbsp;actually be $5,000, but the Government pays $3,000 and the patient pays $2,000.&nbsp; To the patient, it is still cheaper to go to a public hospital.&nbsp; So, I hope the Ministry will look into this and enlighten us on some of these issues.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Minister what are MOH's key performance indicators.&nbsp; What&nbsp;is the number of patients served?&nbsp; Quality of service?&nbsp; Is it cut waste?&nbsp; Cut cost?&nbsp; Or affordability?&nbsp; Is it the use of IT or application of technology?&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about relative to managing cost?&nbsp; Is it how we stretch the Medisave dollar, as the Minister was <p align=left>Column: 2179<p>talking about just now or, perhaps, more importantly, how will MOH stretch Government's subsidy dollar for medical care?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mdm Ho Geok Choo:&nbsp;</b> Sir, like my colleagues before me, I would also like to touch on the two public healthcare clusters.&nbsp; The public health delivery system was reorganised into two vertically integrated networks in 1999.&nbsp; This reorganisation created the National Healthcare Group and the Singapore Health Services.&nbsp; The intention then was to enable more integrated and better quality healthcare services through greater cooperation and collaboration among public sector healthcare providers.&nbsp; It would minimise duplication of services and ensure optimal development of clinical capabilities.&nbsp; But, in reality, the competition between the two clusters has resulted in a mushrooming of services and clinical capabilities.&nbsp; They have business development departments that market and source for overseas patients and bid for hospital projects in foreign countries.&nbsp; They compete with the private sector for local healthcare projects.&nbsp; Perhaps all these explain the reason for the big staff strength in their setup.&nbsp; The point is:&nbsp; is this necessary, in view of our public economy drive?&nbsp; As the two public clusters are significant players, their actions have a major impact on the local healthcare scene.&nbsp; In October last year, the Minister for Health asked the two clusters to stop the silly competition and not to fight for market share.&nbsp; Like my colleagues before me, I would like the Minister to state categorically what is the current mission and role of the two public healthcare clusters and how the mission and role should be changed.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I appreciate that MOH is finding ways to cut healthcare cost.&nbsp; My concern is whether the cut cost initiative will have the side-effect of cutting corners as well and, therefore, affect the standard of medical services.&nbsp; Sir, I have received feedback that in some hospitals, the diagnostic process is slow and the decision on how to treat patients takes a longer time and causes much anxiety to both patients and family members.&nbsp; Some have even decided to discharge the patient to seek private hospital treatment.&nbsp; I would like to know what are the specific plans MOH has in its cost cutting exercise.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area which I am concerned is waiting time.&nbsp; I noted that waiting time at hospital's specialist clinics and polyclinics has been long.&nbsp; In some instance, waiting time in some polyclinics can be as long as two hours.&nbsp; As we put forward budgetary and fiscal cost cutting measures, the Government must beware that certain areas are very sensitive to cost cutting measures.&nbsp; I urge the Government to be mindful of this, especially in the area of healthcare.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

SARS has shown Singapore's spirit of medical service.&nbsp; But how do you maintain that?&nbsp; Quality of service is different during crisis time compared to peace time or boom time when there is greater mobility.&nbsp; How do you maintain a service when we <p align=left>Column: 2181<p>are short of medical manpower, including doctors and nurses?&nbsp; What has Singapore's experience been when it comes to enhancing quality of service, when we have to import nurses from all over Asia - China, Philippines and, I was told now, even Indonesia?&nbsp;

Dr Lily Neo:</B><B>&nbsp;</B> Sir, may I ask the Minister for Health on his plans to enable Singapore to become the regional medical hub?&nbsp; May I ask the Minister to quickly activate measures before we lose the chance completely as our neighbouring countries have been making up grounds in healthcare services by leaps and bounds?&nbsp; These countries have the advantage of lower cost and the marked difference in cost is driving large numbers of cost-conscious patients from the region away from Singapore.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our endeavour to succeed in this area, may I ask the Minister to consider the following points:</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Facilitate a more competitive cost of healthcare to attract foreign patients.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Ensure that healthcare for Singaporeans is not affected by having foreign patients, which he assured us earlier.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; There is a need to integrate our healthcare clusters and sectors for better economies of scale and maximising our limited resources to compete globally and not competing between ourselves.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Singapore has a very good reputation as a centre of medical excellence and our healthcare professionals are recognised for their high quality and efficiency.&nbsp; We need to have a more structured aggressive marketing of this fact.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2182<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(6)&nbsp; To maintain Singapore's medical excellence, there is a need to pay more attention to the training of our future generation of healthcare providers.&nbsp; Only by continuing to invest heavily on our undergraduate and post-graduate medical education will we ensure that our doctors are competent and conversant with the new developments in medical sciences.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; It is worthwhile to include the extension of the service hub to become a training hub as this will boost our aim of being a medical hub in the region.&nbsp; This will have the effect of promoting collaboration with doctors in the neighbouring countries and of gaining their acceptance of us.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think it would be an exciting and challenging initiative.&nbsp; It will capitalise on the professional reputation of our medical expertise as well as take advantage of the excellent infrastructure we have already developed, such as transportation, communications, etc.&nbsp; Being centrally located in Asia will&nbsp;also give us an added advantage.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to share with the Acting Minister some of my concerns and suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we must be focused in our efforts.&nbsp; While our professionalism and <p align=left>Column: 2183<p>expertise in medical services are generally well regarded, we must identify certain areas where we have a competitive edge and focus our efforts in developing these areas of excellence.&nbsp; This will ensure that our limited resources are not dissipated.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we must adopt a total approach.&nbsp; To become a medical hub, medical excellence alone is not sufficient.&nbsp; We must also ensure that the non-medical supporting system is also tuned up.&nbsp; For example, we must ease the application process for visas and we must provide one-stop services.&nbsp; It may&nbsp;even be necessary to create a new category of visas called \"medical visas\" to facilitate foreigners who are travelling to Singapore for diagnosis and treatment.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we must ensure that Singaporeans' interests are not compromised.&nbsp; In this regard, I am pleased that the Acting Minister has given his assurance earlier that Singaporeans will always come first.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think we have what it takes to transform Singapore into a medical hub for the region.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Acting Minister to elaborate more on his strategy and plans.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">12.45 pm</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s private sector healthcare facilities for foreign patients offer superb outpatient services and subsequent after-care service.&nbsp; However, the development of a world-class centre for medical excellence will require not only the offering of better customer services in a better designed ambience but will include the continuous investment in research and development.&nbsp; I would like to propose that the making of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a medical hub should not be the prerogative of the private sector, but should be a collaboration between the public and private sectors.&nbsp; The recognition as a medical hub is dependent on the recognition that we achieve for clinical excellence, like the Cleveland Clinic or the Mayo Clinic, which took more than 50 years to evolve.&nbsp; In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> case, there had been a tremendous amount of research and development activities, both in the public and private sectors, over the past decades.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, traditionally, the bulk of research and innovative work is done in the public sector where Government funding is included as part of the budget approved in this House.&nbsp;

In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> model, research grants are given to both private and public sectors, and they compete for such grants so that they both can contribute to the developments and innovations in clinical practice.&nbsp; I urge the Government to consider giving incentives to encourage the private sector to do research, especially now that so many of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s top medical brains are already in private practice.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And, hence, we have not been able to develop a formal referral base like what the renowned Houston Heart Centre had done in the past decades.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for us to position as a medical hub, it has to be everyone's business, both the public and private sectors.&nbsp; And with the public sector having made heavy investments in healthcare infrastructure, research and talent, the public sector can set the stage and maintain <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s position as a pre-eminent place for healthcare excellence.&nbsp; It would be good to have the Minister's view on how we can more effectively promote <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s competitive edge in medical science through what we have already invested in&nbsp;

<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani:</b>&nbsp; Sir, people worry about health cost, especially in the case of serious and chronic illnesses and diseases.&nbsp; And one way to reduce health cost is by having a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, healthy lifestyle has a serious cost dimension to it.&nbsp; A healthy lifestyle also enables us to enjoy life more.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what is the attitude of Singaporeans today on healthy lifestyle compared to, say, three or four years ago?&nbsp; What programmes have there been on promoting healthy lifestyle and how can we improve on them?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence suggests that certain segments of our population are more likely to suffer certain types of diseases.&nbsp; I wonder whether there are studies made on the profiles of such patients.&nbsp; For instance, recently, the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Berita Harian</i> carried a front-page report of a comment made by a Minister that adult Malays seem to place less emphasis than others to avoid chronic diseases.&nbsp; So more profile information would enable the Ministry to take measures that are more targeted, more focused and more <p align=left>Column: 2190<p>effective.&nbsp; For instance, if the target for a certain campaign is for the Malay housewives above the age of 40, then our usual posters and brochures would not work.&nbsp; Probably collaboration with the Malay radio or the brisk walking groups at mosques would be more effective.&nbsp; Similarly, if the problem is smoking among youths in schools, then other more targeted approaches are probably more effective.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the underlying principle here about healthy lifestyle is that prevention is better than cure.&nbsp; I wonder what is the Minister's assessment of our present situation.&nbsp; Are we putting this into practical effect or are we still procrastinating on the prevention part until it is too late even to cure?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I hope MOH can implement more aggressive measures in assisting our elderly lead healthy lifestyles and providing more<p align=left>Column: 2191<p> preventive care for our elderly.&nbsp; An important message for this group will be \"disabilities in old age are often due to disease and early treatment of the disease can prevent disabilities.\"&nbsp; Upon this basis, it is necessary for MOH to ensure that those with diagnosed chronic diseases can get their regular long-term medications.&nbsp; It is, thus, necessary to include chronic diseases care, which is presently not provided for those eligible poor elderly in the Primary Care Partnership Scheme.&nbsp; I would like to declare, Sir, that I am a doctor looking after some patients under PCPS.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A one-stop diagnosis and care-plan centre is essential for elderly care.&nbsp; At this centre, a standardised and holistic assessment can be done according to the patient's needs.&nbsp; Sir, having the correct diagnosis and the choicest management for each illness not only results in better outcome but also saves us money.&nbsp; Referral to the correct doctor and discipline for treatment is essential for reduction in hospital admissions.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many Singaporeans are concerned about rising medical costs, and this is especially so for the elderly folk in our midst who have no income but increasing medical needs.&nbsp; In time to come, this increasing burden will affect even more people due to our fast ageing population.&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to urge MOH to have good plans, insurance schemes and various safety nets put in place to ensure affordable long-term healthcare for all Singaporeans.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Sir, several Members have asked if the corporate missions of our clusters are properly aligned with our objective of keeping healthcare affordable to all.&nbsp; For example, Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked what their mission is: Is it to get more patients?&nbsp; Dr Chong Weng Chiew and Dr Ong Seh Hong<p align=left>Column: 2192<p> felt that if doctors and CEOs' income depended on patient volume, then they are bound to compete for more patients and revenue, pushing up healthcare cost.&nbsp; So I put these comments to the two clusters' CEOs.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Suet Wun explained to me that pay and promotion would depend on a number of performance measures.&nbsp; Workload is not the only measure but it could not be ignored.&nbsp; Let me quote him: \"Not to consider workload means that those who work hard and those who don't, are paid the same.\"&nbsp; In his cluster, as an example, his doctors are pushing projects which improve the care for asthma patients so as to reduce their admissions.&nbsp; Their diabetic foot care programme to prevent&nbsp; amputations is another example.&nbsp; As he put it, \"less amputations hurt our bottom-line, but we enjoy doing it\".</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Prof. Tan Ser Kiat explained that his cluster doctors are also measured on a number of indicators.&nbsp; Revenue and patient load are not the only criteria.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, at the end of the day, it is values that count.&nbsp; If a doctor is solely interested in maximising his income, then I think the public healthcare sector is not the right place for him or her.&nbsp; We need to gather around us like-minded people who share a common objective to serve.&nbsp; We have to reward them adequately, and we will, but their passion must be towards their patients. &nbsp; Then they are qualified to join the Fellowship of the Ring.&nbsp; Our job is to expand that Fellowship.&nbsp; I, therefore, spend considerable time sharing my thoughts and values with the staff.&nbsp; That probably explains why I have less time to speak to the public, which is what Mdm Halimah urged me to do, which I will.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My advice to both clusters is simple - put patients at the centre of&nbsp; their focus, not clusters, not hospitals, not doctors, but patients.&nbsp; At the same time, bear in <p align=left>Column: 2193<p>mind the need to keep healthcare affordable, which means doing more with less but without compromising clinical quality.&nbsp; So to Mr Low Thia Khiang, let me assure him that, yes, we are cutting cost, but we will not cut corners.&nbsp; At the most fundamental level, these must be the key performance indicators which Mayor Zainul Abidin touched upon.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate with some examples this patient-centric philosophy.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Electronic medical record (EMR)</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, sharing of electronic medical record (EMR).&nbsp; One in four of our patients needs to cross clusters.&nbsp; For example, a patient may begin with a consultation with a doctor at NUH.&nbsp; Subsequently, he may decide to seek another opinion from a doctor in SGH.&nbsp; If we focus on the clusters' benefits, we will probably make it inconvenient for the patients to cross the border.&nbsp; So, duplicate medical reports will have to be created and tests may have to be repeated at unnecessary cost.&nbsp; But if we focus on the patient's benefit, we will quickly realise that the correct decision is to facilitate the transfer and make it seamless.&nbsp; One cluster's gain is not another cluster's loss.&nbsp; It is not a zero-sum game.&nbsp; The patient's care is what counts.&nbsp; And this is the approach I take towards cluster competition and cluster cooperation.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago when DPM Lee reopened Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic, he was shown how IT was being used to allow doctors in the National Health Group (NHG) Cluster to access medical records of the patients once they have had one encounter with the cluster.&nbsp; For example, if an Ang Mo Kio polyclinic's patient was admitted to, say, NUH A&amp;E Department, the NUH doctor would be able to check, real-time, online, the medical records of the patient in the other NHG institutions, even though it is the patient's first visit to NUH.&nbsp; This is the power of electronic <p align=left>Column: 2194<p>medical records.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, the other cluster (SingHealth Cluster) also illustrated the capabilities of&nbsp; EMR to the public.&nbsp; The objective is identical, which is to exploit IT to benefit the patients.&nbsp; I am glad that for their pioneering efforts, SingHealth took one of the top five spots in the CIO Asia Awards.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am moving this initiative up to the next step.&nbsp; We are now working to link up the EMR of both clusters, so that a patient, once served by a member of a cluster, will enjoy the benefits of the EMR in subsequent visits to any member of the cluster.&nbsp; This has powerful applications.&nbsp; For example, patients would no longer need to re-register at counters, a tedious and time-consuming process.&nbsp; They can avoid being sent for repeat tests and x-rays, if these have been carried out recently by doctors in different institutions - I think a point made by Dr Lily Neo yesterday.&nbsp; A&amp;E doctors can access the patient's medical record to look out for drug allergy, or other pertinent clinical information which may influence the treatment to be rendered.&nbsp; We are not there yet in linking up the EMRs of both clusters.&nbsp; But I am determined that the key pieces will be put in place within 12 months.&nbsp; It is complicated business, but it can be done.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Rebuilding of</i> <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Alexandra</i></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Hospital</i></st1:PlaceName></st1:place></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second example, the rebuilding of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Alexandra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Hospital</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> (AH).&nbsp; MOH made a commitment to rebuild <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Alexandra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Hospital</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.&nbsp; I am seeing through this commitment.&nbsp; There are good reasons why <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Alexandra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Hospital</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> should be rebuilt.&nbsp; It is already 65 years old.&nbsp; The buildings are old and sprawling.&nbsp; Patients have to walk long distances to get different treatment.&nbsp; Although the staff has done a wonderful job in sprucing up the place, it is becoming expensive to maintain.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2195<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is, what kind of hospital should replace it?&nbsp; In the last 25 years, we have rebuilt all the public hospitals, except Alexandra.&nbsp; From Changi to <st1:City><st1:place>Woodbridge</st1:place></st1:City>, they have all been given a new lease of life.&nbsp; For the new hospital to replace AH, will it be more of the same?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members are aware of the transformation of our public libraries.&nbsp; From a boring depository of books, they have become \"lifestyle destinations\".&nbsp; Dr Tan Chin <st1:country-region><st1:place>Nam</st1:place></st1:country-region> told me that their approach was to treat every new library project as a prototype to test out new ideas, new innovations in library services.&nbsp; As a result, every new library is an enhancement over the previous one.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I posed the challenge to the AH rebuilding team: do to your hospital as what Chin Nam did to public libraries.&nbsp; And I do not mean to turn hospitals into lifestyle destinations!&nbsp; Specifically, build a hospital where patients will be treated as you would wish for yourself or your loved ones.&nbsp; To meet this challenge, the hospital will have to be designed with patients unambiguously at the centre of the focus, with technology fully exploited for the benefit and convenience of patients.&nbsp; It will be a hospital where patients do not get lost or get pushed from pillar to post.&nbsp; It will be a hospital with minimal bureaucracy and paper work.&nbsp; It will be a hospital which is well linked to the polyclincs, GPs and nursing homes in the neighbourhood, and to which the patients can be transferred seamlessly and in a way that makes the most sense to them.&nbsp; It will be a hassle-free hospital.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is a tall order, and I would be pleased if they can achieve half of what I have sketched to them.&nbsp; The hardware aspect is the easy part.&nbsp; We have done it many times before.&nbsp; But it is the software that will determine if they succeed or fail in this mission.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2196<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AH team is brainstorming these software issues, in collaboration with many partners, including Infocomm Development Authority (IDA).&nbsp; We will not know which ideas will work.&nbsp; But if you do not try, you never know.&nbsp; They will use the next couple of years to try them out at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Alexandra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Hospital</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.&nbsp; I will squeeze out some budget to support them in this.&nbsp; And for those ideas that work, we shall adopt them at the new hospital.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked them to consult widely, speak to the patients, ask their relatives, and certainly involve the stakeholders in the neighbourhood, the GPs, the polyclinics, the nursing homes, the MPs and the grassroots leaders.&nbsp; Whoever can bring value to the table, involve them.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also told them to avoid building a huge hospital.&nbsp; Every city needs a couple of huge hospitals.&nbsp; We already have them - SGH, NUH and <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Tan</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Tock</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Seng</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.&nbsp; I suggest that they limit their new hospital to around 400 beds, big enough to accommodate a range of specialties, and yet small enough to be manageable and be patient-friendly.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Hospital in the North</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third example, the general hospital in the north.&nbsp; During the last general elections, DPM Dr Tony Tan promised a hospital in the north.&nbsp; In fact, he appointed Senior Minister of State Ho Peng Kee to head a committee to identify a site for the hospital.&nbsp; I am seeing through the commitment.&nbsp; Currently, we do not have any hospital in the north.&nbsp; All our hospitals are in the south.&nbsp; I have been studying the ambulance travelling time between Woodlands and our A&amp;E departments.&nbsp; They are still within acceptable limits but, at times, pressing the boundary.&nbsp; There are already a million Singaporeans living in the north and north-east.&nbsp; They can well justify a general hospital.&nbsp; So we shall site the rebuilt <p align=left>Column: 2197<p><st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Alexandra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Hospital</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> in the north.&nbsp; My Ministry has been working informally with Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth example, integrated healthcare services in the West.&nbsp; I have been discussing with Minister Lim Boon Heng on existing healthcare services in Jurong.&nbsp; There are many players - a tertiary hospital in NUH, a community hospital, several nursing homes, and there is a new polyclinic coming up at Jurong West, and, of course, many GPs.&nbsp; So the residents are adequately served for the moment.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a plan to build a new <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Jurong General</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.&nbsp; A site has been reserved.&nbsp; We could proceed with this plan.&nbsp; But I persuaded Minister Lim Boon Heng that it is better to postpone the plan for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us focus instead on the software of delivering healthcare services to see if we can transform existing services to serve the Jurong residents better through greater use of IT, adoption of innovative ideas that link up the various players in a seamless manner.&nbsp; The idea is to put patients at the centre and with services reorganised around the patients.&nbsp; I think such a patient-centric, software-driven project in Jurong is much more meaningful than simply building another general hospital.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have tentatively codenamed this project: \"Jurong health-connect\".&nbsp; It is to pilot a new concept of care at our polyclinics with virtual links to day-care facilities, nursing homes and community hospitals,&nbsp;with&nbsp; close cooperation, weekly joint management meetings, single case files for each patient across the continuum of care.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will attempt what Dr Tan Cheng Bock outlined yesterday: \"manage chronic<p align=left>Column: 2198<p> diseases, like diabetes and hypertension in a proactive manner, but outside of hospitals\", ie, a public and private partnership that not only treats the disease but also prompts the patients to manage their risk factors so as to avoid costly hospitalisation.&nbsp; This will enable us to serve patients better for both acute illnesses as well as chronic diseases.&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it was reported that quite a large proportion of diagnosis and treatment traditionally carried out in a general hospital could in fact be done in a community setting.&nbsp; This is less traumatic for the patients, besides saving them money.&nbsp; Can the Jurong West Polyclinic be the nerve centre for this new concept of care?&nbsp; If so, it may have to be enhanced physically to provide a wider range of services.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the elderly requiring long-term care, there is the St. Luke's <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Community</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and several nursing homes and day rehabilitation centres run both privately and by VWOs.&nbsp; But the services are fragmented as they are all facility-centric.&nbsp; Can we bring all these services to a higher level by linking them up through IT and also link them up to NUH and AH so that the care of patients can be centrally coordinated, even as they progress through the various healthcare facilities?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it worth doing?&nbsp; I read the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Hansard</i> recently and I recall there was at least one sitting during which Dr Lily Neo made several suggestions on how public and&nbsp;private sector healthcare services could be integrated to provide the elderly and the chronic sick with a better level of care.&nbsp; And this morning, she proposed more ideas on this issue, including having holistic treatment for the elderly and one-stop diagnostic centres.&nbsp; The question is how to convert intent into practical ideas which can be executed on the ground.&nbsp; But we know now who to call to help us in this project.&nbsp; So besides Dr Lily Neo, Dr<p align=left>Column: 2199<p> Tan Cheng Bock will be invited to join the Fellowship of the Ring.&nbsp; And, perhaps, Dr Tan Cheng Bock shall be Gandalf, our wise counsellor.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Boon Heng was persuaded by my plan and signed on to the Fellowship quite early on.&nbsp; He brought with him his full GRC backing on the ground.&nbsp; So Mdm Halimah is in the Ring too.&nbsp; We will work together to flesh out Jurong Health-connect and make it work for the residents there.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As providers, we will put patients at the centre of our focus.&nbsp; But I hope Singaporeans, in turn, will put their health at the centre of their focus.&nbsp; They can do so by adopting a healthy lifestyle, but not merely chanting the mantra, but actually doing it.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis asked how Singaporeans' attitude towards healthy lifestyle has changed over the years.&nbsp; The cup is half-full and half-empty.&nbsp; On the one hand, many more Singaporeans have moved to the right side of the divide.&nbsp; The percentage of Singaporeans doing exercise regularly has gone up, from 14% in 1992, 10 years ago, to&nbsp;20% now, ie, one in five.&nbsp; The percentage of Singaporean smokers has fallen from 18% to 14%.&nbsp; Tens of thousands of Singaproeans exercise in our public parks, especially during the weekends.&nbsp; Mayor Teo Ho Pin is a champion of healthy lifestyle in his CDC.&nbsp; He started brisk walking clubs and he told me that he was pleased to note the steady increase in both the number of clubs and the number of participants.&nbsp; And occasionally, he told me he organised joint brisk walking among all the clubs and would be able to gather 10,000, 20,000 walkers in one session.&nbsp; Quite impressive!</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, many are still not exercising regularly.&nbsp; Many are still over-weight.&nbsp; Many with hypertension and <p align=left>Column: 2200<p>diabetes still do not know that they have such problems.&nbsp; So we are getting better, but we certainly can do more.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promotion requires a multi-pronged approach, as pointed out by Mr Ahmad Khalis.&nbsp; This is because young children, working adults, older individuals have different needs.&nbsp; To reach out, we need all the 3P sectors - the people, public, private - to work together.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH is grateful to the Ministry of Education for its efforts in getting our kids to acquire a healthy attitude from young.&nbsp; We are also grateful to the Ministry of National Development for their many, many parks.&nbsp; I am especially pleased to read that NParks is expanding and will be adding more park connectors.&nbsp; And, of course, we also thank the Singapore Sports Council for their many sporting activities, including the Annual Singapore Marathon which several MPs and I took part recently, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the workplace where more than half of the population spend a significant amount of their time, we have great opportunity to promote health.&nbsp; Where the company's CEO and management are personally committed, their company will tend to have the right environment for everyone to follow.&nbsp; And that is why it is so important for all of us in this House to set personal examples.&nbsp; I have been in the Ministry of Health for nearly eight months now.&nbsp; I have never used the lifts.&nbsp; When I started, I would not bump into anybody at the staircase.&nbsp; Now, I do, and often.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH, unlike my previous offices, does not have an office gym, because there is an excellent one in SGH campus.&nbsp; I use it regularly during lunch time.&nbsp; So compared to my previous office, it is a bit inconvenient because you have to change, expose yourself in shorts and drive there.&nbsp; But after a while, I realise that it actually serves an additional purpose.&nbsp; Hopefully,<p align=left>Column: 2201<p> the taxi drivers and patients in the queue will be inspired to follow suit.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis asked if there were statistics to prove that healthy lifestyle did reduce sickness rate.&nbsp; There are plenty.&nbsp; They are all in the literature, you can find it on the Internet.&nbsp; But he is certainly correct to say that we need to design programmes that will cater specifically to segments of the population which are more prone to certain diseases.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo spoke passionately about elderly healthcare.&nbsp; And she has done so often in this House and has made many good suggestions.&nbsp; We have to work together to get the elderly to stay physically, mentally and socially fit.&nbsp; Being old does not mean frail or disengaged from society.&nbsp; In fact, there are many elderly Singaporeans who remain active.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at the 96th birthday party of Venerable Shi Chin Yam of Man Fut Tong recently.&nbsp; She is tireless raising funds for her inmates.&nbsp; At the party, she told us that she is launching a new project to build an orphanage.&nbsp; At the age of 96!</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining a healthy lifestyle from cradle to grave is the key.&nbsp; Managing and controlling the risk factors are important.&nbsp; The cost of screening these risk factors is inexpensive.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many are still not aware of their risk factors.&nbsp; At the grassroots level, many of us are organising such mass screenings, as pointed out by Dr Neo just now.&nbsp; At the workplace, simple health screening for hypertension and diabetes can uncover hidden health problems.&nbsp; I really hope more companies can be enlightened to offer this for their employees.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am for more opportunistic screening.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; Every day, 1% of Singaporeans will visit some doctors, public, private, clinic, hospital, somewhere.&nbsp; So while the doctors attend to the patients' immediate needs, there is an <p align=left>Column: 2202<p>opportunity for them to also screen the patients for the common risk factors, if this has not already been done recently, and then, more importantly, document the results in the patients' electronic medical record.&nbsp; In this way, we update the Singaporeans' electronic medical record regularly, making it a lifelong medical record, one for each Singaporean.&nbsp; This can potentially transform the whole practice of medicine in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and bring the management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, to a higher plane.&nbsp; Through the proposed Jurong Health-connect, we hope to pilot some of these ideas.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo also stressed the greater promotion of preventive healthcare.&nbsp; Yesterday, she pointed to the tiny budget of the Health Promotion Board, not so tiny, about $100 million, and supported a bigger budget for HPB.&nbsp; I must thank her.&nbsp; I always thank MPs who support bigger budget for the Ministry of Health.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has and will continue to support worthy initiatives, especially in the area of health promotion and preventive care.&nbsp; Effective programmes, by the way, need not always be costly.&nbsp; Much can be achieved if we have champions who are passionate and creative.&nbsp; Also, it is how you cleverly leverage other people.&nbsp; Although we said only 90 million or 80-odd million dollars are for Health Promotion Board, this Government actually invests billions every year in health promotion.&nbsp; The entire budget of the Ministry of the Environment is for health promotion.&nbsp; You have clean water, you remove all the rats, as what Minister Lim Swee Say is trying to do, you are improving people's healthcare.&nbsp; You keep the air clean, you improve the healthcare for everybody.&nbsp; Likewise for Ministry of Education, the huge budget in the schools promoting healthy lifestyle, that is health promotion.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also bear in mind that,&nbsp;in principle, while nobody can disagree with<p align=left>Column: 2203<p> more preventive healthcare, it is also possible to go over-board.&nbsp; There is a recent rather controversial trend in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> where millions of people have been diagnosed with one or, often, several, what they call, \"pre-disease\", before disease, conditions.&nbsp; The controversial question is what to do with such pre-disease conditions?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preventive medicine is at its best, if pre-disease diagnosis leads to lifestyle changes: cut out salt, cut out sugar, cut down weight, exercise more.&nbsp; Preventive medicine is at its worst, if pre-disease diagnosis leads to over-treatment, over-medication: often expensive drugs paid for by insurers or the State.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">1.30 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is the challenge of managing preventive medicine.&nbsp; I am watching this US trend very closely.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to Members' points about making Singapore a regional&nbsp;medical hub.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo spoke about having competitive costs in order to attract foreign patients.&nbsp; I totally agree.&nbsp; As is the case with other sectors of the economy, if we do not have a good handle over our cost-competitiveness, we can forget about trying to maximise our potential as a regional medical hub.&nbsp; An important part of our strategy is to recruit and train many more doctors and nurses.&nbsp; Matching supply of healthcare workers to demand is the key to ensuring that even as we become a regional medical hub, we do not inadvertently push up overall healthcare costs.&nbsp; If foreign patient load grows, without a corresponding increase in doctors and nurses, then healthcare cost <p align=left>Column: 2204<p>is bound to rise.&nbsp; I therefore agree with Dr Wang Kai Yuen on the need to review our control of medical school enrolments and have more flexible market-based manpower policies.&nbsp; We certainly should not inadvertently protect a cartel.&nbsp; I am tackling this at various fronts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have increased the NUS medical intake from 150 to 230.&nbsp; The next increase in intake will be when a new graduate medical school working with Duke University starts in the SGH Campus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, MOH has expanded the list of recognised foreign universities and medical schools to 71.&nbsp; I hope to do more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we have allowed fast-track entry of foreign-trained specialists already registered in the UK and Australia.&nbsp; As a result, the number of foreign-trained specialists practising&nbsp; in Singapore has grown by an annual rate of 23% per year in recent years.&nbsp; Can we do more?&nbsp; I posed this question to the SMC recently: why can we not allow fast-track accreditation of all US-board certified specialists?&nbsp; They have&nbsp;reviewed, and they have just decided.&nbsp; They will allow this for nine specialties, eg, general surgery, orthopaedics and so on, and they are actively looking into the other specialties, as there are significant differences in the training structure and duration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we are getting our hospitals to redesign jobs and re-engineer their processes to make nursing a desirable profession again.&nbsp; This will improve the students' attitude towards nursing as a profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, we are exploring setting up a local degree course in nursing in our university to provide the next generation of nursing leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2205<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, we are recruiting foreign nurses from countries like the Philippines and China.&nbsp; There is a global shortage of qualified nurses.&nbsp; Despite our efforts, the clusters still have 200 vacancies.&nbsp; We have to work harder on this front.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo pointed out that, in order to sustain advantage in quality, we must always pay attention to medical training and, hopefully, the training of medical doctors as well as nurses can also be part of Singapore's intention to be an education hub.&nbsp; I totally agree with that.&nbsp; Hopefully, the Duke University partnership at the SGH Campus can help&nbsp;stimulate development along that line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Gan See Khem that the public sector has a role to play in the regional medical hub.&nbsp; Let us work together.&nbsp; But we need to manage it properly because, by mandate, our public hospital workers must be to serve Singaporeans first, especially the bottom 50%.&nbsp; However, where the hospital has the capacity to do more, having acquired a regional reputation and strong finance, I think they should pro-actively pursue international patients on their own or jointly with private hospitals.&nbsp; In fact, I am trying to work with the Singapore National Eye Centre to see how we can try to meet these two contradictory goals of serving Singaporean needs and, at the same time, serving foreign patient needs.&nbsp; Hopefully, we can learn from that experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayor Zainul Abidin and Dr Lily Neo talked about marketing Singapore and gave many useful suggestions.&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested that we should focus on niche specialties where we have a competitive edge and adopt a total approach in promoting them.&nbsp; Singapore Medicine has identified a few areas that we will intensively market, and these are likely to be specialties that have large patient populations in the region, and would include areas like opthalmology, <p align=left>Column: 2206<p>cancer, heart, etc.&nbsp; Singapore Tourism Board is also in active dialogue with healthcare providers, travel agencies, hotels and other service providers to ensure that the diverse needs and requirements of our foreign patients are catered for.&nbsp; The issue of medical visas, I think raised by Mr Ahmad Khalis and Mr Gan Kim Yong, is also actively being reviewed.&nbsp; The objective is to make it easy for foreign patients to come here for treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me respond to Mr Low Thia Khiang's point on medical standards.&nbsp; He reminded us that while we cut cost, let us not cut corners.&nbsp; I do not intend to do so.&nbsp; I think we would have failed in our duty, if medical standards deteriorate as a result of whatever objective that we may be at the same time tackling.&nbsp; The bottomline is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;In healthcare, if you are rich, regardless of what&nbsp;the healthcare system is, you are all right because you can fly to anywhere you want.&nbsp; If you are poor but not too sickly, also never mind, because whether your healthcare is good or bad, you will cure yourself anyway.&nbsp; Our immune system will take care of that.&nbsp; But if you are poor and you are very sick, where would you rather be within, let us say, a 7-hour flying radius of Singapore?&nbsp; I think it is Singapore.&nbsp; Yes, it is easy and politically sweet to promise a 30-baht medicine.&nbsp; But a 30-baht medicine is no use, if you need a bypass or you have serious cancer.&nbsp; I think we have a good system in Singapore.&nbsp; It does not happen by accident.&nbsp; It is an investment that we have done&nbsp;over many years, and my job is to continue to build on that.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Could he tell us what is the average waiting time now?&nbsp; Has it improved?</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; It is not a clarification.&nbsp; It is a question.&nbsp; Do you want to answer that question, Mr Khaw?</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> There are two questions.&nbsp; One is on data to support why we say the medical standard in Singapore is not bad.&nbsp; However, I do not think this is the occasion, because I do not carry those data.&nbsp; One of these days, I will publish an occasional paper and the Member&nbsp;can see for himself.&nbsp; But, anecdotally, we all know who come here for treatment, like some of the VVIPs that we handle in Singapore.&nbsp; We know where the better healthcare standard is, Singapore <I>vis-a-vis</I> the others.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to waiting time, many years ago, when I started my career as a hospital CEO in 1984, young and naive, I told my management team at NUH - at that time, it included Dr Jennifer Lee -&nbsp;\"Let us run a hospital with zero waiting time.\"&nbsp; As an engineer, I thought I could bring engineering practice into medicine, so that we can systematically manage the clinic, eg, a new case will require 30 minutes, repeat case maybe 15 or&nbsp;20 minutes, and then we can schedule things, and so on.&nbsp; But I quickly discover that the reality outside is not like in textbooks.&nbsp; I remember one conversation I had with the former head&nbsp;of orthopaedic surgery.&nbsp; He had a busy practice, with many Indian ladies as his patients.&nbsp; He said: \"You know, Khaw Boon Wan, when the Indian ladies come, especially those in sarees,<p align=left>Column: 2208<p> they take more time to change\".&nbsp; So, he said,&nbsp; \"Please give me more time.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, more importantly, it is because illnesses differ.&nbsp; I think we have had that discussion not too long ago.&nbsp; Yes, we can schedule so many patients and so on, but once you have a complicated case, clinic management goes haywire.&nbsp; Should we, for the sake of efficiency, even though this patient may need one hour to look after,&nbsp;cut corners and just go for the scheduled 20 minutes so that everybody would not have to wait too long?&nbsp; We cannot.&nbsp; So, I have&nbsp;resigned myself to the fact that clinic waiting is a phenomenon which is impossible to eliminate.&nbsp; But what one can do is try to reduce it.&nbsp; And this will require cooperation all round, from the patients especially.&nbsp; There are data to show that \"no shows\" - \"no shows\" means I have an appointment but I do not turn up - are, unfortunately, still very common.&nbsp; And the more \"no shows\" you have,&nbsp;in order to better utilise the resources, the more I have to overbook because, if I do not overbook and there is no show, then the doctor will be shaking legs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can run a clinic with zero-waiting.&nbsp; But to run a clinic with zero-waiting means that I must have expensive resources waiting for business.&nbsp; And that is the model in the private hospitals.&nbsp; I charge high because my patients cannot afford to wait too long.&nbsp; But, yes, I see maybe 30 patients a month, instead of 30 patients a day, as in the public hospitals.&nbsp; The economics are completely different.&nbsp; So, if you want to keep healthcare costs low and as affordable as possible, I think we have no choice but to exercise our resources to the maximum, which means I have to work them at high occupancy level, whether it is wards or clinics and, unfortunately, as a result of that, I am afraid some waiting is inevitable.&nbsp; But, of course, the waiting cannot be because the doctors or nurses are having prolonged lunch or meetings and then not turning&nbsp;up&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2209<p>at the appointed time.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Indeed, patient confidentiality is one key issue, and it has always been the issue, whether it is paper-based or IT-based.&nbsp; Today, it is not electronic medical records, it is paper medical records, but we also have to preserve patient confidentiality.&nbsp; In fact, with electronic medical records, it is easier to audit and manage.&nbsp; What is the concern?&nbsp; The concern is doctors or nurses may look into medical records of patients whom they have nothing to do with, somewhat being&nbsp;a \"busybody\".&nbsp; And you can be a busybody today.&nbsp; Doctors can walk into our medical records office and take out medical files.&nbsp; But, with IT,&nbsp;I can now track who are the busybodies, eg, someone&nbsp;who&nbsp;handles, say,&nbsp;2,000 patients a month but has accessed 3,000 medical records.&nbsp; Something must be wrong, right?&nbsp; Then we can look into it.&nbsp; But whatever it is, the profession has to respect its promise to preserve patient confidentiality.&nbsp; And my intent is that it may be useful every year to remind all our healthcare workers about the need to preserve patient confidentiality.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Thus, our investments on the Health Manpower Development Programme (HMDP) should be enhanced.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what steps have been taken to ensure this?&nbsp; May I also ask him whether our hospital doctors are too preoccupied with daily routines that require them to manage maximal numbers of patients, as the Minister said earlier on maximising their time and effort, and leave the seniors with little or no time to teach the juniors who in turn have no time to be trained?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Unless we monitor our health-risk factors regularly and adopt a healthy lifestyle, many of us may have to spend the last few years of our lives burdened with ill health and disability.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NTUC Health Outreach Programme, an on-site basis health screening programme, has already reached 50,000 workers in the last four years.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry will also consider a structured approach to also give incentives to get Singaporeans to monitor their own individual health risk factors regularly.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the recent survey conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), the prevalence of private sector workplaces that have a comprehensive Workplace Health Programme (WHP) has increased, to 45% in 2003.&nbsp; These companies employ 63.5% of the private sector workforce compared to 26% in 1998.

When I mention the words \"patient siting\", I am referring to where patients should be treated and admitted. Should it be in acute hospitals, community hospitals or nursing homes?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current system of care placement and referral of our elderly patients can definitely be improved upon.&nbsp; With the implementation of Diagnosis Related Grouping (DRG) in acute hospitals some years ago, funding of the hospitals is based on a fixed budget per disease grouping. While it is an efficient system, it definitely places pressures on hospitals to discharge patients as quickly as possible to be cost-effective, as a result of which, elderly patients are most disadvantaged. Those who are not ready yet to go home are referred to step-down facilities. &nbsp; Particularly, these are patients with social problems.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad to say, they would be transferred to the provider who accepts their cases fastest. This is far from ideal if we assess the long-term effects of indiscriminate discharging.&nbsp; For example, an elderly patient who may have rehabilitation enters a nursing home instead, rather than a community hospital, just because the nursing home has no waiting list and a community hospital has.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, may I propose to set up a neutral body comprising&nbsp;independent healthcare personnel, preferably employed by the Ministry of Health, to look into the assessment and the appropriate placements and discharges from hospitals.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2215<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, at the national level, we should definitely promote greater awareness of the various step-down care facilities and their functions. Singaporeans should realise that immobility need not be a natural progression in old age.&nbsp; In fact, in many cases, rehabilitation is the key.&nbsp; This would definitely translate into substantial savings for our entire healthcare system.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Mental Wellness at Work</I><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B>:&nbsp; Sir, we are definitely living in a world where we have to contend with higher stress levels in our jobs as we strive to ensure our employability in such a competitive globalised world.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers are facing a higher frequency of job changes and industry restructuring.

Mr Gan Kim Yong:&nbsp;</b> Sir, last year I urged the Ministry to review the Primary Care Partnership Scheme with a view to<p align=left>Column: 2218<p> broadening its scope.&nbsp; The then Minister replied that more time was needed to gain experience in the scheme before expanding it.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether the time has come for him to reconsider it.&nbsp; Under the PCPS, senior citizens who meet the criteria are allowed to seek treatment at neighbourhood private clinics at subsidised rates instead of having to travel all the way to the Government polyclinics.&nbsp; This has benefited many residents, and save time and travelling costs.&nbsp; The cost to the Government is arguably the same, as they would have enjoyed the same subsidy had they gone to the polyclinics.&nbsp; In view of the benefits of the scheme, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider expanding the scheme to cover at least the following categories:</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the handicapped people who are less mobile.&nbsp; It would be good to cover them under the PCPS to reduce the need for travelling.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, patients requiring long-term medication or treatment.&nbsp; It would be an added burden if they are required to travel to polyclinics to seek treatment or medication on a regular basis.&nbsp; We should consider putting them under PCPS so that they can receive treatment and medication from nearby private clinics.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, low income families, particularly families who are receiving financial assistance from the Government, should be covered under the PCPS regardless of their age.&nbsp; It would not make sense to incur additional travelling cost and time when they are already having problem to make ends meet.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that these groups of people are quite clearly defined.&nbsp; Expanding the PCPS to cover them is unlikely to lead to major abuse.&nbsp; Therefore, I would urge the Government to consider reviewing the qualifying<p align=left>Column: 2219<p> criteria of the PCPS so that these people will also benefit from the scheme.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, with greater transparency, which is something that I applaud, and a population that is better educated, it becomes imperative for doctors and nurses to develop good communication skills and bedside manners.&nbsp; What I am saying here is from my experience as both care-giver and a patient.&nbsp; Currently, both the Certificate in Nursing and the Diploma in Nursing have modules, in some cases, elective, that deal with communication skills.&nbsp; In other cases, bits of it are incorporated in the general course.&nbsp; I hope that in the proposed degree course in nursing, and in all these other courses, communication skills which play an important role be made a compulsory module.&nbsp; Housemen, nurses and trainee nurses whom I spoke to, say that much of it is left as an on-the-job training, and depended on a good mentor to take them through.&nbsp; It is my hope that the Ministry will look into this.&nbsp; As the public gets more and more educated, they would need more information.&nbsp; The way information is given to them becomes very important as it will help them make considered choices in an era of greater transparency.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I totally endorse what Dr Lily<p align=left>Column: 2220<p> Neo brought up about the image of the nurses.&nbsp; It is my hope that mutual respect, or a process towards attaining mutual respect, can be taken on by the Ministry with the help of the Singapore Nurses Association, which I think can play a bigger role in all of these.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b>&nbsp; Sir, the Minister had cited shortage of skilled manpower as one of the three reasons for the increase in healthcare cost in the recent discussion on this subject in Parliament.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how the Ministry proposes to deal with the shortage of skilled manpower.&nbsp; The many developments that we now see will continue to impose considerable strains on our manpower resources, and Singaporeans fear it will cause healthcare cost to go up.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at the situation in terms of the manning position of our healthcare sector.&nbsp; Currently, about 40-50% of the staff strength at the ward level in our hospitals are already taken up by foreign nurses, and about 25% at the hospital level are also taken up by foreign nurses.&nbsp; There are about 1,500 vacancies in the healthcare services which are not filled.&nbsp; Juxtapose this against the demands that are going to be imposed on the manpower needs as a result of certain developments, one of which is the announcement on the part of the Government last year to develop Singapore into a leading healthcare services hub in Asia by increasing the number of foreign patients in Singapore from 211,000 in 2002 to&nbsp;one million by 2012, and juxtapose that also against a rapidly ageing population that will impose serious demands on healthcare services, the problem is very apparent.&nbsp; And it has been estimated that by 2030, the elderly will make up 43% of total hospital admissions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are also reminded by the recent exodus of doctors from the public<p align=left>Column: 2221<p> hospitals.&nbsp; A recent media report cited that 177 doctors had left the public sector to join the private sector, including 43 specialists.&nbsp; So the question on everybody's mind is&nbsp;whether such an exodus will result in higher wages to attract and retain even more doctors and specialists.&nbsp; Sir, while Singaporeans will not disagree with the objective of building a medical hub, it is good as it will contribute significantly to our GDP. &nbsp;Singaporeans are, however, concerned that a busy medical hub treating many foreign patients, coupled with the other severe resource constraints that I have mentioned, will push up healthcare cost as public hospitals will then have to compete with private hospitals for specialists, doctors and nurses.&nbsp; There is clearly a need to match supply of healthcare workers with demand to ensure that healthcare cost will not escalate.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how the shortage of skilled manpower will be addressed, and what more can the Ministry do to make the healthcare sector much more attractive to Singaporeans, and what steps will be taken to ensure that turning Singapore into a medical hub will not result in higher medical cost for Singaporeans.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</B> Sir, first, I would like to thank Dr Lily Neo, Ms Braema, Mdm Halimah on their questions on doctors, nurses and the supply of skilled healthcare manpower, Dr Michael Lim and Mr Gan on the question of primary healthcare, Mr Yeo on physical and mental health in the workplace, and Dr Chong on where patients should be appropriately treated.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin, I want to point out that the healthcare system in Singapore is a good system, and has improved the health of Singaporeans.&nbsp; On average, our system has increased the life expectancy of Singaporeans by&nbsp;three months every year, <p align=left>Column: 2222<p>over the last 20 years.&nbsp; The life expectancy was 73.3 years in 1984.&nbsp; Today, it is 78.9 years.&nbsp; We expect it to exceed 80 years by the end of the decade.&nbsp; Singaporeans enjoy a higher life expectancy than most people in the world.&nbsp; It is higher than even that of the US, the country that is the origin of most of the recent advances in medicine.&nbsp; If we are cutting corners, as suggested by Mr Low Thia Khiang, Singaporeans would not be living to such a ripe old age.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our challenge is to maintain this high quality system at an affordable cost.&nbsp; To do this, our healthcare delivery must be as efficient as possible.&nbsp; Healthcare is an expensive service.&nbsp; More than half the cost in healthcare service involves paying for the services of skilled people - doctors, nurses and other paramedical professionals.&nbsp; Our healthcare system can be more efficient if we use the services of healthcare professionals in an efficient and appropriate manner.&nbsp; For example, if a patient has caught the flu and has a cough, he could decide to see a lung specialist.&nbsp; He would make an appointment at the specialist clinic, wait a while and see the specialist.&nbsp; The specialist can treat the cough and prescribe a cough mixture.&nbsp; But if the patient says to the lung specialist, \"This medicine is for my cough, but my nose is stuffy, do I have a sinus problem?\", the lung specialist will refer him to the Ear, Nose and Throat doctor or ENT doctor.&nbsp; He goes to the ENT clinic, waits a little while more, then gets his sinus checked and will be given more medication.&nbsp; As the patient is about to leave the ENT clinic, if he says he feels bloated, then the ENT surgeon will refer him to a doctor looking after the digestive system.&nbsp; If he thinks the problem is at the upper end, the referral is to a gastrologist.&nbsp; If he thinks it is the lower end, the referral is to a colorectal doctor.&nbsp; If the ENT doctor is not sure, the patient gets referred to both.&nbsp; This is an example of expensive and inefficient delivery of healthcare.&nbsp; But if the patient had seen a <p align=left>Column: 2223<p>GP, the GP would have treated all the complaints in one consultation.&nbsp; Many patients are seeing specialists when a primary physician can take care of the problem.&nbsp; This is why our specialist clinic attendance is growing at the rate of 6%.&nbsp; It is also driving the cost of healthcare upwards.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean that patients do not need specialists.&nbsp; At times they do need to see a specialist, but the problem that the public sometimes faces is that they may not know when and which specialist to consult.&nbsp; If every family in Singapore had a family doctor, then by consulting the family doctor or GP, they would know when they need to see a specialist and when the family doctor can take care of their medical problem.&nbsp; The family doctor can serve as a friend and mentor to the patient and as a gatekeeper who directs traffic within our sophisticated healthcare system.&nbsp; GPs and polyclinic doctors are the key to solving the proper matching of health resources in our system to the health needs of the patient.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> My Ministry has, therefore, instituted measures and programmes to encourage Singaporeans to see their family physicians and general practitioners in the private and public sectors.&nbsp; Singaporeans must also play their part.&nbsp; Where a medical problem can be settled at GP clinics or polyclinics, it should be done so, and when the medical problem has to be referred, it should be directed to the right specialist.&nbsp; Such habits will reduce cost and build a long term doctor-patient relationship where there is commitment to care and trust between the patient and the primary care doctor.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has programmes to facilitate primary healthcare for special groups by improving accessibility of subsidised care.&nbsp; For example, there are<p align=left>Column: 2224<p> many less well-off elderly who do not live near polyclinics.&nbsp; Getting to polyclinics can be inconvenient for them and for such elderly patients, the Ministry brings affordable healthcare closer to them through the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS), which was mentioned by Mr Gan.&nbsp; Under this scheme, my Ministry engages private general practitioners and dentists to provide common outpatient medical and dental treatment to needy elderly.&nbsp; These elderly pay polyclinic charges for such services.&nbsp; The number of elderly on the scheme has increased over the last one year, as a result of our outreach efforts, which include road shows at Senior Activity Centres and door-to-door promotion at 1- to 3-room HDB flats.&nbsp; More than 15,000 elderly are now on the scheme, compared to 5,000 elderly one year ago.&nbsp; That is a 300% increase in the number of patients in one year, and we will continue to look at ways of increasing the scope of this programme.&nbsp; This programme is currently served by 570 GPs and 210 dental clinics.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Night clinics were previously set up so that lower income Singaporeans could have the convenience of subsidised medical attention at night instead of having to wait until the following day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven night clinics have been set up so far.&nbsp; The polyclinics deploy their own doctors and also engage private GPs to provide the night clinic services.&nbsp; Each clinic employs an average of&nbsp;three doctors and sees about 57 patients a night.&nbsp; The cost per patient of providing polyclinic service at night is much higher than that during the day.&nbsp; So we will review these services to see if this is the most efficient way of providing primary healthcare.&nbsp; As suggested, perhaps GPs in the clinics may be a more efficient way of providing this care at night.&nbsp; The clusters have no plans to expand night clinic services.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the healthcare cluster, better vertical integration of hospital and primary care services has resulted in shared care<p align=left>Column: 2225<p> programmes between hospitals, polyclinics and general practitioners.&nbsp; This enables the coordination and management of diseases across the spectrum of care from primary to secondary to tertiary care to achieve better outcomes.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Health education is important and besides using the various media, it is also conveyed through the polyclinics or by GPs, who can obtain free health education materials from the Health Promotion Board (HPB) either directly or through the Singapore Medical Association and the polyclinics. Doctors and patients can also download health education materials from HPB's website. Patient education tools have also been developed by HPB to help GPs provide education to patients with chronic conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>The sick elderly and right placement of care</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong brought up the issue of the right placement of patients so that they can get the appropriate care. Our elderly utilise more healthcare services because there are more health problems as a person grows older.&nbsp; There are challenges here&nbsp; -&nbsp; to deliver care at the right place at the right time.&nbsp; The community hospitals and nursing homes, whose focus is rehabilitation, provide lower cost and a&nbsp; more holistic care compared to acute hospitals. Elderly patients sent to the appropriate facility have better long term recovery. Wrong placement, on the other hand, results in unnecessary financial and social costs. A patient who should be rehabilitated in a community hospital but instead goes to a nursing home may not receive the optimum care to get back to <p align=left>Column: 2226<p>their full rehabilitation potential.&nbsp; On the other&nbsp;hand, the patient who is better taken care of in the community hospital but stays in a more costly acute hospital may be consuming health resources to a greater degree than is needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of awareness of healthcare services must be tackled.&nbsp; My Ministry intends to pilot an Aged Care Assessment Programme (ACAP) to promote right placement of care in hospitals, community hospitals, nursing homes, day rehabilitation facilities and the patients' own homes as appropriate.&nbsp; We will train health care professionals in the acute hospital to be familiar with the criteria for step down and rehabilitation services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Workplace health and mental wellness at work</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prevention is better than cure and getting the public to lead a healthy lifestyle in a healthy environment will reduce the consumption of healthcare services as more people remain healthy.&nbsp; Two-thirds of Singaporeans work and spend a minimum of&nbsp; eight hours in the workplace daily. No company wants poor health amongst its employees. My Ministry is serious about healthy lifestyle amongst working Singaporeans. Workplace health programmes promote healthy lifestyle among employees, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, smoking cessation and mental wellness. To encourage workplace health, my Ministry gives a grant of up to $5,000 to companies to start workplace health promotion programmes.&nbsp; They can also apply to the Skills Development Fund for funding workplace health promotion training. We recognise that a collaborative approach from employer and employee is needed.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has pointed out that NTUC is actively promoting this.&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board and NTUC will launch a pilot project to reward employees for participating in workplace health activities.&nbsp; Singapore National<p align=left>Column: 2227<p> Employers' Federation (SNEF) is also HPB's key partner to promote healthy lifestyle in the workplace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo raised the issue of mental wellness of workers. Stress is a concern and mental wellness is important to work effectively.&nbsp; HPB conducts public education programmes on stress management and managing depression for workers, students and the elderly.&nbsp; The Institute of Mental Health has plans to implement an Employee Assistance Programme to provide confidential counselling either through the telephone or in person for employees.&nbsp; With this programme, we hope tragedies like that mentioned by Mr Yeo would occur less frequently in future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Medical and healthcare manpower</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of questions were also raised on our medical and nursing manpower, the training of doctors, nurses, morale and communication skills of these healthcare workers. One key challenge is to safeguard our medical standards whilst we strive to achieve optimum numbers of skilled and competent healthcare professionals to meet the healthcare needs of Singaporeans, as well as to support our drive to become a regional medical hub. Healthcare manpower is highly skilled and takes many years to train, and you need the right mix of skilled manpower - doctors, nurses, pharmacists, therapists and health science professionals.&nbsp; All must move and work together for smooth progress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Protracted training required</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protracted training required to develop these professionals poses a major challenge in managing manpower. It takes up to 12 years from entering as a medical student to becoming a medical specialist; and perhaps another 10-12 years to reach <p align=left>Column: 2228<p>the pinnacle of excellence in&nbsp;a specialty. Three to four years are required to train entry-level practitioners for the various healthcare professionals like nurses and therapists. But it takes many more years of training and experience to produce highly skilled nursing professionals and therapists. There are no quick-fix solutions, but we are working to enlarge our local base of professionals as well as drawing talent from overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Raising intake of students</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have raised the annual intakes of students. For example, the intake of medical students in NUS has risen from 150 in 1996 to 230 in 2003. We have also lifted the quota on the number of female medical students, and to answer Dr Neo's question, in 2003, the intake of female medical students was 43%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also recognised more overseas medical schools - from 24 to 71 schools in 2003.&nbsp; For the past three years, an average of 100 doctors from recognised overseas medical schools were registered per year.&nbsp; The Singapore Medical Council has also allowed the clusters to employ doctors with non-registrable degrees under temporary registration, provided such doctors are very closely supervised. For the past three years, the total number of such doctors registered averaged 120 per year.&nbsp; We will continue to increase the supply of skilled healthcare manpower without compromising the standard of these personnel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 13.9% vacancy in junior doctor positions in the last quarter of 2002 was reduced to 6.2% in the last quarter of 2003.&nbsp; To put in another way, the number of filled positions had risen from 1,470 to 1,656. For medical specialists, although there is a 40% specialist cap, we are still some way from reaching this as specialists presently only comprise 35% of all fully and conditionally registered <p align=left>Column: 2229<p>doctors in Singapore. With the development of the regional medical hub, we will require more specialists to provide good quality care, both in the public and private sectors as well as to moderate healthcare cost increases.&nbsp; If there is a need, this cap will be removed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Nurses</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For nurses, the intake of nursing students into the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) had increased from 146 in 2001 to 204 in 2002 and 238 in 2003.&nbsp; The number of new nursing students has to match the number of nursing instructors that can be recruited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanyang Polytechnic had also an increased intake of nursing students from 588 in 2001 to 707 in 2002 and 854 in 2003.&nbsp; More lecturers are being recruited by ITE.&nbsp; Nanyang Polytechnic is also actively recruiting clinical instructors.&nbsp; It has increased the number of lecturers and clinical instructors from 73 in 2001 to 87 in 2004.&nbsp; We are making progress, though there are no quick-fixes to the problem of training new nurses and doctors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clusters continue to recruit foreign nurses to supplement locally trained nurses from Nanyang Polytechnic and the ITE.&nbsp; Measures will be implemented to reduce the attrition rate of foreign nurses and to encourage the better ones to commit to a long-term career with us. A new work pass, which will replace the existing Q2 pass, with effect from July 2004 will benefit many foreign nurses by allowing them to bring in their dependants. This may help to retain good nurses. MOH is also looking into reducing the waiting time for good foreign nurses to obtain permanent resident status.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vacancies for nurses in public sector institutions had been reduced from 4.1% in 2002 to 2.4% in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of public sector nurses increased from 8,575 in 2002 to 9,065 nurses in 2003. The<p align=left>Column: 2230<p> attrition rate of public sector nurses in 2003 was high&nbsp; - about 14%. The two healthcare clusters have targeted to reduce the attrition rate to 10% by 2005. A multi-pronged approach is being taken to achieve this, including balanced work schedules, job redesign, improving career pathways, training and development programmes and review of nurses' salary to ensure competitiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing healthcare manpower, we have heard much about other professionals and retrenched workers who switched vocations to enter healthcare. The Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme (Healthcare) implemented by MOH and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) is for mid-career workers who want to take up job opportunities in the healthcare sector. Under this programme, mid-career diploma courses have been launched to train registered nurses and diagnostic radiographers. The trainees are provided with full sponsorship and a training allowance. The first two batches of 109 trainees are undergoing the two-year accelerated diploma in nursing at Nanyang Polytechnic, and the third batch started in July this year&nbsp; -&nbsp; the target is 100 new trainees.&nbsp; Half of the trainees already have university degrees and the feedback on the programme has been positive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NTUC and the National Heart Centre have also launched the Skills Training and Employability Enhancement for Retrenched Workers (STEER) programme for training of Enrolled Nurses, Healthcare Assistants and Health Attendants.&nbsp; There are a total of 215 trainees for STEER, out of which 114 trainees have graduated from the Healthcare Assistant and Health Attendant programmes, and 101 trainees are currently undergoing the training for Enrolled Nurses, Healthcare Assistants and Health Attendants positions.&nbsp; There are also on-the-job programmes run by ITE together with participating healthcare employers. These include various types of<p align=left>Column: 2231<p> ITE Skills Certificate in Healthcare, including outpatient, inpatient, homecare and clinic practice skills, which takes one year to complete as well as a similar Skills Redevelopment Programme which takes nine months to complete.&nbsp; ITE also runs short skills based programmes of three months for health service, housekeeping operations and patient service and a six-month course on rehabilitation therapy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Morale of doctors</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Neo was&nbsp; concerned about the morale of doctors.&nbsp; We believe that the morale of our healthcare workers is good or even excellent. Our regular six-monthly survey of doctors indicated that over 90% of medical officers are satisfied with their work and postings. Doctors have traditionally worked long hours. During my years as a trainee, I routinely worked more than 100 hours a week for many years. Because this was a historical practice, it does not mean that we should carry on making our doctors work such long hours. All over the world, as has been pointed out by Dr Neo, in the US and Europe, steps are being taken to reduce the working hours of junior doctors. We too are gradually reducing their working hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of reduction of hours,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>in 2003, 18% of our junior doctors in public hospitals performed more than six night calls per month, compared to 26% in 2002. &nbsp; Our medical officers currently work an average of 60-65 hours per week. &nbsp; The clusters are also making efforts to ensure that junior doctors do not work more than 30 hours continuously. &nbsp; We cannot change the working hours dramatically overnight, because it will affect patient care. But as more young doctors graduate from our medical school, the working conditions of our young doctors will continue to improve over the next few years.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2232<p><p>2.30 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Training of doctors in the Hospitals</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are senior hospital doctors too preoccupied with daily workload that they have no time to teach the junior doctors?&nbsp; MOH had surveyed medical trainees in 2003 and it showed that over 70% of the trainees gave high ratings on the supervision received from their seniors.&nbsp; The survey showed that trainees have been given time for training and almost 90% of trainees indicated that they participated in various organised learning activities. The workload of the trainees was not onerous as more than 60% of the trainees saw fewer than 20 patients per day in the wards, while about 70% of doctors saw fewer than 60 patients per week at specialist outpatient clinics. &nbsp; We are assured that, on the whole, there is a satisfactory level of supervision and training for our trainee doctors in the hospitals.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Communication skills training for doctors and nurses</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Communication skills are important, as pointed out by Ms Braema.&nbsp; The good practice of medicine requires good inter-personal skills. EQ is as important as IQ. Communication skills and the ability to empathise are skills needed for good medical practice. We can teach communication skills, but empathy must come from the heart. Medical students in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> undergo a communication skills programme to enable them to communicate effectively with patients and relatives. This comprises many hours of course work, lectures, role-playing and mentored interaction with patients. The programme, administered by the NUS Medical Faculty, together with the Faculty of Business Administration, supplements the students' practical exposure to communicating with patients during their 3-year clinical postings.&nbsp; For practising <p align=left>Column: 2233<p>doctors and trainees, programmes on communication skills are organised by the Healthcare clusters, NUS and professional bodies like the Singapore Medical Association (SMA) and <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName>Family Physicians</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. Experienced GPs and family physicians are involved in such programmes. Nursing students in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) undergo course modules on communication skills which are also acquired in practice sessions and clinical postings. Good senior clinicians, both in medicine and nursing, serve as role models who teach our young doctors and nurses to understand the human condition and empathise with patients.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Further Nursing Education, sponsorships and the nursing degree programme</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To upgrade the skills of nurses, the clusters have a sponsorship programme for Diploma training for nurses. Nurses who are working for VWOs under MOH funding can also apply for training sponsorship from MOH if the training is relevant.&nbsp; MOH provides funds under the HMDP for the upgrading of training of public sector healthcare nurses.&nbsp; This has resulted in an increasing number of nurses doing fellowships in well-known overseas centres - about 50 nurses in 2002 and 60 nurses in 2003.&nbsp; Under the Visiting Experts programme, nursing experts have been invited to teach nurses in specific nursing skills. The Ministry of Health, together with the Ministry of Education, is currently considering a degree course in Nursing at the proposed Outram Campus.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">The Health Manpower Development Programme</i></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The continuous training of health professionals is essential to provide high quality healthcare services.

We want to remain healthy and not see health professionals if we can. But should we need to seek medical care, a family doctor should be our contact point with the healthcare system. We must encourage all Singaporeans to have a primary physician who can advise and guide them on healthcare matters. &nbsp; Healthcare is not just the concern of the Government and healthcare professionals.

<B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</B>:&nbsp; Sir, for most illnesses,&nbsp;besides&nbsp;patented and generic medicine, there would usually be a number of alternative medications that a patient can take.&nbsp; Definitely, of course, he usually relies upon his doctor's prescription without much query.&nbsp; This could be good or bad, depending on how good or how bad the doctor is.&nbsp; Patients usually have no idea about the range and cost of the alternatives, or why one medication is prescribed over the other.&nbsp; It depends almost entirely upon the knowledge and diagnosis of the doctor.&nbsp; Some medications can be very expensive, and subsidised patients may find themselves struggling to afford them on a long-term basis even though the drugs could already be subsidised.&nbsp; The price difference between the prescribed drug and the next best alternative can be substantial.&nbsp; Sometimes, the effectiveness of one drug may be only marginally better than the alternative, although this may not be reflected in the price difference.&nbsp; The financial circumstances of the patient and his family should definitely be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give an example, for gastric pain, the cheapest medicine that can cure it&nbsp;could be an antacid that costs only about five cents, while a new medicine being developed, eg, Omeprazole, can cost $2 per tablet.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to suggest to the Ministry that they should ensure that doctors, particularly the junior doctors in acute hospitals, are aware of the cost of the medicine that they prescribe.&nbsp; This is particularly essential because, many times, junior doctors practising in hospital wards are not too aware of the cost of the medicine they prescribe,&nbsp;since the workflow of the<p align=left>Column: 2236<p> hospital is such that they prescribe the medicine in the wards and the patients do not pay until they are discharged.&nbsp; Many times, the doctors are not directly involved in the billing of the patients.&nbsp; As such, many of the junior doctors would not be aware of how much of the medicine, in terms of cost, they are prescribing.&nbsp; Definitely, we know that the latest and the most expensive medicines are not always the best nor the most appropriate.&nbsp; Hence, we should educate our doctors as far as possible, to avoid prescribing expensive medicine for patients, especially those which are beyond their ability to pay for them.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In fact, the Ministry of Health recognises the role of traditional Chinese medicine in the medical scene in Singapore.&nbsp; The Ministry of Health itself has a department on traditional medicine and one on Chinese medicine.&nbsp; Over the years, the Ministry of Health has adopted positive actions to regulate and register the Chinese physicians, the Chinese medicine practitioners as well as the Chinese herbal and patent medicines.&nbsp; In order that we could further improve the use of Chinese medicine in Singapore, we should do something to satisfy the needs of our patients in Singapore who require Chinese medicine treatment.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Sir, I believe there can be more that we can incorporate&nbsp;traditional Chinese medicine into our healthcare system.&nbsp; Western medicine and the healthcare system&nbsp;have no doubt made advances beyond the human imagination.&nbsp; However, I am not sure whether the 14% of GDP the Americans spend on healthcare is any more effective than the 8% or less which&nbsp;the Europeans or Singaporeans spend on ours.&nbsp; I believe that traditional Chinese medicine should have its place.&nbsp; Traditional Chinese medical practices have always been incorporated in the social and philosophical framework of human life and well-being.&nbsp; It has existed for thousands <p align=left>Column: 2238<p>of years and it has proved to be lasting.&nbsp; So, I hope the Minister can incorporate traditional Chinese medicine into our healthcare system.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am told Chinese medical care is aimed at the gradual approach to treatment, emphasising the social, mental and the psychological approaches to life, living and well-being.&nbsp; I think these descriptions fit well into modern and even new-age needs and perspectives on living and well-being.&nbsp; One way is to systematise the body of Chinese medicine practitioners, including the training and education of these practitioners, to link them with Chinese medical bodies overseas, such as in China, on a more intensive level, including the exchange of doctors and regular sharing of development knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this is done, essentially, one would have taken control of the supply stream of relevant TCM practitioners and of ensuring that they are of a certain international standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way is to&nbsp;identify the area of medicine where TCM is considered sophisticated and effective, such as in the area of acupuncture, which has been mentioned, or these areas can be determined in consultation with other experts.&nbsp; The rest of them should be left to market demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Health should also consider allowing choices by people, by allowing TCM practices at prescribed MOH clinics or hospitals.&nbsp; These are currently done privately by many non-private bodies, such as Chung Hwa Clinic and the Kwan&nbsp;Im Hood&nbsp;Cho Huay.&nbsp; The latter has helped my constituents in Queenstown, for example, run a free TCM clinic for more than 10 years.&nbsp; And patients make small donations in a box after their treatment.&nbsp; Believe me, there is a regular queue waiting for treatment, young and old of all races, for the last 10 years.&nbsp; So, it cannot be without use or effect, when the sick keep coming.&nbsp; It must be useful and effective.&nbsp; It must <p align=left>Column: 2239<p>have answered to the need when it has lasted more than 10 years, and it is still continuing.&nbsp; So, alternative medicine and TCM can prove to be effective and more cost-effective, and may be more satisfactory than western medical treatment in certain fields.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Subsidy for Providers of Home Therapy</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I declare my interest in the following cut.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry introduced subsidies for home care providers two years ago.&nbsp; This is in recognition of the role home care plays in the healthcare system, and I was glad to hear the Minister&nbsp;reconfirming that point again just now.&nbsp; However, currently, the subsidies do not extend to home therapy providers.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry will reconsider this decision in view of our ageing population.&nbsp; Increasing numbers of elderly in Singapore will require physiotherapy.&nbsp; While there are currently day-care centres which provide physiotherapy, home therapy and day-care centres target at different groups of patients.&nbsp; Day-care centres request patients to be at their doorsteps.&nbsp; However, there is a large group of patients, especially those with severe strokes and who, as a result of which are bed-bound, are unable to go to day-care centres for rehabilitation.&nbsp; Thus, for such groups of patients, home therapy is the only option.&nbsp; Elderly poor patients who currently are unable to move to day-care centres,&nbsp;as a result,&nbsp;would be left stranded thoroughly without much of a subsidy and treatment.&nbsp; If the Ministry is able to fund home therapy services and with the convenient and regular but affordable treatment sessions, many current disabled home-bound elderly would be able to benefit from improvements in their health and quality of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2240<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in conclusion, home care services, definitely including the therapy component, can contribute to a higher standard of health among our elderly patients.&nbsp; In the long run, this would help to bring down our healthcare costs.&nbsp; Hence, I hope the Minister could consider my request.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pro-family policies</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, today, I would like to talk about pro-family policies.&nbsp; Here, when I talk about pro-family policies, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;very broad-based, not just on procreation.&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;touch on two aspects.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I hope that the Ministry of Health would, through the National Health Promotion Board, spread the message of procreation promotion to all our people&nbsp; In this respect, I would like to thank the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; In fact, the hospitals and the polyclinics are very well structured and fully equipped, and the facilities are very good.&nbsp; The Acting Minister for Health has just announced that he was going to consolidate all the healthcare facilities in the western part of Singapore.&nbsp; This is indeed a piece of good news to us.&nbsp; But the problem is some of our senior citizens with chronic diseases are having difficulty going to the hospitals for treatment.&nbsp; We should train our young people to support these elderly people and find some ways for these old people to receive treatment at home.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1970s, when we were promoting family planning in all our hospitals and clinics, we made every effort to discourage the mothers from having any more babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, when we are reversing the process, have we trained our hospital and polyclinic staff to promote procreation and encourage our young mothers to have more babies? Every year, we have more than 10,000 abortions.&nbsp; In principle, I do not oppose abortions, but I feel we should train our<p align=left>Column: 2241<p> hospital and polyclinic staff to give consultation to pregnant mothers who are contemplating abortion. For those who are married and are thinking of going for abortion because of financial difficulties, we should try and help them and see how the babies could be saved.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our family planning programme, we should also educate our people as to when is the best time to give birth to children, that is, from 18 to 28 years.&nbsp; We should tell them not to delay their marriages.&nbsp; Even after their marriage, we should also encourage them to have babies as soon as they can.&nbsp; For those who are infertile, we should try and help them with IVF, and make it affordable.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, because most of the hospital staff are females, I hope that we could have pro-family policies to help these female medical staff find time to be with their families.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>3.15 pm</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Dr Chong Weng Chiew reminded our hospitals not to prescribe overly expensive medicine to subsidised patients especially chronic patients, as they may not be able to afford them after discharge.&nbsp; I appreciate his timely reminder.&nbsp; One practical way to help patients save money is to go for generic drugs and the savings can be considerable, as the example he gave just now, between $0.50 and $2.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of generic drugs should be Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in all our subsidised clinics and wards.&nbsp; It will help stretch the hospital's budget, patients' savings and Government subsidy - three-in-one.&nbsp; I therefore agree with him and also Dr Wang Kai Yuen, who mentioned this morning about the need for an open competitive market for drugs and to facilitate the entry of generic alternatives.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2242<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About two-thirds of our 7,500 pharmaceutical products registered here in Singapore are generic drugs, from various sources, including India.&nbsp; We would, of course, continue to tap generic drugs where feasible.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning I mentioned about DPM Lee reopening Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic and that he was shown the capabilities of IT in the NHG cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the applications pertains to this, which is, what we call, e-prescription.&nbsp; Instead of handwriting, which very few people can read, through the IT, the doctor can send out his prescription. And the power of IT is, with a computer screen, when the name of the drug is keyed in,&nbsp;alternatives are put up, including their pricing, so that doctors, whether it is the MO or the Senior Consultant, can, with a look, with the patient in front of him, decide what to prescribe.&nbsp; If the patient insists on branded products, we will tell him how much it will cost and we will prescribe accordingly.&nbsp; But if they want to save money, then go for cheaper alternatives, which, as Dr Chong puts it, are as effective.&nbsp; Patients themselves&nbsp;play an important role and should understand that in most cases, the generic medication can do the same job as a branded drug.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Health Sciences Authority assesses generics for local registration to ensure that they are safe, efficacious and of good quality.&nbsp; My Ministry will step up public education to provide information on drugs to help Singaporeans make better choices.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Home therapy services</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong also asked my Ministry to consider subsidising the providers of home therapy.&nbsp; By home therapy, I presume it means sending a therapist to a patient's home to provide rehabilitation services.&nbsp; Whether we should subsidise such services will depend on the effectiveness of the service and, of <p align=left>Column: 2243<p>course, the financial status of the patients. The problem is: home therapy is not cheap. We should not subsidise just because patients are poor, especially when there are cheaper alternatives in the community. We are already subsidising home medical and home nursing care.&nbsp; I will have to think many times to see whether we should make this further concession.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For patients who need rehabilitation and therapy, there are many day rehabilitation centres providing such services.&nbsp; I do not know about Dr Chong's constitutency, but within Tanjong Pagar GRC, there are several.&nbsp; Many of them are located in HDB void decks and they are definitely very much cheaper than the home therapy.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Traditional Chinese Medicine</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now discuss the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).&nbsp; I grew up with TCM. As a child, I probably took more Chinese medicine than Western drugs, and I do not think my experience is unique or unusual.&nbsp; Is there a&nbsp;role for TCM, even in modern Singapore?&nbsp; Of course, there is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our data suggested that one in 10 outpatient attendances are served by TCM practitioners.&nbsp; Will the demand grow? TCM has been able to retain its market share over many years.&nbsp; In fact, this is not unique to Singapore.&nbsp; Recently, I read a British article which noted the growing popularity of TCM in the West.&nbsp; It made an interesting observation that the TCM clientele, at least in the West, were either the lower-educated or the highly-educated. The author did not explain why.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many things about TCM which we have no answers to. That is why all healthcare regulators, whether it is the east or the west, find it very challenging to regulate TCM and other complementary medicine.&nbsp; The reason is <p align=left>Column: 2244<p>the basis&nbsp;and approach of TCM and Western medicine are fundamentally different.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members would know Dr Hong Hai.&nbsp; He was an MP, western trained, English-educated engineer, with a PhD in Economics and a recent serious interest in TCM.&nbsp; He has just graduated from a local TCM school and he is now a fully qualified TCM practitioner.&nbsp; When I met him recently, he commented positively about my health.&nbsp; So I asked him to substantiate his observations.&nbsp; He explained his observations&nbsp;by noting&nbsp;the colour of my face, my complexion and such esoteric stuff.&nbsp; I was very happy with his conclusion - never mind if I could not fully understand his explanation.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therein lies the challenge of trying to regulate TCM, especially when we want to integrate it into mainstream Western medicine.&nbsp; In Western medicine, the operating principle is evidence-based medicine.&nbsp; If we say that a particular drug or a particular treatment works, it is backed by clinical trials, double-blinded randomised, and research findings which have been subject to international scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although TCM is increasingly subject to evidence-based tests in countries like China, where leading universities teach and conduct research in TCM, the level of rigour has not quite reached that required by Western medicine.&nbsp; The question to regulators is:&nbsp; should we accept lower standard of evidence for TCM or should we apply that evidence-based principle strictly?&nbsp; A strictly conservative approach will make it very difficult for the practice to continue, let alone grow.&nbsp; This will, as Mr Chay put it, deprive consumers of a service which has provided much relief and comfort to generations of Singaporeans, many of which are in his constituency.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in 1995, then Minister George Yeo appointed a TCM Committee, under Dr <p align=left>Column: 2245<p>Aline Wong, to look into this subject. It recommended, and subsequently Ministry of Health agreed, a cautious step-by-step approach to TCM.&nbsp; That same year, 1995, MOH set up an Acupuncture&nbsp; Research Clinic in Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital which is still functioning. A year later, we started to upgrade the training of TCM practitioners.&nbsp; In 1999, we tightened the control of Chinese proprietary medicine.&nbsp; In 2001, we registered acupuncturists.&nbsp; Acupuncture is now a registered practice.&nbsp; Only in 2002, we began to register TCM physicians.&nbsp; I will continue this step-by-step approach.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will particularly want to learn from the experience of others.&nbsp; In fact, next week, I will be in Nanjing because we are launching the inaugural direct flight of SIA between Singapore and Nanjing.&nbsp; I will take that opportunity to visit the TCM University in Nanjing to discuss the development of TCM.&nbsp; But whatever we do, one thing is clear.&nbsp; This is an area where regulations inevitably will have to be light, for the simple reason that regulators do not know enough.&nbsp; The major focus of regulation is to ensure safety of the TCM products, such as by checking whether there are contaminations of the herbs with heavy metals, and whether there are adulterations of Chinese proprietary medicines with Western pharmaceutical agents.&nbsp; However, regulators are unable to assess such products for efficacy as is done for Western pharmaceutical drugs.&nbsp; Therefore, consumers must not equate TCM with Western medicine.&nbsp; Consumers will have to be sensible and careful.&nbsp; At the same time, it is incumbent on TCM practitioners to regulate themselves, and to do so seriously,&nbsp;they must self-regulate and be prepared to turf out those who are sub-standard or not up to standard.&nbsp; And more importantly, they must continuously upgrade their standards of practice.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong and Mr Chay asked about the adoption of TCM treatments within <p align=left>Column: 2246<p>our hospitals.&nbsp; Acupuncture, as I have said, is available at Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital and also in NUH, SGH and Tan Tock Seng Hospital for selected medical conditions.&nbsp; However, to make it clear to the patients that this treatment lies outside mainstream Western medicine, TCM therapy is provided in a clinic, separate from the Western clinics and hospital wards.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met the medical community recently and asked if we could now move beyond acupuncture to consider other forms of TCM therapies.&nbsp; They were unanimous in&nbsp;suggesting to me that the next modality after acupuncture could be \"<i>tui na</i>\".&nbsp; My Ministry has therefore formed an expert committee under Prof. Lee Tat Leang of NUH to look into this idea and if viable, to look into the operating details.&nbsp; Prof. Lee is both a professor of anaesthesia and a qualified acupuncturist.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chay asked about the training of TCM practitioners.&nbsp; The two local TCM training schools have recently upgraded their courses to six-year part time or three-year full-time diploma courses. This is accredited by the TCM Practitioners Board.&nbsp; One of the schools has also linked up with Nanjing TCM University to offer a Bachelor's Degree in TCM while the other offers a Masters degree in TCM, but jointly with Beijing TCM University.&nbsp; As for TCM herbal dispensers, my Ministry has worked with the traders community to conduct a four year part-time training course in TCM herbal dispensing. This course is also accredited by the TCM Practitioners Board.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Neo asked about the qualifying examinations for the practitioners. Any person who wishes to practise as&nbsp;a TCM physician now needs to pass the examinations.&nbsp; This was the decision taken many years ago, with ample notice to the TCM practitioners and with much preparation involving upgrading of TCM<p align=left>Column: 2247<p> training at the schools.&nbsp; There are some TCM physicians who did not have the opportunity to receive formal training.&nbsp; The Ministry created a special transitional arrangement to grant them various exemptions based on their individual qualifications and experience.&nbsp; Only those - and that is a small minority - who did not have sufficient qualifications or prior experience, as assessed by TCM Practitioners Board, were required to enrol in the TCM upgrading training course and also to pass the common examinations.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give all applicants sufficient opportunities to upgrade themselves and to take various examinations, a total of three appraisals,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two examinations and one upgrading training course were conducted over a period of two years, and a vast majority passed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, despite repeated reminders, 61 applicants did not come forward for the appraisals, 37 did not come for their examinations and 27 did not enrol in the upgrading course.&nbsp; But they were really a tiny minority.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">3.30 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common examination, from now on, will be conducted every year.&nbsp; So those who failed to be registered under the transitional arrangement can still enrol in either of the two local schools and be registered once they have passed the examination.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><I>Pro-family policies</I></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me respond briefly to Mayor Yu-Foo Yee Shoon's various baby and family-friendly comments.&nbsp; Along the way, I will also address Mdm Halimah's comment this morning.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;Members know, baby policies of all Ministries are under scrutiny.&nbsp; MOH will do its part in this review.&nbsp; I am quite sure <p align=left>Column: 2248<p>Mr Lim Hng Kiang will leave no stones unturned; no diapers unchanged.&nbsp; But as a parent who knows how to change diapers, we also know not to change the diapers unless they are soiled.&nbsp; We will relook the pricing of IVF, but offhand, I think it is unsoiled.&nbsp; I will be very reluctant to start subsidising IVF. &nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Subsidy is a zero sum game.&nbsp; More subsidies for unborn babies mean fewer subsidies for the sick who are already born.&nbsp; But, of course, if there is extra subsidy coming from Mr Lim Hng Kiang's baby budget, then it is a different story.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for childbirth subsidy, Medisave has made childbirth expenditure very affordable.&nbsp; And that is the reason why more Singaporeans are born in the private hospitals now, than in public hospitals.&nbsp; Are hospitals family-friendly?&nbsp; I think they are.&nbsp; But, like all things, there is always room for improvement.&nbsp; With Dr Jennifer Lee, who&nbsp;champions family-friendly policies at the office, running KK, I know that KK could be a good benchmark.&nbsp; Along the way, we will pass on best practices to all the other hospitals.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, one in five married couples finds it difficult to conceive.&nbsp; In view of our <p align=left>Column: 2249<p>declining Total Fertility Rate, we should further help these couples who yearn to have children.&nbsp; The amount of Medisave withdrawal for each in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) programme should be increased.&nbsp; The Minister said earlier that he will do his part for the baby issue and, therefore, I hope that MOH will also consider subsidising other fertility procedures, like intra-uterine inseminations (IUI), to ease the burden for patients at all fertility clinics in the public hospitals, especially if he should get more funding from Minister Lim Hng Kiang.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, one in five women has kids when she is 35 years old or older.&nbsp; This figure far exceeds the developed world average.&nbsp; There is an increased risk of infertility with late pregnancy.&nbsp; Pregnancy in older women also carries increased risks for mums and babes.&nbsp; These include miscarriages, pregnancy complications and complicated deliveries.&nbsp; Would the Minister for Health help promote healthier pregnancies and prevent neonatal abnormalities by publicising and promoting the advantages of earlier childbearing?&nbsp; I feel that we need to better inform the public on the medical disadvantages of pregnancies in older women.&nbsp; MOH can disseminate this message through either the Health Promotion Board or in collaboration with other organisations.&nbsp; Grassroots organisations can be co-opted to hold talks and seminars on such topics in their constituencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, complicated deliveries for mother and premature babies can incur financial burdens to young couples.&nbsp; Therefore, I hope, as discussed earlier, that the Minister consider risk-pooling insurance schemes for medical expenses and maternity insurance from our Medisave to insure couples against complications of pregnancies and childbirths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2250<p><p><I>Stroke</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and it is the fourth leading cause of death in Singapore.&nbsp; Data from MOH shows a rise in the number of admissions to hospitals for cerebrovascular disorders, including stroke and transient ischaemic attacks, from 3,732 in 1986 to 10,250 in 2001.&nbsp; As some patients may prefer to remain at home rather than go to hospital, a notion that has to be corrected through public education, the actual numbers are probably higher.&nbsp; About 63% of all stroke survivors in Singapore are still moderately or severely disabled three months after the event.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anti-platelet therapy and thrombolytic therapy improve outcome with fewer in-hospital deaths for cerebral infarcts when they are prescribed early; preferably within hours of onset.&nbsp; And, in Singapore, over 74% of stroke cases are due to cerebral infarctions that would benefit from such therapy.&nbsp; The diagnosis is possible and treatment can be started only following early brain scanning which, unfortunately, is expensive.&nbsp; Will the Minister facilitate these tests by allowing patients to use their Medisave to pay for them even as outpatients?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister help set up urgent protocols in our public hospitals to facilitate stroke patients to get early investigations and appropriate treatment as soon as possible?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since about 30% of stroke cases end up with long-term disability, does our healthcare system provide enough assistance in managing such patients, for example, in terms of rehabilitative and other supportive measures?&nbsp; Do we have enough therapists to provide for such care?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister enhance further on public education on stroke, especially on advice to seek early treatment and on <p align=left>Column: 2251<p>preventive measures for strokes, maybe by the Health Promotion Board?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister foresee an increasing need for caring of more sick people with disability due to stroke and other causes in view of our fast ageing population?&nbsp; What action plan is the Minister taking to cope with this trend?&nbsp; Will the Minister also consider an epidemiological study on stroke with the purpose of improving the management of stroke patients and the prevention of stroke?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Homecare</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the challenge for MOH on the care of the dependent elderly will be in assisting them to live in their own homes for as long as possible with appropriate support.&nbsp; We recognise that institutional care is costly and causes loss of independence.&nbsp; We also recognise that the family unit, with adequate support, is the principal way to provide care in the home environment rather than institutional care.&nbsp; Thus, we must accept that homecare will translate into convenience, lower costs and a happier populace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a priority for MOH, in the care of the elderly, will help our nation cushion the awesome effects of a fast ageing population.&nbsp; Careful proactive planning and action now will ensure a successful outcome in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aim is to minimise hospital admissions and dependence on long-term care in institutional settings.&nbsp; Homecare with medical care, domiciliary services, daycare with rehabilitation facilities, occupational therapy services as well as equipment and adaptations at home should be made available.&nbsp; Homecare requires the services of personnel, transport and domestic support.&nbsp; Older people often have a variety of inter-related<p align=left>Column: 2252<p> needs, including nutrition, nursing medication and mobility management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of caregivers of homecare is important for MOH to develop.&nbsp; And these caregivers can be the professional providers, family members and volunteers.&nbsp; There is a need to involve the communities to facilitate the elderly to stay in the communities and at their own homes for as long as possible by involving community help and community volunteers to deliver the services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from providing the combination of these services, MOH needs to look into the funding for such long-term healthcare to ensure that it is affordable, equitable to all generations, and sustainable over time.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also asked about Medisave for in-vitro fertilisation.&nbsp; My Ministry would like to help couples who need assisted conception procedures to have children.&nbsp; A treatment cycle costs about $6,000-$8,000.&nbsp; The first cycle has the highest chance of success.&nbsp; With successive cycles, the chance of success decreases.&nbsp; Currently, couples can use their Medisave for assisted conception procedures up to a maximum of three treatment cycles.&nbsp; There is a need for a cap on the number of treatment cycles to prevent premature depletion of Medisave.&nbsp; The Ministry had, <p align=left>Column: 2253<p>in June 2001, raised the withdrawal limit from $2,000 per treatment cycle to $4,000 per treatment cycle.&nbsp; This means that up to $12,000 from Medisave can be used for these procedures.&nbsp; This is a significant drain on Medisave resources of couples.&nbsp; I am concerned about the ability of these couples to pay for their medical care should they fall ill.&nbsp; The Ministry will consider reviewing the cap.&nbsp; And, when it reviews the cap, it will try and balance the competing needs - the need to preserve Medisave and the need to help procreation.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue Dr Lily Neo brought up was&nbsp;stroke.&nbsp; All our public hospitals have stroke units and&nbsp;multi-disciplinary stroke teams to provide integrated and holistic care to patients with acute stroke.&nbsp; Clinical care pathways and guidelines are in place to streamline the care of patients with stroke, from the Emergency Department till discharge.&nbsp; More than 95% of all stroke cases admitted to the hospitals would get a brain scan within 24 hours of admission.&nbsp; Most get it within one hour.&nbsp; As part of the clinical protocols in hospitals, rehabilitative care is initiated when the acute medical problems have been stabilised so as to improve outcomes.&nbsp; Patients who require more intensive rehabilitation are either referred to in-hospital rehabilitation departments, or to community hospitals.&nbsp; For those who will benefit from outpatient rehabilitation, they are discharged home with either a referral to community-based therapy centres and/or their care-givers are trained in simple rehabilitation techniques to assist the patient at home.&nbsp; The use of Medisave for outpatient brain scanning does not arise in acute stroke because acute stroke patients should go to the Emergency Department for appropriate treatment by a stroke team.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The third issue that Dr Lily Neo brought up was on home care.&nbsp; The Ministry's philosophy on home care is to encourage the elderly to stay in the community for as long as possible and institutionalisation should only be a measure of last resort.&nbsp; As such, the Government has extended subsidy to financially deserving elderly who require home medical and home nursing visits.&nbsp; With subsidy, more severely disabled elderly can continue to stay in their own home with their families, thus avoiding the need to stay in an institution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our subsidy scheme for home care services has benefited about 7,000 elderly who meet medical nursing and financial criteria for subsidised home medical and home nursing care.&nbsp; For 2003, over 53,000 home visits were provided by the VWOs, 10 home medical and 13 home nursing providers which altogether cost the Government $3.6 million in subsidies.&nbsp; The norm cost is $122 for home medical and $56 per home nursing visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the elderly to stay at home, care givers need to be trained to reduce burn out.&nbsp; Home carer training courses aim to equip home carers who may be family members or maids.&nbsp; Restructured hospitals, community hospitals, VWOs and private operators provide home carer training.&nbsp; Community Development Councils are also running a number of home carer training programmes in the community.&nbsp; The scope of training provided varies across organisations but, in general, it incorporates information on basic nursing care, activities of daily living, transferring techniques and personal hygiene.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board also has a web page specifically designed to provide information on help for the elderly.&nbsp; A free video titled&nbsp; \"Home Care for the Elderly\" can be downloaded from the HPB website as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2255<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also looking into improving the knowledge of home carers by providing them with easy access, eg, through the MOH website, to information on home carer training courses available in the community.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Education Policy</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</B>: Sir, I beg to move,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Ministry recently changed several long-standing policies such as school ranking, single intake for pre-university and scrapping of SAT for part of the university admission criteria.&nbsp; After many years of debate in this House, it seems that our voices were finally being heard.&nbsp; I would like to congratulate the Acting Minister for his bold and decisive actions.&nbsp; The quick turn-around on SAT requirement is especially dramatic, given the justification of SAT in this House just two years ago.&nbsp; I hope these small changes are reflective of the change in emphasis and focus in MOE towards education in primary and secondary schools.&nbsp; These changes, though minor, went to the heart of the problem.&nbsp; I believe we are doing the right thing, moving away from the over emphasis on grades.&nbsp; Instead, we should focus on the development of&nbsp;our pupils and students&nbsp;to be&nbsp;upright and productive citizens of Singapore -&nbsp; our future citizens who grow up confident of their ability to tackle the challenges of the future, self-assured and well equipped to stand on their feet in a globalised economy in the future.&nbsp; In my mind, Sir, the best way forward is to do so by engaging them in sports and other supervised CCAs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another change is the relaxation of mother tongue requirement for university <p align=left>Column: 2257<p>admission.&nbsp; My understanding is that in the past, students could still gain enrolment into the university, even if they failed the mother tongue, provided they take remedial lessons in the university.&nbsp; So, in practice, the impact of the change is not that great.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the removal of penalty as a disincentive should address the source of angst in many parents and students regarding mother tongue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding mother tongue, Sir, the introduction of Chinese B has created heated discussions within the Chinese community regarding the teaching of the Chinese language.&nbsp; They are also concerned about the decline of the Chinese language.&nbsp; Surprisingly, because of two main newspapers&nbsp; -&nbsp; one in English and the other in Chinese&nbsp; -&nbsp; covered the issue from two different perspectives, the issue has even threatened to become a proxy contest of wills between the Chinese educated versus the English educated Singaporeans.&nbsp; Sir, this is unnecessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue also shifted to focus on the value of the Chinese language with the ascendancy of China as an economic power.&nbsp; I believe that we should all review the issue of mother tongue and ask ourselves why do we insist that our children should learn their mother tongue.&nbsp; Yes, language and culture are as inextricably tied to the economic development of people using the language.&nbsp; Still, for Singaporeans who are descendants of immigrants, I think the most important factor for us must be the issue of our identity.&nbsp; I think it would be tragic if our children growing up in Asia end up completely cut off from our heritage by giving up on their mother tongue.&nbsp; This goes to the core of us being human beings.&nbsp; For Chinese Singaporeans giving up Chinese would be especially regrettable, as we have everything in place to retain proficiency in the language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2258<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given this anxiety, I would ask the Minister to reaffirm the Government's resolve towards the commitment of mother tongue education in our schools.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another topic that is close to our heart is streaming, which is a hot topic judging from the number of cuts.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

of the total 300 points.&nbsp; This emphasis has tilted the balance of education towards language rather than learning of knowledge such as Geography, History and Arts.&nbsp; As a result, I found that our P6 pupils are narrowly focused compared to the pupils of other educational systems of comparable standard in the world.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, the real challenge to me for the Ministry is how to translate its vision into reality.&nbsp; For this, it needs not&nbsp;&nbsp; only good policies but also teachers who believe in the vision and parents and students to respond to the various stimulus that it has put in place.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2259<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From my own observations, there is still disconnect between the vision of the MOE and the reality down the ground.&nbsp; Recently, a JC student told the press that although he got an A2 in his mother tongue language, he would be resitting the examination so that he can get a score sheet that is as perfect as possible.&nbsp; Another student who got a C5 in her MTL will be retaking it for her mum who was worried that it would affect her chances of getting a scholarship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the MOE is trying to get Singaporeans to think about innovation and entrepreneurship, but everyone else is thinking about how many As to get so that they can secure scholarships, and thereafter get into the elite Administrative Service as a measure of success.&nbsp; That is what I mean by a disconnect and so long as this exists, I wonder whether we will be able to reach the peaks of excellence that the Minister so often speaks of.&nbsp; Perhaps the problem lies with the way we define excellence itself.&nbsp; It is still very much perceived as being very focused on academic excellence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to cite the example of the film industry as an example of how others in the Asia Pacific region has surged ahead in terms of achieving excellence.&nbsp; A New Zealand film recently won 11 Oscar nominations, and the New Zealanders were not even well known for film making.&nbsp; Australia has just released another potential blockbuster called \"Passion\", which I was told is comparable in impact to the \"Ten Commandments\" which was made in 1956.&nbsp; Thailand had two locally made films which beat the takings for the \"Matrix\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" in Bangkok.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now operating in a different league where countries, regardless of their level of development, can leapfrog in certain areas if their people have the <p align=left>Column: 2260<p>innovation and enterprise.&nbsp; Can our education system translate that vision into reality?&nbsp; Or will we be producing more of the same things?&nbsp; That is the question that I would like to ask the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point, Sir, is on streaming.&nbsp; It is indeed sad that this is one sacred cow that has remained unslaughtered, and which I have also raised in previous budget debates.&nbsp; When we look at the way streaming is done, the lines appear to be rather artificial in some instances.&nbsp; For example, a child may be very good in English and Mathematics but so long as he is poor in the mother tongue language, he ends up in EM2.&nbsp; Now that the MOE has done a complete review of the mother tongue language and one only needs a D7 to enter university, I would like to ask the Minister what is the strong basis for keeping this distinction between EM1 and EM2.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>: Please wrap up your speech, Mdm Halimah?</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Yes, I will, Sir.&nbsp; As for the EM3, the same problem of stigma and labelling has continued.&nbsp; As I understand, the issue is one of motivation and interest.

This will also address the fact that there are late developers who may be disadvantaged from early streaming.&nbsp; Could our school principals monitor and ensure that teachers do not overload pupils with homework and tests?&nbsp; Could all teachers be equipped with more and better teaching resources to make education in schools interesting?&nbsp; How are schools progressing in parent-teacher rapport?&nbsp; Are all schools now promoting this rapport?&nbsp; Are schools considering all feedback and acting on them, especially on pupils' progress and family stress from education?&nbsp; Do our schools provide teacher-counsellors and professional counsellors for students, teachers and parents, if called for?&nbsp;

<B>Mr</B> <B>Inderjit Singh:</B>&nbsp; Sir many people have asked me why I was the only Member who did not talk about the procreation issue during this year's Budget debate.&nbsp; I think everyone else spoke about it except me.&nbsp; This cut is my contribution to the great baby debate.&nbsp; In my opinion, there are two things that worry and stress Singaporeans when it comes to having children.&nbsp; The first is the stress of the cost of living and the ability of their children to live comfortably in the future in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The second issue, which in my opinion, is more significant than the first is the stress of our education system.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two levels of stresses.&nbsp; The first is the stress of a child going through<p align=left>Column: 2263<p> a system which labels and streams them too early and too many times, and the second is the stress on the parents who inevitably worry about the academic success of their children.&nbsp; In fact, many a time, when a child goes through a major examination, it seems as if the parents are sitting for the examination for themselves.&nbsp; So, if we can bring back the joy of being a child, as I experienced when I was a child, and if we can bring back the joy of our education system for our children and parents, we will reduce the unnecessary stresses and make bringing up a family more fun.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, today, I would like to focus on the streaming issue, particularly streaming in our primary schools, which is one of the causes of the stress in our education system.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, while the rationale of allowing each child to progress at his or her own pace seems logical, I have issues in the implementation which has resulted in the wrong measure of success as well as labelling, branding and creating a social class system, including the emergence of some amount of elitism, as some Members have brought up.&nbsp; I truly feel that we can achieve the same objective of letting each child progress at his or her ability and to learn by not segregating the students into clear streams but by perhaps creating a hybrid system, which I brought up before.&nbsp; I also recognise that each child has different learning abilities at different stages of their lives, and we should therefore find other ways of maximising each child's talent and potential, rather than through the streaming systems.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest an alternative to streaming children after Primary 4, where we have a system where students be kept in the same class for as long as possible.&nbsp; In fact, for EM1 and EM2, as has been stated earlier, the only <p align=left>Column: 2264<p>difference is the mother tongue,&nbsp;whether they can be kept in the same class and only be separated when it comes to the learning of mother tongue.&nbsp; We could carry this one step further to separate students according to the ability in each of the subjects, ie,&nbsp;in Mathematics, Science, and so on.&nbsp; In fact, I would like to go one step further to suggest that, even for EM3 students, we could integrate them together with the EM1 and EM2 as they are today, and integrating them for Physical Education, like Music and other non-Mathematics or Science subject levels where they may have strengths, as good as the EM1 and EM2 students.&nbsp; My main objective is to allow students to learn from their diversities from each other and also for using peer influence for each child to improve&nbsp;herself or himself .&nbsp; If we can do what I suggest, I am sure it will go a long way in minimising&nbsp; the potential future social problems that we will see as a result of the class system that we are creating.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the Minister will consider modifying or totally eliminating the streaming system to achieve the same objectives as we are trying to achieve for each student.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would just like to repeat my call to the Ministry to stop streaming at Primary 4.&nbsp; I am not for streaming at Primary 4.&nbsp; While I do not disagree that no man is created of equal ability, some are better and faster learners, some are slower learners, streaming at Primary 4 tends to add stress unnecessarily at a tender young age.&nbsp; The stigma and the stress of streaming have been alluded to in this House by many Members, and I shall not repeat them.&nbsp; But looking purely from the psychological development point of view, streaming at Primary 4 means that the students are streamed between the age of 9 and 10 <p align=left>Column: 2265<p>years old.&nbsp; According to&nbsp;several psychological theories of development,&nbsp;eg, Piaget's Theory, at this age, the kids are not even capable of abstract thinking yet, and to stream them before they are actually fully developed psychologically is, to me, too premature.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, streaming at Primary 4 also means that the schools internally will stream their students at P2 or P3, and that, in itself, is another additional source of stress to the kids.&nbsp; So, I do not support streaming at Primary 4 and call on the Ministry to actually move it to a later stage of a student's life.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, one favourite bugbear remains intact, and that is streaming.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, once again, in the new spirit of never say never and with a little bit more hope, I would like to comment briefly on this issue and urge the Ministry to dismantle the system,&nbsp;at least at the fringes where the merits of streaming&nbsp;are no more obvious.&nbsp; In fact, the cause of streaming, such as the negative self-esteem of the&nbsp;child, could far outweigh the benefits, if any, that can be achieved from streaming in these instances.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the primary school level, the only major material difference between EM1 and EM2 curriculum is MTL.&nbsp; That being the case, is there any good reason for retaining EM1 and EM2 in the first instance?&nbsp; Students in the present EM1 can take their MTL lessons at a higher level while all the other subjects can be co-mingled with their EM2 counterparts so that there is no necessity to separate <p align=left>Column: 2266<p>the students into two streams.&nbsp; This will obviously encourage greater social interaction between the so-called superior and the less endowed ones.&nbsp; Doing away with the EM1 and EM2 classes would effectively mean causing much less stress to close to 90% of the parents since the EM1 and EM2 cohort makes up close to 90% of the cohort.&nbsp; Similarly, EM3 students should be allowed the option to take some EM2 subjects in the same way that Normal (Technical) students are to be permitted to take some Normal (Academic) subjects to provide a route for them to take their 'O' levels.&nbsp; These principals and teachers alike have already said that this should raise the self-esteem and boost the confidence of many of the Normal (Technical) students, and I have no doubt it will do the same for EM3 students.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the GEP students, they should also co-mingle with the other students for non-examinable subjects, such as health education and social studies to foster greater interaction among the students.&nbsp; Also, the teaching methodology used for GEP students, which has been found to be more interactive and train the minds to be more analytical, should also be made available to other students.&nbsp; The primary benefit of streaming has always been said to allow students of different abilities to progress at different pace and, hence, keep all in schools for a longer term.&nbsp; Otherwise, the very weak students may give up and prematurely drop out of school. &nbsp; However, streaming, especially at a very young age, may inevitably penalise the laggard and cause irreparable psychological damage, such as low self-esteem due to the stigma of labelling.&nbsp; With the latest emphasis on different pathways to success, diversity and flexibility, as well as the various changes that have already been made, there is really no need to keep this sacred cow intact.&nbsp; I think it should be sent to the veterinarian once more for thorough re-<p align=left>Column: 2267<p>examination.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Hang on, children and parents!\"<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quote, \"We are moving towards a more flexible education system that provides more choices for students&nbsp;- new types of schools, alternative school curriculae and more customised approaches to teaching students with different abilities.&nbsp; We have to nurture young Singaporeans who are more willing to ask questions, as they learn to think in original ways and to try out new ways of doing things.\"&nbsp; I personally believe in streaming for effective teaching,&nbsp;but the present mode of streaming destroys our children's confidence and self-esteem.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present streaming of learning abilities has resulted in the labelling of students, ie, EM1, EM2 and EM3, <st1:City><st1:place>Normal</st1:place></st1:City>, Express, Special and ITE students.&nbsp; MOE had ignored the impact of streaming on the confidence of the students and their self-esteem for far too long a time.&nbsp; Has the Ministry conducted any survey on the emotional and psychological impact of our children due to this labelling of our children?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Minister's visionary thought on the diversity of our education system, will there be changes in the way we stream our children in their learning abilities?&nbsp; Can we adopt the model-based approach, like what he introduced for the Chinese Language B, for the other different subjects too?&nbsp; Based on this <p align=left>Column: 2268<p>model, the advantages would be, I quote the Minister again, \"At the other end of the spectrum, there is no stigma attached to the student who opts for Chinese Language B.&nbsp; If he faces great difficulty in learning Chinese, despite putting in the effort, Chinese Language B can motivate him to sustain an interest in the language and use it.&nbsp; This is similar for the other subjects as well.\"&nbsp; I would like to implore the Minister to kill this sacred cow and to reconsider the mode of streaming&nbsp;our children for the objective of effective learning.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are many shortcomings which many Members have spoken about them just now and over the years. &nbsp;I do not think I need to repeat them.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;aim of the current streaming system is a recognition that different individuals have different abilities and talents and thereby customisation of the learning process is needed to bring the best out of every student,&nbsp;then my question is whether the current system of streaming based on aggregate scores of the subjects, as a basis, is the best way to achieve this objective.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most children at age nine or 10 years old are very sensitive, and can easily be hurt irretrievably.&nbsp; Streaming at such a young age hurt them very badly.&nbsp; When they are branded failures, in that sense, our education system is said to be very stressful.&nbsp; This has caused many Singaporeans to emigrate.&nbsp; Even now, many parents want to emigrate to countries where the education system is more accommodating and less stressful.&nbsp; Yet, in those less stressful education systems, they are able to produce children with equally good results and students who can become good citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At least, even if we do not want to slaughter the cow, we could dress it up to look like a sheep, because the form is also equally important as the substance.&nbsp; Even if the Minister does not think that the system is fundamentally wrong, at least, as a result of MPs' persistent pestering, he could keep an open mind and carry out a review on the streaming system.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current system, while effective in channelling students of differing abilities, suffers from the existence of labels.&nbsp; Students and parents resent the labelling, and it imposes additional stress on the students.&nbsp; The concept of streaming is really not new.&nbsp; I remember, even during my time, there was some form of streaming, where the better students were grouped into certain classes, while the slower ones were grouped into other classes so that more attention could be given to them.&nbsp; There was less problem then, as there was no labelling, such as EM1, EM2 or EM3.&nbsp; In fact, it was intentional that the A class was usually not the best, and all of us eventually graduated from the same school with the same PSLE certificate, and no one ever<p align=left>Column: 2271<p> asked, \"Which class did you come from?\"&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Ministry consider doing away with the labelling of EM1, EM2 or EM3.&nbsp; We can revert to the old system where we simply grouped students into classes according to their ability.&nbsp; We can offer a Higher Mother Tongue language as an option for those who can cope better.&nbsp; This way, we retain the cow but make it look like a sheep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, of course, many other possible models that we should explore.&nbsp; In fact, we could allow selected schools to carry out trials before a final decision is taken.&nbsp; If the Ministry agrees to carry out a review, I would like to urge the Ministry to consult all the stakeholders, eg, teachers, students and parents.&nbsp;

Enough has been said regarding streaming at primary level.&nbsp; At secondary school level, I would not argue against allowing students who needed five years to successfully complete their \"O\" level.&nbsp; I only want to make the observation that our students in the Normal stream are a full 40% of our students each year.&nbsp; This is very much in that big portion of the Bell Curve of ability.&nbsp; But somewhere along the way in the history of the development of our education system, our elitist tendencies consigned almost half of each cohort of our children who are perfectly normal - \"normal\" with a lower case, ie, small \"n\" - to a life of misery by labelling them subnormal, euphemistically \"Normal\" with an upper case, ie, capital \"N\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2272<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard anecdotally that some of the students may be less quiet and well behaved, with the result that their teachers have a much more challenging time coping with the usual class size of 40, possibly leading to expressions of frustration, which do not help the situation at all but add to the students - and, by extension, their parents - and teachers alike viewing being assigned to the Normal stream as a horrible sentence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have always directed attention and resources to the cream of the crop.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is that the bright kids are the ones that need our help the least.&nbsp; They will do well anyway.&nbsp; We should direct more attention and resources to how we can give this 40% of our students an environment that is more supportive and that will encourage and facilitate them achieving their potential rather than dampening their spirits.&nbsp; Can we take customisation of the system one step further from streaming as we practise it now and look at how we can teach and assess these students, ie, do it all together in a review of that?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think this is a good move, for I am never in favour of publicly ranking schools in its current form.&nbsp; This usually puts undue pressure on principals and teachers, as well as on parents and students.&nbsp; Hence, the constant complaint about our education system being too stressful.&nbsp; Principals and teachers are often under tremendous pressure to perform for their career<p align=left>Column: 2273<p> advancements are dependent, to a large extent, on how their schools fare in the 'O' and 'A' level results.&nbsp; <I>Kiasu</I> parents naturally want their children to get into good schools high up in the ranking order.&nbsp; They often compare notes, and this raises expectations and puts a lot of pressure on our students, resulting in, what Mr Chiam said, many of them suffering from an inferiority complex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ranking of schools does have its advantages, if the criteria&nbsp;are broadened to non-academic areas, like achievements in CCA, sports, social services and so on.&nbsp; Indeed, schools should be assessed based not solely on academic results, but on how they train our children to have an all-rounded education.&nbsp; Even then, I would recommend that ranking be based on a band, a cluster or group basis, rather than on an individual basis.&nbsp; If the Ministry sees the need to rank schools individually, I suggest that this be kept internally within the Ministry and not made public.&nbsp; In short, I would like to ask the Minister if he would review the criteria for ranking of schools and whether it is necessary to make the ranking of individual schools public, in the light of his intention to make schooling more interesting and enriching, less stressful and more relevant in the context of a broader-based and all rounded education for our young ones.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, the Minister's recent announcement that the school ranking system would be reviewed is yet another refreshing change taking place in the education system.&nbsp; Since its introduction in 1992, there has been endless gripe in this House and outside that the exercise, which is based heavily on academic performance and ranks schools individually, makes schools even more examination-oriented and leads to unhealthy pressure on principals, teachers, students and parents.&nbsp; All of us must have read reports of schools offering only subjects which students find easier to get good grades, as well as schools<p align=left>Column: 2274<p> advising students to drop subjects they are likely to do badly in to avoid pulling down the schools' overall ranking.&nbsp; The system has also been criticised as it does not give a complete picture of the schools' achievement.&nbsp; MOE has, for years, stoutly defended the merits of the ranking system as a benchmarking tool for schools to know how they fare nationally, and for the parents and students to make informed choices when selecting schools.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partly, to overcome the negative impact of ranking, MOE had, over the years, introduced various awards to recognise the achievements of schools, not only academically.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the school ranking system has continued to be the main focus of the public's attention.&nbsp; The Remaking Singapore Committee had proposed that the current system of ranking be modified into a banded concept instead of individual school rankings.&nbsp; Ranking schools by bands will still give schools an idea of their performance in relation to other schools.&nbsp; But because there is anonymity in the exact ranking within the band, it would eradicate some of the unhealthy competition arising from jostling for a few places.&nbsp; Indeed, the usefulness of the school ranking system will be diminished in future, as many of the current top schools offer integrated and through-train programmes in which students do not sit for the 'O' level examinations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.25 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry could adopt the Remaking Singapore Committee's banded concept of ranking but, at the same time, also highlight the other awards given to the schools in recognition of their effort to give students an all-rounded education.&nbsp; For instance, the value-added school ranking is a good system that should not only be retained, but more intensely <p align=left>Column: 2275<p>publicised.&nbsp; Until now, the public's attention has been focused on school ranking.&nbsp; A <I>Straits Times</I> poll showed that whilst pupils have no trouble recognising the top ranked schools in Singapore, they are in the dark about value-added schools.&nbsp; In fact, a parent noted that it was not even clear about the concept of value added.&nbsp; Hence, besides modifying the ranking system and giving out other non-academic and best practices awards, these other awards should also be widely promoted and publicised, say, on the MOE's website and in the students' guide to secondary schools.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The first is the one on admissions to Secondary 1.&nbsp; Currently, there is a huge advantage given to students of affiliated schools when being posted to secondary schools after their PSLE examinations.&nbsp; The issue is that many students may not get into such an affiliated primary school for various reasons, especially because of different priorities granted when admissions to Primary 1 are done.&nbsp; This disadvantage then remains for such children even if they do well during the PSLE examinations.&nbsp; It is best that such an advantage should end at the primary school level and not be carried forward to the secondary school level during the admission exercise.&nbsp; Such admissions at the secondary school level should be purely on merit, based on the PSLE results.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, affiliated secondary schools are giving too much of an advantage on the cut-off aggregate score for students from an affiliated primary school, and this is unfair for the many students coming from our neighbourhood schools who do well in their PSLE examinations.&nbsp; I suggest that the Ministry relook at this advantage <p align=left>Column: 2276<p>and put a cap as to the level of the advantage students from affiliated schools get.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is the issue of the integrated programme.&nbsp; Many junior colleges have now started offering the integrated programme, taking students either at the Secondary 1 or the Secondary 3 levels.&nbsp; I worry that when we do this, we would be limiting the number of spaces available in the good junior colleges for students who do well at their 'O' level examinations.&nbsp; Again, most of them will be coming from our neighbourhood schools.&nbsp; How does the Ministry plan to address this issue?&nbsp; I feel that many students who do well in their later ages may be disadvantaged by the current system of getting students started at the integrated programmes at Secondary 1 and Secondary 3.&nbsp; Can the Minister assure us that students who do well will still have an equally good chance of getting into good junior colleges, as it was done in the past?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Hence, the university admission criteria have been changed, such that the universities now have the flexibility to use their own discretion to admit up to 10% of the annual intake.&nbsp; In fact, the Remaking Singapore Committee had also noted in its report that ranking students based on the single aggregate score, including languages as a compulsory component, may be too rigid a way of determining admission to schools and universities.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in line with this new mantra of education, which is diversity and flexibility in order to allow students to pursue their passions and develop special talents,&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if the admission system for secondary schools would be modified in line with the many <p align=left>Column: 2277<p>changes at the post-secondary and tertiary levels.&nbsp; Presently, the autonomous and independent schools can admit up to 5% to 10% of their student intake who, they believe, will boost the schools' niche area of expertise but whose PSLE aggregate scores do not meet the schools' cut-off point.&nbsp; For instance, Tanjong Katong Girls' School's niche is in music, and Bukit Panjang Government High School's special areas are in Science and the Malay language.&nbsp; Such a scheme allows schools to look at the summary indicators, consider abilities not fully assessed in the PSLE system, and admit singularly talented students or students who have reached proficiency in most of the relevant subjects but whose aggregate scores may be dragged down by one or two subjects.&nbsp; It will also reinforce the signal that we are trying to send out now to parents and students</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This will save parents from having to ferry their children to and from different places for these hobbies, and this will also help Singaporean parents save much time, effort and money.&nbsp; Let us make our schools more holistic and comprehensive in nature.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criteria for the ranking of schools need to be expanded to lessen the emphasis on academic achievements and grade scores.&nbsp; More weightage should be on other markers relevant to the present time.&nbsp; Thus, ranking should take attainments in developing the potentials of students in information technology, sports and the arts into consideration.&nbsp; Like my previous speakers, Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Amy Khor, I would like to ask whether MOE will start ranking of schools by bands rather than individually.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having flexibility in secondary school entry criteria, such as consideration for <p align=left>Column: 2279<p>non-academic abilities, will lessen the stress for many students and parents.&nbsp; Parents can then be at ease to let their children develop their own unique potentials, some of which may not conform to the norm.&nbsp; Sir, schools should not be too fixated on accepting students with high grades, but should be more flexible and be open-minded in student admissions.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry of Education will continue reviewing and expanding favourable criteria for our school entry.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mdm Ho is not here.&nbsp; Mr Zainudin.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>NUS High School</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zainudin Nordin</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the introduction of NUS High School is a positive development as it will help to enrich our education system.

They do well, by any international reckoning.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been repositioning the education system in recent years to help our young meet the challenges of a very different future,&nbsp;a much more competitive future.&nbsp; We will be moving from a focus of quantity - in other words, on producing graduates of sufficient numbers&nbsp;from our&nbsp;various post-secondary institutions -&nbsp;to a focus on quality, from primary schools all the way up.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have introduced improvements and innovations in curriculum, and in the use of technology.&nbsp; We are moving towards single session primary schools, and smaller classes in the first two years of primary education, as announced in last year's COS debate.&nbsp; And we have made substantial improvements in the teaching service and school management.&nbsp; We have a well-trained teaching force, and a service that provides teachers and principals with considerable opportunities to develop themselves professionally and to occasionally retool and re-gear.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More broadly, we have been moving in recent years towards a more flexible and broad-based education system.&nbsp; We are providing for more choices in schooling, and in the tertiary sector.&nbsp; We want to help students to develop themselves in diverse areas, in more varied intellectual pursuits as well as in sports and arts.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 2281<p>want to nurture students with all-round strengths, while providing space for those with special talents in a single area to go as far as they can.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are therefore moving towards a more flexible education system - new types of schools and programmes, alternative curricula, and more flexible or customised approaches to teaching students with different abilities.&nbsp; We are expanding university enrolment, providing the state-funded universities with greater autonomy, and opening up the sector to greater competition.&nbsp; We are also redoubling our efforts to provide students with a broad-based, holistic education, focused on more than examination performance.&nbsp; We have recently introduced more flexible criteria for admitting students to our universities, and will do the same for schools and junior colleges as I will elaborate on shortly.&nbsp; We will also revise the school ranking system to support and encourage schools in their efforts to provide an all-round education.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are able to make these changes because our education system is strong.&nbsp; The fundamentals are strong.&nbsp; It is, in fact, this confidence in the system that allows us to keep looking ahead, to review what we do, and make adjustments and changes in good time.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members are familiar with the new educational pathways that we are putting in place.&nbsp; Integrated Programmes, spanning secondary and JC education have been introduced in selected schools from this year, and a few more are coming onstream.&nbsp; Specialised independent schools are being established, in sports from this year, in Mathematics and Science from next year, the NUS High School, and as announced last week by Minister Lee Boon Yang, a School for the Arts from 2007.&nbsp; Alternative curricula and qualifications like the International Baccalaureate are now allowed in our schools.&nbsp; We will soon also allow for a <p align=left>Column: 2282<p>few privately-funded secondary schools, which can provide their own models of education.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked if access to the JCs offering the Integrated Programmes - these are the top JCs - would be reduced.&nbsp; The implementation of Integrated Programmes will not reduce access for deserving students to the top JCs.&nbsp; Their overall enrolment will remain close to existing levels.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin asked about the NUS High School. The School will provide a new type of programme to develop students with a special aptitude for Mathematics or the sciences.&nbsp; It will have a different and enriched curriculum - special projects, research and programmes for their senior students that will be linked&nbsp; to university modules offered by NUS.&nbsp; Students will have access to NUS facilities and interact with NUS academics.&nbsp; They may even sit in&nbsp;on some university classes.&nbsp; Admission, which will be for next year, will be based on merit.&nbsp; The NUS High School will consider students on the basis of their academic performance, aptitude in science competitions and projects, and other special attributes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next important change we have to introduce, as part of a more flexible and broad-based education system, is in school admissions.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor, Dr Lily Neo and Mdm Halimah spoke of the need for a more flexible admission system.&nbsp; MOE agrees with this.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We select students for secondary schools and JCs based on merit.&nbsp; However, the criteria for selection are quite narrowly defined.&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah has highlighted, they focus on single measures of academic merit - PSLE T-score for placement in secondary schools and 'O' level aggregate score (L1R5) for junior college admission.&nbsp; To achieve our objectives in&nbsp;our next phase of education, we will give schools greater flexibility in <p align=left>Column: 2283<p>student admission, to allow them to recognise a more diverse range of intellectual achievements and other talents.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By giving schools greater flexibility in how they select students, we will be reinforcing the changes that we have recently allowed in the university admission system - with NUS and NTU being able to admit up to 10% of their students on the basis of their own, independent criteria.&nbsp; It will encourage students who wish to put effort into activities they have a special interest or talent in, to take them seriously and not give them up early because they do not count for admission.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has, for some years now, allowed Independent Schools (IS) and Autonomous Schools (AS) to look at wider criteria when they admit a proportion of their students - up to 10% of intake in the case of the Independent Schools, and up to 5% for the Autonomous Schools.&nbsp; This was introduced under tightly controlled conditions, to see whether the schools could manage the process, and to enable the public to understand that admission into these top schools is still based on merit, but using wider criteria.&nbsp; The system has worked well, and can now be expanded.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has studied this carefully and sought the views of a large number of parents, teachers and ex-students of schools - over 1,200 people in all.&nbsp; Based on a survey we conducted earlier this year, over 90% of each of these groups felt that we should send stronger signals to students on the importance of all-round development.&nbsp; The vast majority supported broadening schools' admission criteria to recognise special skills and talents aside from academic scores.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2284<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several ways in which broader and more flexible school admissions can work.&nbsp; A secondary school may want to select students with intellectual abilities that are not reflected in their PSLE aggregate, eg, a student with a special ability in Mathematics or Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL). Or it may want to attract students with other non-academic talents that it wishes to develop.&nbsp; Likewise, a junior college may want to select a student who has done consistently well in his school assessments, or has done outstanding community service.&nbsp; There will be other examples of students who may not meet the school's or junior college's usual cut-off scores for admission, but whom the school feels have special talents and will strengthen the school community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also how the best schools abroad, in countries like the US, UK and elsewhere, select their students.&nbsp; These are mainly private schools, which are free to set their own entry requirements.&nbsp; Many have rigorous entry procedures, but are usually not focused on results in a single examination.&nbsp; The measures we will take in Singapore, to introduce broader and more flexible criteria for admission to certain schools, will have some similarities with these best practices abroad. But what sets us apart is that we are doing this in a<p align=left>Column: 2285<p> publicly-funded school system, with admission open to all rather than based on the ability to pay.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach is to introduce greater flexibility, choice and diversity in education by providing our publicly-funded schools with greater autonomy,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>rather than by opening up a large private school sector that is based principally on ability to pay.&nbsp; That is the fundamental choice we have made.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we allow for a few private secondary schools from next year, the publicly-funded sector will remain dominant, and very likely remain at the pinnacle of the education system.&nbsp; And there is no reason why our top schools cannot be amongst the best in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the top Chinese schools, which operate within a state-funded and meritocratic national system like ours, are moving in the same direction. For example, Beijing University's Affiliated Middle School admits 30% of its students on the basis of achievement in sports and the arts.&nbsp; When I visited them last year, I was told by the principal that they did this in order to achieve a more diverse school environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The diversity benefited all students and produced more rounded students in general.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting this year, we have allowed the new Integrated Programme (IP) schools and Specialised Schools to have full discretion on admissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; NJC, for instance, which selected secondary school students this year for admission into Secondary 3 did so on the basis of a General Ability Test, PSLE scores, school-based assessments, personal essays, references from principals and teachers, CCA achievements and, finally, interviews with all shortlisted students.&nbsp; The NUS High School for Mathematics and Science, as I mentioned earlier, will adopt a somewhat similar framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next steps concern the Independent Schools (IS) and the Autonomous Schools (AS).&nbsp; As I have mentioned, these schools are currently able to admit their own students, outside of the central posting system, up to a cap of 10% and 5% of their respective Secondary 1 enrolments.&nbsp;&nbsp; This discretion that we provide the Independent Schools&nbsp; and Autonomous Schools is, however, subject to certain strict conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will phase in greater autonomy for the Independent Schools and Autonomous Schools&nbsp; in two steps.&nbsp; First, for admission<p align=left>Column: 2286<p> into Secondary 1 in 2005, in other words, at the end of this year.&nbsp; We will lift the existing MOE conditions on how the Independent Schools and Autonomous Schools&nbsp; admit their own students, while retaining the existing 10% and 5% caps.&nbsp; They will be free to consider students on their own admission criteria, whether on intellectual or other attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, for admission from 2006 onwards, in other words, end of next year, we will double the level of discretionary places available to the Independent Schools and Autonomous Schools to 20% and 10% of their Secondary 1 enrolment respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will also provide some measure of autonomy to other mainstream secondary schools that want to develop niche programmes of their own.&nbsp; Schools that receive MOE approval will be allowed to admit 5% of their intake based on their own criteria.&nbsp; We will allow for this from 2006 as well.&nbsp; This broadening of autonomy to more schools will allow for more and different peaks of excellence in the school landscape, for example, in the arts or sports, besides the new specialised schools, Independent Schools and Autonomous Schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be a richer landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also extend autonomy at the Junior College&nbsp;&nbsp; level. The Junior Colleges that are part of the new Integrated Programmes will, like the secondary schools in these programme, have full discretion to admit students based on their own criteria.&nbsp; The top five JCs will be offering the Integrated Programmes by 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will have full discretion.&nbsp; The remaining 12 JCs will be given discretion to admit 10% of their declared capacity, outside the central posting system, from 2006.&nbsp; This is similar to the discretion that we will grant the Autonomous Schools at the secondary level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes we are taking in school admission procedures are significant, and <p align=left>Column: 2287<p>will have to be implemented carefully.&nbsp; Schools will put in place processes to ensure that selection continues to be based on merit. The schools have their reputations to protect.&nbsp; However, MOE will, as Dr Khor has also suggested, audit the admission practices of the schools. We will not undermine the meritocratic nature of the Singapore&nbsp; education system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor, Mr Chew Heng Ching, Dr Lily Neo, have spoken on the need to refine school ranking.&nbsp; MOE has studied this and consulted widely amongst schools and parents.&nbsp; We will broaden and loosen the school ranking system. By changing the way we measure the performance of schools publicly, we hope to support schools in their efforts to deliver a holistic education to their students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE does not intend to do away with school ranking.&nbsp; It continues to serve as a useful benchmarking tool for schools to assess their performance, and allows parents and students to make informed choices.&nbsp; In fact, in our survey of parents, a majority of them still expected that we will continue with some system of school ranking because it provided them&nbsp;information that they needed.&nbsp; However, the ranking system, in its present form, may have led to an over-emphasis on examination performance, at the expense of other important things we want to do in education. It also has the risk of entrenching conventional teaching approaches, and inhibiting schools from exploring approaches which may help develop their students, eg, in innovation or in creative thinking, but which have no assurance of producing superior examination results.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will therefore revise the school ranking system to provide more room for schools to experiment and to offer their students a broad range of learning experiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2288<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new rankings cannot be too precise an exercise. There is broad consensus that it will not be advantageous to compare schools on the basis of small differences in performance.&nbsp; We cannot measure the things that matter in education with precision.&nbsp; The new 'school achievement tables' that MOE will release later this year will, therefore, band schools instead of ranking them on their exact academic scores.&nbsp; Instead of showing the top 50 secondary schools ranked individually based on the average 'O' level performances of their students, they will be divided into 12 or so bands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second change will be to provide a broader picture of schools' performance in various academic and non-academic domains.&nbsp; There is again strong consensus amongst parents and teachers in favour of this.&nbsp; Over 90% of parents favoured us doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new school achievement tables will seek to provide this broader picture in a simple, digestible form.&nbsp; The tables will reflect schools' achievements under the existing Masterplan of Awards, which we have refined for the purpose. This will show schools that have received awards for academic value-added, sports and other areas of physical health, and in the aesthetics.&nbsp; They will also reflect the schools with best practices in the internal processes they have put in place to achieve those outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character development will be a new area under which schools' efforts will be recognised.&nbsp; We will give recognition to schools that have adopted an integrated approach to developing students in Enterprise, Citizenship and Personal and Social Lifeskills.&nbsp; We will, however, give emphasis to schools' processes and programmes, rather than short-term outcomes, as it is difficult to measure outcomes in character development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recognising schools for their achievements in physical health, we will place renewed emphasis on the<p align=left>Column: 2289<p> participation of students in sports and games, besides outstanding performance in national competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua spoke passionately about this during the debate on MCDS yesterday.&nbsp; The revised criteria for excellence in physical health will recognise schools that allow a broad base of students to take a sports CCA for recreation, even if they are not of exceptional ability and are unable to represent the school.&nbsp; This will dovetail with the efforts of MOH and MCDS to provide an active, sporting lifestyle amongst Singaporeans as a passport to good health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help parents make the most practical use of the information, MOE will also provide a web-based interactive system to allow them to generate comparative lists of schools based on the features they consider important, eg, schools in a certain vicinity, within a certain academic band or with a strength in, say, rugby.&nbsp; We will also continue to provide detailed individual school profiles for each and every school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed changes to the public presentation of school achievements are targeted for implementation from September this year.&nbsp; Some of the new and revised awards, such as for Excellence in Physical Health and Character Development, will be introduced progressively from 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the initiatives that the Ministry has embarked on in recent years will enable us to bring out the best in every child.&nbsp; Taken as a whole, the greater flexibility and diversity that we are introducing in education will help us groom young Singaporeans with diverse talents, and open to diverse ways of thinking and approaching problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need this diversity, both amongst Singaporeans, and through an infusion of people from around the world, if we are to develop the innovative capabilities that Singapore&nbsp; needs, and if we are to make it as a<p align=left>Column: 2290<p> leading world city.&nbsp; The changes will also help us develop strength of character amongst our young, and the desire to serve others and improve society, in each new generation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Wang and others who have spoken about the importance of leadership and character development.&nbsp; We want to develop a mental toughness in our young, the ability to withstand shocks, come out of difficulty and thrive.&nbsp; These are attributes that will help young Singaporeans do well in the future, and help Singapore do well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that several Members have spoken on the subject of streaming, and some others are scheduled to speak on the subject of the Normal Course.&nbsp; Sir, we will address these issues, together with the other issues which Members have brought up, in subsequent interventions.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Minister has just confirmed that.&nbsp; The key objective of this strategy is to provide diverse educational pathways.&nbsp; Indeed, while the MOE tries to have peaks of excellence, the words of Mr Ngiam Tong Dow resonates with many people when he said that we also need \"high national averages\".&nbsp; Mr Ngiam was, of course, citing the views of the former President of Matsushita Corporation of Japan, Mr Yamashita, who had made the same point.&nbsp; Mr Ngiam's statement resonates because many would agree that having peaks of excellence alone are not sufficient.&nbsp; We need a good critical mass of competent and capable school leavers who can man the industries and run the offices.&nbsp; In fact, this is critical, Sir, if we want to ensure that our workforce remains No. 1 on the BERI ranking, so that we can continue to attract investments and create more jobs for all Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2291<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in last year's debate, I had made calls, together with other parliamentary colleagues, to ask for a review of the \"N\" level education, to make sure that the syllabus is much more meaningful and useful to the students in terms of either preparing them for their \"O\" levels or for vocational training that will help them to secure employment.&nbsp; Sir, I am glad to note that in January this year, the MOE announced about reforms to the Normal (Academic) stream.&nbsp; Normal (Academic) students can now sit for two \"O\" level papers one year earlier than they would otherwise do.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there are any other reforms with regard to the Normal (Academic) students.&nbsp; My question to the Minister is also whether there has been a review of the Normal (Technical) syllabus and, if so, when will it be completed and whether the Minister can share with this House the key components of that review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I would also like to ask what is the overall strategic objective that the MOE intends to achieve when it conducts the review of the \"N\" level syllabus.&nbsp; Will the review result in the students in the \"N\" level stream being better prepared for either the \"O\" levels or for the job market?&nbsp; Also, does the review include a review of the teaching methods and approaches, because an important consideration for students in the Normal stream is that they do need an environment which is much more motivating and interesting?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</B> Sir, I look forward to more exciting announcements from the Education Minister, especially with regard to ranking.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry to consider doing away with the Secondary 4 academic examinations, and allowing all Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students <p align=left>Column: 2292<p>to sit for the Secondary 5 \"N\" examinations at the end of three years, the reason being four out of five of the 10,000 students who get into the Normal (Academic) stream already qualify for the Secondary 5 \"N\" examination.&nbsp; A check with the Ministry's top 40 schools for the Normal course in 2003 - shows that in almost all of the 40 schools, about 80-90% of the students obtained&nbsp;three \"O\" levels and 65% of them went on to obtaining&nbsp;five \"O\" levels.&nbsp; These are very healthy trends.&nbsp; While four out of five go on to Secondary 5, their Secondary 5 results show that our Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students are capable of producing good results.&nbsp; So, if this is the trend then I hardly see, unless the Ministry can convince otherwise, the necessity to prepare our Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students for a two-step progression - a Secondary 4 Normal examination and then followed by a Secondary 5 examination.&nbsp; If we look at the original intent of introducing the Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) stream, it was to allow the students to reach \"O\" levels at a pace that they can move along with.&nbsp; So, if this is already happening naturally over three years, why not we just do away with the Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) examinations?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I anticipate the Ministry's reservation on this point.&nbsp; \"Why are we over-emphasising the \"O\" level?\", was the answer I got last year.&nbsp; My counter to that would be that if we look at nursing right now, students without \"O\" levels enter Certificate in Nursing,&nbsp;students with \"O\" levels enter a Diploma in Nursing course.&nbsp; So \"O\" levels are still crucial and if so many of our Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students can make it to Secondary 5, I would like to know why the Ministry still sees it as a necessity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, the many changes that are being made to upper <p align=left>Column: 2293<p>secondary, JC as well as university education - have largely been welcomed by Singaporeans but will essentially benefit only the top 20% or so of the secondary schools, leading to the feeling of elitism by some.&nbsp; In contrast, time seem to have stood still for the <st1:place>Normal</st1:place>&nbsp;(Technical) education programme, as its curriculum has remained essentially the same for the past 10 years.&nbsp; In fact, a teacher in the <st1:place>Normal</st1:place>&nbsp;(Technical) stream recently told me that there is only one Mathematics text book for this stream&nbsp; - the very same one since streaming started.&nbsp; The <st1:place>Normal</st1:place>&nbsp;(Technical) students seem to be poor forgotten cousins in the grand edifice of our world-class education system.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand that some teachers have been asking that the textbooks for the <st1:City><st1:place>Normal</st1:place></st1:City>&nbsp;(Technical) stream be rewritten, and they were recently told by MOE officials that the earliest the changes can be made is only in 2006, some three years later.&nbsp; With due respect, I do not understand why the Ministry needs three years to implement these changes.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry's recent announcement that the syllabus and teaching methods for the <st1:place>Normal</st1:place>&nbsp;(Technical) stream will be reviewed has come none too soon.&nbsp; Allowing the better <st1:place>Normal</st1:place>&nbsp;(Technical) students to take up to two subjects, like Science and Mathematics, at the higher level, similar to their counterparts in the <st1:place>Normal</st1:place>&nbsp;(Academic) stream, is clearly welcomed.&nbsp; As noted by the Principal of Hai Sing Catholic School, Mrs Mary Koh, these changes would have far-reaching effects.&nbsp; But, more importantly, it will raise the self-esteem of these pupils and boost their confidence.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recent interviews and feedback from teachers of these pupils&nbsp;are that many of these students, if given a chance, can be motivated to work hard and even take on leadership roles.&nbsp; Labelling these students as Normal and, by inference, not as good<p align=left>Column: 2294<p> as their peers in the Express and other streams could be a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp; The students may internalise this negative perception of themselves that they are weak, ill-disciplined students and, therefore, behave exactly as they are perceived.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, I urge the Ministry to speed up its review of the curriculum and teaching methods for this group of students on an urgent basis, as change is sorely needed here if we want to ensure that every student's potential is developed to the fullest.&nbsp; Further, the criteria for lateral transfer between <st1:City><st1:place>Normal</st1:place></st1:City>&nbsp;(Technical) and <st1:City><st1:place>Normal</st1:place></st1:City>&nbsp;(Academic) streams should be reviewed in conjunction with the syllabus, as it has been reported that making the transition from <st1:City><st1:place>Normal</st1:place></st1:City>&nbsp;(Technical) to <st1:City><st1:place>Normal</st1:place></st1:City>&nbsp;(Academic) is extremely difficult, because of the big gulf between the syllabi of the two streams.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, since the stream started 10 years ago, no Normal (Technical) student has ever made it to Secondary 5, as the criteria required to go up the ladder&nbsp;are just too difficult to meet for the Normal (Technical) students.&nbsp; This, again, could be a demotivational factor for&nbsp; <st1:City><st1:place>Normal</st1:place></st1:City>&nbsp;(Technical) students, as they see the hurdle placed before them as being extremely difficult to cross, even if they have a dream to pursue.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In this period of 50 years, great changes have taken place in the world economy and society, but dictation and writing passages from memory remain the baggage of students. This is a problem not only in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but also in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, where the learning of Chinese characters is not a <p align=left>Column: 2295<p>simple matter. In the bilingual environment of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I think the teaching methods should be innovated.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have not explored new methods probably because of the compulsory Mother Tongue policy. Since it is compulsory, there is no need to innovate. If students do not get admitted into the premier schools, then the implication is that they have not worked hard enough, hence they could not score well in examinations. In the circumstances, students take up the Mother Tongue for the sake of the examinations, and not for the love of it. Those who cannot cope, will hate it even more. I can see from my own&nbsp;four children, especially my 9-year old child. With his standard of English, he can read interesting story books, such as Harry Potter. But with his meagre standard of Chinese, he is unable to read books which are likely to interest him, while the only books he could read and understand are probably too elementary to arouse his interest.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With modern technology, even the handphone has a dictionary.

To this group of people, even if the Government is to give way again and again, they will not be contented.&nbsp; They will be testing the Government's bottom-line. What is next? Are we going to take out Mother Tongue from the PSLE aggregate?&nbsp; And&nbsp;are we then going to follow the suggestion of Mr Giam Meng Tuck of <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I>, by allowing the parents to opt their children out of the mother tongue language, and stop the young children from learning it?.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the emergence of China, India and other Asian countries, I am not worried&nbsp;about the long-term development of mother tongue in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the Government does not affirm the status of mother tongue, and keep on giving way,&nbsp; we&nbsp;will polarise our society, with the masses supporting the mother tongue on one side and the minority, whose voice is also the loudest, on the other.&nbsp; The development of this kind of polarisation will do harm but no good to our social cohesion.&nbsp; As such, I<p align=left>Column: 2298<p> hope that the Government should be mindful of the long-term implications in making any&nbsp;adjustment to the mother tongue policy.&nbsp; We should not slaughter the sacred cow just because we want to slaughter a cow.&nbsp; Mother tongue is the dignity of a nation which we&nbsp;should not&nbsp;kill wrongly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we should look carefully into the matter.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, in response to feedback from parents and students who are less linguistically gifted in their mother tongue but who do well in other subjects, MOE has liberalised its rules on MTL for JC and university admission.&nbsp; MTL is now also taught experimentally using English.&nbsp; It is different strokes for different folks approach to tailor-make the programme to suit the learning abilities of the child to go as far or as near as their aptitude allows.&nbsp; Many students taking Higher Chinese have opted to continue to do so, even if they can switch to the lower CLB standard if they wanted to.&nbsp; Furthermore, some students taking CL syllabus have also sought to switch to Higher Chinese, perhaps out of interest.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This change of policy has led to very opposing views.&nbsp; The <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Straits Times,</i> in an editorial of 26th January, quite rightly, called this \"a tale of two camps&nbsp; -&nbsp; the English-speaking camp and the Chinese intelligentsia\".&nbsp; Many English-speaking parents whose home environments are not the most conducive to the learning of Chinese have warmly welcomed this move to reduce the struggles their children face.&nbsp; Those who favour the liberalisation move argue that the cultural bias inherent in language learning should be Singaporean rather than Chinese.&nbsp; Therefore, it is okay to under achieve in Chinese, even if one is a Chinese by ancestry.&nbsp; Because one is first and foremost a Singaporean who happens to be Chinese by race.&nbsp; Chinese intellectuals, however, argue that this move is <p align=left>Column: 2299<p>capitulation to populist pressures and will result in lower standards of language learning and, ultimately, a culturally stunted generation of younger people whose learning of Chinese is purely functional, so as to gain an advantage in doing business in China.&nbsp; Allowing CLB is, therefore, a cop-out.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They further argue that the bias inherent in CLB or learning Chinese using English leans towards westernisation, not so much Singaporeanisation.&nbsp; And the best antidote is a higher standard of Chinese language as an anchor to one's cultural and not really national roots.&nbsp; I think between these two sides of the debate, those most affected, the students themselves including my children, have often complained about the way in which Chinese is taught, principally through memorisation of characters and phrases, which kills the joy of learning. By contrast, some schools have successfully used a variety of creative methods to instill interest&nbsp; -&nbsp; comic strips to learn idioms, singing Stephany and pop songs, discussing characters and plots in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\".&nbsp; Teaching method is therefore one of the important keys to effective Chinese learning.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to research further how Chinese can be taught in such a way as to sustain the interest of our students.&nbsp; Perhaps, for their pupils' sake, MOE might even have to conduct some for the Chinese appreciation courses&nbsp;of parents to raise their level of understanding and competency.&nbsp; This is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for effective MTL.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B> (<I>In Mandarin)</I>: Sir, I want to emphasise that we need to maintain a more balanced bilingual policy between the mother tongue and English, so as to stay competitive in the global <p align=left>Column: 2300<p>economy.&nbsp; We want to have a bigger space for our Singaporeans to survive.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a survey in <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>, by the year 2050, the people speaking English in the world would be reduced to just 5% of the population. In another study conducted by the \"<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Science</i>\" journal of <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>, more and more people are learning Chinese, and Chinese would be the \"most learnt\" language in the world in the next decade.

This will free the regular teachers from this extra burden, and they can concentrate on nurturing the other students.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify;

In the refinement of the mother tongue policy, the curriculum design, teaching strategies and assessment modes should be reviewed thoroughly.&nbsp; We should not review only the teaching strategies because that is not enough.&nbsp; It will not solve the problem.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.&nbsp; If today, we still base the testing on <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">ting xie</i>, that is, dictation, and learning of vocabulary, I think this is against the general trend.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2302<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should have a full review on why the students find it so difficult, and have to spend so much more time in preparing for the tests in Chinese.&nbsp; From primary school to Pre-U, after 12 years, 90% of the stduents passed the Chinese examination, but they are not proficient in Chinese.&nbsp; They cannot even speak proper Mandarin, not to mention the writing or reading of the classics.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Under the present climate, I think Chinese has a very bright future.&nbsp; Our Chinese teachers should not feel despondent because Chinese has a very bright future in the changing global economic climate.&nbsp; Those who do not want to learn Chinese, we should let them go.&nbsp; We should not force them to learn so that our teachers can concentrate their efforts on teaching those who are willing to learn Chinese, and learn it well.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

However, the changes carried out currently have been limited to only the Chinese mother tongue language.&nbsp; The Minister has said that he may make the same changes to the other mother tongue languages.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if this will be done because currently although we do not have a major problem with Malay students passing their<p align=left>Column: 2303<p> mother tongue language, I can however see that a growing number of Malay students will be facing problem because the quality of the Malay language has also risen.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I> :&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the economic rise of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> has plucked up a crave for the learning of Chinese in the world.&nbsp; The recently revised university admission criteria which exclude the grade of&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese seem to run counter to the current world trend.&nbsp; The Chinese community here is very concerned. &nbsp; The new policy may perhaps be intended to mitigate the difficulty in learning Chinese, so as to relieve the pressure on the students.&nbsp; However, if consultation has been made with the Chinese community and feedback sought from the public, misunderstanding and dissatisfaction may be minimised.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; tab-stops: 28.05pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; tab-stops: 28.05pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese language is&nbsp;the root of the Chinese culture.&nbsp; It is because of Chinese language that the Chinese culture can be transmitted&nbsp;from generation to generation. &nbsp; It is therefore unwise to give up the language just for immediate convenience. English educated parents often complain about the difficulty in learning Chinese.&nbsp; They want MOE to lower the standard of the Chinese Language in school so that it could be easier for their children to pass <p align=left>Column: 2304<p>the examinations. During my school days, almost all our parents were dialect- speaking.&nbsp; But when we complained to our parents of the burden of learning Chinese and English at the same time, they would say, \"If you do not study hard, you will not be able to make a living and end up as a beggar.\" &nbsp;&nbsp; To our present students, may I urge them to work hard, to read more, study more and write more in both the English and the Chinese languages so as to be effectively bilingual.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, parents nowadays who do not know Chinese or are unwilling to learn Chinese, often give the wrong ideas to their children, resulting in the children developing a phobia for Chinese. Worse still, some ethnic Chinese parents even treat English as their mother tongue and relegate their own mother tongue as a secondary language to be ignored.&nbsp; As ethnic Chinese, they do not know Chinese and even want to discard their own Chinese culture.&nbsp; They will regret in their later life.&nbsp; A survey by the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Lianhe Zaobao</i> showed that 83% of our students regard Chinese as their mother tongue.&nbsp; But there are still some 17% who&nbsp; regard Chinese as an alien language.&nbsp; This is a matter of grave concern.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in our society, the majority of ethnic Chinese do not discard their own culture and values although they do not know the Chinese Language.&nbsp; For example, in an interview by <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Lianhe Zaobao,</i> &nbsp; Mr Liew Woon Leong, the CEO of Capitaland remarked that &nbsp; his biggest regret in life was not to have learned Chinese.&nbsp; He would not let his children make the same mistake.&nbsp; Instead he encouraged them to value the learning of Chinese. He even took them to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> to learn about Chinese culture.&nbsp; This spirit of upholding Chinese cultural value and encouraging his children to learn Chinese is a good example to be emulated by other Chinese parents who do not know Chinese.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 2305<p><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Chinese Language</I><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> (<I>In Mandarin</I>): Sir, I read this story on the Internet<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">. &nbsp;</b> A young man from <st1:City><st1:place>Columbia</st1:place></st1:City> was encouraged by his father to take up a foreign language. He heard about the emergence of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and thought maybe he should take up Chinese as there was hardly anyone in his country who knew how to speak Chinese.&nbsp; Knowing nothing about <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and wanting to know about <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and its history and culture before embarking on the study of the language, he posted a message on the Internet to seek more information about <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and whether he should learn Chinese.&nbsp; <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">&nbsp;</b></p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One month later, he received a letter from a young lady in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> saying (presumably in English) , \"I understand that you want to learn Chinese.&nbsp; Learning Chinese is not difficult.&nbsp; All you need to do is to put your heart and soul in it. &nbsp; I am sending you two Chinese words: one expresses joy, while the other represents sadness.&nbsp; If you take a good look at these two words, I am sure you can tell which is which.\"&nbsp; The two Chinese words were \u54ed <I>ku</I> (meaning cry), and \u7b11 <I>xiao</I> (meaning laughter).&nbsp; This young Columbian took a good look at the two words and he had no difficulty making out which word was \"laughter\", and which word was \"cry\".&nbsp; Thus he received a confidence booster to start the learning of Chinese.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many westerners learn Chinese as an adult and the environment in which they learn Chinese may not be as good as that in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, yet they could learn Chinese very well.&nbsp; In the newspapers, we read that some westerners came to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to perform the \"cross talk\" with impeccable Mandarin.&nbsp; They are successful because they worked hard in their learning, and put their heart and soul in the process. Of course, their love for Chinese culture also helps.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order that our students could learn <p align=left>Column: 2306<p>Chinese well, we should not be lowering the standard of Chinese because this is like putting the cart before the horse. When the standard of Chinese is very low, even if you get an 'A', the 'A' means nothing.&nbsp; Most importantly, as Mr Ang Mong Seng has said, we need to change the mentality and attitude of the parents and the students in the learning of Chinese.&nbsp; There are many ways that parents could do to help their children to learn Chinese and create more opportunities for them to practise using Chinese. As Prof. Koo Tsai Kee has said, they could send their children to the PCF kindergartens and let them watch Chinese TV programmes. They could also buy more Chinese newspapers and magazines for them to read, so that they have more opportunity to come into contact with Chinese.&nbsp; Of course, I would support the suggestion by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that we have to improve on the teaching method of Chinese.&nbsp; I do not think I need to repeat this.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping that the teaching of Chinese would be linked to our daily life and our culture so that the students will get to learn a lively language and not a deadpan subject.&nbsp; Only with this multi-faceted approach, can we genuinely raise the standard of Chinese in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

<B>Mr</B> <B>Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I read from the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Hansard</i> that MOE needs to recruit around 300 Chinese teachers every year to replace those who have resigned or retired.&nbsp; Many of these new Chinese teachers are from <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and are here on MOE's teaching scholarship programme - where they are given a monthly stipend and have to serve a six-year bond upon graduation from NIE.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am concerned with this high turnover and replacement of experienced Chinese teachers with new recruits who have just graduated.&nbsp; I ask because I note<p align=left>Column: 2307<p> that the standard of Chinese, as a second language, has been falling and that it has also been dropped as an admission requirement for our local university.&nbsp; Is this an acknowledgement of the failure of our education system to boost the standard of Chinese among our students?&nbsp; Why is it that our younger students are getting weaker and weaker in the Chinese language?&nbsp; When our students do not do well in their studies, I question the teachers as much as I would question the ability of the students.&nbsp; Has MOE evaluated the effectiveness of this programme to know whether it has been effective?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, either the new teachers are not very effective in the teaching of Chinese to our students &nbsp; or we do not have a good system of teaching Chinese to our students, or both.&nbsp; It is either way.&nbsp; I want to emphasise that there is an urgent need to re-evaluate both the teachers or the methods the teachers use to teach Chinese so as to improve on our declining standards.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

While we may have a good command of the written language, it may not always be true for the spoken form.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2308<p>A check with some primary school teachers shows that there is still too much emphasis on the written form in terms of composition, comprehension and structured answers, and this is quite a routinised process.&nbsp; Teachers also say that there is too little time within the current classroom situation to engage in discussions that involve processing information as well as having fun with the use of the language.&nbsp; Moreover, the indicators used to see whether successful learning is taking place within the classroom still go back to the conventional form, often in terms of composition, comprehension and written exercises.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fear is that we have boxed the English language into something that is perhaps too functional, with little room left for having just pure fun.&nbsp; Developing a love for the language has to begin early which, I think, happens in many homes.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, it is the school that continues to nurture that interest.&nbsp; In this respect, I have two questions or suggestions to make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the teachers who teach English language, especially in the primary schools, could I ask who they are, what are their qualifications, and whether they are individuals who have specialised&nbsp;in either English Language or Literature at university.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, for mother tongue, we do bring in specialists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we could also do with introducing an oral component in the examinations, and this oral component could carry a stronger emphasis than the current form, so that we encourage our young children to speak and we&nbsp;also hear their voices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, as we continue with this discussion on mother tongue, may I also urge that we keep an eye on the command of our English language where our students are concerned, so that we <p align=left>Column: 2309<p>know that we are moving perhaps a little bit more beyond <I>Phua Chu Kang</I>.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Many have said that there have been a lot of reviews and changes made to the education system but, generally, I would say that I endorse the direction it is taking.&nbsp; Personally, I would also like to applaud the changes made to accommodate the weaker students in terms of Chinese, with the introduction of Chinese B, because my son happens to be in that category.&nbsp; So I am extremely grateful for little mercies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said,&nbsp;I would like to champion the learning of more languages.&nbsp; We live and operate in a globalised world.&nbsp; So, language has become very important.&nbsp; If we look at the Dutch, we should be impressed by them.&nbsp; They speak Dutch, of course, but, amongst the Europeans, they are the most proficient in terms of English.&nbsp; Not only that, they are also able to master two other languages, eg, German, French, and so on.&nbsp; We are surrounded by some 300 million people who speak Malay.&nbsp; But many Singaporeans, especially the younger ones, cannot venture beyond a few words of Malay.&nbsp; Likewise, other countries, such as Vietnam and Thailand, are also up and coming.&nbsp; And languages really help us to do business, because languages simply build&nbsp;relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, rather than take the attitude that the learning of languages is difficult, it should be made&nbsp;for all to feel that it is important and, therefore, it should be made fun, enjoyable as well as relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; My Dutch friends tell me that it is not stressful at all for them to learn so many languages in school.&nbsp; Maybe one reason is because it is not examinable to start with.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2310<p>The Dutch have been global citizens for a long time.&nbsp; The Chinese are new in this game, but they are really plugging ferociously into the global network in terms of English proficiency.&nbsp; So, I would urge the Ministry of Education to perhaps look at these winning models and see how we could adopt some of the changes or factors that they have&nbsp; introduced into their system.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, several Members have spoken on the issue of mother tongue language -&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Dr Ong Seh Hong, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mdm Halimah, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Steve Chia and Mrs Fang Ai Lian.&nbsp; This is an important issue.&nbsp; I will first explain MOE's policy perspective on the issues raised, before MOS Chan Soo Sen also replies on this subject, and Mr Hawazi explains our position on the issue of <I>Baku</I>.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our policies on the learning of the mother tongue languages are founded on a basic fact.&nbsp; It is not in Singapore's&nbsp;interests to allow the mother tongue languages to wither.&nbsp; It is not in our interest to allow new generations of Singaporeans to lose their competence in the mother tongue languages, or lose an instinctive sense of affiliation with the cultures that&nbsp;they represent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two reasons for this.&nbsp; The first has to do with how the world is changing, especially economically.&nbsp; Our competence in the mother tongue languages, together with our English-speaking capabilities, are critical to how we stay competitive in the coming decades.&nbsp; Together, they help us to stay relevant to Asia, and stay relevant to the West.&nbsp; China especially is reshaping the world, and will reshape Singapore's economic future.&nbsp; As Members have pointed out in this debate, and as others like Senior Parliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai Kee and&nbsp; Mr Ng Ser Miang pointed out during the&nbsp;Budget debate, that is also <p align=left>Column: 2311<p>why&nbsp;people around the world are learning Mandarin.&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng had referred to this as well.&nbsp; The numbers will grow geometrically over the next two decades.&nbsp; Every Chinese Singaporean student should be encouraged to learn the Chinese language to as high a level as he can manage.&nbsp; Those who acquire a deep understanding of Chinese language and culture, including contemporary China, will be a major asset for Singapore. &nbsp;They will help us to engage China, economically and socially.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason why the&nbsp;mother tongue languages are integral to education has to do with the type of society we want to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang had mentioned this in his remarks. &nbsp;We lose more than the mother tongue languages if we allow them to wither.&nbsp; We lose our sense of distinctiveness as a society, our sense of being part of a larger Asian history, and of the unfolding Asian story.&nbsp; We lose our identity and confidence as a people.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must, therefore,&nbsp;apply ourselves to sustaining the mother tongue languages&nbsp;in Singapore.&nbsp; We must do what we can in schools to sustain and deepen our capabilities in the mother tongue languages. &nbsp;There is no easy way of doing so.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;no switch to turn on, no rheostat to turn the lights up.&nbsp; Because English is the&nbsp;main language of instruction in education for our&nbsp;young, it is a complex challenge.&nbsp; Many of our students lack the home or social environment that allows them to immerse themselves in the mother tongue.&nbsp; We have to take account of these realities and find effective ways to develop our students' capabilities in the mother tongue languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that we will not succeed unless students are motivated to learn the language.&nbsp; Motivation is at the heart of whether you learn something successfully.&nbsp; It is at the heart of&nbsp;whether <p align=left>Column: 2312<p>you learn the mother tongue in a way that gives you&nbsp;confidence to use&nbsp;it when you&nbsp;leave school.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have sought to motivate students to learn the mother tongue languages&nbsp;by providing them incentives to do so, eg,&nbsp;entry requirements to the next stage of their education, and bonus points if they pass or do well in Higher Mother Tongue.&nbsp; It is a pragmatic approach, and remains a useful and effective way of motivating young students, who will not immediately understand why competence in the mother tongue will give them advantage in life.&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach helps to ensure that our students take mother tongue seriously, put in effort, and achieve at least a basic proficiency in the language.&nbsp; But these incentives will not in themselves be sufficient to motivate students to deepen their knowledge, go beyond the examinations, and take a lasting interest in mother tongue after they leave school.&nbsp; There has to be something more.&nbsp; There has to be a love for the language and an appreciation of the richness of culture that the language opens the doors to.&nbsp; And, as students get older, an appreciation of the advantages and opportunities that will come with knowing the language.&nbsp; We will have to help students develop this love for the language and help them recognise the opportunities that they can open for themselves by learning the language well.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts to sustain and enhance interest in the mother tongue languages must&nbsp; therefore involve a balance of several strategies. &nbsp;It will be simplistic to assume that we can maintain an interest in the mother tongue languages by doing away with the incentives we provide and hoping students will become motivated on their own.&nbsp; But if we rely solely on educational incentives or rewards to motivate students to take the language seriously, we will be losing the battle.&nbsp; For language learning to be effective, we need more than this.&nbsp; We need a curriculum,<p align=left>Column: 2313<p> teaching methods and assessment methods that will help bring the language to life.&nbsp; We have to provide students the opportunities and experiences that will spur a passion for the language and help them discover the positive reasons why they should learn the language well.&nbsp; And the student's motivation to learn the language in school will have to be supported at home.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The balance of strategies we adopt will depend on a student's abilities, and what stage of education he is at. &nbsp;We cannot adopt the same strategies for tertiary education as we do in schools.&nbsp; At the tertiary level, the Government recently agreed to the proposals of the University Admissions Committee for NUS and NTU to do away with mandatory counting of mother tongue language&nbsp;scores for university admission.&nbsp; There were sound reasons for this.&nbsp; First, as the committee&nbsp;had rightly pointed out, it is not appropriate for a student's choice of university, what course he takes and what career he eventually pursues to be determined by his mother tongue language&nbsp;grades in school.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a second reason which is also important.&nbsp;&nbsp; NUS and NTU have entered a more competitive university landscape.&nbsp; We are opening up to one or two private universities, with the first intakes expected from as early as 2006.&nbsp; They will have their own admission requirements, just like SMU today, which does not take mother tongue&nbsp;into consideration as an entry requirement.&nbsp; Adding to this, NUS and NTU are increasingly competing with good overseas universities for Singapore students. &nbsp;For our universities to thrive in this more competitive university environment, they must be able to select the best students for each course.&nbsp; It is no longer tenable for the Government to impose requirements on NUS and NTU that hamper their ability to attract and select the best students.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2314<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the reasons why we agreed that NUS and NTU need not require every student to include his Mother Tongue&nbsp;grade in the admissions score.&nbsp; However, students will still be required to have a passing grade in the Mother Tongue to gain admission.&nbsp; Those who do well in the Mother Tongue&nbsp;can still choose to use it in their university admission scores.&nbsp; And those who take the Mother Tongue or the Higher Mother Tongue Language&nbsp;as a full 'A' level subject, will still be able to include it in their admission scores, as one of their 'A' level subjects.&nbsp; But the Mother Tongue&nbsp;grade will no longer be a mandatory component of the scores, just as it is not a mandatory component for junior college&nbsp;or polytechnic admission.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the school system, MOE will retain incentives for students to offer Mother Tongue to as high a level as they can manage.&nbsp; Bilingualism remains a cornerstone of school education.&nbsp; All students will continue to do mother tongue for 10 years of general education; 12 years if they carry on through junior college.&nbsp; It may be worth reminding Members of the incentives we have in place to encourage students to take Mother Tongue&nbsp;seriously in school.&nbsp;

Even with the greater flexibility that some schools will have in their admissions, which I have mentioned earlier, the MTL will remain a fundamental feature of progression requirements.&nbsp; Those who pass Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL) also get bonus points for admission to SAP schools.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At the junior college level, students going to junior colleges have to pass Mother Tongue Language (MTL) - at least a D7. Those who do well in mother tongue can include it in their scores for JC admission - 50% of our JC1 students, in fact, do so when they apply for admission to the junior colleges. Those who do well in HMTL can use the subject instead of <p align=left>Column: 2315<p>English in their JC admission score - 10% of our students already do so.&nbsp; Those who obtain at least a C6 grade in HMTL get bonus points for JC admission.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">5.45 pm</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are significant incentives.&nbsp; Few other countries, perhaps no other country, provide similar incentives for school admission.&nbsp; But our language environment is unique and the fact that these are not just second languages but mother tongue languages requires that we give them additional emphasis in our schools.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our real challenge is to go beyond these incentives, to nurture a passion in our students for the languages, an interest that they carry with them after they have completed their examinations and leave school.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a major priority for MOE.&nbsp; That is why we are undertaking a comprehensive review of our Chinese Language (CL) teaching and learning methods.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese Language Curriculum and Pedagogy Review Committee, chaired by Mr Wee Heng Tin, currently the Director-General of Education, will study how we can improve the Chinese Language curriculum and teaching approaches to better motivate and interest students in the language as they progress through school.&nbsp; The Committee will see how we can introduce innovative Chinese Language teaching and assessment approaches in our schools, as Dr Wang and several others have suggested.&nbsp; They will study the appropriate level of emphasis that should be given to the various language skills - listening, speaking, reading and writing.&nbsp; Dr Wang has also commented on this.&nbsp; The Committee will also study the extent to which we need a differentiated approach to teaching Chinese Language to different students, in primary and<p align=left>Column: 2316<p> secondary schools, so as to best sustain every student's interest in the language.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will also explore possibilities to enrich Chinese Language learning at the junior college level.&nbsp; The new junior college curriculum framework from 2006 will have the flexibility to allow for new elective subjects, including those relating to China.&nbsp; MOE will be exploring with the universities and JCs on how we can develop a 'China studies' elective in the new curriculum, which can focus on Chinese history and the contemporary Chinese economy and society.&nbsp; It can be part of the range of subjects that students can choose from, as part of the broader curriculum that they will take in future. We will study this.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, improvements to the curriculum and innovations in teaching will not be enough.&nbsp; We have to provide more opportunities for students to pursue their interests in mother tongue outside the classroom.&nbsp; We are re-doubling our efforts to give our students&nbsp;exposure to China, through schools' linkages and exchange programmes with their counterparts in China.&nbsp; Currently, about 1,200 students go to China each year on exchange or immersion programmes.&nbsp; We will have to scale up this number.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also exposing our school leaders to China.&nbsp; We have begun sending principals to the Tsinghua Executive Programme which is coordinated in Singapore by MTI.&nbsp; This and other opportunities have to be used to give school leaders a clear sense of the challenge and excitement of an unfolding China, so that they can impart the same to our teachers and students.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The schools and JCs which are part of the new integrated programmes will now have additional scope to provide an informal curriculum to raise their students' exposure to the Chinese Language and to China.&nbsp; Those with LEP centres, like Hwa <p align=left>Column: 2317<p>Chong and Temasek JC, can do more.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had asked if the refinements in MTL policy would have an impact on the role of MTL teachers in the junior colleges and centralised institutes (CIs).&nbsp; We do not intend currently to redeploy MTL teachers out of JCs and CIs. There will be some reduction in teaching requirements as students choose not to retake their MTL examinations in their second year of junior college after sitting for the examinations in the first year.&nbsp; However, the JCs and CIs will have ample need for their MTL teachers, if we are to make the most of the opportunities for learning that I mentioned earlier, including the informal curriculum.&nbsp; There will also be a need for teaching resources if we introduce a China studies elective in the JC curriculum in future. MOE is&nbsp; however also mindful of the fact that there is a shortage of senior teachers who can teach Higher Chinese Language (HCL) at the secondary level, especially as more students offer the subject with our recent liberalisation of the eligibility criteria.&nbsp; We will therefore not rule out deploying a few JC/CI teachers to senior teaching positions at the secondary level. Such deployment takes place regularly in our system, as a matter of course.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universities are also doing more to spur their students' interest in the study of CL.&nbsp; NUS, NTU and SMU are promoting student awareness of China through exchange programmes with Chinese universities. NUS has established a Shanghai Overseas College in Fudan University to provide a one-year internship programme to NUS students, that will include Fudan-taught entrepreneurship courses.&nbsp; NTU is offering CL as a major next year for undergraduates at its School of Humanities and Social Sciences.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will work on these initiatives in education, to sustain and raise the interest in the MTLs amongst young Singaporeans and ensure a vibrant future for the <p align=left>Column: 2318<p>languages, as Mr Yeo said, a bright future for our languages. We can achieve that.&nbsp; It has to be a multi-faceted strategy, not focused on incentives and rewards alone. It will continue to be founded on sound educational precepts and the best interests of Singapore. We have not shaped our MTL policies for political expediency, and we will not do so now.&nbsp; I am not sure if Dr Ong Seh Hong seriously believes that the recent changes in university admission requirements were in response to pressures from those who dislike the language, but&nbsp;that is wrong and quite misleading. We do not shape MTL policies to balance constituencies.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also address the different needs and capabilities of our students.&nbsp; Every student must be encouraged to take an interest in the MTL, even if not every student goes the same distance in school.&nbsp; I do not agree with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that we let those who have difficulties with the MTL drop the subject altogether.&nbsp; We should avoid thinking along 'all or nothing' lines in education, whether in mother tongue or any other subjects.&nbsp; I do not think Members will suggest, for instance, that if an EM3 or Normal (Technical) student is having difficulty in Mathematics, we stop teaching him the subject, or&nbsp;if he&nbsp;becomes discouraged, we do not find a new way of creating an interest in the subject on the part of the student.&nbsp; Let us help every student take his mother tongue, go as far as he can, take pride in doing so, and when he leaves school, carry an interest in the language with him.&nbsp; Those who are able to go further, to master the language and take a deep interest in the culture need not fear that they will be held back by others who may not be able to go beyond a basic competence.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last December, when I took my family to Beijing for a holiday, I met Christopher Yap, an old schoolmate.&nbsp; He is SIA's Station Manager in Beijing. When he was in school, he barely passed his CL at<p align=left>Column: 2319<p> Secondary 4.&nbsp; It was an easier subject in those days, but in the school he came from, many boys did no better than scrape through in the language. In those days, there was no need to take CL at the pre-university level either. So, he stopped at Secondary 4.&nbsp; He now speaks CL fluently - fluently enough to do the job well and live comfortably in China.&nbsp; I asked him how he had been able to do this.&nbsp; He said he picked it up when he was posted to Shanghai for three years, then Kunming and Xiamen, another five years.&nbsp; Now in Beijing, he has been in China for eight years.&nbsp; And he is still learning. He told me he is learning the language all the time, even at home watching TV every night.&nbsp; Could he have picked it up as easily if he was not taught the basics in school?&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me it would have been much more difficult.&nbsp; There are many others like him in China - Singaporeans who did not do very well in the language when in school, but have taken the plunge in China, improved their language ability and are doing well. And there will be others like him in future.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not be helping them, or helping Singapore, if we tell them that if they cannot do the language well in school, they better not try at all.&nbsp; We should help every young Singaporean take the MTL as far as he can in school, and to sustain an interest in the language after he leaves school.&nbsp; What matters is not just how many laps of the pool you swim while in school but whether you take a liking for it, and whether you are able to make the most of a huge ocean of opportunities that await you after you leave school.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now ask the Minister of State, Mr Chan Soo Sen, to speak on the issues that have been raised, as well as address some of the other points that have been brought up by Members.&nbsp; Mr Hawazi would then clarify the issues concerning <p align=left>Column: 2320<p><I>Sebutan Baku</I>.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</B> Sir, what I propose to do is to supplement what my Minister has said with regard to the teaching of the&nbsp;Chinese Language. For this part, I will present in Mandarin.&nbsp; I will also address the other issues raised by the other Members and, for that part, I will address in English.&nbsp; I will not mix the languages in the respective parts.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to share with you a story on the learning of languages.&nbsp; This is my own story on how I learned the English language. It happened more than 40 years ago.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was learning English, frankly speaking, in quite a difficult way.&nbsp; In those days, among the subjects that I was learning, English posed the most difficulties to me. In fact, at that time, most families of my class spoke no English. Even our English teachers were sometimes forced to speak to us in Mandarin when they really could not communicate with us. However,&nbsp;a number of teachers in our school were Indian, so it was not possible for us to converse with them in Mandarin. Maybe they knew Chinese but they pretended not to know! Most importantly, we somehow managed to understand one another, and I improved my English in the process.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economic value of English was without doubt. That was 40 years ago.&nbsp; Although I was in a Chinese school, my future prospects would be discounted if I had not learnt English well.&nbsp; I wanted to apply for a scholarship to study overseas, so if my English was not good or if I had failed my Senior Cambridge Examinations, then my dream of an overseas scholarship would remain just a dream, never to be realized.&nbsp; I was taking my Senior Cambridge Examinations in the year when I was in Pre-U 1, and I realised that I had <p align=left>Column: 2321<p>to brush up on my English if I wanted to have some meaningful results.&nbsp; I forced myself to read the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Straits Times</i>. I forced myself to listen to radio broadcasts.&nbsp; If I could not understand the news in English, I would listen to the news in Chinese first, and then tune on to the English news later, because the contents of the Chinese and English news were more or less the same.&nbsp; After some time, I began to understand the English news better. When I read the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Straits Times</i>, I had to underline the words which I did not understand and check the dictionary. Sometimes, after checking the dictionary, I would forget the meaning of the words again. Then, I would have to recheck again.&nbsp; In the process, the number of words which I could not understand became fewer, and I have gradually built up a bigger vocabulary.&nbsp; It was not easy.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I sharing this story?&nbsp; There are a few important points in this story.&nbsp; The first important point is that learning a language is never easy.&nbsp; We cannot just give up the moment we encounter some difficulties.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the economic value of the language is a very important motivating factor, particularly to the students.&nbsp; We often say, if you want to learn a language, you cannot just look at the economic value.&nbsp; I agree. But as an ancient sage said, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sanshi er li</i>, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sishi er buhuo</i>, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">wushi er zhi tianming,</i> meaning at 30, a man should be able to be independent; at 40, a man begins to be wise; and at 50, he begins to know his destiny in life.&nbsp; So, during school days, the students are not even 20, not to mention 30. They only want to be independent, and hence the motivating power of economic value. Having the command of another language is certainly a great asset.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had I not had the command of Chinese and English when I was in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Suzhou</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Industrial Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, it would not be possible for me to negotiate with the Chinese people, using subtle and <p align=left>Column: 2322<p>indirect style which communicate clearly in Chinese.&nbsp; When it comes to dealing with the local Chinese, certain things <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">keyi yihui buke yuanchuan</i> (\u53ef\u4ee5\u610f\u4f1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u8a00\u4f20), meaning can be understood but cannot be expressed or are beyond words. So, such informal manners of communications can carry you far and wide. At the same time, I was able to communicate with the westerners, urging them to come and invest in <st1:City><st1:place>Suzhou</st1:place></st1:City>. On the left, I could face the Chinese; on the right, I could face the westerners.&nbsp; This is what they say, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">zuoyou feng yuan (</i>\u5de6\u53f3\u9022\u6e90), meaning to be successful both sides, or to have the best of both worlds.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Zuoyou feng yuan</i> is an advantage we have been leveraging on. It has been a key competitive edge in our economy.&nbsp; So, on the east we can face <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, on the west we can face <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; We can face east and face west, and we can bring the east and the west together, with us acting as a middleman or a bridge.&nbsp; This type of relationship has been a competitive edge in our economic development.&nbsp; Without our bilingual policy, it is not possible for us to have this competitive edge.&nbsp; So, under the present situation, particularly at the time when the competition is even more intense, it will be foolish of us to give up the bilingual policy and give away this competitive edge.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is emerging and the economic value of Chinese language is entirely different from that of 40 years ago.&nbsp;Forty years ago, when I had just left school, if I were asked the economic value of the Chinese Language 30 years later, I am afraid I would not have been able to confidently say it would be brighter than present. But, today, if I were asked the same question, I would very confidently say Chinese Language would be more important and its prospects brighter 30 years from now, since we know China will be an even more important country politically and<p align=left>Column: 2323<p> economically than what it is today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are very pragmatic.&nbsp; So I am sure this factor will be able to motivate our students to work hard in the learning of the Chinese language, &nbsp; and also to inspire the parents to persuade their children to learn Chinese well.&nbsp; I know that some parents have written to the newspapers, saying that Chinese is very difficult to learn.&nbsp; It has wasted a lot of the children's time and efforts, and they could not learn it well.&nbsp; I believe these parents are in the minority.&nbsp; Maybe, they are about my age, but studied in the English stream. During their younger days, they did not appreciate the importance of Chinese, and thought it had nothing to do with their future prospects. So, they did not put in much effort to master the language. Hence, they have this misconception that Chinese is not of value to them and is irrelevant to their future development. They feel that learning the Chinese language is a burden and an obstacle to their children's studies. Hence, it is not worth putting in all the efforts to master it.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having heard my parliamentary colleagues' speeches, I think we have come to a consensus that the Chinese language does have real economic value.&nbsp; It is something that is worthwhile for us to learn it well. I believe these parents will, one day, eventually come to this realisation too.&nbsp; In fact, I know some real cases amongst my friends and colleagues, who were from the English schools and had conveniently dropped Chinese during their school days, becoming lovers of Chinese language and culture today. I often find them going to <st1:City><st1:place>Beijing</st1:place></st1:City> operas, dialect operas, appreciating Chinese movies and singing songs in Chinese at karaoke sessions. Perhaps they have come to the age of 40 and 50, and hence have become wise and begin to know their destinations. So, they begin to<p align=left>Column: 2324<p> search their souls, and feel that they have to go and find their roots.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To know another language is like holding another key.&nbsp; You can open another treasure trove and enjoy all the good things in it.&nbsp; We know that Singaporeans are pragmatic and even <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">kiasu</i>.&nbsp; So, if we can provide them with a good environment to earn another key, why would they refuse? If Singaporeans realise that the target is important, they will work very hard towards it. Even if they have to suffer some hardship, they are prepared to do it.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we have a group of people who are steadfast in their role, and are prepared to make valuable contributions.&nbsp; These are our Chinese teachers.&nbsp; On 9th March, I spoke to a group of Heads of Chinese Department in Junior Colleges. I asked them about the feelings of our Chinese teachers in the junior colleges, now that Chinese Language results was no longer mandatory for the computation of university admission scores. Although, a little disappointed, the teachers are not despondent.&nbsp; In fact, they are determined to do their job well.&nbsp; During the meeting, they offered many, many suggestions on how to improve Chinese language teaching. Some of their suggestions were also raised by Members of this House. The Chinese Language Review Committee will look into all these suggestions. Therefore, our JC Chinese teachers need not be despondent.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Chinese Teachers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> recently issued an 8-point statement, as was mentioned by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, and I am particularly encouraged and moved when I read the last few sentences which said: \"A multi-language era has arrived.&nbsp; All the developed countries are attaching more importance to the learning of Chinese.&nbsp; Under such a climate, our mother tongue teachers should not be desperate or despondent.&nbsp; We have to mould the<p align=left>Column: 2325<p>character of our next generation of Singaporeans.&nbsp; If we don't, who will?\" It is upbeat, forthright, confident, even heroic, much like the expressions often used by the northern Chinese.&nbsp; The northern Chinese are normally more forthright and heroic in their style of expressions. Hence, \"If we don't, who will?\" They understand their mission and are determined to achieve. I would like to salute our Chinese teachers.&nbsp; With this dedicated spirit of our Chinese teachers, I am sure that the review on the teaching methods will bear good and plentiful fruits. Our Chinese teachers will put in their heart and soul, and lift the teaching and learning of Chinese language to a higher peak.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If our Chinese teachers are not despondent, I hope our Chinese community would not feel too negative. I understand that, of late, the feelings of the Chinese community have been like a roller coaster, springing up and down. When the Mother Tongue B and Higher Chinese admission criteria were relaxed together, generally, the spirit was lifted especially when they heard that more students were applying to read Higher Chinese. In fact, there were&nbsp;many more students opting to do Higher Chinese than those going for Chinese B. So, their spirit was up.&nbsp; When the <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Lianhe</i> <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Zaobao</i> survey<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">,</i> which concluded that out of 10 students, at least eight of them were determined to learn Chinese well, the spirit was even higher.&nbsp; At that time, some even felt so confident about the prospects of Chinese Language that they commented that for those who did not want to learn Chinese, \"So be it! Do not drag the cow up the tree and make life difficult for everybody.\"</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then when we announced a small movement, that is,&nbsp;Chinese language is not compulsory for the computation of university admission score, the spirit sank. Mind you, students still have to secure a minimum CL score, and they could still use Chinese to compute university <p align=left>Column: 2326<p>admission score if this makes his score higher. Hence CL score is still important. But then the spirit did not sink to the bottom. A friend of mine told me that he has been getting feedback from the Chinese community, and the score outside and the score now is 60-40.&nbsp; 60% are downhearted, while 40%&nbsp;are upbeat. I hope that after the assurance given by the Acting Minister that Chinese is still part of the national spirit that cannot be alienated,&nbsp;there will be a swing around to 40-60, or better still, 30-70 and even 20-80.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should see the big picture. Under our school system, mother tongue is still a very important factor in our examination aggregate results. This will not change. &nbsp; The economic value of Chinese is now beyond doubt.&nbsp; We do not have to force people by policy to learn Chinese Language. Indeed we have been talking about education programmes emphasising in creativity, innovation and more autonomy to empower people. If we need to have a policy to force people to learn the mother tongue, then I am afraid it will not be convincing. Our students will just say, \"If I don't learn Chinese, I cannot go further, so I will just hang on with it.\" &nbsp; Down in their hearts they are not happy.&nbsp; They hate Chinese.&nbsp; Some students are having this mentality; my own children included. The ancient Chinese classic said, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">zi bu jiao, fu zhi guo</i> (\u5b50\u4e0d\u6559, \u7236\u4e4b\u8fc7) meaning \"if a son is not properly taught, the father is at fault.\" To this, I agree and I plead guilty. &nbsp; My son told me, \"I am learning this Chinese for you, for your sake, because you want me to learn, and so I learn.&nbsp; I will work hard to get a good grade.&nbsp; But, once I have cleared my hurdle of Higher Chinese, don't force me to learn Chinese again.\"&nbsp; Now he has cleared his Higher Chinese and he is not doing Chinese anymore in the junior college. His learning of Chinese was not motivated from the heart. &nbsp; I hope that maybe one day, he would be like Christopher Yap and rediscover the importance of the Chinese<p align=left>Column: 2327<p> language. He should be able to build on the existing foundation that he has and go further.&nbsp; So now, the future of Chinese is settled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Education has set up a Chinese Language Curriculum and Pedagogy Review, and for the first time it is going to be chaired by the Director-General of Education. &nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, whenever we wanted to review the standard of Chinese, we always had a Minister or some political leaders to lead the committee. But, on this occasion, we are getting the Director-General of Education to lead the committee which comprises senior school leaders, Chinese language subject heads and experts in the academic field.&nbsp; I am sure they will be able to come up with some holistic and multi-dimensional approach to review the curriculum design.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, many of my colleagues suggested that the teaching of the Chinese language should be more interesting and more lively, with singing, comics and all sorts of methods, or even like what the Columbian used to learn Chinese.&nbsp; We will look into all these suggestions very carefully.&nbsp; If Members have any other suggestions, please do not hesitate to give them to me.&nbsp; You can write in English or Chinese, it does not matter.&nbsp; You can also criticise the present practice - no problem.&nbsp; I think it is better to have people showing concern and criticising than nobody showing any concern at all.&nbsp; Now the teaching of Chinese is something which everyone is concerned about, I think the Chinese community should feel empowered.&nbsp; I fully agree with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Dr Ong Seh Hong and even Mr Steve Chia that we have to have a holistic review of the teaching of Chinese.&nbsp; I hope that by August or September when this review committee completes its work, we will be able to share the results of this review <p align=left>Column: 2328<p>with Members.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, our situation is such that parents support the learning of Chinese.&nbsp; Our students also want to learn Chinese.&nbsp; The teachers are determined to teach Chinese and teach it well. Our parliamentary colleagues are all saying that mother tongue is important.&nbsp; We have to learn it with our heart and soul.&nbsp; Now I would like to call upon our Chinese community to make more efforts to cooperate with us.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Chinese to be a lively language, we have to create space for the use of Chinese.&nbsp; We have to use it in a creative way with feelings and be realistic.&nbsp; Only then can our Chinese be like a stream of living water.&nbsp; I believe that the Chinese community can contribute more in this respect.&nbsp; They could organise more activities or competitions and allow our young people to express their feelings in Chinese.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice that in St. Andrew's Junior College, they had an inter-school Chinese songs composition contest.&nbsp; The students wrote the lyrics, composed the tunes and then performed.&nbsp; The Chinese that they used was, to me, a very conservative person, not exactly perfect.&nbsp; In some parts, the grammar was wrong. Sometimes they mixed in some English.&nbsp; But that does not matter.&nbsp; We look at the passion, the expressions, the feelings that manifested in their songs - they sang about their worry for the future, their passion for friends of the opposite sex and the dissatisfaction with the generation gap.&nbsp; This is the feeling of our young people.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to express it in Chinese, and this is an affirmation for the Chinese language.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can have more opportunities to express our hearts in Chinese, it will become a lively language. We will rediscover that Chinese language is passionate, dynamic, creative and also practical.&nbsp; If our Chinese newspapers can <p align=left>Column: 2329<p>have a forum page for the young people to discuss matters which concern them like, for example, falling in love, their worries, their loneliness and their fear, with someone experienced in youth matters, that could be a best seller. Such exchanges would benefit the youth readers and their parents. Also expressing their feelings in Chinese, our young people would feel a sense of attachment to their mother tongue. If we can also have more Chinese toastmaster exercises in our schools and society, they could have more opportunities to use Chinese to express themselves, and I think it will raise the standard of Chinese.&nbsp; There can also be more activities like operas and musicals. We have been talking to and encouraging the Chinese community organisations to do more. I know they will support us.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question now is not whether Chinese is good or English is good, or whether Chinese is strong or English is strong.&nbsp; We want to grab both with both our hands.&nbsp; As Mrs Fang Ai Lian has mentioned, we want to be like the Dutch people.&nbsp; They can speak all sorts of languages.&nbsp; They can speak German, French, Dutch and English.&nbsp; In <st1:place>Scandinavia</st1:place>, it is the same thing. As I have said, with one more key, you can open one more treasure trove.&nbsp; Even if the key is small, you can still have a small treasure, but it is still worth looking for it.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a former student from the Chinese stream, of course, I am very concerned with the future of Chinese.&nbsp; But I feel that under the present macro environment, we do not need to worry.&nbsp; What we need to worry is how to rally the teachers, students, the Chinese community, the parents and the people of all stations of life to put in a concerted effort, to seize the opportunity and to hold this very important key to open this very big treasure trove.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2330<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, I would like to thank all the Members for their suggestions in the teaching of the Chinese language.&nbsp; If they have other suggestions, please pass them to me and I will present them to the Review Committee so that they can do an even better job.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In English)&nbsp;</i> Sir, there are other subjects which have been raised.&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia asked about the success of the MOE teaching scholarship programme for Chinese teachers.&nbsp; The PRC undergraduate teaching scholarship scheme was started in 1998 and has helped to widen the pool of Chinese language teachers in our local primary schools. The first batch of teachers was posted to schools in June 2003.&nbsp; But the scholarship scheme has been discontinued from 2002, because the Ministry of Education was able to meet the demand for CL primary school teachers through local recruitment and targeted teacher recruitment in the PRC.&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Steve Chia that all our Chinese Language teachers&nbsp;are properly trained in the National Institute of Education.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked whether we have similar plans for a review of&nbsp;ML and TL.&nbsp; I would like to say that the Ministry of Education is willing to see how the teaching and learning of our other mother tongue languages can be enhanced, and to see if changes are necessary.&nbsp; As for the specific question about <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">baku</i></st1:place></st1:City>, I will leave it to Mr Hawazi who is more qualified to answer.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Fang Ai Lian called for further evolution of language education to prepare Singaporeans for greater regional and global roles.&nbsp; I agree with Mrs Fang that Singaporeans who are able to speak a language apart from English and their mother tongue will find it economically useful in accessing markets in the region and beyond.&nbsp; As I have said, an additional language is like an additional key to another treasure trove.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2331<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some opinion leaders have indeed said that the age of multi-lingualism has arrived.&nbsp; Currently, students can offer a foreign language such as French, Japanese and German or a non-native mother tongue as a third language.&nbsp; An example of the latter is the Malay special programme which, like our other non-native MTL programmes, is now offered to the top 30% of the PSLE cohort.&nbsp; We have 435 students in the Malay special programme.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education will look into how we can provide greater opportunities for students who have the capacity and interest to take up a non-native mother tongue language as a third language.&nbsp; But I would like to advise Members that speaking with the personal experience of a parent whose son has done Malay special programme, it is not easy to learn three languages.&nbsp; They spend two afternoons a week on classes, and they need a lot of support.&nbsp; At one stage, my son was about to give up.&nbsp; Then I told him about this treasure trove analogy.&nbsp; He was not moved.&nbsp; Then I said, \"Son, can we say that you&nbsp;only need to&nbsp;get a P6 for your third language?&nbsp; That&nbsp;will be&nbsp;good enough for me.\"&nbsp; He said, \"Really, ah!&nbsp; Just a P6 will satisfy you?\"&nbsp; I said,&nbsp; \"Sure.\"&nbsp; He said, \"But I am not going to pass my oral.\"&nbsp; I said, \"I have not seen somebody who is a non-Malay and attends the Malay oral exam, tries his best and still fails.\"&nbsp; Sure enough, he passed.&nbsp; So, do not put too much pressure.&nbsp; Treat this as an additional bonus and try your best.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mrs Fang suggested, students can also benefit from non-examinable language learning experiences that are fun and engaging.&nbsp; I find it encouraging that four of our primary schools and 14 secondary schools have offered students non-native mother tongue language enrichment programmes. &nbsp; One example is <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Chinese&nbsp;</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>&nbsp;High&nbsp; School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>&nbsp;which requires all Secondary 2 pupils to take a two-term <p align=left>Column: 2332<p>course on conversational Malay and Malay customs and culture without the need for examination.&nbsp; This is good enrichment experience.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema spoke on the importance of English language skills for enhanced social interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree.&nbsp; In fact, even as we refine our Mother Tongue provisions, we will continue to strengthen our English Language teaching.&nbsp; Subjects, such as project work, also provide a useful platform to practise social interaction in both formal and informal settings, eg, in group communication and making presentations.&nbsp; Visiting schools nowadays, I do see students staging plays in the classroom as part of learning.&nbsp; In some of the schools, they also have&nbsp;speakers' corners which&nbsp;are quite well used, unlike our Speakers' Corner.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> Sir, on behalf of my Minister, I would like to respond to Mdm Halimah who spoke and commented on <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sebutan&nbsp;</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">baku</i></st1:place></st1:City>, and I would like to speak in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">sebutan&nbsp;</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">baku</i></st1:place></st1:City><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">.</i><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In Malay)&nbsp;</i> In the early 1990s, MOE supported the proposal made by the Malay Language Council of Singapore (MLCS) to adopt the standardised pronunciation in Malay language or <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; MOE did so because the pronunciation system does not change the spelling of the Malay words and does not pose any difficulty in the writing of ML, as each vowel or consonant will have only one sound associated with it.&nbsp; The system provides greater consistency between scripts and the sound.&nbsp; This consistency facilitates the learning of the Malay language for our students who are less exposed to the language at home, including non-Malay students who offer ML in school.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2333<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City> was implemented in primary schools in 1993 and in secondary schools, centralised institutes and junior colleges in 1994.&nbsp; To facilitate the teaching and learning of <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City>, a section on <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City> was included in the new instructional materials based on the revised syllabus that was implemented in the same year as the implementation of <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City>, and it was used in the same year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audio CD, ETV, E-VIDEO and CD-ROMs were also produced using <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; Subsequently, <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City> was incorporated into the oral and listening comprehension examinations at the national level in 1997 for the GCE 'N','O' and 'A' levels, and in 1998 for PSLE.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE had prepared well the ground in the implementation of <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City> in schools.&nbsp; MOE had organised training sessions in the form of seminars and workshops for teachers, and deployed project officers to monitor closely and guide the teachers on the use of <i>sebutan&nbsp;</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City> from 1995 to 1998.&nbsp; The result showed that teachers had responded positively to the implementation of <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; Examination results and feedback provided by teachers on the students' performance in oral examinations in schools had also been positive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the small Malay community in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it would be better to have a common language policy for the schools and the general community that guides the use of the Malay language led by MLCS.&nbsp; If MOE drops the use of <i>sebutan</i> <st1:City><st1:place><i>baku</i></st1:place></st1:City> in schools, there will be no uniformity between the spoken language used in schools and in public at formal occasions.&nbsp; This does not support the objectives of MLCS.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of MLCS in adopting <I>sebutan baku</I> is to position Singapore with its Malay-speaking neighbouring countries to<p align=left>Column: 2334<p> share a common identity within the language and cultural contexts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adoption of <I>sebutan baku</I> is not to replace the existence of the Malay Johore-Riau pronunciation.&nbsp; Historically, Malays in Singapore, owing to our proximity to Johore and Riau, have been using the Johore-Riau pronunciation system in their formal and informal exchanges.&nbsp; While the bazaar-form of Johore-Riau pronunciation is still widely used in daily interactions in informal situations, the use of <I>sebutan baku</I> is encouraged in formal occasions, such as in classroom teaching and learning, delivery of speeches, at seminars, forums, formal meetings, interviews, debates, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major difference between Singapore and our neighbouring countries in the use of <I>sebutan baku</I> is the presence of various dialects in the latter.&nbsp; In Indonesia, for example, there are more than 250 dialects which, to some extent, may cause linguistic interference that hinders students from acquiring the desired standard pronunciation.&nbsp; The <I>sebutan baku</I> in Indonesia is much influenced by Javanese dialect and words.&nbsp; It is because of this that we do not choose Indonesia as our model, although it has adopted <I>sebutan baku</I> since 1928.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Negara Brunei Darussalam, the <I>sebutan baku</I> that is used among the people infuses the Brunei dialect and words into the pronunciation system.&nbsp; However, the students are able to speak in <I>sebutan baku</I> effectively at formal occasions, such as the 'Titian Minda' (Bridging Minds) debate involving Brunei and Singapore pre-university students.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
