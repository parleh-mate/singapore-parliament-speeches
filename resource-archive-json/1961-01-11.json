Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  a  few  days  ago  a  handful   of\r\n\r\ndesperadoes, from the basest of motives, managed to\r\n\r\ncreate among the Malay public an atmosphere of fear\r\n\r\nand  tension  with a view to precipitating  clashes\r\n\r\nbetween Malays and Chinese on 6th January. But  for\r\n\r\nthe  speedy action taken by the Government with the\r\n\r\nactive assistance of members of the Muslim Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard,  Malay P.A.P. Assemblymen, U.M.N.O. leaders\r\n\r\nand Malay religious leaders, 6th January might have\r\n\r\nturned  out to be a day of terror and mourning  for\r\n\r\nmany of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vast majority of the non-Malay public was\r\n\r\nunaware  of the mood of tension and fear  that  had\r\n\r\nbeen built up among the Malays, it was because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   with  the  help  of  Malay   leaders,\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in  preventing  these  anxieties   from\r\n\r\nspreading among the non-Malays as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the danger has passed, we feel it our\r\n\r\nduty  to tell the people of Singapore about  how  a\r\n\r\nhandful of desperadoes plotted death for Malays and\r\n\r\nChinese alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plot began on 14th December, 1960, with a\r\n\r\nmeeting  in  Changi  of a body calling  itself  the\r\n\r\nAngkatan   Revolusi  Tentera  Islam  Singapura   or\r\n\r\nA.R.T.I.S. for short. The leader of this group  was\r\n\r\na   man  called  Abdul  Ghani  Bin  Hassan.  It  is\r\n\r\nworthwhile  noting  that he had been  sentenced  in\r\n\r\n1949 to six years' imprisonment for robbery (though\r\n\r\nhe only served three years). He was sentenced again\r\n\r\nin 1951 for two years for theft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting was ostensibly called to discuss\r\n\r\nMalay  rights,  but a pamphlet distributed  at  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  made  it  clear that A.R.T.I.S. had  more\r\n\r\nsinister motives - to provoke shedding of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, quote a few passages from this\r\n\r\ninflammatory pamphlet:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This pamphlet is directed to my own race, the\r\n\r\nMalays,  who  are  now fighting  to  realise  their\r\n\r\naspirations   and  rights - Singapore's  independence\r\n\r\nthat is untamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the uncontrollable elements of the weather\r\n\r\nin  the high seas, to be followed later by a  calm,\r\n\r\nso   will   our  fighting  spirit  finally   emerge\r\n\r\ntriumphant.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`History teaches us that the aims and aspirations\r\n\r\nfor  the race and country are achieved through  the\r\n\r\nsacrifice of lives and property.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is reprehensible about this pamphlet is not\r\n\r\nthat  it  protests  against the  real  or  imagined\r\n\r\ngrievances  of  the  Malays. There  is  room  in  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  country  for protest  over  grievances,\r\n\r\nwhether real or imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is dangerous and unforgivable is the\r\n\r\nincitement to violence and hatred. Anyone,  whether\r\n\r\nMalay  or Chinese or Indian, who, in a multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety, glorifies violence and preaches hatred and\r\n\r\nuses them as political fuel inevitably prepares the\r\n\r\nground for racial carnage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fortunately these exhortations to violence\r\n\r\nalarmed many of the Malays who were present at  the\r\n\r\nmeeting and they did not therefore respond  to  the\r\n\r\nappeals   of  leaders  of  A.R.T.I.S.  So   nothing\r\n\r\nhappened for a few days after this meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on Christmas Day, rumours began circulating\r\n\r\nto  the  effect that Malays would assemble  on  6th\r\n\r\nJanuary to protest   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst  the  P.A.P.  Government's   alleged\r\n\r\nneglect of Malay interests and alleged favouring of\r\n\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These and other rumours gained circulation very\r\n\r\nrapidly  among the Malays. One of the  rumours  was\r\n\r\nthat  the  Malays would march to the Istana  Negara\r\n\r\nand  that  any attempt by Government  to  stop  the\r\n\r\nprocession would be answered by rioting. The Malays\r\n\r\nwere also told to prepare for an alleged attack  on\r\n\r\nthem by Chinese on 6th January, which was a Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 28th December, a new rumour was added - that a\r\n\r\nMalay member of the Singapore Work Brigade had been\r\n\r\nmurdered.   This  was  a  complete  lie   but   the\r\n\r\nfabricators   of  this  and  other   rumours   were\r\n\r\ndeliberately out to create an atmosphere  of  panic\r\n\r\namong the Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on 31st December, the Police raided a house at\r\n\r\nFernhill  Road and seized a quantity of  stencilled\r\n\r\nposters.  The posters were inflammatory in language\r\n\r\nand  talked of violence and revolution if Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  not  returned  to  the  Malays.  These \r\n\r\nanti-Government posters were scheduled to appear on  3rd\r\n\r\nJanuary, as a prelude to racial disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posters were issued under the name of\r\n\r\nA.R.T.I.S. and so on the morning of  1st  January,\r\n\r\nthe  Police  arrested its president,  Abdul  Ghani.\r\n\r\nUnder  interrogation, he made a  number  of  useful\r\n\r\ndisclosures  and admitted that he  had  a  hand  in\r\n\r\npreparing  the posters. He also revealed  plans  by\r\n\r\nA.R.T.I.S. for engineering armed violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 3rd January, there was widespread fear,\r\n\r\nlargely  induced  by false rumours  spread  by  the\r\n\r\nplotters, of racial disturbances in Malay areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In between spreading these vicious and dangerous\r\n\r\nrumours calculated to bring about the loss of Malay\r\n\r\nas  well as Chinese lives, the plotters decided  to\r\n\r\nmake  some money out of the anxiety they had caused\r\n\r\nto  their  own  people.  So  one  of  the  plotters\r\n\r\ncontacted  a  bomoh. While spreading rumours  about\r\n\r\nimpending  racial clash, the plotter also  informed\r\n\r\nhis   victims  that  \"invulnerability\"  charms  and\r\n\r\nshirts could be bought for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  price from the bomoh. The bomoh is said to  have\r\n\r\ndone well selling invulnerability charms and shirts\r\n\r\nfor  as  much  as $15 apiece. Three Malays  wearing\r\n\r\nthese  shirts were found in the house and  detained\r\n\r\nby  the Police but the bomoh unfortunately vanished\r\n\r\nbefore the Police appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of these plotters toured various\r\n\r\nkampongs spreading false rumours that fighting  had\r\n\r\nbroken out between Chinese and Malays and that  the\r\n\r\nMalays  should stand in readiness for  6th  January\r\n\r\nwhen widespread racial clashes were to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of 5th January, the Police seized\r\n\r\ncopies of a Malay magazine just before they were to\r\n\r\nbe  distributed. This magazine carried an editorial\r\n\r\nunjustly  accusing the Government of provoking  and\r\n\r\nhurting the feelings of Singapore Muslims.  It  was\r\n\r\nalso learnt that the proprietor of the magazine had\r\n\r\nintentions of making a statement on the subject  at\r\n\r\nSultan Mosque after mid-day prayers on 6th January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not suggested that the proprietor was\r\n\r\nin any way connected with the A.R.T.I.S. group. The\r\n\r\nappearance  of this editorial may have  been  sheer\r\n\r\ncoincidence. But in view of the prevailing  air  of\r\n\r\ntension  among the Malays and in view of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  according to rumours Sultan Mosque  had  been\r\n\r\nselected  by the plotters as the spot to spark  off\r\n\r\nclashes, it became necessary for the Government  to\r\n\r\nprevent circulation of the magazine and request the\r\n\r\nproprietor not to make a statement at the mosque.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on the morning of 6th January, the Police\r\n\r\ndiscovered in an unoccupied hut, seven jungle green\r\n\r\nuniforms  with  shoulder  badges  bearing  a  white\r\n\r\ncrescent and star on a green background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police also discovered four flags with Arabic\r\n\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 4th and 5th January, rumours about an\r\n\r\nimpending  racial clash on 6th January  had  gained\r\n\r\nwide  currency among the Malay public. Fortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  non-Malay public knew little or nothing  about\r\n\r\nthese  rumours  or  else the air  of  tension  and.\r\n\r\nanxiety might have spread to the non-Malays as well\r\n\r\nand thus created an extremely ugly situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be asked, why then did 6th January\r\n\r\npass off peacefully?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the Police acted swiftly. They\r\n\r\narrested  a  number of the plotters.  To  date,  15\r\n\r\npersons  have  been  detained  in  connection  with\r\n\r\nA.R.T.I.S.  This  organisation was fortunately  not\r\n\r\nlarge  or influential and these timely arrests  put\r\n\r\nit out of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important factor was the wholehearted\r\n\r\nassistance  given  by  Malay religious,  civic  and\r\n\r\npolitical leaders in helping to combat the  vicious\r\n\r\nrumours  that the plotters had deliberately spread.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the Muslim Advisory Board, Malay\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Assemblymen and leaders of U.M.N.O. issued\r\n\r\nwarnings telling their brother - Malays not  to  heed\r\n\r\nthe   mischievous  lies  of  the  plotters.   These\r\n\r\nwarnings  were broadcast over the Malay section  of\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore throughout the night of 5th January\r\n\r\nand 6th January morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also sent out field units equipped\r\n\r\nwith  loudspeakers  to broadcast  the  messages  of\r\n\r\nMalay leaders in Malay areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay leaders also approached leaders of mosques\r\n\r\nrequesting them to be on the look-out for  mischief\r\n\r\nmakers  and  to  counter  dangerous  rumours.  This\r\n\r\nassistance by Malay religious and political leaders\r\n\r\ndid a great deal to neutralise the mischief created\r\n\r\nby the plotters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason was that these rumours, though\r\n\r\nthey  created anxiety among the Malays,  roused  no\r\n\r\nMalay   animosity   against  the   non-Malays,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, against the Chinese. The fear  was  not\r\n\r\nthat  the Chinese would attack the Malays,  as  the\r\n\r\nplotters had said they would, but that the plotters\r\n\r\nwould  stage  a  small incident which  might  panic\r\n\r\npeople into racial clash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was to prevent such an accidental sparking off\r\n\r\nof  racial  clashes that the Government thought  it\r\n\r\nprudent  not to draw the attention of the non-Malay\r\n\r\npublic to what was happening. A sudden announcement\r\n\r\nabout  it a few days before 6th January might  have\r\n\r\nalarmed  the  non-Malay public who, by  and  large,\r\n\r\nwere  unaware of the rumours and fears  circulating\r\n\r\namong large numbers of Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn  island-wide mood of anxiety and fear could have\r\n\r\nprovided the plotters with greater opportunities to\r\n\r\nstart trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most important reason was that the\r\n\r\nMalays,  though  anxious, behaved sensibly  by  not\r\n\r\nsaying or doing anything to provoke conflict.  This\r\n\r\nas  much  as anything else ensured that 6th January\r\n\r\npassed off without incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that A.R.T.I.S. has been broken up and the\r\n\r\nmood  of  anxiety and fear has subsided, it  is  as\r\n\r\nwell to reflect calmly on what had taken place  and\r\n\r\nwhy it took place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to note is that a handful of\r\n\r\ndesperadoes,  without any following  or  influence,\r\n\r\nwere  able  to inculcate in hundreds  of  people  a\r\n\r\ndangerous mood of anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should frankly recognise the reasons for this.\r\n\r\nThe  Malays are deeply conscious of the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  a  minority in Singapore. This  minority\r\n\r\ncomplex  feeds on the fact that there  is  economic\r\n\r\ndistress among the Malays. Of course, the truth  is\r\n\r\nthat  economic  distress is not  confined  only  to\r\n\r\nMalays.  If  there are poor and unemployed  Malays,\r\n\r\nthere   are  many  poor  and  unemployed   Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndians, and other non-Malays as well. It is not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of solving just Malay poverty or  Chinese\r\n\r\npoverty  or Indian poverty, but poverty in general.\r\n\r\nIt is economically impossible, in a complex society\r\n\r\nlike  ours,  to solve poverty in terms of  this  or\r\n\r\nthat race. However, the unsophisticated Malay, like\r\n\r\nthe  unsophisticated Chinese or  Indian,  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  complex nature of the  problem  of\r\n\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the racialist plotters\r\n\r\ntried  to work on the economic discontents  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays,  in  particular, unemployed  Malay  youths.\r\n\r\nTheir  propaganda claimed that the  Government  was\r\n\r\nfavouring the Chinese at the expense of the Malays.\r\n\r\nThis  was  completely  false, but  same  unemployed\r\n\r\nMalay youths may be ready to believe such false and\r\n\r\ndangerous propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's attempts to solve the Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity issue was again deliberately,  distorted\r\n\r\nby  the  plotters to mean that the  Government  was\r\n\r\nfavouring Chinese education by offering equal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial aid to Nanyang; that it favoured  Chinese\r\n\r\nwhen  it  offered  to take Nanyang  graduates  into\r\n\r\nGovernment service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are, of course, completely distorted\r\n\r\nand  mischievous  interpretations  of  Government's\r\n\r\nactions and intentions, but we should not be  blind\r\n\r\nto  the possible effect such propaganda can have on\r\n\r\nunemployed Malays or on a minority community  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety  which has not yet learnt to think and  act\r\n\r\nnationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a political atmosphere it is necessary\r\n\r\nfor  all  of us - Malays, Chinese and Indians - not  to\r\n\r\nsay  and  do  things which might create  fears  and\r\n\r\nsuspicions,   which   reckless   opportunists   and\r\n\r\nplotters  can  exploit with a view to sparking  off\r\n\r\nracial  conflict. We must never  forget  how  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society there is always the danger  of\r\n\r\nracial  explosion being sparked off by even trivial\r\n\r\nacts  of  stupidity and miscalculation, in addition\r\n\r\nto  deliberate acts of provocation. It is timely to\r\n\r\ndraw  attention  to the lunatics in  the  non-Malay\r\n\r\nworld  who are saying and doing stupid things which\r\n\r\ncould, if unfettered, explode in racial violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are non-Malays who, in the name of\r\n\r\nrevolution or culture or education, are saying  and\r\n\r\ndoing things which, whether they intend it or  not,\r\n\r\nare  increasing  the anxiety of the Malay  minority\r\n\r\nand  thus making them ready prey for reckless Malay\r\n\r\ndemagogues like those who organised A.R.T.I.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, give an illustration of this sort of\r\n\r\nlunancy. Yesterday, that is Tuesday, the Government\r\n\r\nbanned  a  locally  produced Chinese  book  called,\r\n\r\n\"Wind  and  Rain in Rubber Estates\". It is  a  long\r\n\r\npoem  purporting to deal with the life  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nrubber  tappers in the Federation.  It  is  a  well\r\n\r\nwritten  and, for the most part, a sensitive  piece\r\n\r\nof literature written with great feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, for all its poetic language and\r\n\r\nfeeling  the intent of the poem is not unlike  that\r\n\r\nof  the  manifesto of the A.R.T.I.S. group which  I\r\n\r\nquoted earlier. Like the A.R.T.I.S. manifesto, this\r\n\r\npoem  glorifies  violence and inspires  hatred.  It\r\n\r\nendorses   hatred  and  violence   as   justifiable\r\n\r\npolitical fuels and bases for political action. The\r\n\r\neventual result of poems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike this must be to build up an atmosphere of fear\r\n\r\nand hatred to be consummated in racial violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poem after recounting the hardship and\r\n\r\nexploitation  of  rubber  workers,   which   is   a\r\n\r\nlegitimate  theme for any poem,  then  goes  on  to\r\n\r\ndescribe  the  deliberate shooting  of  a  pregnant\r\n\r\nChinese woman tapper by Security Forces during  the\r\n\r\nEmergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote a few extracts to show how the\r\n\r\npoem exploits hatred with a view to inciting people\r\n\r\nto   revolutionary  violence.  I  quote,  Sir.  One\r\n\r\npassage reads like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The rubber workers\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift the companion covered in blood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! She is a pregnant woman.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-spattered body\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soaked clothing\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been torn into shreds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain and the dark red blood mingling\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow like a spring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! A pitiful woman.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then the poem goes on to describe the plight of her\r\n\r\nchildren, left uncared for as a result of the\r\n\r\nkilling. The poem then says this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The hearts of rubber workers can no longer be\r\n\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow, hatred fill their hearts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gloomy sky\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blows the angry wind\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy rubber estate is filled with thick\r\n\r\nmist\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, how gloomy and cold is the great earth!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then  towards the end of the poem, the clarion call\r\n\r\nis  sounded for revolutionary violence. This is how\r\n\r\nthe  passage  reads - after the pregnant  woman  has\r\n\r\nbeen  murdered,  the  tappers carry  the  body  for\r\n\r\nviewing by the other estate tappers:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They open wide both eyes,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hold tightly their tapping knives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, the tapping knives!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they flashed the light of hatred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, eyes!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if arrows of vengeance follow the sound of\r\n\r\nrubber-buckets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of rubber buckets\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is no longer a fearful sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of rubber buckets\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compels them to run to\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road of life and death.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carry the flashing knives\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to fight\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, ready to fight...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They run over many slopes\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping on the bloodstained little path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They run towards the terrible sound of\r\n\r\nrubber-buckets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They run towards the path of battle!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Sir, the \"sound of rubber buckets\" is\r\n\r\nthe  poetic  symbol for rifle fire. The  poem  then\r\n\r\ngoes on to describe how the enraged rubber tappers,\r\n\r\narmed  with tapping knives, rush to join the  armed\r\n\r\nCommunist  forces presumably engaging the  Security\r\n\r\nForces who had killed the woman tapper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this dangerous and mischievous\r\n\r\npoem came to the notice of Government when students\r\n\r\nof  a  Chinese  school applied  for  permission  to\r\n\r\ndramatise this poem for performance at a concert to\r\n\r\nbe  held  on  the 27th of last month.  The  student\r\n\r\norganisers  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of   Home\r\n\r\nAffairs   a   synopsis  of  this  poem  which   was\r\n\r\ndeliberately misleading. The synopsis merely  said,\r\n\r\nand  I  quote  from  the synopsis,  that  the  item\r\n\r\n\"eulogises   the  mountains  and  rivers   of   the\r\n\r\nmotherland,  particularly the sturdy robust  rubber\r\n\r\nplantations.... This work also describes  the  life\r\n\r\nof  rubber  tappers  who keep company  with  rubber\r\n\r\nestates  while running on the plain wielding  their\r\n\r\ntapping knives.... They use their tapping knives to\r\n\r\nallow that snow-white latex to flow slowly....\" You\r\n\r\ncan  see Sir, from the extracts of the poem that  I\r\n\r\nhave  read  that  the synopsis was  completely  and\r\n\r\ndeliberately  misleading. And because  this  was  a\r\n\r\ncompletely  misleading account  of  the  poem,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  all  good faith was  deceived  into\r\n\r\napproving this mischievous play or poem.  The  true\r\n\r\nnature  of  the poem came to light when, just  four\r\n\r\ndays  before the concert, the organisers  submitted\r\n\r\nto  the  school  principal  galley  proofs  of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  to be sold at the concert. The programme\r\n\r\nwas  almost wholly devoted to long comments on  the\r\n\r\nplay.  Thousands of copies of the programme  had \r\n\r\nbeen  printed for sale without the approval of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government's attention was drawn to the\r\n\r\nreal nature of this poetic drama and the programme,\r\n\r\nit  told the organisers that they could not perform\r\n\r\nthe drama or distribute the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  were  told that if they had not deceived  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  by  providing a  completely  misleading\r\n\r\naccount  of  the  poem-drama, they  need  not  have\r\n\r\nincurred the expense and labour of rehearsing  this\r\n\r\nitem and printing the special programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the concert, that is, 27th\r\n\r\nDecember, the organisers announced to the assembled\r\n\r\naudience  that  because  of Government  action  the\r\n\r\nannounced play could not be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some undesirable and irresponsible elements\r\n\r\nexploited  the  situation by  suggesting  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  been  unreasonable,  that  it  was\r\n\r\nstifling  the  free  development  of  culture   and\r\n\r\nrepressing creative expression by local artists. So\r\n\r\nhundreds of people present at the concert left with\r\n\r\nthe impression that the Government had unreasonably\r\n\r\nrepressed progressive Chinese culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider what would have been the effect\r\n\r\non our relations with the Federation Government and\r\n\r\non all right-thinking people had poems of this sort\r\n\r\nadvocating  revolutionary violence and  hatred  and\r\n\r\npraising  the  violence  of the  Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty   been  allowed  to  be  performed  for   the\r\n\r\nedification  of  school  children  and  a   Chinese\r\n\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what would have been the effect on our Malay\r\n\r\nbrothers  who fear Communism and who are from  time\r\n\r\nto time told by Malay communalists that Chinese are\r\n\r\nworking for the victory of Chinese Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, though the poem was ostensibly\r\n\r\nrevolutionary in intent, its presentation was  such\r\n\r\nas   to   excite   racial  animosity   among   less\r\n\r\nsophisticated  people. The  woman  tapper  who  was\r\n\r\nkilled  was a Chinese. A large majority of  members\r\n\r\nof the Security Forces are Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this poem and poems of a similar\r\n\r\nnature  would  have been, wittingly or unwittingly,\r\n\r\nto gradually bring the two major races to the brink\r\n\r\nof racial conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know who were the reckless adventurers\r\n\r\nwho   prevailed   upon  these   misguided   student\r\n\r\norganisers to stage this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninflammatory  play.  What  would  have   been   the\r\n\r\nconsequences  had  these adventurers  succeeded  in\r\n\r\ngetting  this play performed at Badminton  Hall  on\r\n\r\nthe night of 27th December?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result would have been that on 27th December\r\n\r\nthe  feelings  of hundreds of unsuspecting  Chinese\r\n\r\nwould  have  been worked up at the  Badminton  Hall\r\n\r\neven  as on the same night racialists toured  Malay\r\n\r\nareas trying to work up fear and hatred against the\r\n\r\nChinese.  One group would have worked  up  sympathy\r\n\r\nfor  violence and hatred in the name of revolution,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  other  would  have  worked  up  similar\r\n\r\nemotions in the name of racialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each by different routes would have reached the\r\n\r\nsame  goal - that is, racial conflict. This  must  be\r\n\r\nthe  inevitable  outcome  in  Malaya  of  political\r\n\r\naction  based  on  glorification  of  violence  and\r\n\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has repeatedly warned that in a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society all efforts to direct politics\r\n\r\non  the  basis of revolutionary violence and hatred\r\n\r\nmust eventually lead to racial conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, this poem repeats the clarion call\r\n\r\nmade  by the plotters of A.R.T.I.S. Let me  repeat\r\n\r\nthe  message  of A.R.T.I.S. to contrast  with  the\r\n\r\nmessage  put  forward by the poem.

To allow  ourselves  to  come\r\n\r\nunder  the  influence of either of the two  lunatic\r\n\r\ngroups is to open wide the gates to the horrors  of\r\n\r\nracial civil war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events I have described earlier should remind\r\n\r\nall right-thinking citizens of how easy it is for a\r\n\r\nhandful of irresponsible men to bring this city  to\r\n\r\nthe  brink  of  racial tension  just  by  spreading\r\n\r\nunfounded rumours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs but a spark to set off the explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our advice is: Do not listen to rumours which\r\n\r\nspeak of impending racial conflicts. They are false\r\n\r\nrumours  started by irresponsible elements  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  care  about the welfare of any race. All  that\r\n\r\nthese  dangerous  men hope for is  to  make  a  few\r\n\r\ndollars or advance their personal glory out of  the\r\n\r\nslaughter of innocent people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By repeating such rumours people would only be\r\n\r\nplaying  into the hands of irresponsible  elements.\r\n\r\nPeople  would be unwittingly helping to create  the\r\n\r\natmosphere   of  tension  and  fear   which   these\r\n\r\ndangerous men want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people hear such rumours of racial clashes or\r\n\r\nstories  calculated to foment hatred between  races\r\n\r\nthey should not pass them on. They should tell  the\r\n\r\npolice  about it, or their Assemblymen or community\r\n\r\nleaders, so that action can be taken in time to nip\r\n\r\nin the bud such dangerous plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most of all, let us remember that we live in\r\n\r\na  mixed  community where old suspicions and  fears\r\n\r\nhave  not  been completely eradicated. As  long  as\r\n\r\nthis is the case, the danger of communalism exists.\r\n\r\nIt   is   like  a  wild  and  hungry  beast  pacing\r\n\r\nimpatiently behind the bars of a cage. We who  bear\r\n\r\nno hatred against races and creeds intend that this\r\n\r\nwild  beast  remains locked in  its  cage  so  that\r\n\r\neventually it will waste away and die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if any lunatic tries to unlock the cage and\r\n\r\nlet  the  beast  loose, then  we  should  stop  the\r\n\r\nlunatic before he gets anywhere near the cage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of racial peace, Sir, is eternal\r\n\r\nvigilance - vigilance against the lunatics who  think\r\n\r\nthey   can   make  use  of  this  wild   beast   of\r\n\r\ncommunalism. The truth is that it will destroy  the\r\n\r\nlunatic as well as the innocent people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, therefore, never allow ourselves to be\r\n\r\nfooled  by the lunatics out to let loose  the  wild\r\n\r\nbeast of racialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our hopes of a happy and prosperous Malaya\r\n\r\ndepend   upon  our  being  able  to  preserve   the\r\n\r\nharmonious relations that have existed between  the\r\n\r\nraces  for  generations. If that  peace  should  be\r\n\r\nshattered,  wittingly  or  unwittingly,  then  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  the beginning of decades of  horror  and\r\n\r\ncarnage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this Government has never ceased to\r\n\r\nreiterate   the  urgency  of  creating  a   Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalism  and  outlook at the earliest  possible\r\n\r\nmoment. Without this sense of Malayan identity, our\r\n\r\nmany  races  remain  exposed at  any  time  to  the\r\n\r\nblandishments of reckless racialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a sense of responsibility and fear of the\r\n\r\nterrible  consequences  of  racial  conflict   have\r\n\r\ninhibited  the vast majority of people from  saying\r\n\r\nor  doing  anything calculated to spark off  racial\r\n\r\nconflagration, we would like to warn the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  against a minority of reckless  lunatics\r\n\r\nwho  want  to  see a clash between  the  races,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, the Malays and Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we want to tell the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  about  the activities of  this  reckless\r\n\r\nminority so that they may be on guard against these\r\n\r\ndangerous and despicable men and not be taken in by\r\n\r\ntheir lies and deceit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of us, because we are by nature\r\n\r\npeaceful  and  law-abiding, may refuse  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat   anything   could  happen  to   disrupt   the\r\n\r\nharmonious   relations  which  have   existed   for\r\n\r\ngenerations  between  the  various  races.  But  as\r\n\r\nrecent  events  have shown, it is  possible  for  a\r\n\r\nhandful of evil and reckless adventurers to create,\r\n\r\nalmost overnight, an atmosphere of fear and anxiety\r\n\r\nwhich could lead to racial carnage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Statement by the Minister for Home Affairs</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the statement by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture should be a reminder to us all\r\n\r\nof the delicate nature of the communal problem. For\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  trying  to  solve  the  communal\r\n\r\nproblem, is like walking on a knife's edge. In  its\r\n\r\nefforts  to  develop a Malayan outlook and  Malayan\r\n\r\nloyalty,  it has to meet the subtle and underground\r\n\r\npropaganda  of the Chinese chauvinist,  the  Indian\r\n\r\ncommunalist and the Malay racialist. If it tries to\r\n\r\nassist  the Malays, the Chinese chauvinist  depicts\r\n\r\nsuch  action  as  pro-Malay and  anti-Chinese.  Any\r\n\r\naction  to help the Chinese is presented by  Malay\r\n\r\nracialists as pro-Chinese and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Government is not pro-Chinese, pro-Malay\r\n\r\nor pro any particular race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is first and last pro-Malayan.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a pro-Malayan policy, as it becomes more effective, will\r\n\r\nmeet  with  the  hostility of all communalists  who\r\n\r\nhave  a political vested interest in racialism.  In\r\n\r\nan effort to combat the growth of a Malayan outlook\r\n\r\nthe communalists may, with increasing recklessness,\r\n\r\ntry to fan the flames of racialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to deal with such elements.

By\r\n\r\nproviding   these   necessary   preconditions    of\r\n\r\ncertainty  and  stability,  a  more  intensive  and\r\n\r\nscientific  cultivation of agricultural  land  will\r\n\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill creates statutory rights of an\r\n\r\nexceptional character and directly interferes  with\r\n\r\nthe   ordinary  rights  of  private  ownership   of\r\n\r\nproperty  by  giving special treatment to  farmers.\r\n\r\nHowever, such inroads into the original concept  of\r\n\r\nthe  sanctity of private ownership of property  are\r\n\r\ninevitable  in  our  society.  The  State  has   to\r\n\r\nreconcile - in  this  particular  case - the  competing\r\n\r\nneeds   of  different  sections  of  the  community\r\n\r\nbetween  farmers  and landowners, and  between  the\r\n\r\ncompeting  demands for growing foodstuffs,  or  for\r\n\r\nindustrial, housing and other purposes in the  uses\r\n\r\nof  land.  It is our intention to refer  both  this\r\n\r\nBill   and  the  complementary  Control   of   Rent\r\n\r\n(Amendment  No. 3) Bill to a Select  Committee  for\r\n\r\ncareful   study,   and   to  enable   the   people,\r\n\r\nparticularly   landlords  and   farmers   who   are\r\n\r\naffected, an opportunity to make representations on\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With land to meet our requirements strictly\r\n\r\nlimited, it is essential that all available land be\r\n\r\nput  to the most economic use. The Master Plan  has\r\n\r\nset  aside approximately 18.5 per cent of the total\r\n\r\narea  of  the  Island for agricultural purposes.  A\r\n\r\ntotal  area of approximately 38.8 square miles  out\r\n\r\nof  a total of 209.5 square miles (not counting the\r\n\r\nareas  subject  to tidal waters) is  zoned  off  as\r\n\r\n\"agricultural\" in the Master Plan. The 1958 Revised\r\n\r\nLand  Use  Survey showed that out of this  area  of\r\n\r\n38.8  square miles, approximately only half  (about\r\n\r\n19.4  square miles) was being used for agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt  is  clear therefore that not all the lands  set\r\n\r\naside  for  agriculture have been put to  full  and\r\n\r\nintensive use. Encouragement and assistance by  way\r\n\r\nof granting security of tenure as well as by active\r\n\r\nassistance by the Primary Production Department  in\r\n\r\ntechnical  and  scientific advice can  improve  the\r\n\r\nposition of our farmers and increase the supply  of\r\n\r\npigs,  poultry and vegetables for the people  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two Bills, the Control of Rent (Amendment\r\n\r\nNo.  3)  Bill, which I shall be moving  after  this\r\n\r\nBill,  together  with  this  one,  will  provide  a\r\n\r\npositive  protection for farmers which was  lacking\r\n\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Agricultural\r\n\r\nLeases   Bill  is  a  logical  follow-up   to   the\r\n\r\nintentions  of  the Master Plan,  as  it  seeks  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  farmers within the agricultural  zone\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  security  of  tenure  to  encourage\r\n\r\nefficient farming. Farmers will now be eligible for\r\n\r\nleases up to 12 years and can go ahead and plan for\r\n\r\nfarming improvements, secure in the knowledge  that\r\n\r\nthey  have complete security for the period of  the\r\n\r\nleases,   provided   they   fulfil   their   normal\r\n\r\nobligations as lessees. The landlord, on the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  will  be  able to obtain  an  economic  rent\r\n\r\nsubject to a maximum over the present rents for the\r\n\r\nlease  which  he will be required to grant  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will benefit farmers primarily within\r\n\r\nthe  areas  zoned as \"agricultural\" in  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan.

It will thereby be possible  to\r\n\r\nextend  the  benefits of long leases to farmers  in\r\n\r\nthose areas of good agricultural land which are not\r\n\r\nat  present  zoned as \"agricultural\" in the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  for  there  are pockets of good  agricultural\r\n\r\nland,  for  example, in the Potong  Pasir  and  the\r\n\r\nBraddell  Road  farms at present  zoned  as  \"green\r\n\r\nbelt\" areas in the Master Plan. We are prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider  designating such lands as  \"agricultural\"\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the definitions of \"farmers\" and \"tenancy\",\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of leases will also be  extended  to\r\n\r\nbona fide farmers who have been occupying and using\r\n\r\nagricultural  land for a period of  not  less  than\r\n\r\nfour  years  immediately preceding the coming  into\r\n\r\noperation  of  the Bill, provided such  farmer  has\r\n\r\ntendered  to  the landlord rent in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nland,  whether or not such tender has been accepted\r\n\r\nby  the  landlord.  This is a  departure  from  the\r\n\r\nnormal theory of freedom of contract and the  House\r\n\r\nwill  appreciate  that it is a necessary  departure\r\n\r\naimed at achieving certain economic objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for a lease of not\r\n\r\nmore  than  12  years to be granted to  the  tenant\r\n\r\nfarmer  at  his request at an economic rent  to  be\r\n\r\nagreed  between  the tenant and the  landlord.  The\r\n\r\nlease would make provision for all the matters  set\r\n\r\nout  in  the Schedule to the Bill. If no  agreement\r\n\r\ncan  be reached between the landlord and the tenant\r\n\r\non the terms of the lease, the tenant may refer the\r\n\r\nmatter for arbitration under the Bill. Sir, we have\r\n\r\nput  the figure at 12 years. It may well be,  after\r\n\r\nhearing  representations from all parties concerned\r\n\r\nin  the Select Committee, that the number of  years\r\n\r\nmay  be increased to 15, or even slightly more. But\r\n\r\nwe  have  to weigh the competing interests  between\r\n\r\nthe  present and future user. If, for instance,  we\r\n\r\nwere  to tie up the land to a hypothetical 30 years\r\n\r\nof  agricultural use and a lease is granted, it may\r\n\r\nwell  be  that  long  before  the  30  years,   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of industry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the island would have so progressed as to  make\r\n\r\nit uneconomic for the land to be allowed to be used\r\n\r\nas  a poultry farm. Therefore, we have to weigh the\r\n\r\nbalance  between,  on  the one  hand,  the  present\r\n\r\ncertainty  for  as  long as it can  conceivably  be\r\n\r\nplanned and, on the other hand, without necessarily\r\n\r\ntying  up  the future to a point where we may  have\r\n\r\ncause to regret our having mortgaged the future  so\r\n\r\nfar in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 provides for a restriction on\r\n\r\nletting  or  leasing of agricultural  land  to  any\r\n\r\nperson for other than agricultural purposes without\r\n\r\nthe  express written permission of the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof Lands. This is an important limitation. Also, in\r\n\r\nfurther  pursuance of the objectives of the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan, it achieves two targets. First, a farmer  can\r\n\r\nonly  transfer the lease to another farmer. Second,\r\n\r\na landlord who has land in an agricultural zone and\r\n\r\nwho   is   paying   assessment  on   it   has   two\r\n\r\nalternatives:  either to develop  the  land  as  an\r\n\r\nagricultural piece of land for farming  within  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  the  Bill, or to  let  it  out  for\r\n\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made in clause 7 for a Panel of\r\n\r\nArbitrators  from  which  an  Arbitrator  would  be\r\n\r\nnominated  to deal with a particular  case.  It  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged  that the Arbitrator will be assisted  by\r\n\r\nofficials from a section to be set up in  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  to  administer  the  two  Ordinances.   The\r\n\r\nArbitrator will, after hearing both parties, decide\r\n\r\non the terms of the lease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I did mention during the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Control of Rent (Amendment  No.  2)\r\n\r\nBill  that  the  original intention of  putting  it\r\n\r\nbefore  the Rent Conciliation Board was then  being\r\n\r\nconsidered  and it was thought unwieldy because  it\r\n\r\nwould,  in  the initial phase, completely  inundate\r\n\r\nthe  Rent  Conciliation Board as  it  had  not  the\r\n\r\nmachinery that would be adequate to deal  with  and\r\n\r\nadjudicate between parties in this sort of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill provide an informal\r\n\r\nprocedure for arbitration under the Bill. Clause 11\r\n\r\nprovides  for  rules to be made to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\npurposes of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 expressly provides that the Bill shall\r\n\r\nnot  apply  to the Crown and safeguards the  rights\r\n\r\nand  powers of the State under the Land Acquisition\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  This  is a necessary  proviso  because.\r\n\r\neven  in  the  agricultural  zone,  land  shall  be\r\n\r\nrequired  for schools, clinics, parks, installation\r\n\r\nof electricity units, community centres, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt  also provides that the provisions of Parts  III\r\n\r\nand  IIIA  of  the Control of Rent  Ordinance  will\r\n\r\napply  to agricultural land comprised in any  lease\r\n\r\nexecuted under the provisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the government machinery of\r\n\r\na  country  is  in the hands of those  who  protect\r\n\r\ncapitalism, they always think of ways and means  to\r\n\r\npass  legislation beneficial to the rich. When they\r\n\r\nare  affected  by  the  tide  of  anti-exploitation\r\n\r\nrevolution  started by the progressive  countries,\r\n\r\nthey will pretentiously pass legislation for the\r\n\r\nso-called  protection of labour and welfare  in  which\r\n\r\nthere  are many defects. This is just to bluff  the\r\n\r\npeople   in  another  form.  They  never  put   the\r\n\r\nlegislation into practice, but they just bluff  the\r\n\r\npeople. In the past, although the various strata of\r\n\r\nour  people  were  under  the  protection  of  some\r\n\r\nlegislation,  only the farmers had  no  protection.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the farmers were doubly  oppressed  and\r\n\r\nwere left to prosper or die by themselves. Often in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  they  were  oppressed  by  the  immoral\r\n\r\nlandlords  on  the  pretext  that  they  wanted  to\r\n\r\nbeautify  this  city. Our existing legislation  was\r\n\r\npassed  in  days  gone  by. Therefore,  the  Judges\r\n\r\nusually  granted the applications of landlords  for\r\n\r\nthe possession of land, thus affecting the farmers.\r\n\r\nBut  since  the P.A.P. Government took  office,  we\r\n\r\nhave  passed  temporary legislation to protect  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the farmers. At the moment, there  are\r\n\r\nstill some unscrupulous landlords who want to  make\r\n\r\nuse of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloopholes in the law to intimidate the farmers  and\r\n\r\nto  destroy  their  agricultural land  and  houses.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I must warn those unscrupulous landlords\r\n\r\nthat if they still want to make use of mean tactics\r\n\r\nto disturb the peace of our country, our Government\r\n\r\nwill take legal measures to deal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our agriculture here is quite\r\n\r\ndeveloped when compared with that of other areas in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia.  Our  agricultural  products  are\r\n\r\nbeing  sold to the Federation of Malaya  and  other\r\n\r\nplaces. Therefore, the farmers have a place in  the\r\n\r\neconomic  position of our society. Before  it  took\r\n\r\noffice, the P.A.P. laid great stress on agriculture\r\n\r\nand  they  made  promises in this respect  to  pass\r\n\r\nlegislation  to protect the farmers in  order  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  live  in security and peace  to  develop\r\n\r\ntheir  agriculture  to the best of  their  ability.\r\n\r\nTherefore, after this Bill was read the First time,\r\n\r\nall   the  rural  people  and  organisations   have\r\n\r\nexpressed  their support for it. They welcome  this\r\n\r\nBill  because  it specifically provides  for  their\r\n\r\nprotection  and tenure of lease so that  they  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  have  security  in  earning  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood through agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land available for agriculture in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  limited,  apart  from  the  agricultural  lands\r\n\r\ndesignated  in  the  Singapore  Master  Plan.  Some\r\n\r\npeople  might misunderstand the provisions of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  They  might think that whenever there  is  a\r\n\r\ndispute,   the   law   will   provide   for   some\r\n\r\nunfavourable   measures   detrimental   to    their\r\n\r\ninterest.  This  depends  on  what  the  Government\r\n\r\nattitude  is. If the Government is for the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  capitalists, then, of course, the  farmers\r\n\r\nwill  be affected. The Bills passed by the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  on labour and so on, did not  have  any\r\n\r\npractical   effect.   But  the  P.A.P.   Government\r\n\r\nrepresent  the people and we are working  in  their\r\n\r\ninterest.  Therefore, the Agricultural Leases  Bill\r\n\r\nis  a manifestation of our policy and this Bill can\r\n\r\nbe  said  to  be  for the good of the  farmers,  to\r\n\r\nprotect them and to give hem security of tenure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, this House feel it an honour  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  today  the Agricultural Leases  Bill.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore can now see that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is fulfilling its election promises.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that hon. Members here and all the  people\r\n\r\noutside  the House will strongly support this  Bill\r\n\r\nand will feel glad about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past legislation detrimental to the people has\r\n\r\nbeen and will be swept out by new legislation. This\r\n\r\nachievement  must  be attributed  to  the  people's\r\n\r\nGovernment  because the people have entrusted  this\r\n\r\nduty  to  the P.A.P. Government, and the Government\r\n\r\nhave peacefully carried out their task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned  what  the  P.A.P. promised  the  people\r\n\r\nduring  the  elections. Under the Master  Plan,  in\r\n\r\nregard to those areas where farmers live which  are\r\n\r\nnot   designated   under  the  Master   Plan,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will take proper steps to declare  those\r\n\r\nareas  as  agricultural lands so as to  enable  the\r\n\r\nfarmers living there to have the protection of  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  We fully understand that up to now the arable\r\n\r\nlands  which  are  available  for  agriculture  are\r\n\r\nlimited. The Government have the duty to take  care\r\n\r\nof those valuable lands and put them to better use.\r\n\r\nThose lands classified as good for the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  country  and  for specific uses  will  not  be\r\n\r\ndeclared  agricultural lands,  unless  construction\r\n\r\nthereon  is  beneficial to the people as  a  whole,\r\n\r\nsuch as building hospitals schools, markets, and so\r\n\r\non. Otherwise, these lands will not be acquired  to\r\n\r\nthe detriment of the farmers. Some people may think\r\n\r\nthat  the  word \"agriculture\" means only \r\n\r\nvegetable-growing.  It is clearly provided in the  Bill  that\r\n\r\nthe   word   \"agriculture\"  includes  horticulture,\r\n\r\nfloriculture,  rubber, coconut and fruit  planting,\r\n\r\ndairy  farming, livestock and poultry breeding  and\r\n\r\nrearing, market and nursery gardening, the  use  of\r\n\r\nland as fish-ponds and prawn-ponds, and the use  of\r\n\r\nland  for  other purposes of agriculture. The  Bill\r\n\r\nwill protect the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  users of agricultural land. This  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  Without these strict  provisions,  this\r\n\r\nBill will lose its original intent and purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many industries\r\n\r\nuseful to farmers. They were taken to task by  some\r\n\r\nlandlords in past legislation. For instance,  after\r\n\r\nthe farmers had cultivated the land for a time, the\r\n\r\nlandlord  would make use of the old  law  to  drive\r\n\r\nthem  out.  Some  farmers had  just  started  their\r\n\r\nagricultural  work and some landlords thought  that\r\n\r\nthey  had  some bad habits and they tried to  drive\r\n\r\nthem out and rob them of their cultivated land  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  use. Therefore, in the past the  people\r\n\r\nwere   in   fear  when  they  carried   out   their\r\n\r\nagricultural work because the landlords  wanted  to\r\n\r\ntake back their land unreasonably. The present Bill\r\n\r\nwill rectify the defects in the old law and try  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  farmers in this  respect.  Our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  just  now clearly explained  certain\r\n\r\naspects of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognise that statutory tenure of\r\n\r\nlease  is  very important to enable the  people  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their agricultural plans without  fear.\r\n\r\nClause  3  of the Bill provides that the period  of\r\n\r\nlease for agricultural land will be up to a maximum\r\n\r\nof  12  years. At the same time, both the  landlord\r\n\r\nand the tenants will agree on an economic rent.  If\r\n\r\nboth sides could not agree to that, then the tenant\r\n\r\ncan  ask  that the issue be put up to an arbitrator\r\n\r\nto consider. The Bill also provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) two hundred per centum of the annual rent\r\n\r\nthereof  paid during the year 1960, in respect\r\n\r\nof the first five years;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) fifty per centum of the annual rent thereof\r\n\r\npaid  during the first five years, in  respect\r\n\r\nof the second five years; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) fifty per centum of the annual rent thereof\r\n\r\npaid  during the second five years, in respect\r\n\r\nof the remaining two years.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  are  the rentals provided in the  Bill.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, if a farmer in 1960\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npays a rental of $24, then when the Bill comes into\r\n\r\neffect, the rental for the first five years  should\r\n\r\nnot  be over $48, and during the second five years,\r\n\r\nthe  rent  should not exceed $72, and for the  last\r\n\r\ntwo years, it should not exceed $108.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we think that the maximum of\r\n\r\nthe   rent  payable  is  necessary.  Without   this\r\n\r\nprovision, the landlords will increase the rent and\r\n\r\nthe  tenants will not be able to bear this.  As  to\r\n\r\nthe rent to be paid by the tenant, it is to be that\r\n\r\nagreed  between him and the landlord at an economic\r\n\r\nrate.   The   arbitrator  will   also   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the relevant facts to  consider  the\r\n\r\nproper  rent  to be fixed. We believe that  through\r\n\r\nnegotiations,   the   result   achieved   will   be\r\n\r\nbeneficial  to both sides. The Government  believes\r\n\r\nthat  both sides can co-operate and understand  the\r\n\r\npurpose of Government's intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that clause 3 (4) of\r\n\r\nthis Bill will not be made use of in future. But if\r\n\r\nsome   landlords   despise  the  meaning   of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Bill, then the Government  will\r\n\r\nhave  no  alternative but to use this provision  to\r\n\r\ndeal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government fully\r\n\r\nunderstands that in order to improve the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the farmers, the matter does not depend only on\r\n\r\none  side.  It does not depend on this Agricultural\r\n\r\nLeases  Bill  alone. It must also depend  on  other\r\n\r\nbases  which will help to bring about improvements,\r\n\r\nnamely, the Primary Production Division and others.\r\n\r\nThey   have  to  pay  careful  attention  to  these\r\n\r\nproblems.  We  believe  that Government  will  take\r\n\r\nimmediate necessary steps to protect the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the  farmers. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker as Chairman and seven other Members  to  be\r\n\r\nnominated  by  the  Committee of  Selection.  -[The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONTROL OF RENT (AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  recommnedation  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with this Bill, and I beg to  move,  \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Rent Ordinance was originally\r\n\r\ndesigned  to impose controls on landlords in  order\r\n\r\nto  prevent the full effect of a shortage  of  land\r\n\r\nand  housing arising from the last war from falling\r\n\r\ncompletely   on  the  shoulders  of  tenants.   The\r\n\r\nOrdinance imposed restrictions on increases of rent\r\n\r\nthat  could be charged for premises and  also  gave\r\n\r\nthe tenants protection from eviction. From time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  the  Ordinance has been amended, and  as  it\r\n\r\nstood  in 1959, the Ordinance enabled an order  for\r\n\r\nthe  recovery of possession of any premises  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven   inter  alia  in  cases  falling  with   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of paragraphs (i) and (k) of section  15\r\n\r\n(1)  of the Ordinance. They enumerated two sets  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances. First, where the premises  consisted\r\n\r\nof a building or buildings of a temporary character\r\n\r\nand  the  site is required by the landlord for  the\r\n\r\nerection  of a building or buildings of a permanent\r\n\r\ncharacter;  and  the second set  of  circumstances,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  landlord  of any  premises  intends  to\r\n\r\ndemolish the same for the purpose of rebuilding  on\r\n\r\nthe  site,  and  the Court is satisfied  that  such\r\n\r\ndemolition is necessary in the interests of  public\r\n\r\nhealth  or town improvement. Sir, until this  Bill,\r\n\r\nfortunes  have been made at the Bar in arguing  the\r\n\r\nintricacies on the meaning of \"town improvement and\r\n\r\npublic  health\", and many a landlord has been  able\r\n\r\nto reacquire possession of his land. But I think it\r\n\r\nweighs  heavily  on  the  conscience  of  many   an\r\n\r\nadvocate  acting  on behalf of landlords  that  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of paragraphs (i) and (k) of section  15\r\n\r\n(1)  of the Control of Rent Ordinance have operated\r\n\r\nharshly  against tenants, who have suffered  to  be\r\n\r\nremoved without compensation in the interests of an\r\n\r\nabstract  ideal  embraced  in  the  phrase  \"public\r\n\r\nhealth and town improvement\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Ordinance as it stood did not give\r\n\r\nprotection,  where  land was being  cultivated  but\r\n\r\nwhere  no buildings which can constitute \"premises\"\r\n\r\nas  defined in the Ordinance existed on the plot of\r\n\r\nland.  This  worked adversely against farmers  who,\r\n\r\nthough in occupation of and in cultivation of land,\r\n\r\nnevertheless  were not protected by  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nbecause  they  did  not have  their  homes  on  the\r\n\r\nholdings they cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to redress the position. Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  inevitable that development which is beneficial\r\n\r\nto  the  community as a whole must proceed. But  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, a balance has to be struck  between\r\n\r\nthis  and the other important aspect, that  of  the\r\n\r\noccupiers who are usually economically in the lower\r\n\r\nincome brackets. This amending Bill seeks in a fair\r\n\r\nand  equitable manner to maintain the  balance,  on\r\n\r\nthe one hand, development of land by owners of land\r\n\r\nand, on the other, the interests of the tenants who\r\n\r\nhave  to  be sacrificed by being evicted  from  the\r\n\r\nland in order that the land can be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill extends the protection of the\r\n\r\nControl  of  Rent  Ordinance to  agricultural  land\r\n\r\nwhich  includes  houses and other  buildings  built\r\n\r\nthereon,  whether before or after the  7th  day  of\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1947. The rent of agricultural land will\r\n\r\nthen   be  subject  to  the  control  of  the  Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in Part IIIA provides that no order or\r\n\r\njudgment  for  the  recovery of possession  of  any\r\n\r\nagricultural land or of any premises comprised in a\r\n\r\ntenancy shall be made or given under section 15 (1)\r\n\r\n(i)  or  (k)  unless the landlord has obtained  the\r\n\r\nprior written consent of the Commissioner of Lands.\r\n\r\nThe  Commissioner of Lands may require the landlord\r\n\r\nto  satisfy him that the development proposed is in\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of town and country  planning,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the eviction is therefore desirable.  He  may\r\n\r\nalso require the landlord to deposit with him a sum\r\n\r\nof money recommended by the Panel of Assessors as a\r\n\r\nfair  compensation to the tenant. If  an  Order  of\r\n\r\nCourt for recovery of possession is made, this  sum\r\n\r\nwill  be  paid over to the tenant. If no  Order  is\r\n\r\nmade, the sum will be refunded to the landlord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this proviso requiring the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the Commissioner of Lands  before  any\r\n\r\naction  can  proceed for the recovery of possession\r\n\r\nof agricultural land is complementary to the clause\r\n\r\nin  the sister Bill, which prevents the transfer of\r\n\r\nagricultural land from one person to another person\r\n\r\nother  than  for  the  same agricultural  purposes.\r\n\r\nWhere  land  which  is being used for  agricultural\r\n\r\npurposes  is sought to be recovered to be developed\r\n\r\nother  than  for  agricultural purposes,  then  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  must first be satisfied  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimperative in the interest of public health or town\r\n\r\nimprovement  or town planning. In this  way,  added\r\n\r\nprotection is given to tenants who are not desirous\r\n\r\nof  obtaining  long  leases  for  various  reasons,\r\n\r\neither because they do not wish to be burdened with\r\n\r\na   long  lease,  or  because  they  may  fear  the\r\n\r\nadjustment  in  rent which is allowable  under  the\r\n\r\nAgricultural   Leases  Bill  to  approximate   more\r\n\r\nclosely an economic rent if a long lease is  sought\r\n\r\nfor.  This impediment in the power of any  landlord\r\n\r\nin  recovering  possession of his land  gives  some\r\n\r\nmeasure of protection to the month-to-month  tenant\r\n\r\nfarmer who may wish to continue as a month-to-month\r\n\r\ntenant  farmer  rather than acquire  a  twelve-year\r\n\r\nlease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all farmers or other tenants (including, in\r\n\r\nthis case, any person who has occupied and used any\r\n\r\npremises  whether built after 7th September,  1947,\r\n\r\nor  not  for a period of not less than three  years\r\n\r\nprior to 1st January, 1961) will now be able to get\r\n\r\ncompensation  if required to move in the  interests\r\n\r\nof  town planning and public health. This is a move\r\n\r\nmade  to  make recovery of possession  of  land  by\r\n\r\nprivate  owners  more approximate to  what  happens\r\n\r\nwhen the Government recovers Crown property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 26B [clause 5] of the Bill provides for\r\n\r\nthe  manner  of  the  appointment  of  a  Panel  of\r\n\r\nAssessors and section 26c for rules to be  made  to\r\n\r\ngive  effect to the provisions of this part of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.

Those  squatters  who  are  outside  the\r\n\r\nagricultural  zone,  or such areas  which  will  be\r\n\r\ndesignated as agricultural zone, will not have  the\r\n\r\nsame   privileges  as  tenant  farmers   like   the\r\n\r\nsquatters you have in the city area. They will have\r\n\r\nto  go,  in the first instance. New buildings  will\r\n\r\nhave  to go up in the congested areas of the  town.\r\n\r\nBut in asking them to go, private landlords will be\r\n\r\nasked  to  observe the minimum standards which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself offers to all squatters  who  are\r\n\r\nasked  to move from Crown land. Here again, instead\r\n\r\nof  referring  the matter to the Rent  Conciliation\r\n\r\nBoard,  we  have  decided to  set  up  a  Panel  of\r\n\r\nAssessors   in  the  hope  that  thereby   a   more\r\n\r\nexpeditious   method   of  assessing   compensation\r\n\r\npayable would be devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our intention to refer this Bill also\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee for proper scrutiny of  its\r\n\r\nprovisions  and  its  effect and  side  effects  on\r\n\r\nexisting interests, either on the landlord  or  the\r\n\r\ntenant or the squatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  if this Bill is restricted  to  the\r\n\r\ncity  area,  I  will not oppose it. But  this  Bill\r\n\r\nconcerns the whole rural area. In respect  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  I  wish  to  request the Government  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention  and  give due and careful consideration.\r\n\r\nOutwardly  looking, it is the Government which  has\r\n\r\nextended its facilities and establishments  to  the\r\n\r\nrural areas. In fact, it is not so. If we carefully\r\n\r\nstudy  the  consequences of this Bill,  it  is  not\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  us to see that this Bill  possesses\r\n\r\nmany  harmful effects which will injure the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  And the people  who  will  really\r\n\r\nreceive  the  blessings will be the  landlord.  The\r\n\r\nNanyang  Siang Pau published the contents  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  on  22nd December. For example, the landlord,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Control of Rent Bill, if  he  wants  to\r\n\r\napply for getting back any agricultural land or any\r\n\r\nhouse,   should   get   the   permission   of   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Lands beforehand. The Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Lands,  however, has absolute  power  over  the\r\n\r\nrequest  of the landlord. Before he agrees  to  the\r\n\r\nrequest  of  the landlord, the latter must  observe\r\n\r\nthe following. First, regarding the asking back  of\r\n\r\nthe agricultural land, the landlord must prove that\r\n\r\nit  is for the sake of the development of the city,\r\n\r\nor for construction plans. Taking all these matters\r\n\r\ninto  consideration, if approval cannot  be  given,\r\n\r\nthe  landlord  will suffer a great loss.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  landlord will be instructed to pay a  deposit.\r\n\r\nThe   amount  according  to  the  opinion  of   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Lands is meant for the compensation\r\n\r\nof  the  tenants, for the Court may have instructed\r\n\r\nthe  landlord to get back his agricultural land  or\r\n\r\nhouse.  We all know that under the Singapore Master\r\n\r\nPlan,  many  rural  areas  are  listed  as  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment   areas.  These   areas   are   densely\r\n\r\npopulated by attap-hut squatters who have lived  in\r\n\r\nthese  places  and obtained their food  from  these\r\n\r\nplaces for tens of years. Although their lives  are\r\n\r\nhard, they are happy for they commit themselves  to\r\n\r\nheaven. Although in some places the villagers  have\r\n\r\nbeen oppressed by the landlords, yet they have  \r\n\r\nco-operated  and formed their united organisations  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate with the landlords. In most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases, the danger has been averted and now there is\r\n\r\npeace.

But I have  not\r\n\r\nnoticed  anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMember can carry on. Please continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nnow  the landlords are backed by the Government and\r\n\r\nprotected  by  the law. It is believed  that  these\r\n\r\nlandlords  will  take advantage of the  passing  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  to pursue their activities  on  a  wide\r\n\r\nscale.  If  only they can get the approval  of  the\r\n\r\nplanning section, after submitting their plans, and\r\n\r\npay  some  compensation to the tenants  which  will\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  Minister, they can  chase  out  these\r\n\r\nunfortunate  attap squatters. The  governing  party\r\n\r\nsympathizes  with  these  few  landlords  who  were\r\n\r\nunable  to  increase  their  wealth  in  time.  But\r\n\r\nthousands  of  villagers will become  homeless  and\r\n\r\nunemployed  as  a  result  of  the  loss  of  their\r\n\r\nagricultural  lands and houses. I wonder  why  this\r\n\r\nsituation   will   not  attract  the   Government's\r\n\r\nsympathy.  I really cannot understand why  the  \r\n\r\nso-called Government for the working masses will adopt\r\n\r\nthis sort of attitude and policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the compensation mentioned in this\r\n\r\nBill,  it  is not clearly stated. For example,  the\r\n\r\nBill  provides that the Minister will appoint three\r\n\r\nassessors.  When the Court approves the request  of\r\n\r\nthe   landlord,  they  have  to  suggest   to   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner   of   Lands   what   is    reasonable\r\n\r\ncompensation  for the tenant. But the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nis  not  bound by their consideration, findings  or\r\n\r\nsuggestions. After all, what is reasonable and what\r\n\r\nis unreasonable? I think there should be a standard\r\n\r\nand  a reasonable provision. Does it mean that  the\r\n\r\nfate  of  these  unfortunate squatters  has  to  be\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the authorities? According to the way\r\n\r\nof  compensation in the past, for  a  wooden  house\r\n\r\nwith concrete floor the compensation was one dollar\r\n\r\nper square foot; for the other type of earth floor,\r\n\r\nit  was eighty cents per square foot. Each of these\r\n\r\nattap  houses  mostly occupies  over  1,000  square\r\n\r\nfeet.   If  it  is  based  upon  the  standard   of\r\n\r\ncompensation in the past, then the most  they  will\r\n\r\nget is about $1,000 or a little more. Moreover, the\r\n\r\nsquatters   live   together  with  their   parents,\r\n\r\nbrothers   and   sisters.  How  can   this   little\r\n\r\ncompensation do anything for a family of more  than\r\n\r\nten  people? Even if they can rent an S.I.T. flat,\r\n\r\nhow long can they carry on paying rents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the passing of this Bill will\r\n\r\ngreatly  harm  the  attap squatters  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  what  I want to say now is very simple.  Just\r\n\r\nnow,  when  the Member for Punggol was  making  his\r\n\r\nspeech,   I  was  wondering  whether  he  was   not\r\n\r\nfollowing  the footsteps of the former  Member  for\r\n\r\nHong   Lim,   because  his  speech  was   full   of\r\n\r\ndistortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these two Bills clearly show\r\n\r\nthat  they will provide protection for the  farmers\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas.  But  from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol's  viewpoint,  the purposes  of  these  two\r\n\r\nBills  are  to  bring harm and suffering  to  those\r\n\r\noppressed people living in attap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuts in the rural areas. If he wants to pursue this\r\n\r\ncourse  of  distortion, then  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nsimply  refute it. But that is not good  enough.  I\r\n\r\nwill,  however,  do my best to explain  to  him  in\r\n\r\nsimple Mandarin the meaning contained in these  two\r\n\r\nBills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, when he was a P.A.P. candidate for the\r\n\r\nlast  election,  1\ufffd  years  ago,  the  Member   had\r\n\r\nproposed to the rural people our Five-Year Plan. If\r\n\r\nhe  had  not read or seen it for himself, he  could\r\n\r\nhave gathered it from the other Assemblymen that we\r\n\r\nhad  promised  certain things in our plan  for  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. The P.A.P. Government wants  to  help\r\n\r\nthe farmers in the rural areas by putting them in a\r\n\r\nsecure  position. They fully understand  that  many\r\n\r\nlandlords have made use of the laws prevailing then\r\n\r\nto drive out the tenants of the land. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nhave  thought  of a method to let  farmers  have  a\r\n\r\nsecure long-term lease. We hope these two Bills can\r\n\r\nput our farmers under very favourable conditions so\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be a chance for them  to  develop\r\n\r\nagriculture  for the good of the country.  How  can\r\n\r\nthey achieve this purpose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, all those landlords who have been\r\n\r\nunscrupulously making use of the laws to drive  out\r\n\r\ntheir tenants will be prohibited from doing so. The\r\n\r\nlandlord  must  first get approval  from  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice. He must let us see clearly why he wants  to\r\n\r\ndrive  out  the  tenants from  his  land.  If,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, a farmer does not like a long-term lease,\r\n\r\nhe  can  still carry on as usual, by paying monthly\r\n\r\nrents  for  the land and so on. This is  the  first\r\n\r\nmethod of protection provided by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method of protection is this. If a\r\n\r\ntenant  wishes to have a long-term lease, he  wants\r\n\r\nhis boss to give him 12 years' secure position.  If\r\n\r\nthe  boss does not agree to that, he will  have  to\r\n\r\nput up his case to the Land Office for a reasonable\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these two Bills are clearly for the protection\r\n\r\nof  the  rural farmers. But the Member for  Punggol\r\n\r\nsays  that they are bringing harm and suffering  to\r\n\r\nthe farmers and are oppressing them. I hope he will\r\n\r\nbring out his proof in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly  to show how these Bills will bring  about\r\n\r\nsuffering  and harm to the farmers.

It was wrong for the Government  to\r\n\r\ndeny the electorate of Hong Lim their voice in this\r\n\r\nAssembly. It is also wrong to use tactics to  delay\r\n\r\nthis  by-election, it is the inherentright  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Hong  Lim to decide  on  their  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative. The people of Hong Lim shall decide\r\n\r\nwhether  they want Ong Eng Guan or not.  No  others\r\n\r\nshould  decide. It is my belief that the people  of\r\n\r\nHong Lim will definitely fight against the acts  of\r\n\r\noppression   and  tyranny  against  their   elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative.  They  shall  also  decide  whether\r\n\r\ntheir  elected representative should be subject  to\r\n\r\nthird degree. They shall also cast their verdict on\r\n\r\nthis  Government. May I ask - would  there  be  more\r\n\r\nattempts  to  silence and smear Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nbefore the battle of Hong Lim begins? If there are,\r\n\r\nI can say that such attempts shall not succeed. The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore now know full well  the  true\r\n\r\nnature of this Government. The by-election for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  would  essentially be a  fight  waged  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Hong Lim against the oppressive policies\r\n\r\nand  the  acts  of  tyranny and arrogance  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You are not from Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> In this fight in Hong Lim, the odds\r\n\r\nwill  be  against Mr Ong Eng Guan.

One of them\r\n\r\nis  that  the  Government is  not  prepared  to  be\r\n\r\ndefeated in Hong Lim, as it was not prepared to  be\r\n\r\ndefeated  in  Tanjong Pagar.

Let us  ask  first  the\r\n\r\nquestion: why did Mr Ong Eng Guan resign from  the\r\n\r\nseat for Hong Lim? Has the Member for Aljunied made\r\n\r\nany  attempt to answer that question? Did  he  say,\r\n\r\n\"Mr Ong Eng Guan resigned because he needed a  new\r\n\r\nmandate  from the people.\"? Or did he say that  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan resigned to tell the people of  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  the truth about himself and the P.A.P.? Or did\r\n\r\nhe  say  that Mr Ong Eng Guan resigned so that  he\r\n\r\ncould  escape from being exposed as a  purveyor  of\r\n\r\nfalsehoods in this Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the records speak for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  They have been indelibly imprinted  in\r\n\r\nthe   annals  of  this  historic  session  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly. Let me recapitulate\r\n\r\nthe salient facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the 1961 Budget debate, the\r\n\r\nthen  Member  for Hong Lim repeatedly made  certain\r\n\r\nallegations and insinuations about the integrity of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw.  Despite  the then Member for Hong  Lim  being\r\n\r\ncalled  a rogue and a liar both inside and  outside\r\n\r\nthis  House by the Prime Minister and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour and Law, he never dared to take up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge to repeat outside this House what he  had\r\n\r\nsaid under cover of privilege inside the House. The\r\n\r\nLeader of the House thereupon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoved  that this House condemn the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim for his dishonourable conduct unbecoming of  an\r\n\r\nelected  representative of the people  in  that  he\r\n\r\nrepeatedly used the privilege of this Assembly as a\r\n\r\ncloak   for   spreading  malicious  falsehoods   to\r\n\r\nunjustly  injure innocent persons both  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside  this  Assembly;  After  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had  put his case before the  House,  the\r\n\r\nthen  Member  for  Hong Lim  pleaded  for  time  to\r\n\r\nprepare  his  case  and answer.  The  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  then  graciously said - I  quote  from  the\r\n\r\nunrevised  transcript  of the  proceedings  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly on 19th December,  1960,  page\r\n\r\n25, line 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dr Toh Chin Chye: Mr Speaker, it is not the\r\n\r\nintention  of the House to prevent the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim from speaking in this Chamber; neither  is\r\n\r\nit  our  intention  not to give him  time  to  seek\r\n\r\nadvice  on  his  motion. As he so decides,  I  will\r\n\r\nmove,  Mr  Speaker,  that  this  Assembly  do  now\r\n\r\nadjourn to Friday, 23rd December.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  so,  Mr Speaker, the scene shifted to Friday,\r\n\r\n23rd   December.  After  your  ruling   about   the\r\n\r\nadmissibility  of  the motion of the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had been thoroughly debated  by  all  the\r\n\r\nlegal  luminaries of this Chamber,  if  I  remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly, the then Member for Hong Lim was given a\r\n\r\nchance  to  reply to the motion which suggested  to\r\n\r\nhim alternatives of either withdrawing unreservedly\r\n\r\nhis   unfounded  allegations  against   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Minister for Labour and  Law  and\r\n\r\napologising  to this Assembly for his dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct  or  repeating outside  the  Assembly  when\r\n\r\nchallenged the charges he made inside the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe  then Member for Hong Lim - and I quote from  the\r\n\r\nunrevised  transcript  of the  proceedings  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly on 23rd December,  1960,  page\r\n\r\n44:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate all the things I have said.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then  there  followed  an  interjection  from   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker: So do I take it then that the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim does not wish to withdraw  his\r\n\r\nallegations;  he  does  not  wish   to   give   any\r\n\r\nexplanation of them, and his desire is to  try  and\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  the  allegations  he  made  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly?  Is that the course the Member  for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim is taking?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the reply was:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: Yes, Mr Speaker, I have\r\n\r\nnothing to apologise.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>However,  Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Ong Eng Guan  could\r\n\r\nnot  substantiate his allegations on 23rd  December\r\n\r\nand  he  again asked for time to prepare his  case.\r\n\r\nThe  debate therefore was again adjourned  to  29th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1960, to give time to the then Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim to marshal all his facts so that he could\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  the allegations he made  against  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\nBut  what happened on 29th December, 1960?  Did  we\r\n\r\nsit  in  Committee  and  listen  to  the  array  of\r\n\r\nwitnesses and facts which the then Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  was  supposed  to have brought  before  us  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  his  allegations  against  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Minister for Labour and Law?  The\r\n\r\nHouse  on  that  day was filled  to  capacity.  The\r\n\r\ngallery  was waiting for the self-proclaimed  great\r\n\r\nrevolutionary to set off the fireworks.  But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  actually  turned out was that  there  was  no\r\n\r\ngreat revolutionary. It transpired that he was only\r\n\r\na  pretender. And instead of fireworks, we found  a\r\n\r\ndamp   squib.   All   those   brave   words   about\r\n\r\nsubstantiating  the allegations  came  to  nothing.\r\n\r\nInstead Mr Ong Eng Guan ran away by resigning  his\r\n\r\nseat  for  Hong Lim. He could not and he dared  not\r\n\r\nface the truth. That was actually what happened. He\r\n\r\nhad  to  run  away, and run away  from  what?  From\r\n\r\ntruth,  truth which would have exposed Mr Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan   as   an  opportunist,  a  vilifier   and   a\r\n\r\nscandalmonger. Following this, on 29th December,  a\r\n\r\nstatement   was   issued  by  the  P.A.P.   Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee. Allow me, Sir, to  quote  the\r\n\r\nrelevant section. It is a short passage:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [that is, Mr Ong Eng Guan] has, among many\r\n\r\nother  falsehoods, made grave charges of  political\r\n\r\ncorruption against Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr  K.  M.\r\n\r\nByrne.  It is his duty now to tell the truth either\r\n\r\nat  a  mass meeting in Hong Lim repeating  all  his\r\n\r\nlies  or, if he is afraid to meet the people,  then\r\n\r\nto  repeat  these  charges before a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  which  will  be open  to  the  public  and\r\n\r\nreported by the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Commission has made a thorough\r\n\r\ninvestigation of the truth and made its report,  it\r\n\r\nwill be published to the whole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  people and then Mr Ong Eng Guan can  come\r\n\r\ndown to Hong Lim and repeat his allegations. The\r\n\r\nby-election  will be held as soon as possible  and  we\r\n\r\nhope  to  meet  Mr Ong Eng Guan in  Hong  Lim  and\r\n\r\nexpose  him  to  be   the dirty  liar  and  covertly\r\n\r\nscoundrel that he has already been publicly called.\r\n\r\nWe  are confident that when the people of Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nknow the truth, they will pass judgment on him in a\r\n\r\nmanner which deserves a coward and a rogue.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the Member for Aljunied thinks we should\r\n\r\nhave an immediate by-election. Of course, he quotes\r\n\r\nquite  a  number  of  other things.  He  is  asking\r\n\r\nwhether  there is any control of the Press, whether\r\n\r\nhe  is  going  to be given radio time, and  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  going to be a voice for  Hong  Lim,  and\r\n\r\nrights  of  the people, almost suggesting  that  we\r\n\r\nmight  employ  third-degree tactics on  people  who\r\n\r\nmight  stand for election. All these do not need  a\r\n\r\nreply.  They have been adequately replied time  and\r\n\r\ntime  again  in  this  House  by  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always good to talk of going back to the\r\n\r\npeople,  but  does he really mean it? If  that  was\r\n\r\ntrue,  then  Mr Ong Eng Guan should have  resigned\r\n\r\nearlier  when he was first challenged by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. Why did he resign only when he  was  left\r\n\r\nto  face the music, when the Speaker had laid  down\r\n\r\nthe  proper procedure to followed, and when Mr Ong\r\n\r\nEng Guan realised that evidence had to be given  on\r\n\r\noath  in Committee and he could not make more false\r\n\r\nspeeches  from his seat in the Assembly  where  all\r\n\r\nthe  speeches  are privileged? Does this  not  show\r\n\r\nthat he could not face the truth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not this anxiety to have an early by-election\r\n\r\nmerely  a  masquerade to run away from  the  truth?\r\n\r\nNow,  the hon. Member for Aljunied thinks we should\r\n\r\nhurry  the by-election so that the people  of  Hong\r\n\r\nLim and the people of the whole of Singapore may be\r\n\r\ndeceived. Again we ask: why this unseemly haste? Is\r\n\r\nit  not  right  and proper that all  the  facts  be\r\n\r\nrevealed to the people? Why must the vision of  the\r\n\r\npeople be besmogged with smokescreens emitted  from\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Eng Guan? Let the people of the whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, not just the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of  Hong Lim, know the whole  truth  first.\r\n\r\nThen  after  knowing the truth, let the  people  of\r\n\r\nHong   Lim  decide  as  to  who  should  be   their\r\n\r\nrepresentative in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we may ask: how did the Opposition react\r\n\r\nto all this? Mr Speaker, Sir, let us have a clear\r\n\r\nview of the issue before us. Grave allegations have\r\n\r\nbeen made against two of the Ministers, and yet the\r\n\r\nOpposition  in  this Assembly, and  especially  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Huh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -is not interested in pursuing\r\n\r\nthe  truth  of  these allegations. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill said, and I quote from the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nof 31st December, 1960:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [in other words, Mr Ong Eng Guan] is now\r\n\r\nfighting  the battle of the Opposition in  the \r\n\r\nby-election against the Party in power.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, all that the Opposition can think\r\n\r\nof and are interested in is that they should oppose\r\n\r\nthe  Government. They are not interested  in  truth\r\n\r\nitself.  If those allegations were true, then  they\r\n\r\ncould  bring  down the whole Government,  in  which\r\n\r\ncase  it  would mean new General Elections for  all\r\n\r\nthe  constituencies in Singapore instead of just  a\r\n\r\nby-election for Hong Lim. Is it because the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  and certain other people  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen mentioned in the Press like Mr Marshall, Mrs\r\n\r\nLeon  Soh, the Member for Aljunied, the Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol,  all  know  that  these  allegations   are\r\n\r\nbaseless and false? And yet they want the people of\r\n\r\nHong  Lim to vote a new representative on the basis\r\n\r\nof false allegations and before the truth is placed\r\n\r\nbefore  them? One irresistible conclusion  is  that\r\n\r\nthe Opposition has, as somebody has said before,  a\r\n\r\nvested interest in lies and falsehoods, and I  hope-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is a direct reference,\r\n\r\nof  course,  to Members of this Assembly - that  they\r\n\r\nhave  vested  interests in lies and  falsehoods.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Parliamentary Secretary should be a  bit\r\n\r\nmore  careful with his language, and withdraw  that\r\n\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw the word \"lies\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has  already categorically  stated\r\n\r\nthat a by-election will be held as soon as possible\r\n\r\nafter  the Inquiry Report has been tabled. It  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  long.  We need no further  assurance  than\r\n\r\nthat. But it is in our interests that before the\r\n\r\nby-election,  we  first know the truth. Let  us  first\r\n\r\nknow the facts that have led to the resignation  of\r\n\r\nMr  Ong Eng Guan and the consequent vacancy in the\r\n\r\nconstituency of Hong Lim. All these are  intimately\r\n\r\nconnected with the coming by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now our duty and our right, not only to\r\n\r\nourselves and the people of Hong Lim, but  also  to\r\n\r\nthe  people of the whole of Singapore, to lay  bare\r\n\r\nall  the facts to find out whether Mr Ong Eng Guan\r\n\r\nwas telling the truth or merely spreading malicious\r\n\r\nfalsehoods. If they are proved to be lies, then his\r\n\r\nskin  must  be  thick indeed if he dared  to  stand\r\n\r\nbefore  the  people of Hong Lim again. As  for  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Aljunied, I do not think I am  letting\r\n\r\nout a secret when I say that there are some who are\r\n\r\nof  the opinion that there also ought to be  a \r\n\r\nby-election in Aljunied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  just  now  brought  in  my  name  in  this\r\n\r\ncontroversy, I feel that I should now rise and tell\r\n\r\na few salient facts to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, I must say that the Government\r\n\r\nhas no right to think that this by-election is a\r\n\r\nfight between Mr Ong Eng Guan and the P.A.P. A\r\n\r\nby-election has to be held under the law. It should\r\n\r\nnot be delayed because of what the Government\r\n\r\nthinks: that Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan may stand as a candidate and that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have to meet Mr Ong Eng  Guan  at  the\r\n\r\npolls. A by-election is for all people who care  to\r\n\r\nstand  as candidates in that by-election.  And  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should, therefore, not treat  this  \r\n\r\nby-election  as  a fight that they have to  carry  out\r\n\r\nagainst Mr Ong Eng Guan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker, Sir, made mention of a\r\n\r\nstatement which we had issued to the Press, and  he\r\n\r\nquoted the Straits Times. I would like to thank him\r\n\r\nfor that quotation, because it strengthens the case\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition - that the Opposition claims  that\r\n\r\nthe Press has been muzzled. To this extent, Sir - we\r\n\r\nsent a statement giving the reasons why we were not\r\n\r\ncontesting the by-election, and that statement  had\r\n\r\nbeen distorted to mean almost nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell this House how that statement should\r\n\r\nhave  read  if  the  Press had  been  fair  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. We said that we had no sympathy for Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan - and we still say it here that we have\r\n\r\nno  sympathy for Mr Ong Eng Guan. But we  did  say\r\n\r\nthis:  \"that  because  of the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nby-election  is  going  to  be a  battle  between  the\r\n\r\nOpposition and the Party in power which, by  reason\r\n\r\nof  its  majority, could unjustly use its power  to\r\n\r\nsilence the Opposition\". Those important words were\r\n\r\nleft  out  by  the  Press which, according  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture, is free to publish  what  it\r\n\r\nfeels  should be published. It is so free  that  it\r\n\r\ndistorts  the statement of the Opposition.  And  we\r\n\r\nstill  say  that it is quite free  to  do  what  it\r\n\r\nwants. I am not saying that the Government has told\r\n\r\nthe Press not to print it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What did you say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have said many a time\r\n\r\nthat   there   is   such  a  thing  as   suggestive\r\n\r\nintimidation.   And  I  repeat   it   here   again:\r\n\r\nsuggestive intimidation is more heinous  than  open\r\n\r\nintimidation,  because  open  intimidation  can  be\r\n\r\nnailed  whereas  suggestive  intimidation  can   go\r\n\r\nunchallenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You are wrong.

The by-election\r\n\r\nin  Hong Lim must not be taken by the Government to\r\n\r\nmean  that it is a fight between Mr Ong  Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nand the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Are you putting up a candidate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nhas yet to learn a little bit of culture!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have said we are not putting\r\n\r\nup  a  candidate because we feel that Mr  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan,  although we have no sympathy for him, has  a\r\n\r\nfight  on  his  hands against the Party  in  power;\r\n\r\nalthough it is rather ironical that he should  have\r\n\r\ncome  out of that Party in power to now fight  that\r\n\r\nParty  in power! The Minister for Culture,  in  his\r\n\r\naddress  at  the Sixth Anniversary meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., said that Mr Ong Eng Guan-because  we  are\r\n\r\nnot putting up a candidate - is being supported by us\r\n\r\nand  therefore he is a Right-wing.

Because so much has been said and so much has\r\n\r\nbeen  left unsaid, it is the view of the Opposition\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be no delay whatsoever  in  the\r\n\r\nholding  of this by-election.

We deny categorically  that\r\n\r\nwe  would like to derive some benefit out of  this\r\n\r\ncontroversy.

Let me\r\n\r\nsay  here  that in this matter, the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  is that truth will triumph.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  sympathise  with  the statements  made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Aljunied so that an early  by-election\r\n\r\ncould  be held for the vacant constituency of  Hong\r\n\r\nLim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very\r\n\r\ngratifying  to  the Government  to  know  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  are  good watch-dogs of democracy,  and\r\n\r\ntheir  anxiety to see that the by-election is  held\r\n\r\nas soon as possible will probably be fulfilled much\r\n\r\nsooner  than they are prepared for. I suspect  that\r\n\r\nall  this  anxious questioning on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Aljunied was with one aim in view.  We,\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  want  to  establish   a   simple\r\n\r\nquestion. Before Mr Ong Eng Guan presents  himself\r\n\r\nas  a  candidate in the by-election, we think  that\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Hong Lim should have the  right  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether  they will be asked  to  vote  for  a\r\n\r\ncandidate  who  is  proved  to  be  a  purveyor  of\r\n\r\nfalsehoods, or whether they are going to  be  asked\r\n\r\nto  vote for a candidate who is obviously a man who\r\n\r\nspeaks  the truth. And it is quite right before  we\r\n\r\ncan  do this. If we are convinced, as we are,  that\r\n\r\nMr  Ong Eng Guan is a purveyor of falsehoods, that\r\n\r\nhe   has   been  using  this  Assembly  to   purvey\r\n\r\nfalsehoods and to assassinate characters,  then  we\r\n\r\nsay that he is not only a menace to himself and his\r\n\r\nfriends but a menace to democracy. Because  a  very\r\n\r\nrecent   case   was  a  gentleman  called   Senator\r\n\r\nMcCarthy,  who used Senate privilege precisely  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose,  of  using lies  and  falsehoods  to\r\n\r\nassassinate  the  character  of  so  many  innocent\r\n\r\npeople,  so much so that at a later period  of  his\r\n\r\npolitical   life,   responsible   newspapers   were\r\n\r\nprecisely making the same demand that action should\r\n\r\nbe  taken against him to prevent him from using the\r\n\r\nSenate  as a cover to assassinate the character  of\r\n\r\ninnocent people, and that if he continued to do so,\r\n\r\nthen  he  would bring democracy into disrepute  and\r\n\r\ncontempt. Not only democracy but Assembly privilege\r\n\r\nwill   become  a  weapon  to  spread  terror  among\r\n\r\ninnocent people. So that is exactly what we want to\r\n\r\nestablish:  whether Mr Ong Eng Guan is a  purveyor\r\n\r\nof falsehoods. Then let us prove it. If he is not a\r\n\r\npurveyor of falsehoods, let him go back and let the\r\n\r\npeople  of Hong Lim reelect the honest man. But  as\r\n\r\nwe  believe  he is not so, then it is our  duty  to\r\n\r\nbring  him  before a Commission and establish  once\r\n\r\nand  for all whether he is an honest or a dishonest\r\n\r\nman.  Therefore,  the Opposition knows  this.  What\r\n\r\nthey are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterested in is that Ong Eng Guan has now become a\r\n\r\nuseful tool to fight some other battle. I am  quite\r\n\r\nconvinced, as they have taken great care  to  point\r\n\r\nout,  that they have no sympathy with Mr  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan.  But  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  played  with   the\r\n\r\nadventurous Left once upon a time. He got  nowhere.\r\n\r\nSo  now he has decided to use the Opposition to put\r\n\r\nhim   into  power.  And,  therefore,  Sir,  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  because Mr Ong Eng Guan is politically\r\n\r\nquite  a  shrewd  man. He knows that  too  open  an\r\n\r\nembrace by the Right-wing would have been the  kiss\r\n\r\nof  death.  So we notice that the S.P.A. statement\r\n\r\nhas  this invocation. \"We have no sympathy with Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan. But we hope that he will fight  the\r\n\r\nbattle  of the Opposition.\" To a man for  whom  you\r\n\r\nhave  no sympathy, if you say, \"Well, we are  going\r\n\r\nto  support  him.  We are not going  to  put  up  a\r\n\r\ncandidate because he is fighting the battle of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition\", what is the battle of the  Opposition?\r\n\r\nIs  it  the right of an elected Assemblyman to  use\r\n\r\nAssembly privilege to tell falsehoods? Is that  the\r\n\r\nright  of  the Opposition? Again we have Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall  also  will  this preface:  \"We  have  no\r\n\r\nsympathy for Mr Ong Eng Guan. But we think that he\r\n\r\nwill fight a heroic battle for democracy.\" There is\r\n\r\nthe leader of the Singapore Congress who also, I am\r\n\r\ntold, is an animal lover - a sort of fighter for  the\r\n\r\nunder-dog - also coming out with the same  statement\r\n\r\nto say that they have no sympathy and so on, but on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, \"he is fighting a great battle for\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\"  Therefore,  I  say,  Sir,   that   the\r\n\r\nOpposition's  stand itself simply  indicates  this.\r\n\r\nThey  think they are going to use Mr Ong Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nto  have  a little battle with the Government.  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan thinks he can use the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nfight  his battle. Therefore, though the two  sides\r\n\r\nthink that they are fighting a kind of battle where\r\n\r\neach  one  thinks that it is getting the better  of\r\n\r\nthe  other,  what simply it all boils  down  to  is\r\n\r\nthis.  The  Opposition know that they  either  hang\r\n\r\ntogether or hang separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nalleged  that  the Government, either  by  indirect\r\n\r\nintimidation   or  otherwise,  had  pursuaded   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  not to publish the magnum opus  of  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  fact, Sir, that statement was published in  the\r\n\r\nChinese Press, but to our consternation, it was not\r\n\r\npublished  in the English Press. As far as  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, that statement makes it more  than  ever\r\n\r\nclear that the S.A.P.-the Right-wing - is now using a\r\n\r\nbankrupt   Left-wing  adventurer,  or  a   bankrupt\r\n\r\nLeftist  who  tried to play with the Left-wing  and\r\n\r\nwho  could  not get anywhere. Therefore, they  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to use him for their political  ends.  You\r\n\r\nwill notice, Sir, that so far the only support that\r\n\r\nhas  come to Mr Ong Eng Guan is not from Socialist\r\n\r\ngroups, not from workers and not from trade unions,\r\n\r\nbut  from the Right-wing, who once upon a time were\r\n\r\nclaiming that Mr Ong Eng Guan was a menace and  so\r\n\r\non.  Now  they  are saying that he  is  becoming  a\r\n\r\nfighter  for democracy. Therefore, I say,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthis battle, as far as the P.A.P. is concerned,  we\r\n\r\nregard  Mr Ong Eng Guan and the Opposition - as  far\r\n\r\nas U.M.N.O. is concerned, I am quite glad they have\r\n\r\nnot yet made a statement - as having flocked together\r\n\r\nas  the Opposition. As far as we are concerned,  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  Mr Ong Eng Guan is merely a shield,  a\r\n\r\nbattering  ram  to  be  used  by  the  S.P.A.,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Congress, and the Workers' Party. And  in\r\n\r\nthat  strain we are prepared to take on all corners\r\n\r\nat  Hong Lim, and if the Member for Aljunied  feels\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be a by-election  in  Aljunied,\r\n\r\nthen we are prepared to take him on there too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

What\r\n\r\nreally interests me, Mr Speaker, this afternoon is\r\n\r\nthe  point  made by the Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Home Affairs who, by the nature of\r\n\r\nhis  documented speech, gave me the impression that\r\n\r\nhe  was speaking for the Government on this matter.\r\n\r\nHe  said,  \"What  is the hurry  to  hold  this \r\n\r\nby-election?\" Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Government seems to  think  that\r\n\r\nthe by-election in Hong Lim is a matter between the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and Mr Ong Eng Guan, and that it does  not\r\n\r\nconcern  anybody else. Might I suggest to them  and\r\n\r\nremind  them  that  in  this matter  the  paramount\r\n\r\nconsideration is not the P.A.P. Government, or  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan, but the electorate of Hong Lim?  If\r\n\r\nthe   Government  choose  to  delay  this  election\r\n\r\nbecause   they   want  to  go   to   the   election\r\n\r\nstrengthened, then it is the electorate of Hong Lim\r\n\r\nthat  is suffering. The point of representation  in\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, Mr Speaker, is this: that no part of\r\n\r\nthe island should be without representation. At the\r\n\r\nmoment, Hong Lim is without representation, and  in\r\n\r\nthe democratic concept of parliamentary government,\r\n\r\nthat  should  not  be  so. The  business  of  every\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  to  see  that  when  a  vacancy  by\r\n\r\nresignation, death or other cause occurs, a writ of\r\n\r\nelection  is  expeditiously issued and an  election\r\n\r\ntakes  place.  Listening to the speeches  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment benches, one gets the idea that this  is\r\n\r\na  private matter between Mr Ong Eng Guan and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the original motion which\r\n\r\nled to this resignation, you ruled that this was  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which  concerned the whole  House,  and  we\r\n\r\naccepted your ruling and we debated that motion  on\r\n\r\nthat  basis.  The  subsequent  statements  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  this  Assembly  today  confirm  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that some of us might  have  had,  that\r\n\r\nthis is a fight they are continuing against Mr Ong\r\n\r\nEng   Guan  personally,  and  that  they  are   not\r\n\r\nconcerned with the electorate of Hong Lim.  Whether\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  is represented or not does not  seem  to\r\n\r\nmatter  two hoots to the Government. All that  they\r\n\r\nare  interested  in is to go to the  electorate  of\r\n\r\nHong Lim only when their hand is strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I really did not wish to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  this motion for the adjournment,  but  I\r\n\r\nwant to dispel any impression which the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park might have given when he said just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  that  every part of the island must always  at\r\n\r\nany  time be represented in this Chamber. That  has\r\n\r\nnot been according to facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of the previous Government, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit  Timah was  detained  under  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. for several years, and during that period,\r\n\r\nthe electorate of Bukit Timah had no representative\r\n\r\nin  this  Chamber. Now, what we wish to  say  quite\r\n\r\nclearly is this; that the people of Hong Lim should\r\n\r\nbe  given the opportunity to see light. It was  not\r\n\r\nthe  Government who forced the resignation  of  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan. Perhaps the electorate of Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nshould  even  ask - upon what grounds  or  upon  what\r\n\r\nright had their elected representative in tendering\r\n\r\nhis  resignation from this Chamber? If Mr Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan,  when  he  was their representative,  were  a\r\n\r\nresponsible person, he would have considered not so\r\n\r\nmuch  his  own skin and not so much his own  pride,\r\n\r\nbut  he should have considered the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople whom he represented. Did he do it? If he had\r\n\r\nthought  more deliberately and carefully, he  would\r\n\r\nnot  have quitted this Chamber in such a hurry  and\r\n\r\nindecent haste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we say we will have the by-election, we mean\r\n\r\nit.  At the last sitting of the Assembly, in moving\r\n\r\nthe motion for adjournment of the motion to censure\r\n\r\nthe  ex-Member  for  Hong Lim for  his  conduct  in\r\n\r\npurveying falsehoods, I said very clearly  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  going  to set up a Commission of  Inquiry  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  into  the  allegations  made  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber; that Mr Ong Eng Guan had dared not appear\r\n\r\nin  this Chamber to substantiate what he had  said,\r\n\r\nor   to   substantiate  what  he  said   he   would\r\n\r\nsubstantiate.  It is important that  not  only  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  of  Hong Lim, but also  the  public  at\r\n\r\nlarge,  including  the public  in  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nshould  be  given an opportunity to  know  what  is\r\n\r\nright  and what is wrong. If we were really  afraid\r\n\r\nof a by-election, what we could have done was, very\r\n\r\nsimply,  not to have any inquiries made  either  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber or outside. But, as Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  know,  a Commission of Inquiry  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  will  be sitting next week and we hope  that  a\r\n\r\nreport will soon be produced by the Commission; and\r\n\r\nwhen that has been done, it will be duly tabled  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, and the by-election will then be held.\r\n\r\nIt  is important that at this juncture we should not\r\n\r\nconfuse  either the electorate of Hong Lim  or  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  on  the  issues  that   are\r\n\r\ninvolved. Whether a man who is prepared  to  be  as\r\n\r\nunscrupulous as to tell lies in this Chamber should\r\n\r\nbe  considered worthy of representing a section  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore - that is the main issue.  We\r\n\r\nwill  wait  for  the findings of the Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  and we certainly hope that this  time  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan  does  not also run  away  from  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry as he has run away from  this\r\n\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  amuses us Members of the Opposition  is  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  former  Member  for  Hong  Lim  was  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development on the Government\r\n\r\nside  and used the same tactics which he later used\r\n\r\nagainst the Government, there was no protest at all\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government benches.  He  accused,  if  I\r\n\r\nremember  rightly, Sir, the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nroundly,  and  I think the Government benches  were\r\n\r\njust  amused. But when the Member for Hong Lim came\r\n\r\nto the Opposition- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering how all\r\n\r\nthis  has  anything to do with the  matter  we  are\r\n\r\ndiscussing-the  by-elections  in  Hong  Lim?   Past\r\n\r\nconduct of that nature, surely, has nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith the by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I mention that because an\r\n\r\naccusation  has been made that we are  siding  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim and using him as  a  tool;\r\n\r\nwhereas if anything. Sir, by the fact that  we  had\r\n\r\nbeen at the receiving end here for a long time when\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Hong  Lim was  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development, one  would  expect  that  we\r\n\r\nwould be against the Member for Hong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLim  in  the by-election. That is why I  wanted  to\r\n\r\nclear  the  air:  that we here were more  tolerant,\r\n\r\nmore charitable and more willing to receive and yet\r\n\r\ngive  the Government a fight. Now, in the Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nby-election, Sir, instead of having the by-election\r\n\r\nquickly,  the Government apparently is not prepared\r\n\r\nto  take what we before were able to take from  him\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was their comrade. I would suggest,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat they should show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe same spirit of charitableness and patience as\r\n\r\nwe showed them when the Member for Hong Lim was on\r\n\r\ntheir side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-five minutes past Five o'clock to Wednesday, 22nd February,1961.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
