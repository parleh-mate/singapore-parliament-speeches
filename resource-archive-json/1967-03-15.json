W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> The answer to the question is\r\n\r\n\"Yes\". The Lorong Limau area is urgently required  not\r\n\r\nfor  industrialisation projects but for re-development\r\n\r\npurposes.  The Housing and Development Board  will  be\r\n\r\ncommencing  redevelopment  as  soon  as  the  area  is\r\n\r\ncleared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for redeveloping this area are threefold.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the  area is frequently subject  to  floods.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  with the redevelopment of the  area,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be better utilisation of the land to house  many\r\n\r\nmore  families than the number of people that  are  at\r\n\r\npresent   residing  there.  Thirdly,  the   one-storey\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flats there are very old  and  in  very\r\n\r\npoor condition, resulting in high maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question is that\r\n\r\nno  notice  to  quit  has as yet been  served  on  the\r\n\r\nresidents of the Housing Board flats affected in  this\r\n\r\narea,  and  I hope that no eviction will be necessary.\r\n\r\nThose  residents who co-operate and move out of  these\r\n\r\nHousing   Board   flats  will  be   offered   suitable\r\n\r\nalternative  accommodation  in  other  Housing   Board\r\n\r\nestates. In fact, some have already moved and we  hope\r\n\r\nthat it will not be necessary to issue notices to quit\r\n\r\non the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Mr Ho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has\r\n\r\nalready    announced   the   acceptance   of   certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the Commission,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nsecond  method  of entrenchment of the  provisions  to\r\n\r\nprotect  fundamental  rights. I would  also  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to accept the first method of entrenchment,\r\n\r\nnamely,  that  a Bill altering the Constitution  shall\r\n\r\nnot be passed by Parliament unless it is expressed  to\r\n\r\nbe  one  that amends the Constitution and contains  no\r\n\r\nother  provisions.  Sir, this  will  help  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  understand better that the Bill  is  meant\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of altering the Constitution, because\r\n\r\nnot  all people know the niceties of the law. So  this\r\n\r\nfirst method will help us to grasp the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take you, Mr Speaker, as an example. If a Bill\r\n\r\nis  introduced  in the House specifically  stipulating\r\n\r\nthat  it is meant to alter the Constitution, then  you\r\n\r\nwill  know  that under the Constitution it  needs  the\r\n\r\nsupport of two-thirds of the Members of Parliament  to\r\n\r\nvote on it before it can be passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the third method of amendment to the\r\n\r\nConstitution which provides for a referendum to decide\r\n\r\non the adoption of the Bill altering the Constitution,\r\n\r\nin  my  view, this third method is redundant  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   rather  cumbersome,  because  there  will   be\r\n\r\ndifficulties if we implement it, especially in  regard\r\n\r\nto the assessment of public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a very small country and newly independent. We\r\n\r\nhave elections once every five years. In 1963 we had a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election. We have also had a few by-elections\r\n\r\nsince then. Even then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  electorate had grumbled about being  required  to\r\n\r\nvote at the elections, especially the by-elections. In\r\n\r\nsome  constituencies the electorate had to  vote  only\r\n\r\nonce,  but  in other constituencies they had  to  vote\r\n\r\ntwice.  So  if a Bill were to be introduced  into  the\r\n\r\nHouse  every year to amend the Constitution,  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  were required to vote on it, then it would  be\r\n\r\nrather  troublesome and it would also incur a  lot  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure. The result would be contrary to  what  we\r\n\r\nwould expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\ntake   this   opportunity  to  echo  the  Government's\r\n\r\nappreciation   of   the  highly   commendable   Report\r\n\r\npresented   to   Parliament  by   the   Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission, 1966? I have read and studied  the  Report\r\n\r\nthoroughly, and I must say that it is one of the  best\r\n\r\nReports  ever  presented. I am, however,  particularly\r\n\r\nhappy  to  note  that the Government  has  given  very\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration to the Report and that most  of\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations are acceptable though a  few  are\r\n\r\nnot,  while there are other recommendations which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment agrees in principle but differs in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, allow me to make a few observations on\r\n\r\nthe  various headings. There are (1) the Ombudsman (or\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration; (2)\r\n\r\nthe  Council  of  State;  and (3)  the  Protection  of\r\n\r\nFundamental  Rights  and Freedoms of  the  Individual.\r\n\r\nBefore  touching  on the office of  the  Ombudsman,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to refer to the fears expressed  in  some\r\n\r\nquarters  that the country is heading in the direction\r\n\r\nof being a one-party State. According to them, this is\r\n\r\nnot good for a country and would in the end lead to  a\r\n\r\ndictatorship or a totalitarian government.  To  dispel\r\n\r\ntheir  fears,  may  I ask these people  one  important\r\n\r\nquestion? Whether or not the P.A.P. Government is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   practising   parliamentary   democracy?    The\r\n\r\nGovernment is essentially democratic socialist and  it\r\n\r\nis,  in  fact, practising parliamentary democracy.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a  President  who  is  a  Malay;  the  Executive\r\n\r\ncomprising the main races of which the Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  is  a Chinese; the Judiciary  of  which  the\r\n\r\nChief Justice is a Chinese; the Commissioner of Police\r\n\r\nwho is a Eurasian; and not forgetting that the Speaker\r\n\r\nof  Parliament is an Indian; the Army Commander  is  a\r\n\r\nEurasian; and in the Civil Service the heads are  made\r\n\r\nup of citizens of the various races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can go on and point out many others. Suffice it\r\n\r\nto  say  that it is not and never will be the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\npolicy to be dictatorial as long as it is entrusted to\r\n\r\nlook  after the interests of the nation. I think  this\r\n\r\nis  sufficient  enough  to  show  to  the  world  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  truly  a  multi-racial  society,  truly\r\n\r\npractising  democracy. We are not like some  countries\r\n\r\nwhich   talk  of  multi-racialism  and  yet   practise\r\n\r\nfeudalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on parliamentary democracy is that we\r\n\r\nstill  have the one-man-one-vote system. We  have  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  elections once every  five  years,  and\r\n\r\nwhenever  vacancies occur in Parliament  they  are  at\r\n\r\nonce  filled through the by-elections. Therefore,  how\r\n\r\ncan   people   say  that  there  is  no  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  Singapore? I think  that  these  people\r\n\r\nought to have their heads examined. The Government  is\r\n\r\nelected by the people, and the only reason I can think\r\n\r\nof  why  the  people  of Singapore keep  on  returning\r\n\r\nP.A.P. candidates  at the various by-elections,  even\r\n\r\nthough they know full well that the P.A.P. already has\r\n\r\nmore  than two-thirds majority in Parliament, is  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  the  only political  Party  that  can\r\n\r\nprovide  a  clean  and  honest  leadership  and   also\r\n\r\nmaintain this progressive society whereby everyone  is\r\n\r\nable  to  have  a happy life. Therefore,  this  purely\r\n\r\nreflects   the  confidence  of  the  people   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   legislate   honestly,   fairly   and\r\n\r\nreasonably in the interests of all concerned.  If  the\r\n\r\nexistence of a one-party State is brought about, as it\r\n\r\nis likely to happen, then it is no fault of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnor  of  the people. It is the will of the people.  We\r\n\r\nmust not forget, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there is still\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition in this House, because the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nnot  got all the 51 seats. Two hon. Members are absent\r\n\r\nand their whereabouts are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunknown.  Why  they choose to be so is for  them,  and\r\n\r\nthem  only,  to  answer.  I cannot  answer  for  them.\r\n\r\nHowever,   I   must  stress  that  the  P.A.P. wants\r\n\r\nOpposition,  and we the Backbenchers  will  play  this\r\n\r\nrole  well.  Be  that  as it may,  Sir,  we  will  not\r\n\r\nabdicate  our responsibility and we will  continue  to\r\n\r\nserve the people to the best of our ability, come what\r\n\r\nmay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to the first point, the office of\r\n\r\nOmbudsman.  I  refer  to  the vast  powers  which  the\r\n\r\nOmbudsman  has,  as  recommended in  the  Commission's\r\n\r\nReport. I am inclined to agree to this office,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould like to make a suggestion. I would propose that,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  vesting vast powers in one person  alone,\r\n\r\nwhich would not serve a useful purpose, a committee of\r\n\r\nthree be set up with each taking turns as Chairman and\r\n\r\nserving  a  minimum period of, say, three years.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  general belief is that two heads are better  than\r\n\r\none,  and  I think three heads well screwed  on  their\r\n\r\nshoulders,  so  to speak, would make the  office  more\r\n\r\nformidable and less fallible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> What about a\r\n\r\nhundred heads?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> That would come later in the\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Even the Ombudsman can be fallible,  and  to\r\n\r\nerr  is  human. However, with three persons in office,\r\n\r\nthe   administration  may  be  slower  but  it   would\r\n\r\ndefinitely  and positively be surer and more  reliable\r\n\r\nin  consequence. For all practical purposes, when  one\r\n\r\nOmbudsman  has  to  conduct  investigations  and  make\r\n\r\npublic  his  findings, it would be from one viewpoint,\r\n\r\nfrom  one  angle. However, if there is a committee  of\r\n\r\nthree, the findings then would be a consensus of or  a\r\n\r\nmajority  of opinion amongst three, and this would  be\r\n\r\nmore  reliable.  And  as  the  complaints  would  fall\r\n\r\nbroadly  within  the two categories mentioned  in  the\r\n\r\nReport,  I  think one man's view, opinion or  decision\r\n\r\nvaries with another, and this depends on how the facts\r\n\r\nare   presented;  also  the  emphasis  on  which   the\r\n\r\nOmbudsman relies before he exercises his discretionary\r\n\r\npowers,  if at all discretionary powers and  decisions\r\n\r\nare  subject  to investigation by the  office  of  the\r\n\r\nOmbudsman, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstated  in  the Report. But I would like to  emphasise\r\n\r\nthat there exists in Singapore a department that deals\r\n\r\nwith  public  inquiries  and complaints.  The  Central\r\n\r\nComplaints Bureau is, in fact, doing a fine  job,  for\r\n\r\non  many  occasions I had to refer to this  department\r\n\r\ncomplaints which I felt should be attended to  by  it,\r\n\r\nand  I  am happy to say that all have been dealt  with\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.  Therefore,  the  suspicion  that  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints would not be properly investigated does not\r\n\r\narise. However, if the committee, as I have suggested,\r\n\r\nis to be set up at all, may I suggest that the members\r\n\r\nbe  drawn from people of high calibre and eminence  in\r\n\r\npublic administration, and who are not members of  any\r\n\r\npolitical  party,  and  for  that  matter,  are   non-partisans in political affairs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendation for the setting up of\r\n\r\nthe  Council  of State, it is noticed  that  the  main\r\n\r\nsupport for the creation of this Council rests on  the\r\n\r\nfact   that  there  is  no  effective  or  responsible\r\n\r\nOpposition  in  Parliament. As I have  already  stated\r\n\r\nearlier, this surely reflects on the confidence of the\r\n\r\npeople in the Government to legislate honestly, fairly\r\n\r\nand reasonably in the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also point out that we still have the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committees of Parliament which  always  invite\r\n\r\nconstructive    and   well-informed   criticisms    or\r\n\r\namendments to measures proposed in Parliament. If  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of the Council of State would not only  be\r\n\r\ntoo  expensive,  it would, in effect,  only  serve  to\r\n\r\ndelay  the passage of Bills. And if the Council is  to\r\n\r\nbe  set  up,  it  would, to my mind,  tend  to  become\r\n\r\nsomewhat like an Upper House where its composition  is\r\n\r\nmade  up  of  non-elected members. They  would  likely\r\n\r\nbecome  more  or less the Senate, though their  duties\r\n\r\nwould be purely advisory. Though the Council would sit\r\n\r\nin  private, still its reports on the deliberations on\r\n\r\nthe  Bills referred to them would have to be presented\r\n\r\nto  Parliament.  Is it intended that  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nState  replaces  the Select Committees  which  Sit  in\r\n\r\npublic  to  hear public views? However,  if  its  sole\r\n\r\nfunction is merely to advise, then I see no reason why\r\n\r\nit should be so set up, for the Select Committees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  serve a more useful  purpose  as  they\r\n\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I refer to the question of protection of\r\n\r\nfundamental rights and freedom of the individual. Sir,\r\n\r\nif  we  are  to continue to have democracy, then  this\r\n\r\nquestion  is of paramount importance to all  citizens,\r\n\r\nincluding  individuals. Therefore, the recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the  Commission to embody in the Constitution  the\r\n\r\nprotection of the rights of life and personal  liberty\r\n\r\nof  the individual, the prohibition of slavery of  all\r\n\r\nforms  and  of  forced labour, the protection  against\r\n\r\nretrospective  criminal  laws  and  repeated   trials,\r\n\r\nequality of all persons before the law, prohibition of\r\n\r\nbanishment and freedom of movement, freedom of speech,\r\n\r\nassembly,  association  and  religion,  are  all  very\r\n\r\nimportant  characteristics of a  true  democracy.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that the Government will ensure that steps  will\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to incorporate them in the Constitution  is\r\n\r\nanother sign that it is practising democracy in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the  overwhelming majority it has  in  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis should dispel the fears of the evils of Singapore\r\n\r\nhaving  a one-party system. This will be the necessary\r\n\r\nguarantee  to  every individual of his rightful  place\r\n\r\nhere.  However,  I  must  stress  strongly  that  this\r\n\r\nsociety   will  collapse  if  the  people,  especially\r\n\r\ncertain  sections, continue to exploit this  issue  in\r\n\r\nspite  of the vigorous steps the Government is  taking\r\n\r\nto  ensure a fair deal to all. Therefore, the need for\r\n\r\nbuilding an organised society out of peoples of varied\r\n\r\nmigrant  origins is a heavy task. But  I  am  positive\r\n\r\nthat  with patience and tolerance amongst the  people,\r\n\r\nthis  organised  society, built upon  multi-racialism,\r\n\r\nwill  ultimately  emerge  and  Singapore  will  be   a\r\n\r\nshowpiece,  not only in South-east Asia, but  also  in\r\n\r\nthe  world where everyone enjoys equal franchise. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  give  my  support to the motion  as  moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  giving  my views on the motion  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  the name of the Minister for Law,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike,  first,  to  express the  gratification  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that a unanimous \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreport was, in fact, possible despite the fact\r\n\r\nthat  almost  every minority group  in  Singapore  was\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Constitutional Commission. It is  a\r\n\r\nreminder,  in  fact, of the value  of  having  certain\r\n\r\ncommon denominators in any group of people if they are\r\n\r\nto  function  effectively and cohesively.  The  common\r\n\r\ndenominators in this case were that, first, they  were\r\n\r\nlawyers   in  the  English  tradition,  and,   second,\r\n\r\nwhatever  their  religious,  their  ethnic  and  their\r\n\r\nlinguistic  origins may have been, they  had  not  got\r\n\r\nembroiled in, and debased by the excesses of  communal\r\n\r\nmass politics. I am not suggesting that a multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety is the ideal society in all circumstances.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the great powers of this world today consist  of\r\n\r\nnations which are ethno-centric in composition.  True,\r\n\r\nboth the Americans and the Russians have more than one\r\n\r\nsingle race or one single language group or one single\r\n\r\nreligion.  But there is in both countries  one  single\r\n\r\nrace  or ethnic group which shares one common language\r\n\r\nand  whose  culture is, by reason of its  dynamism  or\r\n\r\naggressiveness,  far  in  dominance  over  the  others\r\n\r\ncomprised  in  the  nation. Be  that  as  it  may  for\r\n\r\naspirants  to  world powers, we are confronted,  as  a\r\n\r\nyoung   migrant   community,  with  the   problem   of\r\n\r\ncontinuing a tolerant, meaningful society for some two\r\n\r\nmillion  people nearly all of whom cannot trace  their\r\n\r\nlinks  with the Republic for more than 150 years.  For\r\n\r\nwhen  Stamford  Raffles landed here in February  1819,\r\n\r\nthere  were only 120 Malays and 30 Chinese, and  there\r\n\r\ncannot  be  very  many of us here who  can  trace  our\r\n\r\nancestors to those 120 Malays and 30 Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-racialism in a permissive, tolerant society\r\n\r\nbecomes an imperative for us and those societies  like\r\n\r\nus,  which, for one reason or another, have taken into\r\n\r\none  geographic whole large components of people  with\r\n\r\ndiverse  ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe reasons we advanced before merger and Malaysia why\r\n\r\nsuch  a  larger whole would have provided a much  more\r\n\r\nstable, a broader basis for the survival of the values\r\n\r\nwhich we would like to carry forward from the old into\r\n\r\nthe new society,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   still   valid.  And  when  we  found   ourselves\r\n\r\nconfronted suddenly with the problem of an independent\r\n\r\nSingapore,  our pre-occupation was how to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  perils of communal politics shall not inflict us.\r\n\r\nUnless  care is exercised, we could so easily be  torn\r\n\r\nas-under.  The  problem is how to create  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the  minority either in ethnic,  linguistic  or\r\n\r\nreligious  terms,  is  not  conscious  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nminority; where the exercise of its rights as an equal\r\n\r\ncitizen  is so natural and so accepted a part  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety  that it is not conscious of the fact that  it\r\n\r\nis sharing, within this wider whole, equal rights with\r\n\r\nthe dominant ethnic groups who accept its equality  as\r\n\r\na matter of fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me review the events which led us to the\r\n\r\nnecessity of having such a Commission. Multi-racialism\r\n\r\nis   a   tenet  which  has  been  espoused  by   every\r\n\r\nresponsible  political party from the very  beginnings\r\n\r\nof   party  politics  in  Singapore.  It  was   almost\r\n\r\nsomething  taken  for granted as an axiom  before  you\r\n\r\nexpounded  your political credo. But we discovered  in\r\n\r\nthe years 1964 and 1965 how easily it was stretched to\r\n\r\nbreaking  point just by a small group of people  being\r\n\r\npermitted to expound extreme philosophies of political\r\n\r\nforms  of  government based on ethnic,  religious  and\r\n\r\nlinguistic  loyalties.  We felt  that  the  Commission\r\n\r\nwould  get  the problem in perspective. It would  also\r\n\r\nmake  people with a proclivity towards politics, based\r\n\r\non loyalties of either ethnic, linguistic or religious\r\n\r\nties, assess their possibilities of attaining power on\r\n\r\nthe basis of such manipulations. The Commission gave a\r\n\r\npatient  hearing to all those who appeared before  it.\r\n\r\nAnd, if I may add, not only a patient but an extremely\r\n\r\npolite  hearing  to  all manner of propositions  which\r\n\r\nwere placed before it as sound political propositions.\r\n\r\nTheir  unanimous  conclusion is that  it  is  a  man's\r\n\r\nposition as a citizen and his ability to exercise  his\r\n\r\nrights  as a citizen and be protected in the  exercise\r\n\r\nof   his  rights  regardless  of  race,  language   or\r\n\r\nreligion,  that must be ensured. That is  the  biggest\r\n\r\nsingle  contribution  the Commission  made  to  multi-racial understanding, tolerance and acceptance of each\r\n\r\nother's differences in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  let me hasten to add that this is not a sound and\r\n\r\nenduring  basis  on which we can secure  that  such  a\r\n\r\nsociety  will  always be tolerant and will  always  be\r\n\r\npermissive. The problem is, how do we institutionalise\r\n\r\nsome  of these forms and practices so that in the next\r\n\r\ngeneration  these things become part of  the  accepted\r\n\r\nway of life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the factors which will influence our social\r\n\r\nfabric? I suggest they can be divided roughly into two\r\n\r\ncategories,  our  own internal policies  and,  second,\r\n\r\ninternational  policies  affecting  our  own  internal\r\n\r\npolicies.  We  by  our educational  policies,  by  the\r\n\r\nvalues  which  we  systematically  inculcate  in   our\r\n\r\npeople, can ensure that the next generation will  find\r\n\r\nit  much more natural to accept a scheme of things  in\r\n\r\nwhich the exercise of authority in this society by one\r\n\r\nperson  over another does not depend upon his  colour,\r\n\r\nhis name, the kind of church or temple he goes to,  or\r\n\r\nthe language he speaks to his family at home. In turn,\r\n\r\nthe  inculcation  of  these  values  in  our  children\r\n\r\nbecomes easier if the opinion formulaters in all these\r\n\r\nvarious  community groups are conscious  of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat their attitudes and their actions cause either  a\r\n\r\nfavourable or an unfavourable reaction on the  others.\r\n\r\nIn   other  words,  it  is  not  just  a  process   of\r\n\r\nexhortation.  It  is exhortation of values  which  are\r\n\r\ndesirable, and the constant reaction of the individual\r\n\r\nwho  is being exhorted to adopt a particular scale  of\r\n\r\nvalues, against the experiences of his own life. If he\r\n\r\nfinds the exhortation incongruous to the experience of\r\n\r\nhis life, the exhortation will be rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. Recently the Government was\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  a difficult and a delicate  problem,\r\n\r\nfor  all  religious problems are delicate. A group  of\r\n\r\nBuddhists  applied for permission to use  loudspeakers\r\n\r\nfor  their religious services. All churches or temples\r\n\r\nwish to expand their flock and, with modern electronic\r\n\r\naid, the desire to modernise the proselytising zeal is\r\n\r\nonly  natural. If the answer from the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice  who  is  in  charge of these applications  was\r\n\r\n\"No\",  then  inevitably unjust  conclusions  would  be\r\n\r\ndrawn  that some denominations are more favoured  than\r\n\r\nothers. For instance, it is well known that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollowers  of  the  Muslim religion  are  summoned  to\r\n\r\nprayer  with  modern electronic aid.  I  am  happy  to\r\n\r\nreport   that  after  a  sober  but  sometimes  trying\r\n\r\nexploration of all the compromise proposals, the Inter-Religious  Council  was  able  to  reach  some  common\r\n\r\nprinciple upon which all such practices or innovations\r\n\r\nwill  be dealt with, and it was agreed that so far  as\r\n\r\nwas  possible,  such  electronic  devices  should   be\r\n\r\nconfined  to the precincts of a religious  place.  But\r\n\r\nsometimes  either by non-enforcement  of  the  law  or\r\n\r\notherwise, exemptions had been made in the  past,  and\r\n\r\nthis  particular practice had not been complied  with.\r\n\r\nIn  such cases, if there were undue invasions  of  the\r\n\r\nprivacy  of  other  persons, self-restraint  would  be\r\n\r\napplied.  Self-restraint, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  of  the\r\n\r\npeople who were otherwise permitted and have, in fact,\r\n\r\nbeen  permitted to practise particular forms of  calls\r\n\r\nto  prayer.  Under the new circumstances of  it  being\r\n\r\ncited  as a precedent for others to do likewise,  they\r\n\r\nhave  agreed to inhibit their own practices. If  there\r\n\r\nhad not been this capacity to appreciate a problem, if\r\n\r\nthe  attitude  is, \"I have always been allowed  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.   You  have  never  been  allowed  to  do  this.\r\n\r\nTherefore, that must be so,\" then it is impossible  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  this  easy  relationship.  Eventually,   the\r\n\r\nsuccess of our efforts must be measured by the ability\r\n\r\nto  build  these attitudes and these reflections  into\r\n\r\nthe next generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But however assiduously and zealously we pursue these\r\n\r\npolicies,  there  are  events  which  can  take  place\r\n\r\noutside and around us which will have deep and searing\r\n\r\nrepercussions  on our own social fabric.  Recently  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and  I  were  confronted  with  the   very\r\n\r\nunpleasant task of deciding what to do with two sampan\r\n\r\nloads  of  refugees  who came seeking  sanctuary  from\r\n\r\ndepredations which had overtaken them in  some  island\r\n\r\nto  the  south-west of us. Villages were burnt,  other\r\n\r\nhuman  miseries occurred which led them to  take  this\r\n\r\nvery  desperate  step  of seeking  sanctuary,  knowing\r\n\r\nthat,  in fact, the chances of getting sanctuary  were\r\n\r\nnegligible. If, swayed by human sympathy, we permitted\r\n\r\nthis, then we must be prepared to admit some two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  or  maybe  three million  people  in  similar\r\n\r\ncircumstances who will seek refuge in Singapore within\r\n\r\nthe next few years. Even assuming that our economy can\r\n\r\ncarry  them,  or  that they come  in  with  sufficient\r\n\r\nresources  to make a contribution to our  economy,  it\r\n\r\nmust  mean  a  mutation in our attitude, because  they\r\n\r\nmust have their repercussions on the attitudes of  the\r\n\r\nrest of the population. This is what happened in India\r\n\r\nand  Pakistan  with  each  successive  collision,   as\r\n\r\nvictims  of  atrocities streamed across the boundaries\r\n\r\ncarrying  their  tales of horror of what  happened  to\r\n\r\npeople  on the basis of the colour of their skin,  the\r\n\r\nstructure  of their nose, their eyes, the  texture  of\r\n\r\ntheir  hair.  Emotions are aroused which  jell  people\r\n\r\ninto  either unquestioning loyalties to those of  like\r\n\r\nappearance,  or blind hate and fear and  hostility  to\r\n\r\nthose  groups who look different from them.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  majority in my Cabinet are  ethnically  and\r\n\r\nlinguistically  of similar types to those  who  landed\r\n\r\nhere,  made our decision all that much more meaningful\r\n\r\nto  those  of  my  colleagues who do not  share  these\r\n\r\nethnic  and linguistic characteristics. What  we  must\r\n\r\nconstantly  remember  is that,  despite  ourselves,  a\r\n\r\nsituation  may  arise  in  which  xenophobia  actively\r\n\r\nencouraged  or otherwise accidentally allowed  out  of\r\n\r\nhand  spreads its pernicious influence throughout  our\r\n\r\nown  society.  Hence  the importance  of  having  some\r\n\r\nmechanism  whereby  members of our society  are  given\r\n\r\nsome  assurance until long-term values are  inculcated\r\n\r\nin  the  whole society, that there will be  more  than\r\n\r\nfair play, more than what they could normally have had\r\n\r\nthe  right to expect as citizens free and equal of the\r\n\r\nothers in the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that we had to decide\r\n\r\nwhat  parts of the recommendation to accept  and  what\r\n\r\nparts   to  reject.  The  acid  test  is,  does   this\r\n\r\nparticular recommendation, first, help to promote this\r\n\r\nfeeling  of  oneness  regardless of  all  the  ethnic,\r\n\r\nreligious and linguistic differences, and in the  long\r\n\r\nrun  promote  the  sense of being  and  feeling  as  a\r\n\r\ncommunity? Second, even if it does not do that in  the\r\n\r\nlong run, does it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the interim provide that assurance of consultation\r\n\r\nand participation by minority groups in the management\r\n\r\nof  our  society, which consultation and participation\r\n\r\nwould not normally have been open to them on the basis\r\n\r\nof one man one vote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the principal recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council of State. I know that many Members in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  particularly those with some training  on  the\r\n\r\nelective principles of representative government, feel\r\n\r\nthat this is a proposition which runs contrary to  the\r\n\r\nwhole thesis of representative government. It is  true\r\n\r\nthat  by  whatever  name we call  it  and  however  we\r\n\r\ndisguise  its  advisory capacity, it  is,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nclothing  with some authority the views of a group  of\r\n\r\npeople  who really cannot be said to be representative\r\n\r\nof  the electorate, because they cannot claim to speak\r\n\r\non behalf of the majority of any particular section of\r\n\r\nthe  community.  But that having been  said,  I  think\r\n\r\nprovided  there  are  certain  safeguards  as  to  the\r\n\r\npossible  misuse or abuse of the forum which  we  will\r\n\r\ncreate  by  constituting  this  Council  of  State,  a\r\n\r\ngenuine   contribution  can  be  made  to  give   that\r\n\r\nparticipation  and consultation which could  make  for\r\n\r\nmuch happier living for everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the very nature of our population, it is likely as\r\n\r\nthe years go by that Members of this House will become\r\n\r\nyounger and younger and not older and older. The young\r\n\r\nhave  a  habit of choosing those most like themselves,\r\n\r\nof voicing the sentiments, the styles and the moods of\r\n\r\ntheir generation, and over the next ten years or  even\r\n\r\nin  the  next five years, two-thirds of the electorate\r\n\r\nwill be below the age of 35. I do not say that a young\r\n\r\nrepresentative Chamber is a bad thing in itself, but I\r\n\r\ndo  say  that - perhaps this is part of the consolation\r\n\r\nof  growing old, Mr Speaker, Sir - there is  something\r\n\r\nabout  the  process  of learning which,  by  the  very\r\n\r\nnature  of  things, take time. If we had  been  older,\r\n\r\nless  idealistic, more cynical and we had with greater\r\n\r\ncircumspection    weighed   the    possibilities    of\r\n\r\namalgamation  between two very different  textures  of\r\n\r\nsociety, perhaps we may not have gone into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia  with the zest,  enthusiasm  and\r\n\r\nidealism  with which we were fired. Perhaps a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunhappiness might have been avoided. It is not that we\r\n\r\nwould  not  have tried to do it, and I  think  it  was\r\n\r\nright  that  we did. But our actions would  have  been\r\n\r\ntempered with a great deal of circumspection as to the\r\n\r\nway  in which one could slowly and gradually interlock\r\n\r\ntwo very different ways of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of my colleagues and myself that the\r\n\r\nelders  in  this community - and the problem  is  that\r\n\r\nthere are not very many such elders in the community -\r\n\r\ncan  make  a  positive  contribution  to  a  good  and\r\n\r\ntolerant  government. I have mentioned one reason  why\r\n\r\nthe older generation may not be adequately represented\r\n\r\nin  Parliament with the passage of time.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nsecond  reason  why  many people  of  scholarship  and\r\n\r\ndistinction in their particular profession or vocation\r\n\r\nare  reluctant or emotionally unfit to enter into  the\r\n\r\nsharp  conflict of the open political arena. They  and\r\n\r\nmany people find it distasteful. It is not natural for\r\n\r\npeople  educated  and brought up in a  more  sheltered\r\n\r\natmosphere  to expose themselves, their public  stance\r\n\r\nand  their private lives to open and sometimes vicious\r\n\r\npolitical attack. My colleagues and I appreciate  this\r\n\r\nvery  much,  not  because  we  enjoy  these  political\r\n\r\nattacks  but  because over a passage of time  we  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  a  certain tolerance to all  this  constant\r\n\r\nsnipping   and   cudgelling.  But  we  are   extremely\r\n\r\nconscious of the fact that it is not easy to  get  men\r\n\r\nof  intellectual  qualities to join us  in  this  open\r\n\r\narena, because the heat and the dust is something they\r\n\r\nfind uncongenial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A President's Council, which really is what the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of State will be, a kind of Privy Council  to\r\n\r\nthe   Queen,  and  so  an  advisory  council  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident,  can  make a valuable contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nmechanics  of  a  representative government,  provided\r\n\r\nthat  there are sufficient safeguards to see  that  no\r\n\r\nsectional  or functional interest can be  peddled.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  nobody can get on a hobby-horse  either\r\n\r\nfor  life  or  for  a  specific  period  to  pursue  a\r\n\r\nparticular sectional interest, whether for gain or for\r\n\r\nany other reason. Hence we differed profoundly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the proposition that such a  meeting  of\r\n\r\nthe Council should be in public. If anybody challenges\r\n\r\nthe right of the representatives of the people to take\r\n\r\na particular course of action, then they must have the\r\n\r\ncourage  to  come out openly into the political  arena\r\n\r\nand  denounce these policies. But if they  reserve  to\r\n\r\nthemselves  the right to advise caution or perhaps  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  middle course, without entering the political\r\n\r\narena, then this advice should not be given in public,\r\n\r\nfor  it  is  impossible for any elected government  to\r\n\r\naccept  a  change  of its policies once  it  has  been\r\n\r\njoined  in political debate. We envisage this  Council\r\n\r\nof  State  to  be  more  than  just  a  scrutineer  of\r\n\r\nprospective  legislation, if it consists  of  men  who\r\n\r\nhave  had experience of our community - and there  are\r\n\r\nvery few such men. As my colleagues can testify, every\r\n\r\ntime  a  senior appointment has to be made,  which  in\r\n\r\nother parts of the world will bring forth long screeds\r\n\r\nof  highly  qualified and highly  able  men  in  semi-retirement, we are scraping the bottom of the  barrel,\r\n\r\nand  the  reason  is  obvious. All  the  men  in  high\r\n\r\nprofessional, administrative, judicial  or  any  other\r\n\r\npositions were from abroad, and when they retired they\r\n\r\nwent  abroad.  There were very few men who  understand\r\n\r\nthe  texture  and  the flavour of our society,  having\r\n\r\nlooked  after it in some important sphere of activity,\r\n\r\nwho  are  around  to  give us that knowledge  of  what\r\n\r\nhappened  under  certain  given  conditions,  of   the\r\n\r\npossible  reactions, modes of behaviour,  patterns  of\r\n\r\nconduct  of  the various sectors of our population.  A\r\n\r\nretired Permanent Secretary who does not have to speak\r\n\r\nhis mind in public, but can quietly tell the President\r\n\r\nin  his presence, or through the Chairman who will  be\r\n\r\nthe  Speaker of this House, what his experiences  were\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to similar circumstances,  will  make  a\r\n\r\nvaluable  contribution.  A  retired  Commissioner   of\r\n\r\nPolice  who had lived through several riots, not  just\r\n\r\nbetween  gangsters and warring bands of  robbers,  can\r\n\r\nmake  a  valuable addition to the data upon  which  an\r\n\r\nadministration must base its decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are unable to accept the recommendation that those\r\n\r\nwith political affiliations should be excluded, for  I\r\n\r\nthink\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is often those with political affiliations who can\r\n\r\nmake  the  biggest  contribution  to  discussion;   if\r\n\r\nnothing  else, from the folly and error of their  past\r\n\r\nways.  There is a lot to be learned, not just by  what\r\n\r\nwas  done right, but by what was done wrong. Again,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is more likely that we get honest advice  in\r\n\r\nprivate than in public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us to the second role which I think the\r\n\r\nCouncil of State can provide. It means, in effect,  if\r\n\r\nthere is a wise and sufficiently broad-enough range of\r\n\r\ntalent and expertise, that there is no single group  -\r\n\r\neither functional, racial, linguistic, or religious  -\r\n\r\nthat  has  not got some access to the top institutions\r\n\r\nof  power.  This, in itself, has a deep  psychological\r\n\r\nassurance.  It  acts  more  by  the  fears  it   makes\r\n\r\nunnecessary, than by any actual evil that is remedied.\r\n\r\nThe  very fact that there is almost no minority  group\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  that  can  say  that  they   are   not\r\n\r\nrepresented   by   someone  in   this   Constitutional Commission who understands some part of their life and practices  makes  its  findings  all  that  much  more valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to believe that such a group of men\r\n\r\nrepresenting accumulated experience, representing  the\r\n\r\nvarious  professional and technical  institutions  who\r\n\r\nare  important digits in the functioning of  a  modern\r\n\r\nsociety - they could provide the kind of ballast which\r\n\r\na  very young Legislature may not necessarily have. I would urge my Members opposite - all are really on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side  -  to  think  sometimes   of   these\r\n\r\ncriticisms which they take very sensitively as  really\r\n\r\nan expression of tribute in a back-handed way to them.\r\n\r\nIt  is all right provided there are certain checks and\r\n\r\nbalances  which modulate the whole and  so  everything\r\n\r\ncan  work.  But there must come a time when  the  same\r\n\r\nchecks and balances may no longer apply, and it is our\r\n\r\nduty   to  create  a  situation  where,  even   if   a\r\n\r\ncomposition of this Chamber were different, there  are\r\n\r\nstill  enough  checks  and  balances  to  ensure   the\r\n\r\ncontinuance of tolerant and permissive policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the drafting of the duties of the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  State, part of the functions which  might\r\n\r\nhave  been  done  by  an  Ombudsman  or  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommissioner will be taken up through this  particular\r\n\r\nCouncil of State. In rejecting for the time being  the\r\n\r\ninnovation of a Parliamentary Commissioner  -  let  me\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  have not written off this  proposition.\r\n\r\nLegislation  for  such an institution  has  just  been\r\n\r\nattempted  in Britain in a very limited sort  of  way.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no possibility of any member of the  public\r\n\r\nasking for a writ to be issued by the Commissioner for\r\n\r\na  matter  to be investigated. It is very limited  not\r\n\r\nonly in the initiative of the inquiry but also in  the\r\n\r\nfields  where the inquiries can take place.  If  after\r\n\r\nfive  years  it  is found that we have a  sufficiently\r\n\r\nhigh  degree of administration to be able to  take  on\r\n\r\nthe   added  burden  of  having  every  administrative\r\n\r\ndecision  scrutinised by some overlord, then  I  think\r\n\r\nthe position should be reviewed. It must be a position\r\n\r\nwhich  we  would  try to attain. But  faced  with  the\r\n\r\nrealities of what we have, and the knowledge that very\r\n\r\noften the whole machinery of government depends on the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  two  dozen really  good  digits  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration, to put upon them this load is bound to\r\n\r\nslow up the whole process of decision-making. If every\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Lands, every Housing Board  executive\r\n\r\nwho  allocates flats has at the back of his mind  when\r\n\r\nhe makes a decision the thought that the wisdom of his\r\n\r\ndecision  will  be called into question  and  all  the\r\n\r\nparaphernalia  -  secret minutes passed  between  each\r\n\r\nother of the whys and wherefores and who and what  for\r\n\r\n-  can  be  regurgitated, it  is  bound  to  make  him\r\n\r\nhesitate. \"I am refusing accommodation in the  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai block of flats to Malays who have just had their\r\n\r\nattap  huts burnt in Lorong 3.\" It is a decision  made\r\n\r\npartly  by  the  Board  and partly  by  an  unofficial\r\n\r\ncommittee  of M.P.s who feel that this creation  of  a\r\n\r\nghetto  atmosphere would be bad and inimical  for  our\r\n\r\nown  society. If every such decision can  be  reopened\r\n\r\nand it is said, \"You have refused me a flat in Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai, although I am a Malay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  that is a Malay area\" - then it is bound to  slow\r\n\r\nup the process of decision-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying this in wanting to protect or\r\n\r\nperpetuate  this  state of affairs. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that in the next 5 or 10 years more and  more\r\n\r\nable  administrators  will  be  trained  to  man   the\r\n\r\ninstitutions of the State. A position may  be  reached\r\n\r\none day when there is no decision taken anywhere along\r\n\r\nthe line which would be any different if they were  to\r\n\r\nsit  back  and think \"What would happen to my career.\"\r\n\r\nThere  is no desire to hide the political hand. I  say\r\n\r\nquite openly of what has happened in Geylang Serai and\r\n\r\nI am quite prepared to justify it politically, that it\r\n\r\nis  wrong. They should be offered cheaper rent and  be\r\n\r\nmade   to  live  in  Tanjong  Rhu  or  Queenstown   or\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  But if the officer who often has  to  take\r\n\r\nthis decision on broad policy directives, finds he may\r\n\r\nblot his copybook because somebody has complained, and\r\n\r\nhe  was  found to have exercised his judgment unwisely\r\n\r\nand  erroneously, it is bound to slow up the  process.\r\n\r\nHe  is bound in the nature of things to pass it up for\r\n\r\na  decision and ask for a directive, even on  specific\r\n\r\nissues.  Therefore, I would like to reiterate that  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  rejected this. We have only said,  \"Let  us\r\n\r\nwait  and see.\" First, how does it work in its limited\r\n\r\nform  elsewhere?  Second, in five  years  let  us  see\r\n\r\nwhether we have more able digits in our administration\r\n\r\nto  be  able to take on this stringent test of knowing\r\n\r\nthat every decision affecting every single citizen can\r\n\r\nbe reopened for scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission made several other recommendations\r\n\r\nwhich  were not strictly within the terms of reference\r\n\r\nof  the Commission, but since they have made them,  it\r\n\r\nis right and proper that I should express our views on\r\n\r\nthis.  First,  the question of the Judges.  They  have\r\n\r\nsuggested, in fact, that we revert back to the  system\r\n\r\nwhich  existed  - I think nowhere else  in  the  world\r\n\r\nother  than in Singapore before it went into Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThat  was a standstill arrangement and I knew  how  it\r\n\r\ncame about because I participated in the deliberations\r\n\r\nin London which reached that compromise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposal.  There was grave danger that whoever  became\r\n\r\nthe   government,  particularly   in   view   of   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  of all the Judges  then  and  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of vacancies to be filled, would then be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition   to  pack  the  judiciary.  After  strenuous\r\n\r\nargument, the points of views, depending upon who  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  form the next government, a compromise  was\r\n\r\nworked  out  whereby  we allowed  the  Judges  amongst\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  decide  how  these  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nvacancies were to be filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that system has been perpetuated in any\r\n\r\nconstitution    anywhere   else   in    the    British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth. It would be not only derogatory  of  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  the Government to do what is  right  and\r\n\r\nproper, but even more important, there would be a very\r\n\r\nserious  risk of a very inbred judiciary.  People  are\r\n\r\nwhat  they are, Mr Speaker, Sir. They have their good\r\n\r\npoints; they have their bad points. But we should  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  small group of about six or seven  Judges  to\r\n\r\ndecide who is to join their ranks from people for whom\r\n\r\nthey  must  have  positive  reactions,  either  likes,\r\n\r\ndislikes,  admiration, annoyance. It is a  very  small\r\n\r\ngroup  from which you can appoint Judges. 170  or  200\r\n\r\npractising members of whom only about 30 or 40 both in\r\n\r\nand  outside  private practice and in and outside  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are possible candidates.  It  will  be  an\r\n\r\nunfair  test of human infallibility to endow  a  small\r\n\r\ngroup  of men with these powers. Having run this  very\r\n\r\nCatholic  system of the cadres - you  know,  the  Pope\r\n\r\nappoints the Cardinals, the Cardinals together appoint\r\n\r\nthe  Pope - we are fully aware not only of the virtues\r\n\r\nbut also the vices of the system. I think it would not\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  wider interests of the administration  of\r\n\r\njustice  or in the public interest. I can only express\r\n\r\nthe  hope that faith in the judicial system will never\r\n\r\nbe  diminished, and I am sure it will not, so long  as\r\n\r\nwe allow a review of the judicial processes that takes\r\n\r\nplace  here  in  some other tribunal  where  obviously\r\n\r\nundue influence cannot be brought to bear. As long  as\r\n\r\ngovernments are wise enough to leave alone the  rights\r\n\r\nof  appeal  to  some superior body outside  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen there must be a higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndegree  of confidence in the integrity of our judicial\r\n\r\nprocess.  This  is  most  important  because  so  many\r\n\r\ncontracts of a maritime nature with parties from  many\r\n\r\nparts of the world being involved often have to choose\r\n\r\nthe  venue of the litigation. I see no credit  in  our\r\n\r\ntrying  to run a close circuit judicial system on  our\r\n\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposition concerns that of property\r\n\r\nrights.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  here  again  it  is  not\r\n\r\nstrictly  relevant to the terms of  reference.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  was a result of the lawyers' English  legal\r\n\r\ntraining  -  the sanctity of property is  one  of  the\r\n\r\ntenets  of  English  laws. The whole  of  the  British\r\n\r\njudicial  system outside the criminal law  rests  upon\r\n\r\nthe  concept of private property. Sir, whether we like\r\n\r\nit or not, we have to accept the fact that not only  a\r\n\r\nlarge  portion  of  all  this thinking  but  also  the\r\n\r\nmechanics  of our economy is based on the  concept  of\r\n\r\nproperty.   But  land  is  a  special   situation   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If  we  are  swayed by  considerations  of\r\n\r\nprivate  property, had we been swayed in the  past  by\r\n\r\nthese  considerations,  I  venture  to  suggest   that\r\n\r\nrepresentative government in Singapore today would not\r\n\r\nhave  been possible. In this Chamber in 1961 we rushed\r\n\r\nthrough  the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act for  the\r\n\r\nacquisition  of  fire sites; the Bukit  Ho  Swee  fire\r\n\r\nhaving  just taken place and some 30,000 people having\r\n\r\nhad   their  homes  destroyed.  It  would  have   been\r\n\r\nuneconomic and impossible to develop if we have had to\r\n\r\nacquire  the property under the ordinary machinery  of\r\n\r\nthe  Land Acquisition Ordinance with a right of appeal\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of every award contested, to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt,  with  two assessors who are both  trained  and\r\n\r\naccept  as part of their ethos the right and  sanctity\r\n\r\nof   private  property.  This  becomes  all  the  more\r\n\r\ncompelling when vast sums of public revenue  is  being\r\n\r\nspent on developing huge areas like Jurong, Toa Payoh,\r\n\r\nBedok. The whole of the Bedok reclamation scheme, from\r\n\r\nBedok  right  up to Tanjong Rhu, would not  have  been\r\n\r\npossible  if the concept of private property  and  all\r\n\r\nthe  rules  and regulations that have been  elaborated\r\n\r\nover hundreds of years were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplied with, for it must mean that if you deprive  a\r\n\r\nman of a sea frontage, some assessment of his loss  in\r\n\r\nmonetary  terms must be made. A man wakes up  and  has\r\n\r\nawakened  for the last 50 years with the  sea  breezes\r\n\r\nblowing  in  through the window.  He  goes  off  on  a\r\n\r\nholiday, comes back from Europe and America and  wakes\r\n\r\nup  one morning - assuming he arrives late at night at\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar Airport - opens his windows and finds half\r\n\r\na  mile  of  rolling brown laterite. We hope  in  five\r\n\r\nyears  there  will be grass lands, playing  fields,  a\r\n\r\nmotor  express highway into the city. The compensation\r\n\r\nthat  would have to be paid that man for the  loss  of\r\n\r\nhis foreshore amenities - the foreshore belongs to the\r\n\r\nGovernment in any case - but the loss of the amenities\r\n\r\nthat  goes  with the piece of land - would  have  been\r\n\r\nprohibitive. It is not possible to develop  it.  These\r\n\r\ndevelopments  having taken place  and  a  new  express\r\n\r\nhighway  at enormous public cost having been  put  in,\r\n\r\nall  the land and all the surrounding areas which  are\r\n\r\nfed  by  this  highway must go up in price  inevitably\r\n\r\nbecause  the city centre becomes that much closer.  It\r\n\r\nis  unconscionable  for us as a  Government  to  spend\r\n\r\nthese vast sums of public revenue and in the end allow\r\n\r\na  very  small percentage of the population to profit.\r\n\r\nNobody  expects  this  Government  or  any  subsequent\r\n\r\ngovernment  to expropriate. The question is,  what  is\r\n\r\njust  compensation? And to accept the  formula  as  it\r\n\r\nstands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No law shall provide for the compulsory acquisition\r\n\r\nor  use of property except for a public purpose  or  a\r\n\r\npurpose useful or beneficial to the public and  except\r\n\r\nupon just terms.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>must  mean endless litigation. This Chamber would then\r\n\r\nbe  unable to say that where your property has gone up\r\n\r\nin   value   on  account  of  public  expenditure   on\r\n\r\ndevelopment  around it, you will not profit  from  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we propose to adopt the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nIndian  Constitution, which I think is most democratic\r\n\r\nand  sound,  and say, in effect, that the  legislative\r\n\r\nchamber  shall decide the principles upon  which  such\r\n\r\ncompensation shall be paid. The principle will be  one\r\n\r\non which we have acted so constantly in the past, that\r\n\r\nnobody\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill gain, nobody will get a windfall on account\r\n\r\nof  public expenditure. A fire has just taken place  a\r\n\r\nfew  days  ago  in,  I think, Syed Alwi  Road.  A  few\r\n\r\nhundred people have been displaced. We had to  make  a\r\n\r\ndecision  a  few  hours ago that the  place  shall  be\r\n\r\nacquired.  For we have, as a Government, to carry  the\r\n\r\nburden  of  rehabilitating these few  hundred  people.\r\n\r\nThis is a social burden, and for us to leave this land\r\n\r\nvacant  to  the landowner is to give him a  fortuitous\r\n\r\ngain  which he cannot expect unless he is prepared  to\r\n\r\ncommit arson. I am quite sure that the crime of  arson\r\n\r\nhas been at an all-time low, partly because landowners\r\n\r\nhave a vested interest in not having arson take place.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  long run, Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand our problem in some perspective. There  are\r\n\r\ntwo  particular recommendations which I think show the\r\n\r\nsigns  of  wishful  thinking. Apart from  wanting  the\r\n\r\nJudges  to  appoint  themselves, they  also  want  the\r\n\r\nPresident in his discretion to appoint the Council  of\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President is what he is and is accepted by all\r\n\r\ngroups  because  he does not have to  make  unpleasant\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  who  shall get what and  who  shall  be\r\n\r\ndenied. If there is one piece of cake and it is  given\r\n\r\nto  two persons when five want it, then three must  in\r\n\r\nthe nature of things be unhappy at not having been the\r\n\r\nrecipients.  If  you have, by way of illustration,  to\r\n\r\nchoose a representative to this Council of State from,\r\n\r\nsay,  a  galaxy of five able exponents of the  art  of\r\n\r\naccounting and you only really need one to ensure that\r\n\r\nthat  particular profession is adequately represented,\r\n\r\nand  the committee had met and short-listed the  five,\r\n\r\nfour  must  necessarily be disappointed. I  think  the\r\n\r\npolitical  participants are much  better  equipped  to\r\n\r\ncarry these unpleasant decisions than a constitutional\r\n\r\nHead of State. What it means is that you cannot by the\r\n\r\nConstitution  protect yourself against a  bad  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment. There can be no such protection. Your only\r\n\r\nprotection   in  the  long  run  must  be   a   highly\r\n\r\nsophisticated and educated electorate which  will  see\r\n\r\nthat  no bad government, bad in the sense that  it  is\r\n\r\nunable  to  tend  to the needs of the community,  will\r\n\r\never be allowed to take office constitutionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

If the things an elected leader  does  are\r\n\r\nthe  things  which the people who support  him  hanker\r\n\r\nsecretly  to  do, if only they were given the  chance,\r\n\r\nthen  every disclosure of every such fulfilment  of  a\r\n\r\nsecret  ambition must raise him in the  estimation  of\r\n\r\nhis  followers.  I  think  we  discovered  that  in  a\r\n\r\nslightly  different sort of way in our  own  political\r\n\r\nexperience  in  Singapore and elsewhere in  South-east\r\n\r\nAsia. We go back to the fundamental problem of one man\r\n\r\none  vote.  Is that one man sufficiently possessed  of\r\n\r\nenough  sense to make the right decision for  his  own\r\n\r\ninterest?  In other words, is he able to identify  and\r\n\r\ndiscern   where  his  personal  and  his   community's\r\n\r\ninterests lie? Hence the importance again of  teaching\r\n\r\nvalues  and  educating our children in  attitudes  and\r\n\r\nstandards  of  conduct,  community  reactions,   group\r\n\r\nreactions  in  order to ensure their  continued  well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end on this note, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nNobody  really  fears  any  racial  or  religious   or\r\n\r\nlinguistic  persecution or suppression  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat least for a decade. For these things take some time\r\n\r\nto wear off. Even assuming a major catastrophe were to\r\n\r\ntake place with the political structure of power here,\r\n\r\nit  would still take some time for emotional attitudes\r\n\r\non  the  ground  to be soured up and  to  change.  Our\r\n\r\nproblem  really is how do we, within the  ten  perhaps\r\n\r\nslightly more, perhaps less years at our disposal, (1)\r\n\r\ninstitutionalise  these checks and balances;  and  (2)\r\n\r\nensure that the next generation is able to carry  this\r\n\r\nprocess  one step further'? If 10 years from  now,  in\r\n\r\nthe late 1970, a new group of leaders have emerged and\r\n\r\nwe  are  still making pious exhortations to  religious\r\n\r\ntolerance  and the virtues of a multi-racial  society,\r\n\r\njust  paying  lip-service to it, then we have  failed.\r\n\r\nFor  once  the  controlling  hand  of  authority  that\r\n\r\nbelieves  in  these things is weakened, then  all  the\r\n\r\nextremist tendencies which have been inhibited  whilst\r\n\r\nthere  was a strong hand will again come to the  fore.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what happens in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nNobody attempts to deny the fact that there are  these\r\n\r\nextremist  potentials.  They were  there.  In  Ceylon,\r\n\r\nbefore  Mr  Bandaranaike became Prime Minister,  they\r\n\r\nwere  there.  In India, before the present  government\r\n\r\nfaced  this awkward and difficult problem of the  holy\r\n\r\nmen  and the cows as an election issue. The difference\r\n\r\nwas  that the grip at the helm was not so strong.  Our\r\n\r\nproblem  is  how to institutionalise and to perpetuate\r\n\r\nthis  strong  hand at the helm. It is not possible  to\r\n\r\nreduplicate ourselves in the next generation.  But  it\r\n\r\nis possible to deepen and ingrain certain values until\r\n\r\nthey become instinctive reflexes of our people. And it\r\n\r\nis  the  consolidation of these  values  in  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration which must occupy a large part of our time.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  minority no longer is conscious of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a minority, that is the final  state  of\r\n\r\nsuccess. When a man walks into a job or walks into  an\r\n\r\noffice,  he is cheered or abused and he does not  feel\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  received  an ovation  or  been  rebuked\r\n\r\nbecause  of his ethnic qualities. A group of cleansing\r\n\r\nworkers  went  on strike and they had to  be  punished\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  were  acting foolishly. Because the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe leaders were Indians, it was possible for them  to\r\n\r\ngo back to the ground and cover up the misdeeds of the\r\n\r\nleaders  by saying, \"Oh, what can you expect? This  is\r\n\r\nan  awful  government because it really does not  have\r\n\r\nmuch  time for Indians.\" So you see we are in  such  a\r\n\r\nmess as long as that situation prevails and people can\r\n\r\nbe  deluded into believing, as indeed for all I  know,\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers of cleansing workers may believe,  that\r\n\r\ntheir  poor  leaders lost because they  were  Indians.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  my task might have been easier if,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe first group of unionists had challenged the policy\r\n\r\nthat  the  economy  of  Singapore  is  paramount   and\r\n\r\nsectional  interests come second. It would  have  been\r\n\r\nbetter  if there had been a group of majority  Chinese\r\n\r\nleadership  to  put it to the test.  Then  the  lesson\r\n\r\nwould  have been learnt. But to be able to admit these\r\n\r\nthings  openly  and to face them, is a much  healthier\r\n\r\nsituation than to pretend that they do not exist,  and\r\n\r\nto  refer  to  anybody raising these  issues  or  even\r\n\r\nmentioning these issues as dangerous communalists.  We\r\n\r\nface  them, Mr Speaker, because they do happen.  They\r\n\r\ndo,  in  fact,  take  place and people  do,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nbelieve  them.  I  can only say this,  that  if  these\r\n\r\nthings  are  true, then this must be  a  very  strange\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in fact, the policy of this Government is based\r\n\r\non considerations of race or language or culture, then\r\n\r\nit is impossible to have in certain key positions, key\r\n\r\ninstitutions of the State, people who share other than\r\n\r\nthe  majority view because the policy and the  secrets\r\n\r\nof  the  implementation of that policy must be  known.\r\n\r\nThere  are certain institutions of power in the State,\r\n\r\nand it is impossible completely to seal off or isolate\r\n\r\nor  prevent  knowledge  of policies  which  are  being\r\n\r\npursued  and the known raison d'etre of these policies\r\n\r\nfrom  the  President. He gets a copy of every  Cabinet\r\n\r\nagenda,  the  papers, the decisions  and  the  reasons\r\n\r\ntherefor. In the Cabinet itself are ten people of very\r\n\r\ndifferent  views on ordinary matters or  non-political\r\n\r\ninterests. It is impossible to make decisions inimical\r\n\r\nto any single minority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup without their being known to the persons who  do\r\n\r\nnot  share the majority view or the majority affinity.\r\n\r\nThere  is a Chief Justice with six Judges who have  to\r\n\r\nexecute   and   implement   the   administration   and\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the laws. I do not  think  anybody\r\n\r\ncan, by any stretch of the imagination, say that there\r\n\r\nis  any  ethnic group there which intends to  dominate\r\n\r\nthe  situation, although by the very nature  of  their\r\n\r\neducation,  quite  a number of our Judges  are  people\r\n\r\nwith  the  qualities  for  bisecting,  disecting   and\r\n\r\ntrisecting  words  and  phrases.  Then  there  is  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker   who   presides  over  so  many   pieces   of\r\n\r\nlegislation and there is the Attorney-General  in  his\r\n\r\nChambers  who  has  to  draft  them.  There   is   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police who has to implement the  laws.\r\n\r\nThere  are key officials in the Ministries of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  and Finance who must know the basic policies.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  want to do is to try to establish, until  we\r\n\r\nreach  the point where we accept each other, the point\r\n\r\nwhere  we are not conscious of the fact that  you  are\r\n\r\ndifferent, certain conventions whereby we ensure  that\r\n\r\neverybody, no matter whether he be of a majority or  a\r\n\r\nminority group, feels that he has some access  to  his\r\n\r\nown  little community, some access to someone  in  the\r\n\r\nseat of power where decisions have to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real contribution which can be made by a\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  State.  It  is not something  which  will\r\n\r\nwindow-dress  the  legislation  of  this  Chamber.  To\r\n\r\nsucceed  it  must be a real means of consultation  and\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  the mechanics of  management  of  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  by  itself. So long as  there  are  certain\r\n\r\nconventions  practised whereby there is always  enough\r\n\r\nmajority  and minority representation in the  exercise\r\n\r\nof these positions of power, we should be able to ride\r\n\r\nthe  transition to a more consolidated and to  a  more\r\n\r\nsecure position in the next 10 or 15 years. But in the\r\n\r\nlong  term, let us be honest enough and admit that  if\r\n\r\neither  because our policies are not effective  enough\r\n\r\ninternally  to  generate  and inculcate  these  multi-racial values, or because external forces have  had  a\r\n\r\ndeleterious  effect  on our own  community,  then  new\r\n\r\nforms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be  found to keep  this  very  diverse\r\n\r\ncommunity together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, in urging the House to endorse the\r\n\r\nMotion  in the name of the Minister for Law,  to  urge\r\n\r\nour representatives here to bring this message down to\r\n\r\nthe people in the kampongs, in the crowded streets  of\r\n\r\nthe  town,  community centres or in  the  consultative\r\n\r\ncommittees,  that whilst we operate on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nexhortation,  tolerance,  understanding,  forbearance,\r\n\r\nand whilst we keep these sometimes competing interests\r\n\r\nrelatively  accommodated  one  to  the  other  through\r\n\r\nconstant  consultation at all the levels of  decision-making,  eventually  there is no way  other  than  the\r\n\r\ninculcation  of loyalty to the country  which  we  all\r\n\r\nconsider our home. Either we believe that what we have\r\n\r\ninherited  after 150 years of British commercialism  -\r\n\r\nvery  successful commercialism -- is worth  preserving\r\n\r\nin  some  of  its  forms, or we do  not.  The  British\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  holding this because they had  superior\r\n\r\npower.  Anybody  who  acted contrary  to  the  general\r\n\r\ninterests of somebody else other than the British  was\r\n\r\nheld in line. And if you acted against the interest of\r\n\r\nthe British, then you would he smartly dealt with. But\r\n\r\nhere   is  a  situation  where  the  Government   must\r\n\r\nremember,  as any such elected government  must,  that\r\n\r\nits capacity to deal with a particular problem depends\r\n\r\nupon  its capacity to carry its majority with it. This\r\n\r\nis  a  slightly different kind of power  structure.  A\r\n\r\nGovernor can order that a highly popular mass movement\r\n\r\nhe  destroyed  and its leaders incarcerated,  and  his\r\n\r\ncareer prospects are brightened by the expeditious way\r\n\r\nin which he dealt with the dangerous situation. But  a\r\n\r\npopularly  elected Cabinet that deals with a situation\r\n\r\nin such a way that it has alienated the following, the\r\n\r\nsympathy  and the support of the majority on whom  its\r\n\r\npower rests, must either he a very bold or a foolhardy\r\n\r\ngovernment. And so the process of constant  repetition\r\n\r\non  the ground of where their long-term interests lie,\r\n\r\nwhy  a  multi-racial  society.  This  process  may  he\r\n\r\nunnecessary  for those who are capable of doing  their\r\n\r\nown  thinking, but is very necessary for  those  whose\r\n\r\ninstincts  are to do what comes most comfortably.  And\r\n\r\nto give way to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  things  which the ground wants us  to  do,  often\r\n\r\nfoolishly, will be disastrous. Not to give way without\r\n\r\neducating them may be equally disastrous to us. And so\r\n\r\nthe  fearful responsibility in this decade  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  next generation will not be faced with  the\r\n\r\nsame  arduous task that confronts us at every  turn  -\r\n\r\nthe  constant explanation and persuasion - because  of\r\n\r\nwhich  alone  we  are able to do what  we  do;  sane,,\r\n\r\neffective and sensible policies, and with the  support\r\n\r\nof the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge Members to remember this. Never mind all\r\n\r\nthe jibes about one-party government and dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThey  are not just necessarily jibes because they  can\r\n\r\nbe very real probabilities if we allow ourselves to be\r\n\r\nlulled  into  a sense of complacency and  assume  that\r\n\r\nthis  could be the order of things for all  time.  But\r\n\r\nthe very fact that we are able consistently to carry a\r\n\r\nlarge  section of the population with us despite  this\r\n\r\ncriticism,   surely  is  the  answer  that  democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment is possible provided at each step you carry\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of the people with you. It  is  not  by\r\n\r\naccident  that  we  introduced  the  National  Service\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill at the time a by-election  was  about\r\n\r\nto take place. We gave the Opposition an issue to join\r\n\r\nissue with us - certain basic fundamental premises. It\r\n\r\nwas  an  issue which barely 15 years ago caused little\r\n\r\nyoung  boys and girls to riot. The police had then  to\r\n\r\nuse   considerable  force  with  a   great   deal   of\r\n\r\nunhappiness  all round. A colonial government  had  no\r\n\r\nintention  whatsoever other than to pass  the  law  to\r\n\r\nteach  the  boys  and  girls,  particularly  from  the\r\n\r\nChinese  schools, how to handle weapons  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmake  life more miserable for that government  and  it\r\n\r\nbrought  about  that conflict. But now  a  by-election\r\n\r\ntook place, and this was not an issue. So long as  the\r\n\r\nbase  of our authority is one man one vote, it is  not\r\n\r\npossible to go against the grain of the whole of  your\r\n\r\ncommunity   in  policies  which  do  not   win   their\r\n\r\nacceptance.  As long as we remember this  and  we  are\r\n\r\ncourageous enough not only to do the right thing which\r\n\r\nis  acceptable, but to do the right thing which is not\r\n\r\nacceptable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust yet, but to make sure that  the  ground\r\n\r\nbegins  to understand us when we take the next  phase,\r\n\r\nthen   we  will  be  able  to  bequeath  to  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration   of  leaders  a  healthier   and   sounder\r\n\r\nsituation.

This aspect  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  pointed  out in the Report of the Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission.  It  has  recommended  that   no   special\r\n\r\nprivilege  should be accorded to any group  of  people\r\n\r\nand  that  equal rights and basic rights, irrespective\r\n\r\nof  race, colour or creed, should be written into  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  All people will have  the  same  rights\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution. For  instance,  everyone  is\r\n\r\nequal  in  the  eyes of the law. There will  be  basic\r\n\r\nrights  of  equality, rights of personal  liberty  and\r\n\r\nequal  protection and other rights. Thus the  interest\r\n\r\nand  rights of the minorities will be safeguarded.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  right of education and  other  matters\r\n\r\nwill be safeguarded, as a result of which the minority\r\n\r\nraces will feel that they are not minorities but  part\r\n\r\nand  parcel of one whole community. When we reach such\r\n\r\na  state - as the Prime Minister has said just  now  -\r\n\r\nthen  our  country  can be said to have  achieved  its\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, democracy and the independence of the judiciary\r\n\r\nare  the  outstanding  features  of  the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  these  should  be  reflected  in  all\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  independent institutions.  This  will\r\n\r\ninstil a sense of confidence in the people and it will\r\n\r\nalso  make them more determined to advocate democracy.\r\n\r\nIf they lose heart in the democratic system, they will\r\n\r\nreact unfavourably against the Government and this may\r\n\r\nlead to the collapse of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional Commission has also advanced\r\n\r\nconstructive recommendations such as those relating to\r\n\r\nprovisions which will ensure the Constitution  as  the\r\n\r\nsupreme  law  in  the Republic of Singapore,  and  any\r\n\r\nother  law which contradicts the Constitution will  be\r\n\r\ninvalid.  There  is also a provision relating  to  the\r\n\r\nsafeguards  to  be entrenched in the  Constitution  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   the  Constitution,  as   the   highest\r\n\r\nauthority,  is  not  altered at  random.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nrecommendation   setting   out   three   methods    of\r\n\r\nentrenchment  by which amendments to the  Constitution\r\n\r\ncan be effected. The first method is that any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill   seeking   to  alter  the  Constitution   should\r\n\r\nspecifically  state so in the Bill. The second  method\r\n\r\nis  that the Bill altering the Constitution should  be\r\n\r\napproved  by a two-thirds majority of the  House.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has already accepted this second method  of\r\n\r\nentrenchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\nIs there a quorum in the House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This   is\r\n\r\ncharacteristic  of  a democratic system.  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  also to accept the recommendation  of  the\r\n\r\nthird  method in the light of the reasons set  out  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 78 of the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three new provisions recommended by the\r\n\r\nCommission.  One is that the electorate  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  be  given the opportunity to elect  their  own\r\n\r\ngovernment  by secret ballot periodically. The  serial\r\n\r\nnumbers  appearing  on  the ballot  papers  and  their\r\n\r\ncounter-foils and the law which relates to the form of\r\n\r\nand  writing  on  the ballot paper, in  my  view,  are\r\n\r\nincompatible  with the secrecy of the  vote.  So  such\r\n\r\nlegal  provisions  should be  abolished  so  that  the\r\n\r\nelectorate will not harbour any suspicion  or  have  a\r\n\r\nwrong concept about the secrecy of the vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me touch on one very\r\n\r\noutstanding recommendation of the Commission,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of an Ombudsman. He is to shoulder the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   of   checking   the    Government's\r\n\r\nadministration and to safeguard the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  to  see that their interests will not  suffer\r\n\r\nbecause  of  any  faulty administration.  Though  this\r\n\r\nsystem  originated  in Sweden,  it  is  still  in  its\r\n\r\nexperimental stage in some Commonwealth countries,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nI feel that the Government should set up such a system\r\n\r\nbecause   it   will  raise  the  efficiency   of   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of various Government departments  and\r\n\r\nwill also safeguard the interests of the common people\r\n\r\nso  that such people need not have to seek redress  at\r\n\r\nthe  courts,  which is very expensive. At present  our\r\n\r\ncivil  service is a heritage of the British system.  I\r\n\r\nam not criticising our present civil service. However,\r\n\r\nin  actual fact, there are certain officials who still\r\n\r\nhave  the  colonial attitude and have still  not  been\r\n\r\ninculcated with the new sense of duties and values and\r\n\r\nthe   correct  attitude  in  keeping  with   our   new\r\n\r\nindependent country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, if members of the public have any\r\n\r\ncomplaints,   they  can  make  them  to  the   Central\r\n\r\nComplaints Bureau. But this Bureau does not have  wide\r\n\r\npowers.  Therefore,  if  any  complaint  against   any\r\n\r\ndepartment is brought before it, it is normally handed\r\n\r\nover to the head of that very department to deal with.\r\n\r\nThus,  in the end, the complaints of the common people\r\n\r\nwill lead to no solution, and are of no avail. For all\r\n\r\nthese  reasons I feel that it is necessary to  set  up\r\n\r\nthe office of Ombudsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in principle, I support the\r\n\r\nGovernment's views on this Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Commission was appointed  in  December\r\n\r\n1965  with terms of reference the aim of which was  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  rights and interests of minorities  in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic  of Singapore. After some eight  months'\r\n\r\nstudy,  the  Commission presented its  Report  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident  in August 1966, and this Report was  tabled\r\n\r\nbefore Parliament on 21st December, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report is a unanimous Report. In it the\r\n\r\nCommission  makes  three main recommendations,  and  I\r\n\r\nshall today concern myself mainly with them. They  are\r\n\r\n(1)  the  creation  of a Council  of  State;  (2)  the\r\n\r\nestablishment   of   the  office  of   Ombudsman   (or\r\n\r\nParliamentary Commissioner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   Administration);   and    (3)    the\r\n\r\nentrenchment in the Constitution of certain provisions\r\n\r\naffecting the fundamental rights of the citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall take the last recommendation first. This\r\n\r\nrelates  to  the  manner  of entrenchment  of  certain\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Constitution. The  Commission  has\r\n\r\nrecommended three methods of entrenchment,  and  these\r\n\r\nthree methods are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That any Bill altering the Constitution shall not\r\n\r\nbe  passed by Parliament until it is expressed  to  be\r\n\r\none for amendment of the Constitution and contains  no\r\n\r\nother provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That any Bill altering certain provisions of the\r\n\r\nConstitution shall not be passed by Parliament  unless\r\n\r\nsupported by a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That any alteration to certain fundamental\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Constitution, notably those relating\r\n\r\nto the right to elect the Government by secret ballot,\r\n\r\nshall not be passed unless by a two-thirds majority of\r\n\r\nall  elected Members of Parliament and by a two-thirds\r\n\r\nmajority  of all the people qualified to vote  at  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three methods recommended, the Government has\r\n\r\naccepted the second method of entrenchment. No reasons\r\n\r\nwere given by the Government for the rejection of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  and  third  methods of  entrenchment.  All  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Constitution  recommended  to  he\r\n\r\nentrenched   by  the  Commission  will  be  entrenched\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  second  method  -  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nStatement  of  the  21st December,  1966.  The  second\r\n\r\nmethod is legally effective and any provisions when so\r\n\r\nentrenched  will  not be alterable except  by  a  two-thirds majority vote in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first method recommended by the Commission is not\r\n\r\neffective.  Its only function is to draw attention  to\r\n\r\nany   Bill  seeking  to  alter  the  Constitution   by\r\n\r\nlabelling it as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third method is, in fact, the most effective\r\n\r\nmethod of entrenchment. Any provision entrenched under\r\n\r\nthis    method    is    almost    irremovable.    This\r\n\r\nirremovability, however, applies only to those who are\r\n\r\nprepared to observe the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Constitution. It would not  prevent\r\n\r\nthose who are not prepared to operate the Constitution\r\n\r\nwithin  the  democratic framework, from  resorting  to\r\n\r\nextra-constitutional   means   and    scrapping    the\r\n\r\nConstitution altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the first recommendation of the\r\n\r\nCommission?  That  is the creation  of  a  non-elected\r\n\r\nadvisory  body to be called the Council of State.  The\r\n\r\nCommission gave three reasons for this recommendation.\r\n\r\nThese reasons are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To focus the attention of the public on any\r\n\r\nmatters   originating   from  Parliament   which   may\r\n\r\nadversely affect the interests of any minority group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To serve as an additional check on new\r\n\r\nlegislation, and this would be particularly useful  on\r\n\r\nmatters  of  great public importance  and  on  matters\r\n\r\nwhich might affect the minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To put forward, where it considers necessary in\r\n\r\nthe  public interest to do so, constructive and  well-informed  criticisms or amendment of measures proposed\r\n\r\nin Parliament especially where there is no responsible\r\n\r\nor effective Opposition in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted, in principle, the\r\n\r\ncreation of this body, but it does not agree with  the\r\n\r\nCommission on the suggested composition and  functions\r\n\r\nof  the  Council. Further, the Government has rejected\r\n\r\nthe  Commission's recommendation that debates  in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil should be in public. The Government is of  the\r\n\r\nview  that the Council's sittings should, instead, be\r\n\r\nin  private  and the reason for this is - I  quote  the\r\n\r\nMinister  (Vol. 25, No. 14 of Hansard, 21st  December,\r\n\r\n1966, col. 1055) - the reason is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to ensure that discussions taking place are frank\r\n\r\nand constructive and not held with an eye on the Press\r\n\r\nor  publicity  or with a view to scoring  a  political\r\n\r\npoint.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   first   point  I  want  to  make   about   this\r\n\r\nrecommendation for the creation of a Council of  State\r\n\r\nis  that it is not legally effective in protecting the\r\n\r\nminority rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale of this recommendation is that the\r\n\r\nCouncil  should be able in its debates  to  focus  the\r\n\r\nattention of the public on any matter originating from\r\n\r\nParliament which may adversely affect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the minority group. The  reason  for\r\n\r\nthis  is  found  in  paragraph 16 of  the  Report.  By\r\n\r\nrejecting  the  suggestion that the Council's  debates\r\n\r\nshould be in public, the Government has taken away the\r\n\r\nvery basis for the creation of such a body. The second\r\n\r\nand  third reasons advanced by the Commission  in  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of the Council of State are, in my  opinion,\r\n\r\nwrong   reasons.   The  second   reason   is   against\r\n\r\nestablished democratic principles. The third reason is\r\n\r\nbased  on  factors  that  can only  be  considered  as\r\n\r\ntransient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the third reason first. This is that we\r\n\r\nhave at present no responsible or effective Opposition\r\n\r\nin  Parliament.  It is true that we have  not  had  an\r\n\r\nOpposition for the last year and a half. But in  terms\r\n\r\nof  a nation's constitutional development, a period of\r\n\r\na  year  and  a  half,  nay, 15  years,  can  only  be\r\n\r\nconsidered as a transient phase. This is, therefore, a\r\n\r\ntransient phase in our political development.  Yet  it\r\n\r\nis  on  this  very transient phase of our  development\r\n\r\nthat the Commission has now made recommendations which\r\n\r\nwill have lasting effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next general elections are just round the corner.\r\n\r\nThey  must  he  held by September  1968.  No  one  can\r\n\r\npredict  what will be the position after  the  general\r\n\r\nelections. Are we to abolish the Council of  State  on\r\n\r\nan Opposition Party being returned to Parliament then?\r\n\r\nOr  are  we to leave it to carry on with the functions\r\n\r\nnow  prescribed  for  it  by the  Commission,  thereby\r\n\r\nusurping  the  functions of the Opposition?  The  very\r\n\r\nprocess of the Council discharging any function  which\r\n\r\nshould  be  within  the  exclusive  province   of   an\r\n\r\nOpposition   in  Parliament  renders  the   Opposition\r\n\r\nineffective;  the  very  thing  which  the  Commission\r\n\r\nassiduously seeks to overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason prescribed by the Commission for\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of  the Council  of  State  is,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  against  established democratic  principles.\r\n\r\nThe  Commission envisages that the Council  should  be\r\n\r\nable  -  and  I  quote  this from  paragraph  16,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to serve as an additional check on new legislation\r\n\r\nand this would be particularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuseful  on matters of great public importance  and  on\r\n\r\nmatters which might affect the minorities.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  it  is  the  basic  principle  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy   that   Parliament   should   be   supreme.\r\n\r\nParliament, it is said, can do anything except  change\r\n\r\na man into a woman and a woman into a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, I think this is a very\r\n\r\nconvenient point at which to suspend the sitting.

I  will\r\n\r\nsuspend the sitting now and resume the Chair at  half-past Five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>4.44 p.m, until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just before the\r\n\r\nsuspension, I was saying that it is a basic  principle\r\n\r\nof  parliamentary democracy that Parliament should  be\r\n\r\nsupreme  and  that  Parliament, it  is  said,  can  do\r\n\r\nanything except change a man into a woman and a  woman\r\n\r\ninto  a  man.  So  it  ought  to  be.  Parliament   is\r\n\r\nresponsible  to  none but the electorate.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nalways  sensitive to public opinion, the influence  of\r\n\r\npublic  opinion  being exercised through  the  elected\r\n\r\nMembers   of  Parliament.  Any  check  on  Parliament,\r\n\r\ntherefore, should come from within Parliament and  not\r\n\r\nfrom  outside  it. In proposing the setting  up  of  a\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  State outside the framework of Parliament\r\n\r\nto  check  on  any legislation proposed in Parliament,\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  is  recommending something  which  is\r\n\r\nagainst   the   basic   principle   of   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy. If it is said that the proposed Council  is\r\n\r\nonly  an  advisory body and is not meant to be legally\r\n\r\neffective in checking the will of Parliament, then the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  the  Commission  becomes  a   huge\r\n\r\nacademic  exercise  from  which  nobody  benefits.  In\r\n\r\nshort,   this   particular   recommendation   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nlegally  effective  in  safeguarding  the  rights  and\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  citizens. The  acceptance  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the principle of creating such  a  body,\r\n\r\nin  my  opinion, is a mistake, a mistake  which  would\r\n\r\ninvolve  the  spending of a tremendous amount  of  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  money  without any  resultant  benefit  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now say a few words on the composition of the\r\n\r\nCouncil    of    State?    The   qualifications    and\r\n\r\ndisqualifications  for  membership  are  set  out   in\r\n\r\nparagraph 59 of the Report. I want to comment only  on\r\n\r\nparagraph  59, sub-paragraph (v) , item (a) . This  sub-paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(v) the disqualifications for membership shall be -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) membership of any political party at the time\r\n\r\nof appointment;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  disqualification  will  discourage  people  from\r\n\r\njoining  political parties and will act as a brake  on\r\n\r\nthe  recruitment  of  talent into  political  parties.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament are at our  present  political\r\n\r\ndevelopment  necessarily members of political  parties\r\n\r\nand  the  calibre of Members of Parliament depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  talent on which political parties can draw.  This\r\n\r\ndisqualification  will  put  a  dead   hand   on   the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  persons  and  will  not  improve  the\r\n\r\ncalibre  of  Members  of Parliament  about  which  the\r\n\r\nCommission  seems  to complain. The Government's  idea\r\n\r\nabout  permanent membership, too, appears not to  have\r\n\r\nbeen well thought out. With regard to this category of\r\n\r\nmembership, the Minister's Statement on 21st December,\r\n\r\n1966, reads, and here again I quote. This is in Volume\r\n\r\n25,  No. 14 of Hansard, col. 1055, towards the  bottom\r\n\r\nof the page:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(i) Permanent members: This would consist of men of\r\n\r\ndistinction who will be chosen from those who  hold\r\n\r\nor  have held high offices, e.g. Cabinet Ministers,\r\n\r\nformer  Chief  Ministers, the  Chief  Justice,  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   the  Chairman  of  the  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission, Puisne Judges, the Attorney-General and\r\n\r\nformer Permanent Secretaries. There would be no age\r\n\r\nlimit;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I cannot quarrel with former Cabinet Ministers or even\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of the Public Service Commission  being\r\n\r\nmembers of the Council, but involving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudges   in  politics  may  be  something  which   any\r\n\r\ndemocracy may want to avoid. I say this because it  is\r\n\r\nnot  quite  clear  whether only those  who  have  held\r\n\r\noffice  would be appointed to membership or those  who\r\n\r\nare, in fact, currently holding these offices, because\r\n\r\nreading  from the Report, it says here,\"... from  those\r\n\r\nwho  hold or have held high offices\". Furthermore,  it\r\n\r\nis not clear from the Minister's Statement whether the\r\n\r\npresent   incumbents   of  the  posts   of   Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries  or only retired ones are being  appointed\r\n\r\nto   membership  of  the  Council.  If   the   present\r\n\r\nincumbents  are  appointed, then  it  would  blur  the\r\n\r\ndistinction  between the Executive and the Legislature\r\n\r\nand  will detract from the responsibility of the civil\r\n\r\nservants   towards  the  Minister   and   weaken   the\r\n\r\nMinister's  control  of the civil  servants.  If  only\r\n\r\nretired   Permanent  Secretaries  are   appointed   to\r\n\r\nmembership,  then they may be too old  and  senile  to\r\n\r\ndischarge their responsibilities effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I have the feeling that the Commission\r\n\r\nhave  not  given  sufficiently  deep  thought  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the creation of a Council of State.  They\r\n\r\nseem   to  be  influenced  by  a  basic  distrust   of\r\n\r\ndemocratically elected representatives of the  people.\r\n\r\nHence, their recommendation of an appointed Council of\r\n\r\nState without considering the wide implications of its\r\n\r\ncreation  in  the democratic framework. I  am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that the appointment of such a Council  would\r\n\r\nnot  remedy the particular political situation we  are\r\n\r\nfacing  at  present.  Its remedy lies,  in  the  final\r\n\r\nanalysis, in an educated and enlightened electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a temporary measure to meet the situation, perhaps\r\n\r\nthe Government may consider the following proposals:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Appoint Ministerial committees composing of\r\n\r\nexperts to advise the Ministers in the initiating  and\r\n\r\nframing of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Refer as many Bills as possible to Select\r\n\r\nCommittees, thereby giving affected outside  interests\r\n\r\nan opportunity to make representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Lengthen the period between the First Reading and\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany Bill so as to give Members of Parliament more time\r\n\r\nto  study  them. In this connection, to  refrain  from\r\n\r\nintroducing Bills on a Certificate of Urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now come to the second\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of the Commission,  and  that  is  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  the office of Ombudsman? The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  rejected the Commission's recommendation  without\r\n\r\ngiving  any  substantial reasons  for  doing  so.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  only  reason is that  the  time  is  not\r\n\r\nopportune and that the introduction of such an  office\r\n\r\nshould be deferred until the results of the experiment\r\n\r\nin  New  Zealand and elsewhere are known. Here  may  I\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the reason given by the Prime  Minister  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber this very afternoon? The Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nreason appears to disclose a lack of confidence in our\r\n\r\ncivil service. The Prime Minister, having said what he\r\n\r\ndid  say  in this Chamber, I think the efficiency  and\r\n\r\nfairness  of our civil service can only be  vindicated\r\n\r\nby the establishment of such an office. I am afraid  I\r\n\r\ndo  not consider the reason given by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw  and National Development and the reason given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister good reasons. New Zealand has  had\r\n\r\nan Ombudsman since 1962 and by all accounts the office\r\n\r\nis  a  great  success. Here, Mr Speaker, Sir,  may  I\r\n\r\nquote  part  of  a  speech by  the  Honourable  J.  R.\r\n\r\nMarshall,  the Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister  of\r\n\r\nIndustry and Commerce and Minister of Oversea Trade of\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand,  to the 11th Commonwealth  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nConference, at page 213 in the Conference  Report?  He\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the basis of three years' operation of the office\r\n\r\n[meaning  the office of Ombudsman], we in New  Zealand\r\n\r\ncan   commend   the   institution   to   the   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration  of  other members of the  Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nBut this commendation is subject to some reservations.\r\n\r\nIn  the  first place, we do not recommend  our  system\r\n\r\nexcept  in  our  own  circumstances.  For  others   we\r\n\r\nrecommend    only   the   idea   of   an    Ombudsman.\r\n\r\nConstitutional development of this kind must grow  out\r\n\r\nof the needs and experiences of each country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  am  of  the  opinion that we  are  in  a  stage  of\r\n\r\nconstitutional  and  political  development  when  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  such an office  would  benefit  our\r\n\r\nadministration. The office of Ombudsman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafeguards the citizens against two ills which are the\r\n\r\nresult  of the growth of modern government. These  two\r\n\r\nills are, to put them shortly, (1) misguided decisions\r\n\r\nby  authorities  in the exercise of their  discretion;\r\n\r\n(2)  maladministration.  As Dicey,  one  of  Britain's\r\n\r\ngreat  constitutional lawyers, has said, and I  quote:\r\n\r\n\"Wherever  there  is discretion,  there  is  room  for\r\n\r\narbitrariness.\" It is quite possible nowadays  for  an\r\n\r\nindividual's rights to be accidentally crushed by  the\r\n\r\nvast government administrative machinery. Hundreds and\r\n\r\nthousands of administrative decisions are made by  our\r\n\r\nGovernment departments each year affecting the life of\r\n\r\nevery citizen. Some of these decisions are bound to be\r\n\r\narbitrary   and   unjustified.   Under   our   present\r\n\r\ninstitution  of government, there is no easy  way  for\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary citizen to gain redress. Courts are  not\r\n\r\nquite  an  appropriate forum for the investigation  of\r\n\r\nthese complaints. Quite apart from the fact that  they\r\n\r\nare expensive and slow, the courts cannot go behind  a\r\n\r\nMinister's  decision and exercise their discretion  on\r\n\r\nhis  behalf. Members of Parliament are ineffective  in\r\n\r\nthat  they  cannot have access to departmental  files.\r\n\r\nThe  same reason goes for the Press. The advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe Ombudsman is that, unlike M.P.s and the Press,  he\r\n\r\nis  politically neutral and has the power to call  for\r\n\r\ndepartmental  files to get at the full  facts  of  the\r\n\r\ncase. Unlike the courts, he does not require elaborate\r\n\r\ncourt  procedure and no fee, or at most only  a  small\r\n\r\nfee,  is charged for his services, so that his  action\r\n\r\nis cheaper and faster when compared with the review by\r\n\r\nthe  courts.  The creation of the office of  Ombudsman\r\n\r\nnot   only  would  safeguard  our  citizens  from  the\r\n\r\narbitrary  decisions of those in  authority  and  from\r\n\r\nmaladministration,  but  would   also   serve   as   a\r\n\r\nprotective  shield  for  the civil  service.  It  will\r\n\r\nprotect   them   from   unfounded   allegations    and\r\n\r\naccusations. This will further increase the confidence\r\n\r\nof  the  public in our administration. The  fact  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a difference in the development of Singapore\r\n\r\nand the development of the countries at present having\r\n\r\nan Ombudsman is, as I see it,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  argument. All studies so far show the desirability\r\n\r\nof   introducing  such  an  institution  and   it   is\r\n\r\nsignificant  that almost all the countries  that  have\r\n\r\nconducted  studies  into this office  now  accept  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of having such an office. The latest example\r\n\r\nis the United Kingdom. We have an efficient and honest\r\n\r\ncivil  service. We are rightly proud of it. We  should\r\n\r\nnot,  however, be content. The creation of the  office\r\n\r\nof  Ombudsman will be a step forward. It  would  be  a\r\n\r\nstep  towards  greater efficiency and incorruptibility\r\n\r\nof  our  civil service. Its introduction will  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  in  this  region and it will be  the  pride  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\nfirst place, I wish to congratulate the Government  on\r\n\r\nappointing  a  Commission to look into the  rights  of\r\n\r\nminorities  in our Republic. The impartial  Commission\r\n\r\nhas done a wonderful job, as a result of which we have\r\n\r\nthe Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966,  in\r\n\r\nfront  of  us now. The Government, in accordance  with\r\n\r\nits declared policy of multi-racial, multi-lingual and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious Singapore, has, in fact, accepted most\r\n\r\nof   the  recommendations  of  the  Commission.  While\r\n\r\nagreeing in principle with other recommendations, only\r\n\r\na few of the recommendations are not acceptable to the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  is  heartening  to  note   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  willing  to accept  in  principle  the\r\n\r\nprovisions regarding equal treatment of every  citizen\r\n\r\nin   the  eyes  of  the  law  as  recommended  by  the\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I need a clarification from the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law  and National Development on one point  only,\r\n\r\ni.e, land acquisition. We are a Republic with an area\r\n\r\nof about 225 square miles, and not all the land in our\r\n\r\nisland  can be used for development. With the increase\r\n\r\nof  population and social amenities, we need more land\r\n\r\nfor  housing,  roads,  recreational  facilities,  etc.\r\n\r\nBecause   of   shortage  of  land,  we  are   building\r\n\r\nunderground  and multi-storey car parks. But,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  we  see quite a number of plots  of  land\r\n\r\nbelonging to private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindividuals not being put to proper use. In  order  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  such lands, the Government  has  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething;  and for that I agree it should  have  some\r\n\r\nsort  of constitutional power. Having this in mind,  I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  Government's intention  to  include  the\r\n\r\nterms of Article 13 of the Constitution of Malaysia in\r\n\r\na  modified form. The Commission has recommended  that\r\n\r\nno  property will be acquired except upon just  terms.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has stated that it would  accept  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  but  without  the  words  \"upon   just\r\n\r\nterms\". As a layman who does not know much about  law,\r\n\r\nI  fear  that  the  removal  of  these  words  may  be\r\n\r\nconstrued  by some people to mean that no compensation\r\n\r\nwill  be  paid  at  all  for  land  acquired  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. But I am sure that it is not the intention\r\n\r\nof   the  Government  not  to  pay  any  compensation.\r\n\r\nDefinitely  the Government will pay compensation.  But\r\n\r\nwhether  the affected party thinks the amount paid  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  adequate or not  is  a  different\r\n\r\nmatter. Sir, I shall be thankful to the Minister if he\r\n\r\ncan  make it clear, in the article in the Constitution\r\n\r\ndealing with land acquisition, that compensation  will\r\n\r\nbe  paid.  Such  a modification will ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will pay compensation for land acquired and\r\n\r\nthat  the property owner will not be made to give  his\r\n\r\nland free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members\r\n\r\nwill  recall  that  once Sir Winston  Churchill  said,\r\n\r\n\"Democracy is the worst system of government,  but  it\r\n\r\nis  the  only  one that works.\" We are  gathered  here\r\n\r\ntoday to examine the basic principles and also to come\r\n\r\nto  some form of compromise on which to work out a new\r\n\r\nConstitution for our young Republic. This  reminds  us\r\n\r\nof  what  John  Russell said about  constitutions.  He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Every political constitution in which different\r\n\r\nbodies share political power is only enabled to  exist\r\n\r\nby  the forbearance of those among whom this power  is\r\n\r\ndistributed.\" One of the conscious fears of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore is the question of whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nbasic rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the minority - in short, the basic rights of  human\r\n\r\nbeings  -  can  be  entrenched in the Constitution  in\r\n\r\norder  to  provide a form of safeguard for  them.  And\r\n\r\namong  the  suggestions  and  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Commission  were  the  office  of  the\r\n\r\nOmbudsman and the Council of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in as much as we understand and appreciate the\r\n\r\nfunctions  and  the good work that an Ombudsman  or  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Commissioner can do and can  contribute\r\n\r\nto  this new Republic, I think one cannot, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  automatically conclude that that  is  the  best\r\n\r\nform,  having regard to the existing social  structure\r\n\r\nand  the  population  at  large.  The  office  of  the\r\n\r\nOmbudsman automatically presupposes a very high degree\r\n\r\nof  public administration and, of course, a highly and\r\n\r\nextremely sophisticated population. It is not  for  us\r\n\r\nto say that our population is not sophisticated or our\r\n\r\npublic  administration is not up to the standard  that\r\n\r\nwould  have  been expected perhaps by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa Chu Kang. But it would be naive for us to believe\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  come  to that kind  of  standard  when\r\n\r\ncompared  to the Western world for the adoption  of  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Commissioner.  Parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nand  franchise  in voting is indeed new  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand, in fact, in Asia. I do not believe that ten years\r\n\r\nor  maybe even 20 years of education on voting and the\r\n\r\nvalue  of representative government can really  defeat\r\n\r\nthe  prejudice of the people of Asia, who in the known\r\n\r\nhistory  of  4,000  years, have  not  known  a  single\r\n\r\ninstance  in  which a government was  put  into  power\r\n\r\nthrough  voting.  Sir,  we  are  not  dismissing   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation for the establishment or creation of an\r\n\r\nOmbudsman  for  Singapore. But if you are  to  examine\r\n\r\nthis  office, I would say it came into being only very\r\n\r\nrecently.  I  mean  the  known parliamentary  history,\r\n\r\nparticularly  after  the  industrial  revolution.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  known  case of the appointment of an  Ombudsman\r\n\r\nwas in 1809. Is that correct, Mr Tang?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> That is correct, but that is not\r\n\r\nrecent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Well, when you compare human\r\n\r\nhistory  of so many thousands of years. 200 years  can\r\n\r\nbe  regarded  as very recent. In 1809,  in  Sweden,  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary Commissioner of Justice - and  in  their\r\n\r\nterm,  it  was  known as the Justitieombudsman  -  was\r\n\r\nappointed.  It  is only in 1915 that Sweden  appointed\r\n\r\nanother  form of Parliamentary Commissioner  known  as\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Military Administration --and  in\r\n\r\ntheir term, they call it the Militieombudsman. Denmark\r\n\r\nfirst thought of the idea after the war in 1946.  That\r\n\r\ncan  be very recent and it was not until 1953 that the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Constitutional Committee of 1946\r\n\r\nwas  incorporated in the Constitution for Denmark.  It\r\n\r\nwas   not   until  1955  in  March  when   the   first\r\n\r\nParliamentary Commissioner for Denmark was  appointed.\r\n\r\nFinland had its Parliamentary Commissioner in 1919. In\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand,  the  National  Party  put  forward  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a Parliamentary Commissioner  in  its\r\n\r\nelection campaign in 1960. It was only two years later\r\n\r\nthat  the  Parliamentary Commissioner  was  appointed.\r\n\r\nSir, I have listed out all these just to show that not\r\n\r\nonly  the  office  of the Ombudsman is  novel  in  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, but in general it is still  a  very  new\r\n\r\nidea  provided the Member for Choa Chu Kang can accept\r\n\r\nthat 1809 is recent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ombudsman is a man of high integrity and\r\n\r\nhigh administrative ability, and as the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhad said earlier, you almost have to scrape the bottom\r\n\r\nof the barrel to look for a suitable candidate to fill\r\n\r\na  high position Indeed it is difficult to secure  the\r\n\r\nservices  of a man of that calibre for the  office  of\r\n\r\nOmbudsman.  The  Member for Choa  Chu  Kang  - I  must\r\n\r\ncongratulate him on doing considerable research -  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that recently the British Government has adopted\r\n\r\nthe  idea of a Parliamentary Commissioner. But he  has\r\n\r\ndeliberately or otherwise omitted to inform the  House\r\n\r\nof   the  recommendation  of  the  committee  on  this\r\n\r\nparticular question. Mr Speaker.

In the recommendation\r\n\r\nof this Committee contained in page 79 of this Report,\r\n\r\nI  quote - Sir, it is a fairly long one but I hope the\r\n\r\nHouse will bear with me on this - paragraph 166:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our conclusion regarding complaints of\r\n\r\nmaladministration  is  that  Parliament  is  and  must\r\n\r\nremain   the   most   important  channel   by   making\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Executive about grievances.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  did  not  say  the Parliamentary Commissioner  but\r\n\r\nParliament must remain the most important channel.  It\r\n\r\ngoes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We think the existing Parliamentary procedures, in\r\n\r\nparticular  the Parliamentary Question  procedure  and\r\n\r\nthe  Adjournment Debates, provide a valuable means for\r\n\r\ndealing with complaints of maladministration raised by\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament but that they  would  be  more\r\n\r\neffective if they were supplemented by machinery which\r\n\r\nwould enable such complaints to be investigated by  an\r\n\r\nimpartial  authority if the Member  requested  it.  We\r\n\r\nhave  therefore proposed that an officer, to be called\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary  Commissioner  (or  by  some  other\r\n\r\nsuitable title), with a status similar to that of  the\r\n\r\nComptroller and Auditor-General, should be  appointed,\r\n\r\nand  subject to certain conditions, should investigate\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  maladministration  against  Government\r\n\r\nDepartments received from Members of Parliament.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  if we carry the argument of the Member for  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang further, then this recommendation itself  is\r\n\r\nnot conclusive, because it states that only complaints\r\n\r\nreceived   from  Members  of  Parliament   should   be\r\n\r\ninvestigated  and,  of course, it  suggests  that  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  should be supplemented by other  machinery\r\n\r\nif  and  when  a  Member  of  Parliament  requests  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation into a certain matter. We  already  have\r\n\r\nthat machinery in Singapore which has been referred to\r\n\r\nso often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be\r\n\r\npermitted to interrupt?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The\r\n\r\nmachinery recommended by Justice is the very office of\r\n\r\nOmbudsman.   He  has  said  that  the   machinery   to\r\n\r\nsupplement  a  Member's right is  not  Ombudsman,  but\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  very passage he  has  quoted,  the\r\n\r\nmachinery that this Report recommends is, in fact, the\r\n\r\nvery establishment of the office of Ombudsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I was coming to that before I\r\n\r\nwas interrupted by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember for Choa Chu Kang. I said that we already  have\r\n\r\nthat  machinery in Singapore which has so  often  been\r\n\r\nreferred to by my colleagues, and that is the  Central\r\n\r\nComplaints   Bureau.  But  we   do   not   require   a\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Commissioner  to  head   the   Central\r\n\r\nComplaints Bureau. We have a Director there,  and  the\r\n\r\nresults  of investigations by this Bureau have  proved\r\n\r\nto  be  effective  and  honest  without  any  fear  of\r\n\r\nintimidation from any quarter. Sir, I am  inclined  to\r\n\r\nthink  that  the Central Complaints Bureau serves  the\r\n\r\nsame  purpose  as the Parliamentary Commissioner.  But\r\n\r\nthe difference is that A Report by Justice states that\r\n\r\nthe   machinery   can  \"be  called  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommissioner  (or by some other suitable title)\",  but\r\n\r\nwe  call  it the Central Complaints Bureau.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nBritish Constitutional Commission was appointed  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the Prime Minister's speech in November 1959\r\n\r\non  the question of looking into the appointment of an\r\n\r\nOmbudsman. The period 1959 to 1967, by any stretch  of\r\n\r\nthe  imagination, can be regarded as recent.  Even  in\r\n\r\nthe  Report, they have not altogether recommended that\r\n\r\nthe   holder   of  the  office  of  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommissioner must be appointed, and they have not made\r\n\r\nany  firm  recommendation as to whether it  should  be\r\n\r\ntermed \"Parliamentary Commissioner\" or \"Ombudsman\". We\r\n\r\nhave  that  machinery. In fact, it is  operating  very\r\n\r\nsmoothly in Singapore. Sir, I do not believe that  any\r\n\r\ncitizen  in  Singapore  cannot  seek  redress  of  his\r\n\r\ngrievances. After all, a citizen can seek  redress  in\r\n\r\ncourt,  and according to the Hierarchy of the judicial\r\n\r\nsystem - the House of Lords, the Privy Council or  the\r\n\r\nJudicial  Committee, the Court of Appeal, the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  and the Magistrate's Court - he can go  through\r\n\r\nall these channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> It is expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> We can perhaps reduce the\r\n\r\nexpenses,  if  the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang  can  be\r\n\r\ngenerous enough!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Tang, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  listened to you with courtesy. If  we  have\r\n\r\ninterruptions on a controversial issue like  this,  we\r\n\r\nmay take a very long time. Mr Fong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> After all, any Minister in the\r\n\r\nCabinet  of the Republic of Singapore may  sue  or  be\r\n\r\nsued.  If  any individual citizen thinks that  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen  victimised, or any decision by the Cabinet or  a\r\n\r\nMinister is contrary to the basic rights of a  citizen\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Minister  for  Law  has  stated  will   be\r\n\r\nentrenched in the Constitution, he can seek redress in\r\n\r\ncourt.  As  the Prime Minister has said, we  have  not\r\n\r\ndismissed the idea altogether. All he has said is that\r\n\r\nthe  Ombudsman is of very recent history and  that  we\r\n\r\nhad  better wait and see, and perhaps we could benefit\r\n\r\nfrom the mistakes or the good work of the Ombudsman in\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to the Council of State, Mr Speaker. It has\r\n\r\nbeen said that the Council of State is able to rectify\r\n\r\nany   legislation  made  which  infringes   upon   the\r\n\r\nindividual rights of a citizen. Sir, as I see it, with\r\n\r\na  Council of State, Singapore will he bicameral. Sir,\r\n\r\nin  a  small newly independent country like Singapore.\r\n\r\nwe  cannot afford the luxury of a two-House system. We\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to have another Upper Chamber in  order\r\n\r\nto  provide  a  kind of back-door for those  political\r\n\r\n\"rejects\"  to  obtain admission to this  Upper  House.\r\n\r\nThen again, if we have an Upper House, we will have to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether they are to he elected or appointed.\r\n\r\nIf  they  are  to be appointed or by virtue  of  their\r\n\r\nposition they may serve in the Upper Chamber, then any\r\n\r\nlegislation made in the Lower House can be defeated or\r\n\r\nvetoed  by the Upper House. This is against  the  very\r\n\r\nprinciple of representative government; that is,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  veto  or defeat any legislation of  the  Lower\r\n\r\nHouse  which  is  elected by popular  vote.  The  U.S.\r\n\r\nSenate,  for example, is a very powerful body  because\r\n\r\nall Senators are elected, but our Council of State  is\r\n\r\nsomewhere  between  the  two-House  system.  It   will\r\n\r\ndefinitely serve a purpose. As the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier, the population of Singapore is  getting\r\n\r\nyounger  and  younger, and in the  next  five  or  ten\r\n\r\nyears, two-thirds of the population will be below  the\r\n\r\nage   of  35.  Even  in  the  United  Kingdom,   where\r\n\r\nconsiderable  doubts  have  been  raised   about   the\r\n\r\ndesirability and necessity of the continued  existence\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Lords,  they  have found  it  difficult  to\r\n\r\ndispense with it because a separate body, advisory  or\r\n\r\notherwise,  would  still  be required  to  assist  the\r\n\r\nmachinery of State. The Council of State is indeed the\r\n\r\nvery  appropriate  answer, having due  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore. I would rather  prefer  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Council of State should have political\r\n\r\naffiliations,  because  they will  be  able  to  judge\r\n\r\nmatters  in wider perspective, as they have  a  proper\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the  social structure  of  society,\r\n\r\nrather  than  those who represent  a  religious  or  a\r\n\r\nminority group. I am not doubting the ability  of  the\r\n\r\nprospective  members of the Council of State,  but  if\r\n\r\none  were to represent a religious or a racial  group,\r\n\r\nhe is bound to be pressurised and he would not be able\r\n\r\nto  examine any legislation in all its aspects.  So  a\r\n\r\nman   with   political  affiliations   and   political\r\n\r\nsophistication  is  better  equipped  to  sit  in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  State than the man who  serves  only  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of a small group of people and who  fails  to\r\n\r\nweigh  the  implications  of any  legislation  to  the\r\n\r\nsociety at large. But there is a fear that members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Council  may  misuse their  position  for  their\r\n\r\npolitical  ends. I cannot agree that  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nState  should  sit in public. After all,  its  members\r\n\r\nwill not be elected. Their comments will only be in an\r\n\r\nadvisory  capacity and we will, of course, take  their\r\n\r\nadvice  into account, but they should not be  made  so\r\n\r\npowerful as to defeat the aims of the Government which\r\n\r\nis  elected by popular vote. They will serve merely as\r\n\r\nElders in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nassociate myself with the sentiments expressed by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law. One compromise might appear to be -\r\n\r\nI  hope perhaps to the satisfaction of the Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang - for us to streamline or reconsider\r\n\r\nthe functions and portfolios of the Central Complaints\r\n\r\nBureau  and  to increase the responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector so that he can have slightly more power  than\r\n\r\nhe now has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose this to the Minister for Law, and I\r\n\r\nhope he will consider seriously extending the scope of\r\n\r\nthe functions of the Central Complaints Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  may  wish  to\r\n\r\ncontribute more ideas to the Minister when he  accepts\r\n\r\nmy proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I would like to deal\r\n\r\nwith   the   recommendations  of  the   Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission  on  minority rights that an  Ombudsman  be\r\n\r\nappointed. I wish also later to deal with the question\r\n\r\nof  the special position and rights of minorities with\r\n\r\nparticular reference to the Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier in the afternoon, in addition to the reasons\r\n\r\ngiven by the Prime Minister for not appointing such  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary Commissioner today in Singapore, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to give two other reasons why the necessity  has\r\n\r\nnot really arisen for such appointment. Firstly, as  a\r\n\r\nunitary  Republic,  we  do not  have  those  conflicts\r\n\r\nbetween State and Federal Government authorities which\r\n\r\nmay exist in a Federation, which possibly exist in the\r\n\r\nFederation  like  the Federation of Malaysia.  On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, in a unitary State like Singapore, we have\r\n\r\na  central  forum where grievances can  be  aired  and\r\n\r\nwhere  Ministers  have to answer for  all  matters  of\r\n\r\npublic  administration;  matters  going  down  to  the\r\n\r\nminutest  detail, as you know, Sir, have been  brought\r\n\r\nup  to  the  Legislature. Secondly, as a small  Island\r\n\r\nRepublic  with  only an area of 225 square  miles  and\r\n\r\nwhere  road  transport, among other things,  is  good,\r\n\r\nevery  citizen has easy access to persons in authority\r\n\r\nfor the speedy redress of grievances. Unlike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, the United Kingdom, or even Malaysia,  we\r\n\r\nare a small and concentrated community and traditional\r\n\r\nmethods  for  the  redress of grievances  in  a  small\r\n\r\nisland like our Island Republic have always been found\r\n\r\nto  be  adequate  and,  in fact, are  still  adequate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in five years' time development may show  that\r\n\r\nthese  methods are not adequate. That we do  not  know\r\n\r\nnow.  If  so,  if  they prove to be inadequate  later,\r\n\r\nchanges  can and will be made and we can then  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the full experience of New Zealand and the  more\r\n\r\nrecent experience of the United Kingdom and other such\r\n\r\ncountries  in the Commonwealth near or far  away  from\r\n\r\nus,  who may appear to beat us to the gun and steal  a\r\n\r\nmarch.
