Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item 001 of subhead\r\n\r\n101*.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said in this Parliament a week ago\r\n\r\nthat all the roads in the eastern sector have been\r\n\r\nmade  up  under  the Local Government  Integration\r\n\r\nAct,   except  the  roads  in  Kampong   Pachitan,\r\n\r\nLengkong  Tiga and Kampong Eunos. Kampong Pachitan\r\n\r\nis  private property, and the land is let  out  to\r\n\r\nthe  residents who are now occupying it. The roads\r\n\r\nthere are mainly earth roads. When it rains,  they\r\n\r\nbecome  impassable because the  mud  turns  soggy.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would like to request the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned   to  make  up  the  roads  to   kampong\r\n\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Eunos is a reserve road. A community\r\n\r\ncentre  has been built by the residents themselves\r\n\r\nat  the  cost  of $110,000, and it is operational.\r\n\r\nBut because the existing roads are not constructed\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with the road reserve,  therefore,\r\n\r\nSir, I hope the authorities concerned can make  up\r\n\r\nKampong  Eunos road under section 19 of the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment   Integration   Act.   Otherwise    the\r\n\r\nauthorities  have  to divert the existing  Kampong\r\n\r\nEunos  road, in accordance with the reserve  road,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  centre  area can  be  extended  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment work there can be carried out early.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I refer to the kampong roads in\r\n\r\nAlsagoff Estate in Kampong Kembangan constituency.\r\n\r\nOnly  certain roads in that estate have been  made\r\n\r\nup  to kampong standards. A greater number has yet\r\n\r\nto  be  made  up,  and up to now  they  are  still\r\n\r\nnothing  but  earth roads. So when it  rains,  the\r\n\r\ndrain  becomes  clogged and overflows  on  to  the\r\n\r\nroads,  making the roads muddy. Sir, I would  like\r\n\r\nto know why these roads have not been made up when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplications  have already been submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nUrban and Rural Services Committee many years ago,\r\n\r\nand  when can they be made up according to kampong\r\n\r\nstandards?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, applications for roads to be built have not\r\n\r\nbeen  considered and applications to fill up  pot-holes  in the roads have not been entertained.  It\r\n\r\nis   strange   but   true,  Sir,   that   although\r\n\r\napplications  have been made to  the  U.R.S.C, to\r\n\r\nrepair  Jalan  Ladang, including roadside  drains,\r\n\r\nthe  sum  approved to repair the road is up  to  a\r\n\r\nlimit  of $700 only. Despite the fact that  repair\r\n\r\nwork  has commenced, the badly damaged roads  have\r\n\r\nnot  been repaired. Instead the other roads  which\r\n\r\nonly require minor repairs have been attended  to.\r\n\r\nI  wish  to know how this state of affairs can  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  go  on, and whether  applications  to\r\n\r\nmetal  roads in Alsagoff Estate, Kampong  Ubi  and\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan constituencies can be  approved\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first\r\n\r\nof  all,  with  your permission, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nrange  my remarks over amendments* numbers (2)  to\r\n\r\n(7)  under this Head, so that I need not  have  to\r\n\r\nmove them again.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The amendments, standing in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting, read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item 008 of subhead 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to he allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item 010 of subhead 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item 011 of subhead 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item 012 of subhead 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, may I first congratulate the\r\n\r\nUrban and Rural Services Committee, headed by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Law\r\n\r\nand  National  Development, for providing  various\r\n\r\namenities in the rural areas, such as making up of\r\n\r\nkampong  roads,  water  and electricity  supplies,\r\n\r\nstreet lighting, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the apportionment of this fund\r\n\r\nfor     the    various    constituencies    varies\r\n\r\nconsiderably.

There are other requests  too,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  electricity supplies, but  I  would  not\r\n\r\nlike  to bother this House with details except  to\r\n\r\nsay that I hope such requests can be acceded to as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Public Utilities Board\r\n\r\nhas   been   implementing  rural   electrification\r\n\r\nschemes  costing about $2.65 million per annum.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  is\r\n\r\nactually    taking   steps   to    expedite    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of such schemes. I say this because\r\n\r\nnow  and again we receive progress reports of such\r\n\r\nschemes being carried out, and it is noticed  that\r\n\r\nin  some  of my areas implementation will  not  be\r\n\r\ncarried out until a year or two later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect that I wish to bring to the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  Minister concerned  is  street\r\n\r\nlighting in the rural areas. First of all, most of\r\n\r\nthe  street lights that have been put up  are  not\r\n\r\nbright enough, probably due to low\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwattage, and they get out of order every  now  and\r\n\r\nthen.  In  this respect, I would urge the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned   to   look  into  the  possibility   of\r\n\r\ninstalling brighter and more durable lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect I would like to touch on is\r\n\r\nthe  state of agricultural and kampong roads. Many\r\n\r\nagricultural   and   kampong   roads   have   been\r\n\r\nconstructed in the past few years, but I am afraid\r\n\r\nthat  by  now most of them are in urgent  need  of\r\n\r\nrepair.  Therefore, may I once again  request  the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned to look into this matter. It is\r\n\r\ngratifying  to note that this year's provision  is\r\n\r\n$3.25  million.  It shows a marked  increase  over\r\n\r\nlast  year's provision. I hope that the Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural  Services Committee would be generous enough\r\n\r\nto   entertain   the   requests   of   the   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, before an overhead bridge\r\n\r\nis  erected, the Citizens' Consultative  Committee\r\n\r\nor  the  Member of Parliament of that constituency\r\n\r\nshould  be consulted. There is one overhead bridge\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency. It is near the Gan Eng  Seng\r\n\r\nSchool. The children going to and from the  school\r\n\r\ndo  not use this overhead bridge because they have\r\n\r\nto  cross  two  other roads where  there  is  more\r\n\r\ntraffic,  before  they can come to  this  overhead\r\n\r\nbridge.  But  there  are no overhead  bridges  for\r\n\r\nthese  two other roads where the traffic  is  very\r\n\r\nheavy. Therefore, the school children do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  utilise the overhead bridge near their school.\r\n\r\nI  do not know whether or not the other Members of\r\n\r\nParliament were consulted when an overhead  bridge\r\n\r\nwas  built  in their constituencies. But  in  this\r\n\r\ncase,  neither my Citizens' Consultative Committee\r\n\r\nnor  myself  was  consulted.

Therefore,   proper\r\n\r\narrangements  should  be  made  to  see  that  the\r\n\r\noverhead  bridge near the Gan Eng Seng  School  is\r\n\r\nfully   utilised.

The provision  for  rural\r\n\r\nservices  is $3.25 million, and although  this  is\r\n\r\nmore  than last year's provision, it is still  not\r\n\r\nsufficient.   If  this  provision   were   to   be\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  the various constituencies,  each\r\n\r\nconstituency will only get $10,000 or  less.  This\r\n\r\namount Xs not even enough to metal a road. I think\r\n\r\na  provision of two or three times more  than  the\r\n\r\npresent  provision  of  $3.25  million  should  he\r\n\r\nallocated.  Since we are making rapid progress  in\r\n\r\nour economic development, more provision should be\r\n\r\nmade  so that the living conditions of the  people\r\n\r\nin the rural areas can be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter of fact, the\r\n\r\nrequests made by the people in the rural areas are\r\n\r\nbasically  very  simple. They want roads  properly\r\n\r\nsurfaced,  drains  to  flow smoothly,  and  public\r\n\r\nutility  services  like  water,  electricity   and\r\n\r\nstreet lighting. Water is their most urgent  need.\r\n\r\nIn  the last few years the Government has extended\r\n\r\nthe  water  mains  to the various  constituencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many areas, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nmore  remote parts, which still do not have  water\r\n\r\nsupply.  In  these areas, the people have  to  dig\r\n\r\nwells  for their water. Whether or not these wells\r\n\r\nare  hygienic  is  another matter.  In  any  case,\r\n\r\nduring  the dry spells the wells will dry  up  and\r\n\r\nthey  have to depend on Government delivery trucks\r\n\r\nwhich give only a limited supply of water. This is\r\n\r\na  great  inconvenience to them. I know that  many\r\n\r\nconstituencies  have requested for water  supplies\r\n\r\nbut their applications have not been approved. The\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned have  replied  that  it  is\r\n\r\nuneconomic  to  extend the water  mains  to  these\r\n\r\nremote  areas.  I  hope  they  will  not  be   too\r\n\r\ncalculating in the analysis of cost and profit.  I\r\n\r\nhope the people in these more remote areas will be\r\n\r\nprovided with adequate water supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people in the rural areas\r\n\r\nalso want better roads. They would like to see all\r\n\r\nthe present mud tracks properly metalled with tar.\r\n\r\nThese  mud tracks, which are used by the villagers\r\n\r\nevery  day, are uneven, and they hold many puddles\r\n\r\nof  water.  This is a great inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\nvillagers. The mud tracks in the villages can only\r\n\r\nlast  for  a  short time. In the case of  laterite\r\n\r\ntracks, after a year or two of use, there will  be\r\n\r\nmany  pot-holes which have to be repaired.  During\r\n\r\nthe  dry  season, the laterite tracks become  very\r\n\r\ndusty, and when it rains they are very muddy. This\r\n\r\nhas  caused  a lot of hardship especially  to  the\r\n\r\nprimary school children, because their clean white\r\n\r\nshoes  become dirty with red mud after walking  on\r\n\r\nthese  laterite  tracks. Moreover, these  laterite\r\n\r\ntracks  are not durable. Every two or three  years\r\n\r\nthey have to be repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  repair  will cost a few thousand dollars.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  know that it is  impossible  to\r\n\r\nmetal  all the tracks within six months or even  a\r\n\r\nyear.  But I would like to see a greater provision\r\n\r\nmade so that more laterite roads will be metalled.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  hope  that  the  provision  of   more\r\n\r\nmetalled  roads  will not mean a deterioration  in\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of the roads. In my constituency,  I\r\n\r\nnotice  that there are many metalled roads with  a\r\n\r\nlot of pot-holes. As soon as one part of a road is\r\n\r\nrepaired, potholes appear in another part. In less\r\n\r\nthan  two  years the road seems like an old  shirt\r\n\r\nwith mendings everywhere. What is surprising to me\r\n\r\nis that some of these roads have pot-holes in less\r\n\r\nthan  six months after their construction. I  have\r\n\r\ntaken  photographs showing the terrible  condition\r\n\r\nof  these  roads,  and I have shown  them  to  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary. I am not an engineer and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I  am not familiar with the  technical\r\n\r\npoints involved in road construction. But the fact\r\n\r\nthat these roads are easily damaged shows that the\r\n\r\nfoundation  of the road is not strong. Why  cannot\r\n\r\nthe  relevant department first assess the  maximum\r\n\r\nweight  the  road can support and  then  make  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  accordingly. If this is not  done,  as\r\n\r\nsoon as a road is constructed, repairs have to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out every now and again. This will  be  a\r\n\r\nwaste of public funds. Moreover, some of these pot-holes   are  not  mended  in  time.  I  hope   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary will look into this matter\r\n\r\nand  provide  better roads for the people  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, people in the rural areas also\r\n\r\nwant  the drains to flow smoothly. When the drains\r\n\r\nare  clogged  up,  they are not  only  a  breeding\r\n\r\nground  for mosquitoes, but they also give  out  a\r\n\r\nterrible   stench.   This  is   very   unhygienic.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  excessive water from the  silted  drain\r\n\r\nwill  erode  the surface of the road. I  hope  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned  will  organise   teams   of\r\n\r\nworkmen  to clear the major drains in every  rural\r\n\r\nconstituency at least once a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the rural areas also require\r\n\r\nelectricity supply. The Public Utilities Board has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  will provide rural electrification\r\n\r\nwithin  one  or two years. I hope the  Board  will\r\n\r\nkeep   its   word.  The  people   in   the   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies  also want street lighting.  Street\r\n\r\nlighting will make the road users feel much  safer\r\n\r\nand  thus more conducive to the maintenance of law\r\n\r\nand  order.  I  hope all the rural areas  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided with street lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are not many rural constituencies\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, their total areas are quite big. We\r\n\r\ndo need a greater provision for rural services.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  in  the next Budget the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary will request a bigger provision from the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance for the development of  these\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I fully agree with my colleagues who\r\n\r\nhave   spoken   on   rural  services.   They   are\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  people  from  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  This year a provision of $3.25 million  is\r\n\r\nmade   for  urban  and  rural  services,   and   I\r\n\r\nappreciate that the Government has made  a  bigger\r\n\r\nprovision  than  for last year. However,  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Member for Jurong when he said that this\r\n\r\nincreased  provision is still not  sufficient  for\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  projects in the  rural  areas.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  there is a very urgent need  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  more  rural roads. Although many applications\r\n\r\nhave   been   made,  not  many  roads  have   been\r\n\r\nconstructed. The excuse given is that there is not\r\n\r\nenough  provision. This shows that more  provision\r\n\r\nis  needed  for the construction of roads  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise two points. First, the\r\n\r\nprovision  for the construction of roads  is  only\r\n\r\n$750,000.  It  seems to me that this  sum  is  too\r\n\r\nsmall.  There  are many roads in  my  constituency\r\n\r\nwhich  are yet to be constructed. Of course, there\r\n\r\nare also other areas like Jurong, Punggol and Chua\r\n\r\nChu   Kang  (which  is  the  constituency  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Finance), Nee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon,  Changi, Bukit Panjang, Jalan Kayu, etc.  If\r\n\r\nwe  were  to distribute the provision among  these\r\n\r\nvarious  constituencies, then  the  sum  for  each\r\n\r\nconstituency will be very small and it will not be\r\n\r\nsufficient.  Since we have a surplus  budget  this\r\n\r\nyear, I think we can well afford to provide a  few\r\n\r\nmillion dollars more for rural development.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  the  Minister  concerned  to  consider\r\n\r\nincreasing this provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to the supply of water,\r\n\r\nwhich is a very important matter. In the past,  we\r\n\r\nhad many public standpipes. But the Government has\r\n\r\nbeen encouraging people to install their own water-pipes  and there has been a decrease in the number\r\n\r\nof   public  standpipes.  The  provision  of  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the  extension of  water  supply  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient  and  I hope that the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider  increasing  this amount.  During  a  dry\r\n\r\nspell,  perhaps the Minister of State for  Finance\r\n\r\nmay  remember, the Government had to  arrange  for\r\n\r\nwater  wagons and lorries to supply water  to  the\r\n\r\npeople   in   Chua  Chu  Kang  and   other   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  But in Sembawang,  we  are  lucky\r\n\r\nbecause  we can dig wells and the area is not  too\r\n\r\ndry. So we are more fortunate. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  consider  increasing the provision  for  the\r\n\r\nextension of water supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker.

For 1972-73, there\r\n\r\nis  an  increase of $300,000, and I would like  to\r\n\r\nthank   the   Minister  for   Law   and   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment for giving full consideration  to  our\r\n\r\nplea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next financial year the provision for\r\n\r\nitem  013 - Jetties - has been reduced by $25,000.\r\n\r\nI  believe that this meagre sum of $50,000 is  for\r\n\r\nthe  repair of jetties in the Southern  Islands  -\r\n\r\nPulau  Ubin.

I have two questions to raise  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  The first question relates to drains  in\r\n\r\nrural  constituencies. Up to this moment,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere is no comprehensive plan to construct a  good\r\n\r\ndrainage  system. In our Budget for 1972-73,  there\r\n\r\nis  no provision for the construction of drains.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know whether Government is going  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  special scheme for the construction  of\r\n\r\ndrains in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the supply of\r\n\r\nelectricity. In the last few years, the authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned have done very well in this respect.  Not\r\n\r\nonly  have  they spent their own time visiting  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas,  but  they have  also  contacted  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Members of Parliament in  order  to  do  a\r\n\r\nbetter   job, and  I  would  like  to  thank   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned  on this  matter.  But  some\r\n\r\nMembers  just now mentioned that there are  schemes\r\n\r\nfor  rural electrification which have not yet  been\r\n\r\ncarried  out.  I think this is not  a  question  of\r\n\r\ninefficiency.  It  is  more a question  of  getting\r\n\r\nenough  contractors to carry out  the  projects  so\r\n\r\nthat  the electrification of the rural areas  could\r\n\r\nbe carried out more efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nreply to the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Kembangan  regarding  Kampong  Eunos,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  plan at the moment to  make  up  the\r\n\r\nstretch of road from Kampong Eunos to Jalan  Yasin,\r\n\r\nas  the area is heavily squattered. Improvement  to\r\n\r\nthe  existing track may be considered if a  request\r\n\r\nis  made  to the Urban and Rural Services Committee\r\n\r\nby the Citizens' Consultative Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Alsagoff Estate, in fact, we have\r\n\r\ncarried  out  quite  a lot of improvements  in  the\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan, Kampong Ubi and  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nareas.  For instance, we have extended Sims  Avenue\r\n\r\nto  Jalan  Eunos,  and constructed  the  Pan-Island\r\n\r\nExpressway from Paya Lebar Road to Jalan Eunos.  We\r\n\r\nhave  also widened and improved Jalan Ubi and Jalan\r\n\r\nEunos.  With the two new major roads and the  other\r\n\r\ntwo  improved roads just mentioned, the improvement\r\n\r\nin  the  street  lighting, drainage and  foot-paths\r\n\r\nhave contributed considerably to the convenience of\r\n\r\nthe  people living in the area. As Alsagoff  Estate\r\n\r\nwill  eventually  become a housing  and  industrial\r\n\r\nestate, it is unwise at this stage to make  up  all\r\n\r\nthe  side tracks in the area as this will in course\r\n\r\nof  time  be broken up, and it will be a  waste  of\r\n\r\npublic funds. However, if it is necessary to  carry\r\n\r\nout minor repairs, we will always meet the requests\r\n\r\nwhen they are received from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department has no immediate\r\n\r\nplans  to  make  up the portion of Jalan  Ubi  from\r\n\r\nJalan  Lada  to  Airport Road,  as  this  would  be\r\n\r\naffected by Housing Board development of this  area\r\n\r\nwhich is still in the planning stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Punggol, the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board has taken action  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nservicing  of  street lamps in public  and  kampong\r\n\r\nroads,  and the quality of lamps used will also  be\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Punggol, three water-main laying schemes\r\n\r\nfor  the  Trafalgar  Estate in  Punggol  have  been\r\n\r\napproved  recently, and work will  commence  within\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext three months.

The cost is $21,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Tracks in Trafalgar Estate. The cost is\r\n\r\n$55,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Tracks adjoining Trafalgar Estate. The cost\r\n\r\nis $12,500. The total cost will be $88,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scheme for Track 6, Punggol Road, and\r\n\r\nmany  more  water-main laying schemes for  Punggol\r\n\r\nand  for  areas in other constituencies have  been\r\n\r\napproved  recently and work will  be  carried  out\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the rural electrification schemes,\r\n\r\nSir,  this provision of $50,000 is for the  supply\r\n\r\nof  electricity  by generators  to  the  off-shore\r\n\r\nislands,  which cannot be reached  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board's supply. Electrification  schemes\r\n\r\nfor  the  mainland are met from P.U.B, funds.  For\r\n\r\nthis  year, the provision is $2.6 million. It  was\r\n\r\nunfortunate that the Electricity Department of the\r\n\r\nP.U.B., due to factors beyond their control, could\r\n\r\nnot  implement  approved  electrification  schemes\r\n\r\nwithin  the  time specified in the programme.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  last  year,  owing  to  the  floods   in\r\n\r\nCalcutta, the factories under contract were unable\r\n\r\nto   supply  overhead  materials.  The  floods  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  also  resulted in a shortage  of  wooden\r\n\r\npoles. Nevertheless, even with these setbacks, the\r\n\r\nP.U.B, carried  out  and  completed   35   rural\r\n\r\nelectrification schemes between April,  1971, and\r\n\r\n22nd March, 1972, benefiting about 2,000 houses at\r\n\r\na  cost of $660,000 while 23 other schemes  as  at\r\n\r\n22nd  March,  1972, benefiting  about  3,000  more\r\n\r\nhouses  and  costing  $1  million,  are  still  in\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, both the Members for Jurong and\r\n\r\nSembawang have asked for more money to be provided\r\n\r\nfor  the repair of agricultural and kampong roads.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  Jurong constituency, for instance,  was\r\n\r\nallocated  $77,000 for 1971-72,  but  $88,000  was\r\n\r\ncommitted.   So   for  Jurong  constituency,   the\r\n\r\nprovision was over-committed by $11,000. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision for Sembawang constituency was  $15,000,\r\n\r\nbut  $66,000  was committed. Similarly,  Sembawang\r\n\r\nconstituency  was over-committed by $51,000.  Sir,\r\n\r\nfrom  a  comparison of these figures, we have,  in\r\n\r\nfact,    spent   more   money   in    the    rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  For 1972-73,  the  provision  for\r\n\r\nroads and other services has been increased by one-third  over the previous year's provision. Whether\r\n\r\nor  not  more funds will be provided in the coming\r\n\r\nyears  will  depend on the number of requests  for\r\n\r\nservices  and  the amounts involved. However,  the\r\n\r\nMembers  from  the  rural  constituencies  can  be\r\n\r\nassured  that  if  there is  a  balance  of  funds\r\n\r\nuncommitted in the other constituencies,  it  will\r\n\r\nultimately    be    utilised   for    the    rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last 11 years about $10\r\n\r\nmillion  out of a total expenditure of $37 million\r\n\r\nwas  spent  on improvement of roads in  the  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies.   Most   of   these   roads   have\r\n\r\nconsiderably  improved.  The  Government  has  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  task of extending piped-water  supplies\r\n\r\nto  households in the rural areas. In the next few\r\n\r\nyears we will step up the laying of water-mains in\r\n\r\nareas where the people are still dependent on well-water. In areas where the people are dependent  on\r\n\r\npublic   standpipes,  these  standpipes  will   be\r\n\r\nremoved when water-mains are laid. The areas which\r\n\r\nneed  water-mains are Bukit Panjang, Bukit  Timah,\r\n\r\nChangi, Chua Chu Kang, Jalan Kayu, Jurong, Kampong\r\n\r\nChai  Chee, Nee Soon, Punggol, Tampines,  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  Sembawang.  It is  hoped  that  with  the\r\n\r\nstepping up of this scheme, every household in the\r\n\r\noutlying  areas would, in the next three  or  four\r\n\r\nyears, be able to enjoy piped-water facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Changi, there is no\r\n\r\nproposal for the construction of new jetties.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $50,000 for  this  year  should  be\r\n\r\nsufficient   for  the  maintenance   of   existing\r\n\r\njetties.  However, if there is a need to construct\r\n\r\nnew  jetties, the U.R.S.C, will make a request  to\r\n\r\nthe Finance Ministry for more funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary for  doing  his  part  in\r\n\r\nlooking after the people in the rural areas.

This request was made in 1970,\r\n\r\nand   Treasury  had  approved  the  project,   in\r\n\r\nprinciple, by entering this request in the  1971-72 Development Estimates. However, a provision of\r\n\r\nonly $10,000 was shown in the 1971-72 Development\r\n\r\nEstimates,  as Treasury was of the view  that  we\r\n\r\nwere unlikely to spend more than this sum in that\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1971-72. However,  Treasury  was\r\n\r\nrequested  to make the full provision of  $42,000\r\n\r\nfor   furniture  and  equipment  in  the  1972-73\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates. They have agreed, and this\r\n\r\naccounts for the present figure. Therefore, there\r\n\r\nis  actually no increase in the cost of furniture\r\n\r\nor  equipment.

It takes\r\n\r\nsome  time to process the report and tenders  have\r\n\r\nto be called. But before tenders are called, funds\r\n\r\nwill have to be raised, perhaps through loans from\r\n\r\nbanks  or  international organisations.

Due to  the\r\n\r\nhigh  rate  of turnover of cleansing  workers  who\r\n\r\nresign  to  take  up more lucrative  jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial sector, the Public Cleansing Branch  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health is at the moment working on\r\n\r\na  field strength of about only 83 per cent. Also,\r\n\r\nwith the high degree of literacy among our younger\r\n\r\npopulation,  public cleansing work  is  not  their\r\n\r\nfirst  or  second  choice of an  occupation.  That\r\n\r\nbeing  the case, the situation, as far as shortage\r\n\r\nof cleansing workers is concerned, is not going to\r\n\r\nimprove  as  the  years  go  by.  Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nsolution is to mechanise public cleansing. But, as\r\n\r\nI have stated before,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstreet  cleansing work is labour-intensive and  to\r\n\r\nmechanise it would mean that there will be quite a\r\n\r\nnumber   of   problems   associated   with    such\r\n\r\nmechanisation. For example, the mechanical sweeper\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to sweep drains, scupper  holes,\r\n\r\nside-tables,  and so on. Further, with  regard  to\r\n\r\nside  lanes where we have hawkers and car  parking\r\n\r\nlots, the operation of the mechanical sweeper will\r\n\r\nbe quite limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the financial provision for\r\n\r\nmechanisation  is  concerned,  we   have   already\r\n\r\nordered  four  mechanical  road  sweepers  with  a\r\n\r\nsuction device. For the information of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol, they will be arriving in June. First\r\n\r\nof  all, we will use them to clean the main  roads\r\n\r\nas a pilot scheme.

I would like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  raise  a  few questions regarding the  housing\r\n\r\nestate  in  Jurong Town. We know  that  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears  there has been rapid development in  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  and there has been an increase in population\r\n\r\nwhich  number  about 30,000 now.  However,  it  is\r\n\r\nregrettable to say that the J.T.C, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly concerned with the need for housing, and  has\r\n\r\nnot   paid   enough  attention  to  beautify   the\r\n\r\nenvironment  or  to promote environmental  health.\r\n\r\nAccording   to   complaints  received   from   the\r\n\r\nresidents there and the observations I have  made,\r\n\r\nI  can  summarise a few points. I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to note what I am going to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the grass, the lawn and the trees in the\r\n\r\nhousing  estate  in  Jurong  Town  have  not  been\r\n\r\nproperly taken care of. Many fields are left  bare\r\n\r\nwithout  grass, and the trees in Jurong  Town  are\r\n\r\nnot  growing  bigger, although  they  are  growing\r\n\r\nolder.  Perhaps the soil is not very suitable,  or\r\n\r\nit  may  be  due  to other factors,  such  as  air\r\n\r\npollution thus stunting the growth of the trees. I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will urge the J.T.C, to  look\r\n\r\ninto  this. Otherwise the trees will not grow  any\r\n\r\ntaller, and will be stunted forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the complaint is that there are\r\n\r\ninsufficient playing grounds for the children. The\r\n\r\nJ.T.C, is only concerned with building houses  and\r\n\r\nhave  neglected the need for playgrounds and other\r\n\r\namenities.   This  is  not  proper,  because   the\r\n\r\nchildren  have no place to go to in the  evenings.\r\n\r\nHence,   the   importance   of   playing   fields.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  some  space  should  be  reserved  for\r\n\r\nplaygrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the collection of rubbish and refuse. I\r\n\r\nhave  received  complaints that the collection  of\r\n\r\nrefuse  and  rubbish  has not  been  regular.  The\r\n\r\nresult   is  that  a  stench  emanates  from   the\r\n\r\naccumulated   refuse  and  rubbish  heaps.   After\r\n\r\ninvestigation, I found that the J.T.C, contracted\r\n\r\nout  the  work of disposing the rubbish to private\r\n\r\ncontractors, but the contractors have bidded a low\r\n\r\ntender  and  therefore their service is  not  very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  I would like the Minister  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the  J.T.C, should get proper and  efficient\r\n\r\ncontractors to do this job. Even if they  can  get\r\n\r\ncontractors to collect and dispose of the  rubbish\r\n\r\nat  a  very low cost, it is useless if they cannot\r\n\r\ndo it properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the flats put up by the J.T.C.,\r\n\r\nespecially  those recently built, are concentrated\r\n\r\nin  a  small place and in close proximity to  each\r\n\r\nother.  The distance between one block and another\r\n\r\nis, I think, only about 10 feet. I hope the J.T.C.\r\n\r\nwill  build flats with liberal empty space between\r\n\r\nthe blocks so that there is more privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point is the serious problem of air\r\n\r\npollution.  Many residents have complained  to  me\r\n\r\nthat every morning there is a lot of black soot in\r\n\r\nthe  air.  This  probably comes from  the  factory\r\n\r\nchimneys. I hope the Minister concerned will  take\r\n\r\nnote of air pollution in Jurong Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  let me first pay a tribute to the Government\r\n\r\nfor  its  brilliant  success in industrialisation.\r\n\r\nBefore  industrialisation was embarked  upon,  our\r\n\r\ncountry  was  faced with a very grave unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.   However,   as   a   result   of   rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in this country  over  the  past\r\n\r\nfive or six years, we have been able to solve  our\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. The number of people working\r\n\r\nin the factories is now more than 100,000. This is\r\n\r\na  great success by any standard, and I would like\r\n\r\nto  express  my  admiration  to  the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation.  Jurong  is not  only  an  industrial\r\n\r\nestate,  but  is  also a place with  many  tourist\r\n\r\nattractions. For example, there is the Jurong Bird\r\n\r\nPark  with  beautiful gardens  and  various  other\r\n\r\ntourist  attractions. There are  also  playgrounds\r\n\r\nand recreational parks for our local citizens. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jurong will observe  that  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain areas which could be developed. He  should\r\n\r\nbring  them  to  the attention of the  Government,\r\n\r\nbecause he is the Member for Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to tell this\r\n\r\nHouse  how is it that this provision will be  used\r\n\r\nfor  industrialisation? What projects are  in  the\r\n\r\noffing  to  promote  further industrialisation  in\r\n\r\nJurong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  first, I would like  to  give  the\r\n\r\nMember   some   information  on  the   Development\r\n\r\nExpenditure of Jurong Town Corporation  for  1972-73.

The allocation of funds\r\n\r\nis  always a matter of judgment. However, I would\r\n\r\nsay that as the Minister for Finance -this is not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  the attitude I took when  I  was  in\r\n\r\ncharge of Jurong development - the amounts  which\r\n\r\nhave been provided for sports complexes, swimming\r\n\r\npools, playgrounds, parks, Jurong Bird Park,  and\r\n\r\nso  on, are more than adequate for the purposes.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I am not quite sure whether the amounts\r\n\r\nprovided,  in  relation to other  constituencies,\r\n\r\nare  not excessive. Having listened to the recent\r\n\r\ndebate on the provision for overhead bridges  and\r\n\r\nother amenities for Sembawang, I think that  $4.3\r\n\r\nmillion for Jurong Park is certainly ample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also taken note of the comment of the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong on the health of the trees  and\r\n\r\ngrasses. I am not responsible for this and  other\r\n\r\ndetails    of    Jurong   housekeeping    -    my\r\n\r\nresponsibility   being   confined    to    giving\r\n\r\ndirections  to  the  Jurong Town  Corporation  on\r\n\r\nmatters  affecting policy. I am sure he  is  more\r\n\r\nkeenly interested and, therefore, he would have a\r\n\r\ngreater  knowledge  of  the  details  of   Jurong\r\n\r\ndevelopment. However. I am prepared  to  pass  on\r\n\r\nhis  comments to the Jurong Town Corporation  for\r\n\r\ntheir   consideration.  1  have  been  given   to\r\n\r\nunderstand,  however, that some of  his  comments\r\n\r\nare   not  necessarily  correct.  The  Parks  and\r\n\r\nRecreation Unit of the Jurong Town Corporation is\r\n\r\ncontinuing  to  provide from its  nursery  enough\r\n\r\ntrees  for  planting especially  in  the  housing\r\n\r\nareas  and  in  open spaces, in addition  to  the\r\n\r\nroadside  planting carried out by the  Trees  and\r\n\r\nParks  Unit  of  the Public Works Department.  In\r\n\r\n1971  the  number of trees planted by the  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  Corporation is 14,800, and  the  number  of\r\n\r\nshrubs   74,900.   This  is  considerably   heavy\r\n\r\nplanting. As for the statement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the trees are growing older but not bigger,\r\n\r\nI  think this is merely an impression. Some trees\r\n\r\nare  slow-growing  and, therefore,  the  Member's\r\n\r\nimpression  that  they are not  thriving  is  not\r\n\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to refuse from the residential flats\r\n\r\nin  Jurong  Town,  I understand  that  refuse  is\r\n\r\ncollected   by   the   Jurong  Town   conservancy\r\n\r\ncontractor every day and deposited in the various\r\n\r\nbin centres set up by the Ministry of Health.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as  I know, the Public Health Department  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health regularly clear the  bins\r\n\r\nevery  day.  They have checked on  this.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nsometimes  unusually large amounts of refuse  may\r\n\r\nbe  accumulated  after the daily  clearing,  arid\r\n\r\nthis  could  have given the impression  that  the\r\n\r\nrefuse is not collected daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about the design of\r\n\r\nthe  flats and that the blocks of flats  are  too\r\n\r\nclose to one another, the position is as follows.\r\n\r\nThe  distance between each 10-storey block is  90\r\n\r\nfeet  and between each 5-storey block is 50 feet,\r\n\r\nwhen the flats are facing one another. This ratio\r\n\r\nis  the  same  as for Queenstown  and  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nhousing  estates. In the design  of  the  special\r\n\r\ntype  of  staggered-blocks of 4-room  flats, the\r\n\r\n.Jurong Town Corporation thought that the hack of\r\n\r\nthe  block of flats should face the back  of  the\r\n\r\nother block of fiats and, therefore, you have the\r\n\r\nkitchens  of  one block facing those  of  another\r\n\r\nblock.  But  the  front of each block  of  flats.\r\n\r\nwhich  face the opposite direction, would have  a\r\n\r\nvast  open area so that the sitting room and  the\r\n\r\nmain bedroom will not face those of another flat,\r\n\r\nthus  affording greater privacy for the  tenants.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the kitchens in the rear  of\r\n\r\ntwo  blocks  of  flats in the first  experimental\r\n\r\nstage  is 22\ufffd feet. This was necessitated by  the\r\n\r\nsmall site available and the necessity to provide\r\n\r\nample  open space for car parking areas. But  the\r\n\r\ndistance  between the kitchens of two  blocks  of\r\n\r\nsuch  flats  now under construction  will  be  35\r\n\r\nfeet, which should be considered as standard.  A\r\n\r\ndistance  of more than 35 feet will, I think  add\r\n\r\nto the cost of construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H.

I  am  told  that   the\r\n\r\nadmission  fees for the Bird Park are as  high  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  because  of  the  exorbitant  rate   of\r\n\r\ninterest,  which is about 7X per cent, charged  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance for their loan. If we add\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  property tax is  payable  on  the\r\n\r\nproperties, then the charges to the public for the\r\n\r\nuse of such facilities must necessarily be high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the interest\r\n\r\nrates  for  the various loans to the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  have been carefully  negotiated  with\r\n\r\nthem.

I do not know exactly\r\n\r\nwhere we stand. I appreciate the reason that maybe\r\n\r\nwe  should not subsidise by reducing the  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest  to, say, four or five per  cent  on  the\r\n\r\nloans  to the Company. But I would think that  six\r\n\r\nper  cent,  which  is the rate  of  interest  that\r\n\r\npeople  normally get on fixed deposits, would  be\r\n\r\nthe  rate  to  charge, for then we  would  not  be\r\n\r\nsubsidising nor would we be making any profit.

I do not know what\r\n\r\nthe  P.U.B, is going to do with the $25  million.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  I wish to raise some queries. I  wish  to\r\n\r\nquery  the P.U.B, on the manner in which it  deals\r\n\r\nwith  the  public as far as deposit  accounts  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Let me point out an example.  A  widow\r\n\r\nwho wanted to transfer the account of her husband,\r\n\r\nwho  was  the sole breadwinner in the family,  was\r\n\r\nasked  to  pay  another deposit and  start  a  new\r\n\r\naccount.  I  want to know why the deposit  already\r\n\r\npaid  by the husband cannot be used. She was  told\r\n\r\nthat  the  original deposit will be refunded  only\r\n\r\nlater on and subject to a claim for it. May I  ask\r\n\r\nwhy  is the P.U.B, so heartless, especially to the\r\n\r\nlower-income group? The P.U.B, seems to  give  the\r\n\r\nimpression to the public that it is doing  a  very\r\n\r\nbig favour for a very small service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a further example of how the P.U.B.\r\n\r\nmetes out a shabby form of treatment to the lower-income  group.  The  rich  who  can  afford   air-\r\n\r\nconditioners  in their homes are charged  a  lower\r\n\r\nrate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  their  electricity supply. While  unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople  who only want better ventilation by  using\r\n\r\nfans  are  charged a higher rate because fans  can\r\n\r\nonly be connected to the lighting points. This  is\r\n\r\na  terrible injustice on the part of P.U.B. It  is\r\n\r\nhigh  time that this unjust form of charges should\r\n\r\nbe brought in line with the socialist practice. It\r\n\r\nis  also  hoped that when the P.U.B, introduces  a\r\n\r\nuniform  rate  of  charges  for  both  power   and\r\n\r\nlighting in the near future its officers will take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the plight of the lower-income\r\n\r\ngroup.  To  charge a uniform rate  for  power  and\r\n\r\nlighting  is  a  good  idea.  But  it  must  be  a\r\n\r\nreasonable charge for the lower-income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the P.U.B, is\r\n\r\nusing naphtha as feedstock in order to reduce  air\r\n\r\npollution.  Is the P.U.B, aware that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  finding  it cheaper to use the commercialised\r\n\r\nbottled  gas, and has the P.U.B, any intention  of\r\n\r\nreducing the charge for their domestic gas  so  as\r\n\r\nto  compete  at par with commercial  suppliers  of\r\n\r\nbottled gas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision\r\n\r\nof  $25 million to the P.U.B, is for any shortfall\r\n\r\nin financing which may be experienced by them.

It is either that or he pays\r\n\r\na  new  deposit  until the old  account  has  been\r\n\r\nsettled.  Where  the  new consumer  pays  his  own\r\n\r\ndeposit, the old consumer's deposit will  then  be\r\n\r\nused  to settle any of the outstanding charges  on\r\n\r\nthe  closing  of the account and the  balance, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  will  then  be  refunded  to  whoever  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to  it or to the administrators  of  the\r\n\r\nestate.

It would appear, however,  that  there\r\n\r\nare   enough  consumers  who  consider  PUB, gas\r\n\r\ncompetitive with other methods of heating, and the\r\n\r\nP.U.B, has been extending its gas supply to  ever\r\n\r\nlarger areas.

Firstly,  can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nexplain to this House whether Alsagoff Estate  has\r\n\r\nbeen  bought  over by the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard?  The reason for my question is that when  I\r\n\r\nsubmitted  an  application for  amenities  to  the\r\n\r\nUrban  and Rural Services Committee, they  replied\r\n\r\nthat permission is required from the landlord.

However,  they  are   still\r\n\r\ncollecting  ground  rent  from  the  occupiers  of\r\n\r\nAlsagoff  Estate every month.

He has said so a little while ago\r\n\r\nin this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final question is when will the development\r\n\r\nprojects be started?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under\r\n\r\nthis  subhead we can see that the vote is for  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board.  The  Board  has\r\n\r\nundeniably contributed much and has achieved  very\r\n\r\ngood  results  in public housing.  At  the  moment\r\n\r\nthere  are  half a million people staying  in  the\r\n\r\nflats  built by the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\nBecause of this we have successfully resolved  the\r\n\r\nproblem of housing shortage. On the other hand,  a\r\n\r\nfew  years  ago,  we  started  the  home-ownership\r\n\r\nscheme under which we sold the flats to people  of\r\n\r\nthe  lower and middle income groups to enable them\r\n\r\nto  possess  their own houses. This is a  laudable\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise three questions which I\r\n\r\nhope to get a reply from the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Where will the project be sited? I-low is\r\n\r\nthe  amount allocated under this vote going to  be\r\n\r\nused and in what areas? Other than the building of\r\n\r\nhousing  estates, will the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  also  be  interested in  building  shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes and hawker centres?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I have received certain complaints from shop\r\n\r\ntenants that the rentals are too high. They  would\r\n\r\nlike to request the Government to consider selling\r\n\r\nthe  shop premises to the present tenants on hire-purchase  terms. At the moment we have  the  home-\r\n\r\nownership  scheme for the dwellers,  and  I  think\r\n\r\nperhaps we can also consider extending this scheme\r\n\r\nto  tenants  of Housing Board shop premises.  This\r\n\r\nwill help to resolve their problem of high rentals\r\n\r\nand  also help them to maintain their business.  I\r\n\r\nremember I raised this question last year in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  and  the Minister replied  that  he  would\r\n\r\nconvey my suggestion to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board to carry out  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  to  find  out  the response  of  the  shop\r\n\r\ntenants. I would like to ask the Minister now what\r\n\r\nwas  the result of the survey and how good was the\r\n\r\nresponse.  Are these shop tenants willing  to  buy\r\n\r\nover  the shop premises constructed by the Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Now that we are engaged in the Second Five-Year Development Plan, 20,000 units of flats will\r\n\r\nbe  built this year. There are many people on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list  for  flats,  and  they  are  rather\r\n\r\nworried  because fewer and fewer flats  are  being\r\n\r\nreleased  for rental. If they want to  buy  flats,\r\n\r\nthey must have some money in the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund before they can register. And since the lower\r\n\r\nincome   group  do  not  have  sufficient   C.P.F.\r\n\r\ndeposits  at  their disposal, they are  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to buy. So we should consider continuing\r\n\r\nrenting  out  flats to people in the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup.  I would like the Minister to give  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration to these suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, the sum of $180 million is\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the  1972-73  Development  Estimates\r\n\r\nunder   this   subhead,  \"Loan  to   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board\", for its programme for the year\r\n\r\n1972-73.   Government  loans  to  the  Board   are\r\n\r\ndetermined  on  the  basis of  their  own  overall\r\n\r\nbuilding programme. The target this year is 20,000\r\n\r\nunits  of flats, and the loan is to meet the total\r\n\r\nfinancial needs for the year. As such, the loan is\r\n\r\nnot  specifically  tied to any particular  housing\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Alsagoff Estate is concerned, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will, of course, provide the  necessary\r\n\r\nloans to the Housing and Development Board, but as\r\n\r\nI have pointed out before, any overall development\r\n\r\nof  this  low-lying area will first require  major\r\n\r\nroad  and  drainage improvement schemes. The  Sims\r\n\r\nAvenue extension was completed last year. The Pan-Island  Expressway from Paya Lebar Road  to  Jalan\r\n\r\nEunos  will  be  completed soon; I believe,  in  a\r\n\r\nmonth  or two. Further, both Jalan Eunos and Jalan\r\n\r\nUbi,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the Member for Kampong Kembangan is aware, are\r\n\r\nbeing widened and improved and brighter lights are\r\n\r\nbeing installed along these two roads. I think the\r\n\r\nMember     appreciates    that    the    necessary\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  has to be laid for pre-development\r\n\r\nof  the whole area which also has to be taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration   extensions  to  the   Paya   Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for acquisition, the land north of the Pan-Island Expressway was gazetted for acquisition on\r\n\r\nthe 2nd February last year, and the land south  of\r\n\r\nthe Expressway on the 20th September last year.  A\r\n\r\nsurvey of the population in the area has not  been\r\n\r\ncompleted  and  possession of  the  land  not  yet\r\n\r\ntaken,  so that some projects by the U.R.S.C, may\r\n\r\nstill  need  the  consent of the trustees  of  the\r\n\r\nestate  concerned.  But  the  stumbling  block  to\r\n\r\nredevelopment is, of course, resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the two new roads which I have\r\n\r\nmentioned,    there   were   1,200    cases    for\r\n\r\nresettlement, involving about 4,000 persons. On  a\r\n\r\nrough  estimate, there would be more  than  15,000\r\n\r\ncases  of  resettlement  involving  about  100,000\r\n\r\npeople  for the whole area. They cannot be evicted\r\n\r\nor  resettled until new homes are built.  This  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done in housing estates in Kallang, Geylang\r\n\r\nEast, Kampong Chai Chee, and the Bedok new town on\r\n\r\nthe  cut  side between Changi Road and Upper  East\r\n\r\nCoast Road. I assure the Member that steps will be\r\n\r\ntaken to provide low-cost housing within the  area\r\n\r\nitself  together with light industrial  facilities\r\n\r\nto  cater for the needs of the residents. A  large\r\n\r\npart  of  the estate lies in the way  of  the  air\r\n\r\nroute  which  aeroplanes take  when  departing  or\r\n\r\narriving  at  Paya  Lebar Airport,  and  buildings\r\n\r\nalong  this  stretch of land must  necessarily  be\r\n\r\nlow.  I  would  like to reassure the  Member  that\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  is  very much in the  Government's\r\n\r\nplans,  but  it will take many years  to  complete\r\n\r\nplans  for its development. The area north of  the\r\n\r\nPan-Island Expressway will be developed first  and\r\n\r\nlater  the  area south, but the exact commencement\r\n\r\ndate for the development will depend on when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  can  find alternative homes. But homes  alone\r\n\r\nare  not enough. People must not only be given new\r\n\r\nhomes  to move into but their capacity to  earn  a\r\n\r\nliving  from  light  industries,  which  could  be\r\n\r\nprofitably   established  in  the  area,   is   an\r\n\r\nimportant    factor    in    rehabilitation    and\r\n\r\nredevelopment.  With  the  co-operation   of   the\r\n\r\nresidents and the active support of the Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  for  the  area, I  am  confident  that\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  can  and will be  turned  into  an\r\n\r\nattractive  and  well-planned area with  healthier\r\n\r\nconditions for our citizens to live and work in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Sembawang, he asked\r\n\r\ncertain  questions, one of which  is:  where  will\r\n\r\nthese  housing  projects be? I  mentioned  a  few.\r\n\r\nThere  are  other  projects all over  Singapore  -\r\n\r\nWoodlands,  Toa  Payoh, Queenstown,  Farrer  Road,\r\n\r\nRedhill,  Telok Blangah are some of  the  few.  He\r\n\r\nasked:  will there be shopping centres and  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres? Certainly. But he complained that some of\r\n\r\nthe rentals of shops are too high, and at the same\r\n\r\ntime and in the same breath he said they wanted to\r\n\r\nbuy.  This  is what I do not understand.  If  they\r\n\r\ncannot pay the rents, which they say are too high,\r\n\r\nhow  can  they afford to buy? But on this question\r\n\r\nof wanting to buy shops, it is not the same as the\r\n\r\nhome-ownership  scheme for  tenants  who  live  in\r\n\r\nflats. The qualifications are different. Hence  it\r\n\r\nis also difficult to sell. You do not have to be a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of Singapore to tender for a Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board shop premises, but you  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  citizen of Singapore if you want to  buy  a\r\n\r\nHousing Board flat to live in. So are we to extend\r\n\r\nthis scheme to non-citizens too? If we do sell, we\r\n\r\nmust  obviously sell to everybody. We cannot  pick\r\n\r\nand  choose.  That  is just one  reason.  But  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board has considered this for  some  time\r\n\r\nnow  and, after the Member's request last year,  I\r\n\r\nam afraid the answer is still no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for renting out - this is the third time I am\r\n\r\nsaying  this, probably the Member has not been  in\r\n\r\nthe  House - I gave the assurance that 20 per cent\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  new two-room and three-room flats will still\r\n\r\nbe let out, and 80 per cent will be sold. But, of\r\n\r\ncourse, the one-room flats are the ones that  are\r\n\r\nin demand, and most of them are being let out.  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  only one per cent  of  one-room\r\n\r\nflats that have been sold. In other words, it  is\r\n\r\ncheaper to rent them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I wish\r\n\r\nto  assure  the  Minister for  Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment that the problem of resettlement will\r\n\r\nnot  be  difficult. I believe that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nknows  how the Housing and Development Board  had\r\n\r\nresettled the families affected by the Pan-Island\r\n\r\nExpressway project. Likewise, Sir, if  this  area\r\n\r\nis  redeveloped,  I am sure the  residents  there\r\n\r\nwill  give  their  fullest  co-operation  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, the Minister said that the\r\n\r\nfirst   problem   is   resettlement   and    that\r\n\r\ndevelopment will take place in a few years' time.\r\n\r\nSir,   the  problem  which  will  arise  if  this\r\n\r\ndevelopment were to take place in a few years  is\r\n\r\nthat  the residents there will continue  to  live\r\n\r\nunder  conditions where they will have bad  roads\r\n\r\nand   flooded  drains,  including  the   mosquito\r\n\r\nmenace,   if  the  U.R.S.C, cannot  give   prior\r\n\r\nconsideration to repair the bad roads and drains.\r\n\r\nThe  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development said just now that  because\r\n\r\nthese areas are affected by redevelopment, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  wise to repair the by-roads in the area.  If\r\n\r\nthis  area  is not going to be developed,  or  it\r\n\r\nwill  take  a long time to develop it,  it  means\r\n\r\nthat   the  residents  there  will  continue   to\r\n\r\nexperience  the  difficulties  which   they   had\r\n\r\nexperienced  over the past years. In implementing\r\n\r\nthis  redevelopment, Sir, will the  residents  be\r\n\r\ngiven  facilities and equal, if not more priority\r\n\r\nthan  the residents who are affected in the other\r\n\r\nareas, in matters such as compensation, choice of\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation offered by the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board, and whether they will  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  return to their old place  it  and\r\n\r\nwhen the Housing and Development Board flats  are\r\n\r\ncompleted? If these problems can be considered by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  assure  him  the residents  there  will  co-operate whole-heartedly with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  a  while  ago, the Minister  said  that  if\r\n\r\npeople cannot afford to pay the high rentals  for\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board shop premises,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not understand how they can afford  to  buy\r\n\r\nthem. I would like to tell the Minister that this\r\n\r\nis  a long-term investment plan. They can try  to\r\n\r\nget  a  larger sum of money as a deposit. If  the\r\n\r\nproperty belongs to them they do not have to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  high rental. So the instalment payment  will\r\n\r\nbe  less than the payment for rental of the  shop\r\n\r\npremises. Then they will be able to tide over and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  do  their business on  a  long-term\r\n\r\ninvestment basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the survey, the Minister said that\r\n\r\nthe  result was \"no\". I wonder whether  this  was\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  response  after  the  survey,  or\r\n\r\nwhether the \"no\" came direct from him. I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister will be able to clarify these points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his mention that there is a problem\r\n\r\nbetween  selling  Housing Board premises  to  our\r\n\r\ncitizens   and   non-citizens,   some   kind   of\r\n\r\nadjustment can be made. Of course, we should look\r\n\r\nafter  our own citizens first and give  them  the\r\n\r\npriority of buying these premises. After the non-citizens  have  got their citizenship,  they  may\r\n\r\nthen  be  qualified  to buy  Housing  Board  shop\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, the Minister said that the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board  has  decided  to\r\n\r\nallot  20 per cent of flats for rent. I think  it\r\n\r\nis  not  enough  because I have information  that\r\n\r\nthere  are more than 10,000 people on the waiting\r\n\r\nlist  to rent flats. In other words, 20 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the  new two-room and three-room flats  would\r\n\r\nnumber  about  4,000 units. But if there  are  at\r\n\r\npresent  more than 10,000 people on  the  waiting\r\n\r\nlist,  after five years there will be  more  than\r\n\r\n100,000  people which means that every  applicant\r\n\r\nwill  have to wait for more than two years before\r\n\r\nhe can be allotted a flat for rent. So I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister can consider increasing the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npercentage of flats for rent to 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if we raise the rate of flats\r\n\r\nfor  rent  to 40 per cent, there will be  less  to\r\n\r\nsell.  I do not want to get into an argument  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member about either financial or construction\r\n\r\nfigures of the Housing Board. But the waiting list\r\n\r\nto  buy has left the waiting list to rent very far\r\n\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the survey, the answer \"no\" did not come\r\n\r\nfrom the survey but from the Housing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can deal with the questions raised by the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan, Geylang Serai is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  involved in this Alsagoff Estate. I cannot\r\n\r\ntell him exactly when development plans will start\r\n\r\nexcept to indicate that the area north of the Pan-Island  Expressway  will be developed  first.  The\r\n\r\nMember  said  that  if  we  can  find  alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  these 4,000  people  stretched\r\n\r\nalong   the   two  roads,  surely  we   can   find\r\n\r\naccommodation for the others. The answer  is  yes.\r\n\r\nBut  it takes time. There were 4,000 along the two\r\n\r\nroads,  but there are 100,000 in the whole estate.\r\n\r\nThat  is quite a big number. The Member also asked\r\n\r\nwhether  some  of the residents affected  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed to go back. The answer is yes, but  surely\r\n\r\nnot  all.  It  is difficult to evict everyone  and\r\n\r\nthen put them back. But I am sure some of them can\r\n\r\ngo back if they love the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for compensation and resettlement rates, they\r\n\r\nwill be entitled to the current rates. It makes no\r\n\r\ndifference   whether  they  come  from  Kembangan,\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai, Sembawang, or Jurong - everybody is\r\n\r\npaid  the same rates. As for priority, of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  given priority for  Housing  Board\r\n\r\naccommodation.  If  they are not  given  priority,\r\n\r\nthen  they  are  not resettled  and  there  is  no\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan also asked\r\n\r\nabout  priority for employment. I  think  that  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to give. We cannot force any employer to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemploy  whoever  the  Member  would  like  to   be\r\n\r\nemployed.  Of  course,  they  will  be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to apply for such employment, and this\r\n\r\nis  up to the employer. But the whole intention is\r\n\r\nto try and set up light industries within the area\r\n\r\nso  that  the people not only can live there,  but\r\n\r\ncan also find employment in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd.

He has  just\r\n\r\nstated  that this area will be developed first.  I\r\n\r\nwant  an assurance from the Minister that  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  the drains, roads, and the  by-roads  of\r\n\r\nthis  area  be  repaired by  the  U.R.S.C, before\r\n\r\ncommencement of the development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sorry, Sir, that I did not deal\r\n\r\nwith  that  point.

As  the\r\n\r\nMember knows, the area has not been neglected.  As\r\n\r\nI  pointed  out earlier, two big roads  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt,  one  is the extension of Sims Avenue,  and\r\n\r\nthe  other  the Pan-Island Expressway  right  from\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  Road to Jalan Eunos,  which  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  in  a  month or two.

They\r\n\r\ncost millions of dollars. There have been requests\r\n\r\nto repair minor roads within the area, but not all\r\n\r\nof  them  have been attended to because there  are\r\n\r\nalso  other roads in other areas, and we  have  to\r\n\r\nstrike  a  balance between Kampong  Kembangan  and\r\n\r\nChua  Chu  Kang, or between Kampong Kembangan  and\r\n\r\nJurong,   or   between   Kampong   Kembangan   and\r\n\r\nSembawang.

Can this  act  of\r\n\r\nvandalism be prevented by lighting the booths  so\r\n\r\nthat  such acts can easily be detected?

I would\r\n\r\nlike to express my appreciation of the Police, as\r\n\r\nconditions have since improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  mention the various measures which have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Singapore Telephone Board to reduce\r\n\r\nacts  of  vandalism. It is unfortunate that  some\r\n\r\npeople who use public telephones are inclined to\r\n\r\nput  match  sticks into the dials, and  therefore\r\n\r\njamming the mechanism. These are minor irritants.\r\n\r\nBut  when  we  have cases of severe  damage,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  when  the handsets  are  smashed  -  we\r\n\r\nconsider  this  a  major damage -  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephones Board has been instructed to  contact,\r\n\r\nfirst, the Member of Parliament for that area  to\r\n\r\nseek   his  assistance, because  he  knows   his\r\n\r\nconstituents best. He may know where the bad hats\r\n\r\nare  and  where  the troublesome  people  usually\r\n\r\ncongregate.  Therefore,  through  the  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  we will also be able to  liase  with\r\n\r\nthe   Citizens'  Consultative  Committee,   whose\r\n\r\nmembers  are at the grass-root level.  They  know\r\n\r\nwhich  streets are \"good\" and which  streets  are\r\n\r\n\"not   very  good\"  for  the  siting  of   public\r\n\r\ntelephones. It is through the assistance and  co-operation  of  Members  of  Parliament  and   the\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committees that  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to reduce the previous high  rate  of\r\n\r\nvandalism and to bring it down to a check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Singapore Telephone Board also\r\n\r\nsecures the assistance of the Vigilante Corps. For\r\n\r\ninstance,   in   the  course  of   their   duties,\r\n\r\nespecially  at  night, they could pass  by  public\r\n\r\ntelephones  booths more often than  usual  and  to\r\n\r\nkeep   an   eye   on  them.  This  assistance   is\r\n\r\nparticularly   sought  where  there   are   public\r\n\r\ntelephones in remote areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Singapore Telephone Board has begun\r\n\r\nto remove the spring doors of telephone booths. In\r\n\r\nthe  past we thought that wooden doors would  give\r\n\r\nthe users some privacy. However, we now think that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a good idea. We are going to  remove\r\n\r\nthe doors so that if anyone tries to prise open  a\r\n\r\ncoin  box, he can easily be seen by passers-by  or\r\n\r\nby the Police patrol cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there will be more frequent visits to\r\n\r\nthe  telephone  booths by the Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard coin collectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the measures we have taken so far, but\r\n\r\nother  measures  are being contemplated.  Firstly,\r\n\r\npublic  telephones will be located in  conspicuous\r\n\r\nplaces, like community centres. Secondly,  we  are\r\n\r\nconsidering the possibility of installing  burglar\r\n\r\nalarms,  as  has been suggested by the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.  Of  course,  such  devices  can  only   be\r\n\r\ninstalled  if the cost is not too prohibitive.  It\r\n\r\nshould be reasonably economical. If we install  an\r\n\r\nalarm which costs $1,000 in order to collect $10 a\r\n\r\nmonth,  then it is not economical. Of  course,  we\r\n\r\nwill  try  to educate the public through the  mass\r\n\r\nmedia, that is, the radio and the television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also consider the question of lighting\r\n\r\nthe  booths. Here it is a question of cost. Is  it\r\n\r\neconomically  worthwhile to provide  lighting  for\r\n\r\nthe  booths  as  against  the  provision  of  more\r\n\r\ncoinafons  in coffee shops? We will have  to  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the timing device for public\r\n\r\ntelephones, it is true that some people do put  in\r\n\r\nten cents and talk for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhalf  an  hour.  This is unreasonable,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen there are other people waiting to make use of\r\n\r\nthe   telephone.   We  are  now  considering   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of introducing a timing device  which\r\n\r\nwill automatically disconnect the call after three\r\n\r\nminutes. The cost of such a device is estimated at\r\n\r\n$150.   As  there  are  more  than  1,200   public\r\n\r\ntelephones, the capital expenditure involved could\r\n\r\namount  to $200,000. It is a sizable sum to  spend\r\n\r\non  such a device. We will have to study the  cost\r\n\r\nbenefits to see whether it is worthwhile to  spend\r\n\r\nsuch a large sum of money. In the meantime, we can\r\n\r\nonly  hope that the public will cooperate, so that\r\n\r\nif  they  do not make use of the public telephones\r\n\r\nfor  such a long time, we would not have to  spend\r\n\r\n$200,000  to cut off the call automatically  after\r\n\r\nthree minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of vandalism, Sir, perhaps\r\n\r\nthis  is  a good opportunity for me to remind  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  especially members of the public, that  we\r\n\r\ndo  have  the  Vandalism Act (Chapter 108)  where,\r\n\r\nunder  section  2  (b)  of this  Act,  an  act  of\r\n\r\nvandalism   includes  \"stealing,   destroying   or\r\n\r\ndamaging   any  public  property\".   And   \"public\r\n\r\nproperty\"   has  been  defined  as   \"movable   or\r\n\r\nimmovable  property belonging to the Government...\r\n\r\nor  to  any  statutory body...\". And the Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board is a statutory body.  Any  person\r\n\r\nfound  guilty  of  acts  of  vandalism,  such   as\r\n\r\nstealing,  destroying or damaging public telephone\r\n\r\nbooths  is  liable, on conviction, to a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not\r\n\r\nexceeding three years, and shall also be  punished\r\n\r\nwith  caning with not less than three strokes  and\r\n\r\nnot   more   than  eight  strokes.  I  think   the\r\n\r\npunishment  by  caning will  deter  many  acts  of\r\n\r\nvandalism in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

I  of 1972. Sir, it would appear  that  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore has the lion's share\r\n\r\nof  this  loan. But the House is not  sufficiently\r\n\r\ninformed  as  to  how  the  Development  Bank   of\r\n\r\nSingapore will make use of this loan. As stated in\r\n\r\nthe  Memorandum, the Government has  approved  ten\r\n\r\nlines  of credit to the Bank, totalling some  $411\r\n\r\nmillion.

The breakdown has been given  as  $58\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the Development Bank  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\n$11.5 million for Jurong Shipbuilders (Pte.) Ltd.,\r\n\r\n$25 million for the Neptune Orient Lines, and $1.6\r\n\r\nmillion for the other companies, making a total of\r\n\r\n$96.1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans to the D.B.S, are intended for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  assisting the Bank in financing  part  of  its\r\n\r\nlending   operations,  mainly   in   manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries, shipbuilding, real estate development,\r\n\r\ntransport  projects,  and  some  projects  of  the\r\n\r\nM.S.A, for which loans are also to be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines of credit, as indicated by their name,\r\n\r\nare  not project loans. It means that the projects\r\n\r\nare  not  known in advance. This is  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nfinancing  which  the World  Bank  and  the  Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank do when they provide loans to the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank of Singapore. A sum is  provided\r\n\r\nand the disbursements are made upon projects being\r\n\r\nreceived by the Development Bank of Singapore  and\r\n\r\ncarefully  assessed as to their credit-worthiness.\r\n\r\nThe  actual  projects  are  not  known  except  by\r\n\r\ncategories.

One line of credit is to finance the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  freedom-type vessels  built  by  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Ship-builders (Private) Ltd, for  Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient Lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jurong Shipbuilders (Private),\r\n\r\nLtd, there  is also a loan to finance  the  major\r\n\r\npart  of  the  cost  of  imported  materials   for\r\n\r\nshipbuilding   during  the   initial   period   of\r\n\r\noperation of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, requires funds for\r\n\r\npurchasing  a  number of ships  and  tankers.

The Singapore Mariners'  Club\r\n\r\noperates toe seamen's hostel at South Quay,  while\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Sailors' Institute until  recently\r\n\r\noperated Connell House. Connell House reverted  to\r\n\r\nGovernment in August last year, and its  clientele\r\n\r\nare  now  using  the  faculties  provided  by  the\r\n\r\nrenovated  Singapore Mariners' Club, inc  Seamen's\r\n\r\nLodging-Houses Licensing Authority is  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  issuing licences to seamen's lodging  houses,\r\n\r\nbut  has been practically a moribund body for some\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above five authorities have historical\r\n\r\norigins.  Circumstances have changed  considerably\r\n\r\nover  the last decade and it would be more logical\r\n\r\nto  amalgamate the five bodies into one  authority\r\n\r\nto  be known as the National Maritime Board.  This\r\n\r\nmove  will  eliminate over-lapping  functions  and\r\n\r\nwill  result  in  more efficient organisation  and\r\n\r\nadministration of seafarers matters,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nbetter  co-ordination  of  the  various  functions\r\n\r\npresently performed the five different bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now summarise briefly the main\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill. The Board will consist of\r\n\r\nnine members with representatives from Government.\r\n\r\nship-owners and seamen. Such a compact Board  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to perform its functions more effectively\r\n\r\nthan a large unwieldy board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the Board are to develop and\r\n\r\nregulate maritime employment and to administer\r\n\r\nwelfare and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining schemes. The Board will also advise  the\r\n\r\nMinister  on  matters relating to  seafaring  and\r\n\r\nsuch other related matters which the Minister may\r\n\r\nrefer to the Board for advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the proper administration of funds, there\r\n\r\nis established a National Maritime Fund into which\r\n\r\nall  moneys of the Board shall be paid. The moneys\r\n\r\nin  the existing Singapore Mercantile Marine  Fund\r\n\r\nshall  be  transferred  to The  National  Maritime\r\n\r\nFund.  The  Board  may, with the approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister, Invest any surplus funds in such  stocks\r\n\r\nand  securities and other investments  as  may  be\r\n\r\napproved by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 is a re-enactment of the substance of\r\n\r\nthe  Seamen's  Registry Board Act  which  requires\r\n\r\nshipowners  to engage seamen through the  Seamen's\r\n\r\nRegistry  Board  system. Clause  20  provides  for\r\n\r\npenalties both for the employer and seamen in  the\r\n\r\nevent of breach of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is empowered, with the approval of the\r\n\r\nMinister,   to  make  regulations.  These   powers\r\n\r\ninclude  the power to prescribe the procedures  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the  seamen may be selected for employment.\r\n\r\nAt  present, these procedures are spelt out in the\r\n\r\nSeamen's  Registry Board Act itself, but when  the\r\n\r\nNational  Maritime Board Bill comes into force  it\r\n\r\nis  proposed  that  such procedures  will  be  re-enacted by way of regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the National Maritime Board Act comes into\r\n\r\noperation, the Seamen's Registry Board, Seafarers'\r\n\r\nWelfare  Board, Singapore Mariners' Club,  Connell\r\n\r\nHouse  Committee  and the Seamen's  Lodging-Houses\r\n\r\nLicensing Authority shall cease to exist. However,\r\n\r\nseamen  who  are  already  registered  under   the\r\n\r\nSeamen's Registry Board Act shall be deemed to  be\r\n\r\nregistered under the National Maritime Board  Act.\r\n\r\nThe  existing staff of all these authorities shall\r\n\r\nbe  deemed to be transferred to the service of the\r\n\r\nNational   Maritime  Board  on  terms   not   less\r\n\r\nfavourable  than  those they  enjoyed  immediately\r\n\r\nprior to their transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Members that\r\n\r\norganisations  representing  shipowners,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Shipping  Association  and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Shipowners   Association,    maritime\r\n\r\nemployers  like the Singapore Maritime  Employers\r\n\r\nFederation  as well as the National Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress, have been consulted in tile drafting of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  and many of their comments have  been\r\n\r\nincorporated in this Bill. I take the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  thank these organisations concerned for their\r\n\r\nvaluable comments and advice in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the shipping scene in\r\n\r\nSingapore today is vastly different from what  it\r\n\r\nwas  ten  years  ago. Not only is  our  port  the\r\n\r\nfourth  busiest in the world, but today  we  have\r\n\r\nour  own  national  shipping  line,  the  Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient Line. There are at present some 635  ships\r\n\r\ntotalling 893,779 gross tons registered under our\r\n\r\nSingapore flag. We not only repair ships  but  we\r\n\r\ncan  also  build and sail them as well.  We  have\r\n\r\nover  8,000 seamen on the register and  close  to\r\n\r\n1,000 Singapore citizens serving as ship officers\r\n\r\nand  engineers. All this progress in the shipping\r\n\r\nfield  has been achieved over the last ten years,\r\n\r\nand  we are confident of yet greater progress  in\r\n\r\nthe years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this progress there has arisen a need for\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of  a single  body  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the members of  the  mercantile\r\n\r\nmarine in a more efficient manner. Although  this\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  essentially to amalgamate  the  five\r\n\r\nmarine  statutory authorities into  one  National\r\n\r\nMaritime  Board,  it  is  nevertheless   a   step\r\n\r\nforward.    One   of   the   benefits   following\r\n\r\ncentralisation would he that the new Board  would\r\n\r\nbe  more capable of assessing the changing  needs\r\n\r\nof  seafarers in the rapidly changing  technology\r\n\r\nof  the shipping industry in Singapore and, where\r\n\r\nnecessary,   the   Board   could   recommend   to\r\n\r\nGovernment areas for improvement and reform, once\r\n\r\nit has settled down to its duties. I am confident\r\n\r\nthat  the  National Maritime Board, when  formed,\r\n\r\nwould  pursue vigorously its aims and  objectives\r\n\r\nand thereby contribute to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  development  of  Singapore  as  a  great\r\n\r\nshipping centre of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise in support of the National Maritime\r\n\r\nBoard Bill, but subject to such qualifications as\r\n\r\nI  shall later on detail in my speech. The  topic\r\n\r\nof  maritime  employment is  a  matter  of  great\r\n\r\ninterest  to  the NTUC which have  sponsored  the\r\n\r\nformation   of  the  Singapore  Organisation   of\r\n\r\nSeamen, a registered trade union to organise  and\r\n\r\nrepresent  seamen in relation to their respective\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC, therefore, have reasons t' be\r\n\r\ngrateful  for  the  opportunity  to  give   their\r\n\r\ncomments  while  the Ministry  of  Communications\r\n\r\nwere in the process of drafting the Bill. Some of\r\n\r\nthe    recommendations   contained   in    NTUC's\r\n\r\nmemorandum  to the Ministry, I am  glad  to  say,\r\n\r\nhave  been incorporated into the Bill before  the\r\n\r\nHouse. The accepted recommendations include those\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the definitions of \"seafarer\"  and\r\n\r\n\"employer\", and with the imposition of a  penalty\r\n\r\nagainst    employers    engaging    seamen     in\r\n\r\ncontravention of the proposed Act. Other accepted\r\n\r\nrecommendations of NTUC dealt with minor matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the acceptance of some of their\r\n\r\nrecommendations, the NTUC have reservations about\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  as it now stands. While it is  natural\r\n\r\nthat  NTUC should feel disappointed that not  all\r\n\r\ntheir  recommendations have  been  accepted,  the\r\n\r\nreservations of NTUC are not founded  on  chagrin\r\n\r\nbut concern for the future of maritime employment\r\n\r\nin our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second sentence of the Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement  to this Bill, it is averred that  \"the\r\n\r\ngeneral  intention of the Bill is the welfare  of\r\n\r\nmembers   of  the  mercantile  marine   and   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the mercantile marine.\" In so  far\r\n\r\nas  the  Bill  seeks to promote  the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nseafarers,  it  does seem that  the  Bill  is  an\r\n\r\nanswer  to  the concern of the NTUC. But  therein\r\n\r\nlies the snag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in seeking to repeal the Seamen's\r\n\r\nRegistry  Board Act, the Seafarers' Welfare  Board\r\n\r\nAct,  the  Singapore Mariners' Club  Act  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Sailors'   Institute    Incorporation\r\n\r\nOrdinance and to re-enact the provisions of  these\r\n\r\nfour  statutes is, in effect, a consolidating Bill\r\n\r\nwithout   any   new   provision   of   any   great\r\n\r\nsignificance.  Other  than the  Seamen's  Registry\r\n\r\nBoard  Act,  the  other  three  statutes  are  not\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the matter of maritime employment.\r\n\r\nAnd  under  the Seamen's Registry Board Act,  read\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Seamen's Registry Board  Rules,\r\n\r\nthe  seamen  find  themselves  in  a  position  of\r\n\r\n\"Heads,  you  win: tails, I lose\" vis-a-vis  their\r\n\r\nemployers,  for  that  accurately  describes   the\r\n\r\nactual working of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law at present, and it will continue to\r\n\r\nbe  so  under  the Bill, a seaman who commits  any\r\n\r\nmisconduct  would,  in the absence  of  mitigating\r\n\r\ncircumstance,  be invariably meted out  with  some\r\n\r\nform   of  disciplinary  action  by  the  existing\r\n\r\nSeamen's  Registry Board or the proposed  Maritime\r\n\r\nBoard. The disciplinary action would usually be in\r\n\r\nthe  form of suspension from registration, or  the\r\n\r\nloss  of priority in registration. As registration\r\n\r\nis a condition precedent for the employment of any\r\n\r\nseamen  of the registrable categories, it  can  be\r\n\r\neasily imagined that such disciplinary action  has\r\n\r\na  sobering effect on, besides the financial shock\r\n\r\nto,  the erring sailors. Such disciplinary  action\r\n\r\nwould have been bearable to the seamen if they can\r\n\r\nbe  sure  that the employers who literally  short-change their seamen would be brought to account in\r\n\r\na  similar fashion by the Board. Unfortunately,  a\r\n\r\nseaman who has been granted less favourable  terms\r\n\r\nthan  those  originally  promised  to  him  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect any remedy from the Board, even though  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of his employer may be sitting  on\r\n\r\nthe  Board itself, for the simple reason that  the\r\n\r\nBoard  has  no  power to discipline the  employer.\r\n\r\nWhat  utterly demoralises the seamen is  that  the\r\n\r\nsame employers' representatives, when disciplinary\r\n\r\naction against seamen is called\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor,  would  have no scruples about demanding  the\r\n\r\nimposition of the heaviest penalty on the seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for that reason, the NTUC happily places on\r\n\r\nrecord the acceptance of their recommendations  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to assure seamen the fruits of their\r\n\r\nlabour  by  including a definition of  \"employer\",\r\n\r\nwhich is wide enough to cover the local agent of a\r\n\r\nforeign  employer,  and  enabling  the  Board   to\r\n\r\nregulate the manner of payment of salaries and the\r\n\r\ndischarge of contracts of service. The Ministry is\r\n\r\nindeed to be congratulated for their inclusion  of\r\n\r\nsuch  provisions which go towards  increasing  the\r\n\r\nprotection of seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to that extent the aim of the Ministry and\r\n\r\nthe aim of the NTUC seem to coincide. Beyond that,\r\n\r\ntheir  aims  seem to be irreconcilably  divergent.\r\n\r\nThe  cause for such divergence seems to lie in the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Ministry approved the  Bill  as  a\r\n\r\nconsolidation  of  existing  provisions  with  the\r\n\r\nincorporation  of new provisions  limited  to  the\r\n\r\nbarest  minimum possible. The NTUC views the  Bill\r\n\r\nas an opportunity to eliminate malpractices by the\r\n\r\nefficient  and  effective regulating  of  maritime\r\n\r\nemployment in Singapore. Thus, from the viewpoint,\r\n\r\nthe   Bill   must   necessarily  incorporate   new\r\n\r\nprovisions as the existing provisions of the  four\r\n\r\nstatutes to be repealed by and re-enacted  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  have  not  been adequate to deal  with  such\r\n\r\nmalpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that Members of this House can have a\r\n\r\nproper   perspective  of  such   malpractices   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to maritime employment, it is  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  dwell at length on such malpractices.\r\n\r\nMore  important than the other major  question  of\r\n\r\nassuring  seamen the fruits of their  labour,  for\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Bill now contains provisions,  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  assuring seamen  a  fair  and  equal\r\n\r\nopportunity  of employment. Thus, in  theory,  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  registration of certain categories  of\r\n\r\nseamen  for  the  purpose of  maritime  employment\r\n\r\nensures  that seamen of the registrable categories\r\n\r\nhave   equal   opportunities  for  employment   by\r\n\r\nrequiring them to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  turn  in  the  queue  for  employment.   In\r\n\r\npractice,   however,   Sir,   the   provision   as\r\n\r\nreproduced  in  clause 6 (h) of the Bill  allowing\r\n\r\nthe Board to supervise the selection of seamen and\r\n\r\nto  provide  both employers and seamen  reasonable\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  choice in relation to employment,  is\r\n\r\nvery  ineffective.  A  seaman  who  refuses  three\r\n\r\nconsecutive offers of employment goes down to  the\r\n\r\nbottom  of  the  queue.  On  the  other  hand,  an\r\n\r\nemployer  who  refuses to select any  seamen  from\r\n\r\nthese  batches of seamen offered by the  Board  is\r\n\r\nnot similarly penalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am given to understand by the officials\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Organisation of Seamen that  the\r\n\r\ngreatest number of malpractices arises out of such\r\n\r\nselection of seamen. It must be clearly emphasised\r\n\r\nthat  the rates of pay and other terms of  service\r\n\r\nvary  greatly from shipping to shipping companies.\r\n\r\nNaturally, there is a clamour among seamen to work\r\n\r\non,  for  instance, a Norwegian vessel where  they\r\n\r\ncan  earn double or treble the sum they may obtain\r\n\r\non,  for  instance, a Greek vessel  for  the  same\r\n\r\ngiven  period of time. A Greek vessel, it  may  be\r\n\r\nalso  added,  is  the last recourse  of  desperate\r\n\r\nseamen, for invariably a Greek vessel is literally\r\n\r\na floating jungle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the point, seamen are prepared to\r\n\r\noffer  up  to  one  month's wages,  which  can  be\r\n\r\nsubstantial   on  a  Norwegian  vessel,   to   the\r\n\r\nrecruiting agents to ensure that they are taken on\r\n\r\nby  such  a well-paying shipping company. That  is\r\n\r\nwhere the abuse of the selection machinery of  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  Board comes in. If the seamen  who  have\r\n\r\noffered  bribes  are not in the  first  or  second\r\n\r\nbatch  to be called up by the Board for selection,\r\n\r\nthe  recruiting agents who, I regret to  say,  are\r\n\r\nalso  Singapore  citizens, would  reject  all  the\r\n\r\nseamen in the first two batches on one pretext  or\r\n\r\nanother.  Even  if  the seamen  who  have  offered\r\n\r\ninducement are not sufficiently well up the  queue\r\n\r\nto  be  included in the third and final  batch  of\r\n\r\nseamen  to  be  called up by  the  Board  for  any\r\n\r\nparticular ship, the recruiting agents will make a\r\n\r\npassionate  plea  for  the  employment  of   those\r\n\r\nparticular  seamen, or else they will  wait  until\r\n\r\nalmost departure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime outside the office hours of the Board to take\r\n\r\non such seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the question of selection is a matter\r\n\r\nof  life  and  death for the seamen because  every\r\n\r\nadditional  day  of  waiting for  selection  means\r\n\r\nanother  day without pay for themselves and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  The  point is how does  the  Government\r\n\r\nintend to resolve the problem of ensuring that the\r\n\r\nselection machinery offers every seamen  an  equal\r\n\r\nopportunity  for employment? The  Police  and  the\r\n\r\nCorrupt Practices Investigation Bureau have  their\r\n\r\nhands full with their existing responsibilities as\r\n\r\nit is without having to look into the malpractices\r\n\r\nin  maritime employment. A policy of \"a  rate  for\r\n\r\nthe port\" - that is, same pay and other conditions\r\n\r\nof service for all seamen who sign on at Singapore\r\n\r\nirrespective  of whichever ship they are  attached\r\n\r\nto  -  is  not acceptable to the Ministry  as  not\r\n\r\nbeing  feasible at present. I must  add  that  the\r\n\r\nNTUC  agrees with the view of the Ministry on this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves us with the question of a manning\r\n\r\nscale  as a means of eradicating the abuse of  the\r\n\r\nselection machinery. By manning scale, I mean some\r\n\r\nform  of  predetermined percentage of ratings,  or\r\n\r\nregistered  seamen, that must make up  any  ship's\r\n\r\ncomplement.  I  am  given  to  understand  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Organisation    of    Seamen     that\r\n\r\nrepresentation has been made on this matter to the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  In their representation, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nOrganisation  of  Seamen  have  also   drawn   the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Ministry to the fact  that  some\r\n\r\nship's crew complements have been made up of  more\r\n\r\nthan  50  per  cent non-ratings or  non-registered\r\n\r\nseamen.  Such  a situation has come about  through\r\n\r\nthe recruiting agents' rejection of all the seamen\r\n\r\noffered  by  the Board under the normal  selection\r\n\r\nprocess and hiring by the back-door, as it is,  of\r\n\r\npersons  who are not trained as seamen or who  are\r\n\r\nderegistered  or  suspended ratings  but  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared   to   offer  some  inducement   to   the\r\n\r\nrecruiting  agents.  This  constitutes  the  other\r\n\r\nprincipal abuse of the selection machinery of  the\r\n\r\nBoard, and it has more sinister implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, untrained or inexperienced\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  taken  on  ships  normally   as\r\n\r\nlaundrymen,  hatch-men, or any other of  the  non-registrable categories, are not able to cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  natural  hazards or exigencies  that  can  be\r\n\r\nexpected  to occur to a ship at sea. The  risk  to\r\n\r\nthe  fare-paying passengers can well  be  imagined\r\n\r\nsince the non-registered seamen may not be able to\r\n\r\ntake care of themselves in a crisis at sea, not to\r\n\r\nsay  spare a thought for the passengers. It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  great importance that there should  be\r\n\r\nsome form of machinery for manning scale to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  every  ship  carries  a  minimum  number  of\r\n\r\ntrained seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another thing, as long as ship-owners and\r\n\r\nship-captains  can  engage  non-registered  seamen\r\n\r\nwith  impunity,  the selection  machinery  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard will never achieve the purpose for which  it\r\n\r\nis   intended,  and  that  is,  besides  being   a\r\n\r\nmachinery,   to   ensure  equal   opportunity   of\r\n\r\nemployment  with a disciplinary device  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  seamen  taken  on at Singapore  are  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest standards and so enhance the reputation of\r\n\r\nSingapore by their work and conduct. It is obvious\r\n\r\nthat  seamen  who  are unruly and anti-social,  to\r\n\r\nbegin  with,  so  as  to  merit  the  disciplinary\r\n\r\nsanction  of  the  Board, are unlikely  to  submit\r\n\r\nthemselves meekly to any suspension imposed by the\r\n\r\nBoard  on  them. It is such registered seamen  who\r\n\r\noffer  themselves for employment by the back-door,\r\n\r\nby-passing entirely the selection machinery of the\r\n\r\nBoard.  The  significance of the  absence  of  any\r\n\r\nstatutory  provision governing  manning  scale  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the Board's objective of  seeking  to\r\n\r\nregulate maritime employment is that it makes  for\r\n\r\nunnecessary  difficulty in the attainment  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard's objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having given Members of the House a picture of\r\n\r\nthe background of this Bill, I now put forward the\r\n\r\nfollowing proposals for the consideration  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister and the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is clearly intended as an enabling\r\n\r\ninstrument in that specific powers are exercisable\r\n\r\nby the Board by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  of  the various regulations to be made  under\r\n\r\nthe   proposed  Act  with  the  approval  of   the\r\n\r\nMinister. I see no harm in enhancing the  enabling\r\n\r\nprovision of the Bill so as to allow the Board  to\r\n\r\nhave  more  scope for action and  more  teeth  for\r\n\r\neffectiveness  when  the  need  arises.  There  is\r\n\r\nhardly  any danger of the Board running amok  with\r\n\r\nits  powers, as the final say always lies with the\r\n\r\nMinister. Sir, thus I suggest the inclusion of:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a provision for manning scale, on which I\r\n\r\nhave already spoken, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a provision under clause 21 of the Bill\r\n\r\nconferring  on  the  Board \"to prescribe  for  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  all  persons  or  employees  who\r\n\r\ndesire to select or engage seamen registered under\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Act\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing regulations provide for the\r\n\r\ncancellation  of  registration  or  suspension  of\r\n\r\nseamen against whom complaints have been lodged by\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  employers.  But  there  is   no\r\n\r\nreciprocal   provision   for   black-listing    or\r\n\r\npenalising of employers who violate the  terms  of\r\n\r\ncontract  of  employment  of,  or  ill-treat,  the\r\n\r\nseamen. Under the proposed provisions of clause 21\r\n\r\nas it is, the amendment of the various regulations\r\n\r\nas  indicated by this Bill would serve  no  useful\r\n\r\npurpose, as far as seamen are concerned. It should\r\n\r\nbe also noted that under clause 20 of the Bill, no\r\n\r\ndistinction  is  made between  an  employer  or  a\r\n\r\nseaman  in  respect of the penalty to be  incurred\r\n\r\nfor violation of the proposed Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various provisions in the Merchant Shipping\r\n\r\nAct  (Cap. 172) dealing with employment of  seamen\r\n\r\nshould  be  deleted from the Act and  incorporated\r\n\r\ninto the proposed National Maritime Board Act or a\r\n\r\nseparate enactment by themselves. The Director  of\r\n\r\nMarine   seems  most  unhappy  and  reluctant   to\r\n\r\nexercise the various powers conferred on him under\r\n\r\nthe Merchant Shipping Act regarding employment  of\r\n\r\nseamen. For instance, the provision of section  39\r\n\r\nof  the Merchant Shipping Act stipulates that  the\r\n\r\nengagement  of seamen for work in any ship,  whose\r\n\r\nflag is not represented by a consular official  in\r\n\r\nthe Republic, shall be conducted in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercantile  Marine Employment office  set  up  for\r\n\r\nthat purpose. The Director of Marine has indicated\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore Organisation of Seamen that  he\r\n\r\nintends  to  propose amendments  to  the  Merchant\r\n\r\nShipping  Act  to relieve himself of such  onerous\r\n\r\nresponsibility as that entailed by the supervision\r\n\r\nof the Mercantile Marine Employment office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only fair to inform the House that the\r\n\r\nNTUC has never raised this point with the Ministry\r\n\r\nwhen  representations were being made on the Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  fact is that, with discussions being confined\r\n\r\nto  the  Bill,  it  seems rather awkward  to  make\r\n\r\nreferences to another Act, which at that time  the\r\n\r\nNTUC had the impression that it might come up  for\r\n\r\ndrastic  amendment as well. Now it is  clear  that\r\n\r\nthe Merchant Shipping Act would not be amended  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to maritime employment. I am also  given\r\n\r\nto  understand that the Singapore Organisation  of\r\n\r\nSeamen have made representation to the Ministry on\r\n\r\nthe inadvisability of the Director of Marine being\r\n\r\ncontinued to be saddled with the responsibility of\r\n\r\nsupervising  maritime  employment.  Now  that  the\r\n\r\nNational  Maritime  Board is to  be  set  up,  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  should  he taken  to  streamline  the\r\n\r\nadministration of maritime employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier on in\r\n\r\nmy  speech, I did mention that some organisations,\r\n\r\nincluding the National Trades Union Congress, were\r\n\r\nconsulted  in  the drafting of this  Bill  and,  I\r\n\r\nstress the word, many of their comments have  been\r\n\r\nincorporated in this Bill. I was not in the  happy\r\n\r\nposition  to  say  that all their  recommendations\r\n\r\nhave  been incorporated. Probably the long  speech\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Telok Blangah is in respect  of\r\n\r\nthose suggestions which have not been accepted. He\r\n\r\nhas  now narrated them to this House. If it is any\r\n\r\nconsolation to the Member for a very fluent speech\r\n\r\non  behalf  of  the NTUC, may I say that  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of the recommendations from ship-owners  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Employers' Federation were also not\r\n\r\naccepted. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  the case of the workers, there  is  a\r\n\r\nspokesman  in this House, but in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nshipowners there does not seem to be any spokesman\r\n\r\nto  plead their case. I want to say that we do not\r\n\r\nclaim  that  the National Maritime Board  Bill  is\r\n\r\nperfect.  I  have stated that its main purpose  is\r\n\r\nreally to consolidate the five different statutory\r\n\r\nbodies  which have been looking after the  affairs\r\n\r\nof  mercantile marine, it is now felt  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be one central body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that it has taken as long as three\r\n\r\nyears for this central body to take place. I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  desirability of having  a  central\r\n\r\nNational Maritime Board as far back as 1968 when I\r\n\r\nassumed  office. I visited the various bodies  and\r\n\r\nit appeared to me that they were very disorganised\r\n\r\nand  why should there be five different bodies  to\r\n\r\nlook after marine affairs. I, therefore, suggested\r\n\r\nthat  we  should create just one central body.  It\r\n\r\nhas  taken  three long years to do this.  This  is\r\n\r\nonly,  as  I  have  said,  a  step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.  It  is hoped that the reservations  of\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC will be resolved in due course of  time.\r\n\r\nIf  we  refer  to  the  Bill with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nconstitution  of  the proposed  National  Maritime\r\n\r\nBoard,   we   will   see  that   there   will   be\r\n\r\nopportunities for the NTUC to give full weight  to\r\n\r\ntheir  reservations and fears, if any. There  will\r\n\r\nbe  a membership of nine members in the Board. The\r\n\r\nChairman,  who will be appointed by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill,  I hope, be a man of impartial standing  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  give us  the  benefit  of  his\r\n\r\nexperience  and  advice. Then there  will  be  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Marine  and the Director  of  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare.  There  will be two persons  representing\r\n\r\nshipowners  and  two persons representing  seamen.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no indication here that the NTUC\r\n\r\nwill be consulted, I can give my assurance here in\r\n\r\nthis  House  that it will be consulted before  the\r\n\r\ntwo  representatives from the seamen are appointed\r\n\r\nto the Board. There is no question at all that the\r\n\r\nNTUC  will  not have a say in the conduct  of  the\r\n\r\naffairs  of  the  Board. There will  also  be  two\r\n\r\npublic servants on the Board. Therefore,.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have on the Board two representatives from the\r\n\r\nshipowners,  two representatives from the  workers\r\n\r\nand the four officials who when appointed will act\r\n\r\nas   impartial  arbitrators  to  the   conflicting\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the employers and  the  workers.\r\n\r\nAbove all, there will be an impartial chairman. As\r\n\r\nI  have said, there is no question at all that the\r\n\r\nworkers'    views   will   not   be   given    due\r\n\r\nconsideration, and when the Board does come to any\r\n\r\nconclusion, fairness will not only be apparent  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers but also to the employers. We  cannot\r\n\r\nhave  everything to the advantage of the  workers,\r\n\r\notherwise the employers will just fold up and then\r\n\r\nthere will be no ships to employ the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned the situation in which\r\n\r\nthe  seamen are placed, \"Heads, you win; tails,  I\r\n\r\nlose.\"  I  wish to assure him that this  will  not\r\n\r\nhappen as long as it is a fair proposition and  if\r\n\r\nthe  Board makes suitable recommendations. As  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Communications, I will be  only  too\r\n\r\nhappy  to  accept the Board's recommendations.  As\r\n\r\nfor  the  various malpractices, I would appreciate\r\n\r\nit  if the representatives of workers on the Board\r\n\r\ncould  give  the  Board  sufficient  evidence  and\r\n\r\nspecific  information for it to act on. There  may\r\n\r\nbe  backdoor selections which would be contrary to\r\n\r\nthe  law,  in  which  case I  am  sure  that  with\r\n\r\nadequate  evidence to follow up our very efficient\r\n\r\nCorrupt Practices Investigation Bureau - I do know\r\n\r\nthat  they have a lot of work to do, but  I  still\r\n\r\nthink  it is necessary for sufficient evidence  to\r\n\r\nbe  made  available to the C.P.I.B, for  them  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  -  will take the necessary  action  to\r\n\r\nreduce, if not eliminate, all these malpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has conceded that\r\n\r\nhis  proposed legislation is new and  which  would\r\n\r\nrequire an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act.\r\n\r\nIt is the manning scales proposed by the Singapore\r\n\r\nOrganisation  of Seamen. May I suggest  that  this\r\n\r\nmatter be referred to the National Maritime  Board\r\n\r\nwhen it is set up, and probably this matter can be\r\n\r\nthe  very first item on its agenda. It can all  be\r\n\r\nthrashed out by the Board then. And if it  is  the\r\n\r\nmajority view of the Board -. I would not use  the\r\n\r\nword \"unanimous\" -that these suggestions should be\r\n\r\naccepted,  I shall be very happy to come  back  to\r\n\r\nthis House to make various amendments to this  Act\r\n\r\nso   that  it  can  be  a  much  better  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  to improve the working conditions  of\r\n\r\nour  seamen and for the general prosperity of  the\r\n\r\nshipping   community.
