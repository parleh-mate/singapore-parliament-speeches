For  this reason I  cannot  state  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unemployed persons in April  1955  any\r\n\r\nmore than I can state the increase or decrease  in\r\n\r\nthe  number since that date. As recently  as  last\r\n\r\nJanuary I informed this House that a study of  the\r\n\r\nvarious   factors  which  affect   employment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore did not suggest that there had been  any\r\n\r\nappreciable  change in the unemployment  situation\r\n\r\nduring  the  year 1956. I believe that that  still\r\n\r\nsubstantially   represents  the  position   today.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  must  inform the  House  that  recent\r\n\r\nreports   do   seem  to  indicate  a  decline   in\r\n\r\nemployment  in  certain industries.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a reduction of 10 per cent  to  15\r\n\r\nper cent in the numbers of workmen employed in the\r\n\r\nsaw-milling   and   rubber   packing    factories.\r\n\r\nEmployment  in biscuit factories has  declined  by\r\n\r\nabout  25 per cent. These changes appear  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  due  to  Federation  of  Malaya  duties  and\r\n\r\nsmaller quantities of low-grade rubber imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retrenchment of about 400 industrial workers\r\n\r\nat the Naval Base has been well publicised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information collected during the Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment's   census   of   manual   workers   in\r\n\r\nemployment  at the end of March has not  yet  been\r\n\r\nfully  compiled,  so  that I am  unable  to  state\r\n\r\nwhether   there  have  been  increases  in   other\r\n\r\nindustries to compensate for the decrease  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned.  Members  will  appreciate  that  in  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  trading centre like Singapore,  there\r\n\r\nare inevitable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nups and downs in particular industries. It may  be\r\n\r\nthat  when the census is complete, it will show  a\r\n\r\ncontraction  in  the employment of manual  workers\r\n\r\nover  the last six months; but I am satisfied that\r\n\r\nthe net change will not give rise to undue alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment exchanges' records show counts of\r\n\r\npersons actively seeking employment assistance  at\r\n\r\nvarious times as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\nApril 1955 - 7,031.\r\n\r\nApril 1956 - 8,122.\r\n\r\nApril 1957 - 8,074.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bound to point out that the figure for March\r\n\r\n1957  was 8,858. Last month there was a sharp fall\r\n\r\nwhich will probably only be temporary, as a result\r\n\r\nof recruitment for census duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, there has probably been an increase in\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  unemployed persons  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nsince  April  1955,  both as a  result  of  school\r\n\r\nleavers coming on to the employment market  and  a\r\n\r\nrecent  fall  in  the  volume  of  employment.   I\r\n\r\nestimate that the total is of the order of one per\r\n\r\ncent of the total number of persons in employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's aim is to pursue a policy of\r\n\r\nfull employment. Public works are maintained at as\r\n\r\nhigh   a   level  as  resources  of  the  building\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry  allow.  These  works   not\r\n\r\nmerely  provide  temporary  employment  for  those\r\n\r\nengaged  in  actual  construction,  but  permanent\r\n\r\nemployment for those who maintain and operate  the\r\n\r\nschools, hospitals and public buildings which  are\r\n\r\nerected.  Government  is  anxious  to  create  the\r\n\r\nnecessary   conditions   under   which    existing\r\n\r\nindustries will expand and new industries  can  be\r\n\r\nattracted  to Singapore. The Industrial  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard has been set up to assist in this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> With reference to the steps being taken\r\n\r\nto  reduce  unemployment, will the Minister  state\r\n\r\nwhether those longest on the unemployment register\r\n\r\nare  given  the  first chance to train  as  census\r\n\r\nworkers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am not able to reply to\r\n\r\nthis  question without notice.

J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the epidemic of influenza which  has\r\n\r\nvisited Singapore has aroused anxiety and  I  feel\r\n\r\nit  incumbent upon me to make a full statement for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated earlier, this disease\r\n\r\nis  believed to have originated in Japan  and  has\r\n\r\ninvaded   Taiwan,   the   Philippines,   Hongkong,\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Federation  of   Malaya.   A\r\n\r\ncharacteristic of this disease is its capacity  to\r\n\r\nattack  suddenly, although the actual  disease  is\r\n\r\nmild,  and  to  extend very quickly.  The  extreme\r\n\r\nconditions  of overcrowding, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\ntown, must certainly have favoured the spread.  It\r\n\r\nmust  also  be  realised from the  epidemiological\r\n\r\npoint  of view that the entire island of Singapore\r\n\r\nis   one   composite   urban  unit   with   denser\r\n\r\naggregations  north  and south  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nRiver.  In consequence, an island-wide spread  was\r\n\r\ninevitable and indeed the spread to the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya was inevitable. In the view of  medical\r\n\r\nexperts,  it  is likely to prevail in an  epidemic\r\n\r\nform  until about the end of this month  and  from\r\n\r\ndaily  reports,  there are  definite  signs  of  a\r\n\r\ndecline and that it is well on its way out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no known preventive or cure for the\r\n\r\ndisease.    The    only    course -    which    was\r\n\r\nunthinkable - was to close the port of Singapore and\r\n\r\nall  the ports of the Federation of Malaya and the\r\n\r\nSiamese  border  against the entry  of  any  craft\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, and impose martial law to keep  people\r\n\r\nin  their homes until the disease had spent itself\r\n\r\non  a  worldwide career. There is no specific cure\r\n\r\nfor  influenza  as there is none for  an  ordinary\r\n\r\ncommon cold. The number of persons affected by the\r\n\r\ndisease  in  Singapore  and  attended  to  by  our\r\n\r\nmedical   clinics,   and   mobile   and   floating\r\n\r\ndispensaries totalled approximately 25,000. It  is\r\n\r\nestimated  that an equal number have been  treated\r\n\r\nby  private practitioners and local medicine  men.\r\n\r\nSo  much  publicity has been given to the epidemic\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  every reason to  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons who were actually attacked  by\r\n\r\nthe  disease  and  who have not  sought  treatment\r\n\r\nwould be negligible. Directly it was evident  that\r\n\r\nthe  disease  had  attacked Singapore,  Government\r\n\r\ntook  every possible measure to combat and control\r\n\r\nit.  Briefly, the steps taken by Government  were,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  my  Ministry issued warning  and  advice\r\n\r\nthrough  the Press, Rediffusion and the Radio  and\r\n\r\nthe  personnel  of  the medical  services  to  the\r\n\r\npeople to keep away from crowds and to rest in bed\r\n\r\nif  the  disease was apparent. Secondly,  elective\r\n\r\nsurgery  was  restricted  to  the  barest  minimum\r\n\r\npracticable  to  make  possible  the  release   of\r\n\r\nmedical  personnel to augment outpatient services.\r\n\r\nFurther,   extra   travelling  dispensaries   were\r\n\r\nmobilised. Prior to the onset of the epidemic,  we\r\n\r\nhad three travelling dispensaries visiting various\r\n\r\nparts  of the island. In addition to this, we  had\r\n\r\ntwo floating dispensaries doing monthly visits  of\r\n\r\nthe   islands.  On  the  onset  of  the  epidemic,\r\n\r\nGovernment  mobilised five travelling dispensaries\r\n\r\ndoing  double shifts and the floating dispensaries\r\n\r\nwere  put on an emergency basis to visit  each  of\r\n\r\nthe  islands  twice a week. The entire  staff  was\r\n\r\nstretched   to  the  limit.  Simultaneously,   the\r\n\r\npharmaceutical  manufactory immediately  increased\r\n\r\nits production of essential drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack of the disease commences with fever,\r\n\r\nheadache, pains in the limbs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  back,  nausea and sore throat  and  sometimes\r\n\r\naccompanied  with  cough  and  giddiness   and   a\r\n\r\ntemperature  which ranges from  101  to  102.  The\r\n\r\nduration  of the fever is about two days  and  the\r\n\r\npatient settles down to normal within four to five\r\n\r\ndays and there seem to be very few complications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that four persons might have\r\n\r\ndied    of   the   disease   although   biological\r\n\r\nconfirmation  has  yet  to be  available.  Persons\r\n\r\ndiagnosed  as  having died of  influenza  depended\r\n\r\nsolely  on  morbid  anatomy. During  this  period,\r\n\r\nthere  were  a  few  other fatal  cases  in  which\r\n\r\nfindings  suggest influenza but there  were  other\r\n\r\ncomplications  such  as  broncho-pneumonia,  heart\r\n\r\ndisease  and  nervous manifestations and,  in  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  the virus, it is hardly  possible  to\r\n\r\nattribute them to influenza as the causal agent of\r\n\r\ndeath.  Information from commercial firms is  that\r\n\r\nabout  10 per cent of the staff were away at  some\r\n\r\ntime  or  other. The disease seems  to  have  been\r\n\r\nconfined  to  Asians, Europeans being very  little\r\n\r\naffected. Whether there is an immunity already  in\r\n\r\nthe  European race is difficult to decide  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to pay tribute to the\r\n\r\nexcellent team-work and ungrudging service of  all\r\n\r\nmembers of the Ministry, particularly the doctors,\r\n\r\nsisters, nurses, dispensers and others who  worked\r\n\r\nthroughout - some of them fifteen  hours  a  day  on\r\n\r\ntheir feet. In paying this tribute, I do so on  my\r\n\r\nown  personal knowledge: I visited the  outpatient\r\n\r\ndepartment  in the General Hospital  and  saw  the\r\n\r\nwork  that  was being done there. I have discussed\r\n\r\nmatters  with  the personnel manning the  services\r\n\r\nand  the  streamline  basis  on  which  they  were\r\n\r\noperating  to meet the emergency and I  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven  the  assurance that there was  an  adequate\r\n\r\nsupply  of  drugs.  My  discussions  with  all  my\r\n\r\nofficers  convinced me that the disease  is  of  a\r\n\r\nvery mild nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House are, of course, aware that\r\n\r\nthe  schools  were  closed.  After  consulting  my\r\n\r\nmedical advisers and on receiving reports from the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education that  there  was  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of absentees both of pupils and teachers, I\r\n\r\nrecommended that the schools be temporarily closed\r\n\r\nwith the advice to parents and/or guardians that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren should be kept away from crowded  places.\r\n\r\nThe  reasons for this are threefold: first,  large\r\n\r\nnumbers of children travel in crowded buses to and\r\n\r\nfrom  schools  and  it is very easy  for  them  to\r\n\r\nacquire the infection in a crowded bus; second, an\r\n\r\ninfected  child  would spread  to  others  in  the\r\n\r\nschool,  persons in the buses and members  of  the\r\n\r\nhome;  and  third, the Minister for Education  was\r\n\r\nconcerned with the practical difficulty of holding\r\n\r\nclasses without teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal conditions, recorded deaths from\r\n\r\npneumonia  in Singapore rank high in the  fatality\r\n\r\nlist.  In view of the anxiety created in the minds\r\n\r\nof the population, it is not unnatural for persons\r\n\r\nto  believe  that anybody dying of any respiratory\r\n\r\ninfection must have died of influenza and it is  a\r\n\r\npity that, in some cases, most exaggerated reports\r\n\r\nhave tended to aggravate the fears in the minds of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  A  glaring example of  this  is  the\r\n\r\nreport  on  the  mercy mission  to  Pulau  Sudong.\r\n\r\nFollowing the visit of the mercy mission,  it  was\r\n\r\nreported   in   the  local  Press  with   alarming\r\n\r\nheadlines  that  300  persons  out  of   a   total\r\n\r\npopulation  of about 450 were down with  influenza\r\n\r\nand  that three had died of it but Government  was\r\n\r\nnot  giving any special treatment or help and that\r\n\r\nthe  people  were dying of starvation. This,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwas a terrible indictment but proved to be a gross\r\n\r\nexaggeration. It was known to my Ministry at  that\r\n\r\ntime  that  there  were only  21  cases  with  the\r\n\r\ndisease  and that none had died of it. On  reading\r\n\r\nthis   astounding   report,   I   made   immediate\r\n\r\nenquiries.  It was then confirmed by  the  medical\r\n\r\nofficer  and  the hospital assistants who  visited\r\n\r\nthe  island twice a week that only 11 children and\r\n\r\n10  adults,  most  of  whom were  recovering  from\r\n\r\ninfluenza,  were the only cases in  Pulau  Sudong.\r\n\r\nThere were, in fact, three deaths: one child  from\r\n\r\nconvulsions,  another child from  gastro-enteritis\r\n\r\nand the third, a woman, from goitre. Not satisfied\r\n\r\nwith   this  report,  I  sent  two  other  medical\r\n\r\nofficers  with members of the Press in  attendance\r\n\r\nto  make  a further detailed check. The penghulu's\r\n\r\nservices  were  specially enlisted to  permit  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  to  examine  every  sick  person  on  the\r\n\r\nisland. The penghulu went hither and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthither  and  eventually brought  51  persons  for\r\n\r\nexamination most of whom looked far from  ill  and\r\n\r\nwere, in fact, in a cheerful and gay mood. Of  the\r\n\r\n51, there were two new cases of mild infection and\r\n\r\na  further  six  convalescents. The  remaining  43\r\n\r\nintimated  that they were going out  fishing  that\r\n\r\nnight.  What was even more surprising, in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  allegation  that most of the  population  was\r\n\r\nstarving,  was the finding that there  was  not  a\r\n\r\nsingle   case   of  malnutrition   amongst   those\r\n\r\nexamined. I would remind hon. Members of the House\r\n\r\nthat  those  persons examined  on  that  day  were\r\n\r\npersons  specifically  selected  by  the  penghulu\r\n\r\nhimself  as being those most in need because  they\r\n\r\nwere either sick or starving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no need to panic and it is further to\r\n\r\nbe  regretted that the fear caused in the minds of\r\n\r\nthe  people  did  much more harm  than  this  mild\r\n\r\noutbreak of influenza really did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, one of the local papers reported that the\r\n\r\nvictims of this disease had to travel from Changi,\r\n\r\nKatong  and  Tampenis to the General Hospital  and\r\n\r\none  of  these  questioned  by  the  reporter  was\r\n\r\nalleged  to  have said, \"We should  have  our  own\r\n\r\ndispensaries in our areas or quicker attention  in\r\n\r\nthe  General  Hospital outpatient  department.\"  I\r\n\r\nwould  like,  Sir, to remind this  House  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  that  in  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nservices  given by the travelling dispensaries  in\r\n\r\nthe   rural   areas   and  the  General   Hospital\r\n\r\noutpatient  department, static outpatient  clinics\r\n\r\nand dispensaries are and have been in existence in\r\n\r\nthe  following  places - and  all  these  have  been\r\n\r\nworking full strength during the epidemic:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the Kandang Kerbau outpatient dispensary\r\n\r\nfor women and children;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the Tan Tock Seng outdoor dispensary for\r\n\r\nmales;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the Paya Lebar outdoor clinic;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the Bukit Panjang outdoor clinic at the\r\n\r\n10th mile;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the Bukit Timah outdoor clinic at the 7th\r\n\r\nmile;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) the Holland Road outdoor clinic at Holland\r\n\r\nVillage;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) the Thomson Road outdoor clinic at the 6th\r\n\r\nmile;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) the Changi Prison clinic for prison staff\r\n\r\nand  Government servants in  the  area  and\r\n\r\ntheir families;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) the Changi clinic at the 14th mile, Changi;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) the Gulega Road clinic at the 9th mile,\r\n\r\nChangi Road;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) the Kampong Batak clinic in the Malay\r\n\r\nSettlement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) the Kallang outdoor dispensary at the old\r\n\r\nKallang Airport site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  addition,  the  City Council  maintains  three\r\n\r\noutpatient   clinics  solely  for   City   Council\r\n\r\nemployees  which  relieve  the  pressure  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment services. Furthermore, our records show\r\n\r\nthat  there had been daily attendances at all  the\r\n\r\nclinics mentioned and if it is of interest to  any\r\n\r\nMember  of  this House, he is welcome  to  inspect\r\n\r\nthese  records.  Apart from  the  Kallang  outdoor\r\n\r\ndispensary  which  was only  recently  opened,  of\r\n\r\nwhich existence the public has been well aware and\r\n\r\nis  prominently situated in the old Airport  site,\r\n\r\nall  the other clinics have been in existence  for\r\n\r\nat  least  one or more years. The fact that  these\r\n\r\nclinics  have  been well patronised  during  their\r\n\r\nexistence  and during the epidemic is an effective\r\n\r\nanswer to those who might maintain that the people\r\n\r\nare  unaware of them. There are also three clinics\r\n\r\nfor  schoolchildren:  one  at  North  Canal  Road,\r\n\r\nanother at Katong and a third at Paya Lebar.  Five\r\n\r\nthousand schoolchildren attended these clinics  up\r\n\r\nto yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the criticisms appearing in the Press\r\n\r\nand  such  harebrained  suggestions  like  sending\r\n\r\nloudspeakers   to  Chinatown  at   a   time   when\r\n\r\nGovernment medical services were working  at  full\r\n\r\npressure,  had members of the public emulated  the\r\n\r\nsplendid  example of Mr Richard Lim in organising\r\n\r\na  special  voluntary medical service  station  at\r\n\r\nPearl's   Hill  community  centre   and   now   at\r\n\r\nSerangoon,  it  would have served  a  much  better\r\n\r\npurpose.  One  sneeze in Chinatown by  any  person\r\n\r\naffected  in  such congested conditions  as  exist\r\n\r\nthere would result in widespread prevalence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA loudspeaker would only cause more panic and give\r\n\r\nopportunities to thugs and quacks to make  capital\r\n\r\nout  of  it, it is, of course, a matter for regret\r\n\r\nthat  the outbreak of influenza did cause economic\r\n\r\ndamage  and distress to many but I must  emphasise\r\n\r\nthat it was absolutely unavoidable and the hazards\r\n\r\nand  distress posed could be likened to  a  common\r\n\r\ncold  of equal incidence. About nine days  ago,  I\r\n\r\nstated  that the disease had reached the peak  and\r\n\r\nwas expected to decline soon. This was evident  by\r\n\r\nthe daily reports and the graphs of new and repeat\r\n\r\ncases.   Today,  I  am  happy  to  say  that   the\r\n\r\nanticipation  of the Ministry of Health  has  been\r\n\r\ncorrect, that the disease is well on its  way  out\r\n\r\nand I understand that it is unlikely that a person\r\n\r\nwho  has  been  attacked with influenza  virus  is\r\n\r\nlikely to be attacked again in the same epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Will the Minister state\r\n\r\nwhy  the  radio was not fully used  in  the  early\r\n\r\nstages  of  the  epidemic to tell  the  public  in\r\n\r\nsimple  language  what to  do  and  how  to  treat\r\n\r\nthemselves  so  as to reduce the pressure  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment hospitals and the clinics?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As far as I am aware, the first\r\n\r\nopportunity to use the radio was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister informed us that there is  no  known\r\n\r\ncure  against influenza and that whatever medicine\r\n\r\nthe doctors could dispense would be in the form of\r\n\r\naspirin.

I  think,\r\n\r\nSir,  that Members of this Assembly will have seen\r\n\r\nfrom  the first paragraph of the Explanatory  Note\r\n\r\nwhich is appended to the copy of the Bill which is\r\n\r\nin  their hands that at the present time,  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  grounds  on which a party to a  marriage  may\r\n\r\ninstitute  proceedings for  divorce  is  that  the\r\n\r\nother  party  to  the  marriage  is  incurably  of\r\n\r\nunsound mind and has been continuously under  care\r\n\r\nand  treatment for a period of at least five years\r\n\r\nimmediately  preceding  the  presentation  of  the\r\n\r\npetition.  This  care  and treatment,  Sir,  must,\r\n\r\nunder   the   existing   law,   be   within    the\r\n\r\njurisdiction - it must be within the  Colony - and  it\r\n\r\nis clear, therefore, that hardship may occur where\r\n\r\na  party to a marriage is under care and treatment\r\n\r\noutside    the   jurisdiction.   The    Government\r\n\r\naccordingly  considers  it  desirable   that   the\r\n\r\nDivorce Ordinance should be amended so that  cases\r\n\r\nof   hardship   of  this  kind  may  be   avoided.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill is designed\r\n\r\nto  allow divorce proceedings to be instituted  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   where  a  party  to  a   marriage   is\r\n\r\nundergoing care and treatment in a country outside\r\n\r\nthe  Colony, provided that the court is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  he is receiving care and treatment according\r\n\r\nto  standards which are substantially the same  as\r\n\r\nthose  obtaining  in  respect  of  the  care   and\r\n\r\ntreatment   of  patients  suffering  from   mental\r\n\r\nillness in the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that Members will have observed\r\n\r\nfrom  the second paragraph of the Explanatory Note\r\n\r\nthat  the  form of amendment which is now proposed\r\n\r\nfollows the principle of the amendment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nrecently  recommended  in  England  by  the  Royal\r\n\r\nCommission on Marriage and Divorce, where the  law\r\n\r\non this point corresponds to the law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, I think, Sir, only one other point to\r\n\r\nwhich   I  should  refer  in  moving  this  Second\r\n\r\nReading,  and that is the quite separate amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  is  proposed  by clause 3.  That  amendment\r\n\r\nrestores  the  word \"nisi\" in the section  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  empowering  the court  to  pronounce  a\r\n\r\ndecree  of dissolution of marriage. That word  was\r\n\r\nomitted when the 1936 Edition was amended in  1941\r\n\r\nand  was  not  restored when the 1955  Edition - the\r\n\r\npresent Revised Edition - was prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is nothing useful which I can add\r\n\r\nto  what I have said, Sir, and accordingly  I  now\r\n\r\nbeg to move that this Bill be read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

There is\r\n\r\nno  reason why seamen should be excluded from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance and hon. Members  will\r\n\r\nnote that this Bill brings seamen within its scope\r\n\r\nby   amending  the  definition  of  \"employee\"  to\r\n\r\ninclude a master, seaman or apprentice employee on\r\n\r\na  vessel  the  owners of which have  a  place  of\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore or have their agents here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to rectify\r\n\r\ncertain  defects  in the present  Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nmake  administration difficult. Most of these  are\r\n\r\ntrivial  but  there are three,  Sir,  to  which  I\r\n\r\nshould like to draw the attention of hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the amendment of the definition of\r\n\r\n\"employee\" by deleting the reference to a  waiting\r\n\r\nperiod of three months and inserting in section 7,\r\n\r\nwhere it more properly belongs, a provision to the\r\n\r\neffect  that  the employer shall pay contributions\r\n\r\nto  the  Fund in respect of each employee who  has\r\n\r\nworked  for the employer for a period of not  less\r\n\r\nthan  one  month. The experience  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  Board has  been  that  a  waiting\r\n\r\nperiod  of  three  months leads to  non-compliance\r\n\r\nwith   the   Ordinance,  and   that   unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployers  keep  employees for  just  under  three\r\n\r\nmonths  and then dismiss them. I would  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  the Federation Ordinance limits the  waiting\r\n\r\nperiod to one month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the amendment to section 14 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance so as to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide  that  on  the death of a contributor  the\r\n\r\nmoney  shall  be  paid directly  to  a  person  or\r\n\r\npersons  nominated  by  the  contributor  in   his\r\n\r\nlifetime  for the beneficial use of those persons,\r\n\r\ninstead  of,  as  at  present,  to  a  trustee  or\r\n\r\ntrustees.  It  has been apparent  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  Board  for  some  time  that  the\r\n\r\nconception  of a trustee is a matter of difficulty\r\n\r\neven for the educated layman, and it is not at all\r\n\r\nunderstood by the generality of contributors,  who\r\n\r\nmistrust the arrangement. Further, Sir, the actual\r\n\r\nrecipient of the contributor's money is completely\r\n\r\nignorant  of his duties as a trustee, and although\r\n\r\nthe  Board  does  its  best to  advise  a  trustee\r\n\r\nrecipient, the position is not satisfactory. There\r\n\r\nis  no  legal  value or safeguard in  the  present\r\n\r\narrangement and it is thought that the contributor\r\n\r\nshould  be  enabled to dispose  of  his  money  to\r\n\r\nselected individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, Sir, is the amendment of section 7A\r\n\r\nto   increase   the  interest  charged   on   late\r\n\r\ncontributions from one-half per cent per month  to\r\n\r\none  per  cent  per month with a  minimum  of  one\r\n\r\ndollar. It is considered that the old rate is  too\r\n\r\nlow.  Hon. Members will realise that late  payment\r\n\r\nmeans  a  delay  in investing the monies  received\r\n\r\ninto  the  Fund and the Board must be  compensated\r\n\r\nrealistically if the members of the Fund  are  not\r\n\r\nto  suffer. The charge also must be high enough to\r\n\r\ncover the administrative cost of collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments are designed to improve\r\n\r\nthe  administration of the Fund and to remove  one\r\n\r\nor  two  ambiguities. I shall not go into them  in\r\n\r\ndetail  as  they are explained in the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nNote at the end of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  note  that  clause  1  makes\r\n\r\nprovision for the Bill to come into effect on  1st\r\n\r\nJune.  The main reason for this is that  the  Bill\r\n\r\nbenefits  a  new class of employees - the seamen - and\r\n\r\nthat  it  provides additional benefits to a  great\r\n\r\nnumber  of  employees whose work is of a temporary\r\n\r\nnature  by reducing the waiting period from  three\r\n\r\nmonths  to  one month. I am sure, Sir,  that  this\r\n\r\nHouse  will  agree  with  me  that  there  is   no\r\n\r\njustification for delaying these overdue  reforms.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.31 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when\r\n\r\nnotice  was  given  of  the introduction  of  this\r\n\r\namending   Bill,   the   Liberal-Socialist   Party\r\n\r\nexpected  that  an  injustice perpetrated  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in this Bill was about to be  removed.\r\n\r\nCertain  improvements have been made, but the  one\r\n\r\nthat really matters has remained untouched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will remember that the Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund Ordinance was rushed through  on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Urgency on the 29th of June,  1955,\r\n\r\nand  put into operation two days later at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen   we  were  all  new  to  the  work  of   the\r\n\r\nLegislature.  It was lauded to the  skies  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Welfare as a great  piece\r\n\r\nof  social legislation. But the implication of one\r\n\r\nsection  remained  undetected  in  the  haste   of\r\n\r\npushing the Ordinance through all its Readings  on\r\n\r\nthe same day without the public having a chance to\r\n\r\nconsider it, and the iniquity of it has only  come\r\n\r\nto  light  in recent months. Indeed,  it  is  even\r\n\r\ndoubtful  whether it can stand the  interpretation\r\n\r\nput  upon it by the Central Provident Fund  Board,\r\n\r\nbut  in  failing  to amend it, the Government  has\r\n\r\ngiven full backing to this iniquity. Or rather,  I\r\n\r\nshould  say that there is an amendment  before  us\r\n\r\nbut   acting   against  the   interests   of   the\r\n\r\ncontributors.  I  refer to section  11(2)  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance - whether you read it  there  or\r\n\r\nin  the  amended form in clause 9 before us today.\r\n\r\nLet  me read it, Sir, in the form in which  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed to amend it now:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Board shall cause to be credited to each\r\n\r\nmember   of   the   Fund  the  amount   of   every\r\n\r\ncontribution paid in his respect and,  immediately\r\n\r\nupon the declaration by the Board under subsection\r\n\r\n(3)  of  section 6 of this Ordinance of a rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest for the preceding year, interest at  that\r\n\r\nrate  on the amount standing to his credit in  the\r\n\r\nFund at the commencement of such preceding year in\r\n\r\nsuch manner as the Board may direct;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means - this is what the Government wishes it\r\n\r\nto  mean - that the Board will only pay interest  on\r\n\r\nthe amount in the contributor's account on the 1st\r\n\r\nof  January  of each year, and will  not  pay  any\r\n\r\ninterest on the next 12 months' contributions.  In\r\n\r\nother words, the Board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   the  whole  of  the  contributions  to   the\r\n\r\nProvident Fund for 12 months duly invested without\r\n\r\ngiving   any  proportion  of  the  current  year's\r\n\r\ninterest  to  the  persons  to  whom  the   money\r\n\r\nbelongs. Sir, we cannot accept this position which\r\n\r\nseems  to us not only unfair but contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nintentions  of the Ordinance. It would perhaps  be\r\n\r\nmore  convenient if I go into the implications  in\r\n\r\ngreater detail at the Committee stage, and  so  at\r\n\r\nthe   moment  I  only  bring  the  matter  to  the\r\n\r\nattention of the Members of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.34 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam   indeed   amused   to   be   told   that   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the Provident  Fund  Board  in\r\n\r\nregard   to   section  11(2)   is   an   injustice\r\n\r\nperpetrated   by  the  Government.   The   Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund Board, Sir, is an independent body.\r\n\r\nIt  was  set  up under the Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  operate the Ordinance  and  it  can\r\n\r\nfully exercise the powers conferred upon it by the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The Government does not interfere  nor\r\n\r\ndoes it give any directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member was not right when he said that\r\n\r\nthis Government rushed the Bill through. I thought\r\n\r\nthat the Progressive Party, which has now been  embraced by the Liberal-Socialist Party, would  want\r\n\r\nto claim credit for the introduction of that Bill.\r\n\r\nWhat the Government did in, I think, June 1955 was\r\n\r\nto amend the Schedule to the Ordinance so that any\r\n\r\nemployee who draws less than $200 need not have to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Fund, whereas his employer  will\r\n\r\nin  duty  bound be asked to donate five per  cent.\r\n\r\nThat  was  only  what the Labour  Front  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 11 of the Ordinance has been\r\n\r\ninterpreted by the Central Provident Fund Board in\r\n\r\nsuch a way that clause 9 of the Bill now seeks  to\r\n\r\nremove the ambiguity. Sir, I think it is wrong  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  there  is any attempt at  cheating  the\r\n\r\ncontributors. The money is a trust  fund  held  in\r\n\r\ntrust  for them. Whatever money is not distributed\r\n\r\nto  the contributors by way of interest will still\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkept  in  the fund for further distribution.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  matter  came  to light  as  a  result  of  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  article.  It  was  suggested  by   that\r\n\r\nnewspaper  article what the hon. Member now  seeks\r\n\r\nto  amend, but it was pointed out by the  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the Central Provident Fund Board that it would\r\n\r\nof  course  be  open to the Board to  direct  that\r\n\r\ninterest should be paid in the manner suggested in\r\n\r\nthe  article,  and  in the manner  sought  by  the\r\n\r\namendment.  The adoption of this suggestion,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwould mean that after each year's end some two and\r\n\r\na  half  million  separate  interest  calculations\r\n\r\nwould  need  to  be  made, as  the  Board  is  not\r\n\r\nempowered to decide the interest rate until  after\r\n\r\nthe  end of the year. This vast calculation  would\r\n\r\nbe possible but at a cost in time and labour which\r\n\r\nwould  be  out of all proportion to the amount  of\r\n\r\nthe  interest involved. Indeed, Sir, in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun the increased cost of administration would  in\r\n\r\nfact reduce the total amount of interest available\r\n\r\nfor distribution to contributors. What the Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund Board seeks to do  is  to  try  to\r\n\r\nprotect the interests of the contributors and  not\r\n\r\nto  spend  money  indiscriminately  in  increasing\r\n\r\nadministration costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin, Sir, said he would have\r\n\r\nmore  to  speak  about this during  the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage,  and I, Sir, would like to speak  a  little\r\n\r\nbit more too at the Committee stage when he raises\r\n\r\nthe matter again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

[Mr Lim Yew Hock].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8, lines 25 to 28, to leave out from\r\n\r\n\"amount\"   to  the  end  and  insert   \"of   every\r\n\r\ncontribution paid in his respect from the date  of\r\n\r\nreceipt of every such contribution:\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, Sir, the sub-clause as it\r\n\r\nstands means that the Board will only pay interest\r\n\r\non  the amount in the contributor's account on the\r\n\r\n1st  of January of each year and will not pay  any\r\n\r\ninterest  on the next 12 months' contributions.  I\r\n\r\nhave  my  own statement of account in the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund Board with me here. On the  1st  of\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1956, the amount in my account was  $250.\r\n\r\nOn  the  31st  of December, 1956, the  amount  was\r\n\r\n$900,  but the interest earned is two and  a  half\r\n\r\nper  cent on $250 only, namely, $6.25, making  the\r\n\r\ntotal  amount in my account on the 1st of  January\r\n\r\nthis  year  $906.25. Now if my  contributions  and\r\n\r\nthose  of  my  employer had been put in  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings Bank each month in 1956,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  two  and a half per cent interest  would  run\r\n\r\nfrom the date of paying in each contribution,  the\r\n\r\namount in my account would be more than $906.25 by\r\n\r\nsomething like $8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me carry the argument one step further to\r\n\r\nmake this situation still clearer. As I have said,\r\n\r\nmy  account stood at $906.25 on the 1st of January\r\n\r\nthis year. It will be this sum which will earn two\r\n\r\nand  a half per cent seven months from now on  the\r\n\r\n31st  of  December, 1957. In other words, the  $50\r\n\r\nper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth  which is being paid into my account  by  my\r\n\r\nemployer each month of this year is bringing me no\r\n\r\ninterest  whatever, but is being invested  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard at something like six or seven per cent. And\r\n\r\nthis goes for every single one of the thousands of\r\n\r\ncompulsory contributors to the Fund, most of  them\r\n\r\nmuch more in need of the extra interest, which  is\r\n\r\ntheir right, than I am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance, as it stands, compels the people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   to  lose  valuable   savings   in\r\n\r\ncomparison with what they could get from the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice. That is why we propose this amendment. The\r\n\r\nCentral   Provident  Fund  Board  holds   to   the\r\n\r\ncontention that it is protected by section  6  (3)\r\n\r\nof the principal Ordinance which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Interest shall be payable on contributions to\r\n\r\nthe  Fund  at such rate per annum, not being  less\r\n\r\nthan two and one half per centum, as the Board may\r\n\r\ndeclare  after and in respect of each year  ending\r\n\r\non the thirty-first day of December:\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board's interpretation of the word \"annum\"\r\n\r\nwith  reference  to the interest  rate  apparently\r\n\r\nprecludes   the   application  of   the   interest\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  sums which have not  been  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  Board for one whole year - that  is,\r\n\r\nwhether  a contribution is paid in on the 15th  of\r\n\r\nJanuary  or  the  15th  of  December,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  interest. I do not think  that  this\r\n\r\nargument  can be supported. If the Board  were  to\r\n\r\ninvest  any of its own funds at six per  cent  per\r\n\r\nannum, it would feel considerably aggrieved if the\r\n\r\nborrower  repaid  the  Board its  capital  without\r\n\r\ninterest 364 days later and contended that \"annum\"\r\n\r\nmeant  \"year\".  This interpretation  of  the  word\r\n\r\n\"annum\"   makes   meaningless   the   proviso   to\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2)  of section 11  of  the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that where the authority of the Board\r\n\r\nis  granted under section 12 of this Ordinance for\r\n\r\nthe  withdrawal from the Fund of any sum of  money\r\n\r\nstanding to the credit of an employee, the  amount\r\n\r\nof  interest due from the first day of January  of\r\n\r\nthe  year in which such authority is given to  the\r\n\r\ndate upon which it is given shall be calculated at\r\n\r\ntwo and one half per centum per annum and credited\r\n\r\nto    the    employee   before   such   withdrawal\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding   that  the   rate   of   interest\r\n\r\nsubsequently declared by the Board in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthat year may be greater than two and one half per\r\n\r\ncentum per annum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that in the case of withdrawals interest\r\n\r\nwill  be made at not more than two and a half  per\r\n\r\ncent  from  the 1st of January until the  date  of\r\n\r\nwithdrawal,  when you have already  ordained  that\r\n\r\nsuch  interest is not payable, is of course  sheer\r\n\r\nnonsense:   yet  here  we  have  a  Labour   Front\r\n\r\nCoalition Government seeking in this amending Bill\r\n\r\nto  retain  this proviso and yet not to amend  the\r\n\r\nsubsection  to allow interest to accrue  from  the\r\n\r\ndate of each contribution. This makes no sense  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument which the Board puts up, to which\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister has referred, is that the cost\r\n\r\nof  administration would be too high. We  on  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House are not prepared to accept that\r\n\r\nunless  we are supplied with facts and figures  to\r\n\r\nsupport it. It is common knowledge that the  Board\r\n\r\nis  investing its funds at six or seven per  cent,\r\n\r\nwhereas it is paying out interest at only two  and\r\n\r\na  half per cent. When on top of that the Board is\r\n\r\nacquiring for itself considerable capital interest-free,  a  proper explanation from the Minister  is\r\n\r\nclearly  called for. I hope that we shall be  told\r\n\r\nwhat income at, say, a minimum of six per cent  is\r\n\r\nreceived  on the contributions paid in during  one\r\n\r\ncalendar year and how this compares with the  cost\r\n\r\nof  administering  the Fund. The balances  already\r\n\r\naccumulated should be enough to pay for the  extra\r\n\r\nadministrative costs, if the General  Post  Office\r\n\r\ncan  do it in the case of post-office savings, why\r\n\r\nnot the Central Provident Fund Board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Government will probably try to answer\r\n\r\nthat  the Board intends to do better than the Post\r\n\r\nOffice  and raise the interest rate to  three  per\r\n\r\ncent when allowed to do so under section 6 (3) (b)\r\n\r\nof the principal Ordinance, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the Board shall not declare a rate of interest\r\n\r\nexceeding  two  and a half per  centum  per  annum\r\n\r\nuntil the assets of the Fund valued at the current\r\n\r\nmarket  price exceed its liabilities  by  ten  per\r\n\r\ncentum;\";\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>but  that  is  one  of the airy  promises  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture. Who is to know that once the condition  in\r\n\r\nthis  paragraph is fulfilled, there will be enough\r\n\r\nexcuses put forward that three per cent cannot  be\r\n\r\nentertained because the funds will no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlonger be invested in six per cent, or the cost of\r\n\r\nliving  has  gone up, or some such else?  Whatever\r\n\r\nthe   excuse,  the  fact  remains  that  all   the\r\n\r\ncontributors  to  the Fund have  been  denied  the\r\n\r\ninterest  on  their 1956 contributions  and  their\r\n\r\n1957  contributions to date, to  which  they  were\r\n\r\nentitled under this Ordinance as it was originally\r\n\r\ndrafted: and that the Board and the Government are\r\n\r\nhiding behind the phrase in section 11 (2) of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Ordinance \"in such manner as the  Board\r\n\r\nmay  direct\".  That  is a dangerous  phrase  which\r\n\r\ngives   far   too  much  power  to   a   statutory\r\n\r\ncorporation and enables it to snap its fingers  at\r\n\r\nthe public and the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board should act as trustees for their\r\n\r\ncontributors and the Government must see to it, if\r\n\r\nthey  are to justify the compulsory savings scheme\r\n\r\nin  the eyes of thousands of working people,  that\r\n\r\nthe  terms offered are at least as good  as  those\r\n\r\noffered by the Post Office, and for the first  two\r\n\r\nyears the people have been forced to contribute to\r\n\r\nsomething which is less good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, one would\r\n\r\nfeel that what the Member for Tanglin has said  is\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of what the Labour Front  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment has done. I said on the Second  Reading\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill  was being claimed  by  the  then\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party  as their  masterpiece  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers of Singapore.  I  sat  on\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee on the Bill not as a  Member\r\n\r\nof  the  Progressive Party but as a Member of  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Party, and as the Member for  Tanglin  was\r\n\r\nnot there on the Select Committee, he is therefore\r\n\r\nnot  aware that this matter was discussed at  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable  length and the decision  arrived  at\r\n\r\nwas  that we should try out the operation of  this\r\n\r\nnew  venture and leave it to the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Board,  which  would be entrusted  with  the\r\n\r\nrunning   of   this   Fund,   to   discharge   its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities under the provisions of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy, Sir, to say that more and more money\r\n\r\nshould be paid to contributors, but the Board  has\r\n\r\nto  pay  the  money out of interest  earned  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of investments and it can only pay out  of\r\n\r\nits profits. There is a guarantee of two and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  half  per cent and to date the Board  has  been\r\n\r\noperating on a deficit. At the beginning of  1956,\r\n\r\nI  am  informed that the deficit was $540,996.  At\r\n\r\nthe  beginning  of  1956 the  total  contributions\r\n\r\namounted  to $9,075,065, whereas at the  close  of\r\n\r\nthe  year  the  amount standing to the  credit  of\r\n\r\ncontributions was $34 million. As a result of  the\r\n\r\noperation  during the year 1956,  the  net  profit\r\n\r\nearned  was $332,329, and on the basis of  payment\r\n\r\nof  interest  as decided upon by the  Board,  this\r\n\r\nwould  mean a distribution of $223,005, leaving  a\r\n\r\nbalance  of $109,324 to reduce the opening deficit\r\n\r\nof  $540,996.  The deficit as at the beginning  of\r\n\r\nthis  year  is therefore $431,672. I  am  informed\r\n\r\nthat  the Board hopes that by the end of this year\r\n\r\nthis  deficit  will have been totally  reduced  so\r\n\r\nthat  in  later years the interest to be  paid  on\r\n\r\ncontributions, even on the basis of what the Board\r\n\r\nhas  decided, will be more than two and a half per\r\n\r\ncent.  It is not correct to say that it was  wrong\r\n\r\nfor  the  Board to be given such wide powers.  The\r\n\r\npowers  are  given to the Board and  it  can  only\r\n\r\nexercise  them  within certain  restrictions,  and\r\n\r\nthose  powers and those restrictions were  in  the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance - the product of the Progressive\r\n\r\nParty. If the amendment proposed by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin is to be accepted, as I said on the Second\r\n\r\nReading,   Sir,   it  will  mean  extra   clerical\r\n\r\nassistance  at least to work out two  and  a  half\r\n\r\nmillion accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at each stage of the contribution interest is\r\n\r\nto  be  paid on that basis, we know that the money\r\n\r\nthat  comes into the Fund from the employers  does\r\n\r\nnot come in at the beginning of the month, but  it\r\n\r\nkeeps on coming in during the course of the month:\r\n\r\nand  employers  have up to 21 days  to  remit  the\r\n\r\nmoney  to the Central Provident Fund Board  before\r\n\r\nthey  become liable for interest. Now if one  were\r\n\r\nto  stretch what is being sought by the amendment,\r\n\r\nit  would  not  only mean two and a  half  million\r\n\r\naccounts, but it would mean very, very much  more.\r\n\r\nIs   this  worth  it  in  the  interests  of   the\r\n\r\ncontributors concerned? The money is  in  a  trust\r\n\r\nfund. It is their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney. No one can take it away. The Government has\r\n\r\nno  right  to  take it away. It is vested  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund Board which has discretion\r\n\r\nto   use  that  Fund  in  the  interests  of   the\r\n\r\ncontributors.  In  the  light  of  what   I   have\r\n\r\nexplained, Sir, I find it difficult to accept  the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, credit\r\n\r\nwas  given  to the Progressive Party for  bringing\r\n\r\nforth  this Bill, and I think if it had been taken\r\n\r\nthrough  by the Progressive Party then  you  would\r\n\r\nhave to give it greater credit, because that Party\r\n\r\nnever  acted  on impulses. It would probably  have\r\n\r\ngiven  a  great  deal of thought to those  clauses\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member, who sat on the Select Committee\r\n\r\nas a representative of the Labour Party and who is\r\n\r\nnow  the  Minister  for Labour  and  Welfare,  has\r\n\r\noverlooked as being not important. They would have\r\n\r\nhad a thorough investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the statement by the\r\n\r\nMinister that if the contributors were to be  paid\r\n\r\nmore money, then more and more money would have to\r\n\r\nbe  paid  to  them. I say they must be paid - it  is\r\n\r\ntheir  right;  it is their money; it  is  not  our\r\n\r\nmoney. If we make a profit on it, we are making  a\r\n\r\nprofit  on  the money contributed by a section  of\r\n\r\nthe  people whom we say we are out to protect. The\r\n\r\nfigures  which  the Minister has  given  are  most\r\n\r\ninteresting.  The Board operates on a  deficit  of\r\n\r\n$540,996. Sir, sometimes when we have a little bit\r\n\r\nof  money to spare, we bring it to the Post Office\r\n\r\nand  they accept it and immediately credit us with\r\n\r\nthree per cent interest. If we have more money  to\r\n\r\nspare, we go along to a bank and the banker  says.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we welcome your money on a three-month or  a\r\n\r\nsix-month basis, and we will pay you three  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  per  cent.\" If we pay that  money  in  on  a\r\n\r\ncurrent account with some banks, we will still get\r\n\r\nsome  interest on that money. We can  deposit  and\r\n\r\ndraw out the money as we like. There must be a lot\r\n\r\nof  clerical  work  involved, and  yet  commercial\r\n\r\nfirms  seem to be able to do much better. It gives\r\n\r\nme  the feeling that whatever Board the Government\r\n\r\nsets up, is always run inefficiently. If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government  wants  to  run  it  on  a   very\r\n\r\neconomical  basis, I suggest it would be  best  to\r\n\r\ndeposit  every account in the Post Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank,  and  there  you  are,  you  save  all  your\r\n\r\nclerical  work. The Post Office Savings Bank  will\r\n\r\ngive  you  three  per cent. The Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund Board is giving the contributors only two and\r\n\r\na half per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1956 is a very interesting year. The Board had a\r\n\r\nnet  profit  of  $332,000. That  money  was  money\r\n\r\nearned  by  the Board from the money deposited  by\r\n\r\nthe people, and to put it away and not give it  to\r\n\r\nthe  poor people - those earning under $200 a  month\r\n\r\npay  no contributions at all - and say, \"I will save\r\n\r\nit up for you,\" is, I think, open to query. I ask,\r\n\r\n\"Save  it  up  for  whom?  Save  it  up  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to invest in other things so  that  it\r\n\r\nhas  more  money to play about with.\" What  little\r\n\r\nmoney the people contribute should bring them  the\r\n\r\nmaximum amount of interest. The Government  should\r\n\r\nnot  take advantage of forcing people to pay  into\r\n\r\ntheir  Fund  and  make money out of  it.  That  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the excuse that if you are going to\r\n\r\npay  them as they deposit the money, you will have\r\n\r\nextra clerical work. I cannot understand how  that\r\n\r\ncan  hold water. If you operate a small number  of\r\n\r\naccounts,  you  need less clerical work,  but  you\r\n\r\nhave less business, you have less money to invest,\r\n\r\nand you have less profits. But if you have a large\r\n\r\nnumber of accounts, you operate a big concern  and\r\n\r\nyou   can  cut  down  overhead  expenses, if  the\r\n\r\nargument  were to be true that if you have  a  big\r\n\r\norganisation and you cannot pay more, but you must\r\n\r\npay  less  because  it involves  greater  clerical\r\n\r\nwork, then all the big businesses should fail. You\r\n\r\nmust  open  up small shops all over Singapore  and\r\n\r\nyou  will make much more money than the big firms.\r\n\r\nBut  that  is  not the case. Usually we  find  big\r\n\r\nbusinesses  swallowing up small ones because  they\r\n\r\ncan  cut  down on overhead expenses. It is  not  a\r\n\r\ngood  argument to say that if extra clerical  work\r\n\r\nhas  to be called in, the net result will be  less\r\n\r\nprofits. The Post Office Savings Bank can do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe banks can do that. The insurance companies can\r\n\r\ndo that with even a lesser volume of business. Why\r\n\r\ncannot a Government body do that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide powers referred to in the amendment is\r\n\r\nopposed by the Government on the ground that it is\r\n\r\nthe product of the Progressive Party. I would like\r\n\r\nto  remind  the  Government  that  even  with  the\r\n\r\nEducation Bill and many other Bills placed  before\r\n\r\nthis  House during the last sitting we are against\r\n\r\nsuch wide powers. This is a democratic country. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to produce dictators. I think  those\r\n\r\npersons  who are going to handle business for  the\r\n\r\npeople  must be servants of the people  and  given\r\n\r\njust sufficient powers and not over-riding powers.\r\n\r\nSir,   I  support  the  amendment  moved   by   my\r\n\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, a little\r\n\r\nknowledge  is  indeed a dangerous  thing!  What  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  Sir,  was  not to ridicule the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty for having introduced the Bill. I gave  them\r\n\r\ndue  credit. I said this is their Bill.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  Bill. If it had been a bad Bill, the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Coalition Government would not have put  it\r\n\r\ninto operation, but what we did was to improve the\r\n\r\nBill  by  not asking people drawing up to $200  to\r\n\r\ncontribute. That was all, and that was  introduced\r\n\r\nbecause  of  opposition worked up by people  whose\r\n\r\nline  of  reasoning  had been  the  same  as  that\r\n\r\nexpressed   by  the  Member  for  Serangoon:   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is cheating the people; the Government\r\n\r\nis  using this money for its own good. What is all\r\n\r\nthis? If you want to pay interest, you have to pay\r\n\r\nit  with  the  money you have earned,  even  in  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  venture where you earn  very  much  more\r\n\r\nthan from investing in gilt-edged securities. When\r\n\r\nyou  begin a business, you will not be able to pay\r\n\r\nhandsome dividends for the first few years. In the\r\n\r\nsame  way, the Central Provident Fund Board cannot\r\n\r\npay   interest   which  can   be   attractive   to\r\n\r\ncontributors.  It  was because of  that  that  the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party  felt that there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nguarantee  of two and a half per cent.  Had  there\r\n\r\nbeen  no such guarantee at all, hon. Members would\r\n\r\ncertainly have realised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it could not be two and a half per cent\r\n\r\ninterest  at all for still some time  to  come.  I\r\n\r\ngave  a  profit of $332,329. On that basis, paying\r\n\r\ninterest  at two and a half per cent on the  total\r\n\r\ncontributions at the beginning of 1956  will  take\r\n\r\naway $223,005. If we were to pay it at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year on $34,101,466, it would mean a  deficit\r\n\r\nof  $520,207. You will have to find $629,531 more\r\n\r\nin  order  to  pay  two and a  half  per  cent  on\r\n\r\n$34,101,466  at the end of 1956. If you  work  out\r\n\r\ntwo  and a half per cent on $34,101,466, you  will\r\n\r\nget  a  figure  of  $852,536. With  only  $332,329\r\n\r\nprofit  there  will be a deficit of  $520,207  and\r\n\r\nthis,  if added to the deficit as at the beginning\r\n\r\nof 1956, would mean that the Board would be in the\r\n\r\nred for $1,061,203. That is all. The statement  of\r\n\r\naccounts  for 1956 will, I think, soon  be  tabled\r\n\r\nand  when hon. Members see that statement, it will\r\n\r\nbe time for them to criticise with the information\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be at their disposal. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat the figures are other than those which I have\r\n\r\ngiven,   and   I  suggest  that  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon, before passing judgement on whether the\r\n\r\nBoard  has badly handled its work or has  in  fact\r\n\r\nhandled  it  quite well, await the Report  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund Board which should  be  in\r\n\r\nhis hands in the not distant future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I would like to point out\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister that this Bill,  as  he  himself\r\n\r\nsays, though originally drafted and passed by this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  1955, is a good Bill, but the point  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  been  wrongly  interpreted  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund Board, and I  think  there\r\n\r\nare two points which bear this out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wrong interpretation, I mean that it was\r\n\r\nunderstood, when the Bill was framed in 1953, that\r\n\r\ninterest  would be paid on contributions from  the\r\n\r\ndate of paying in those contributions and not only\r\n\r\nonce  a  year on the 1st of January. I would  draw\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's attention to section 6 (3) (a)  of\r\n\r\nthe principal Ordinance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Interest shall be payable on contributions to\r\n\r\nthe Fund at such rate per annum...:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) no such interest shall be payable in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  year  during  which   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance comes into force;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now there would be no point in having that proviso\r\n\r\nin  at  all if the intention of the Ordinance  was\r\n\r\nthat   there  should  not  be  interest  paid   on\r\n\r\ncontributions  from the date of  paying  in  those\r\n\r\ncontributions. In point of fact, that is precisely\r\n\r\nwhat  has happened - no interest was paid until  the\r\n\r\n1st   of   January.  If  that  was   the   correct\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of the Ordinance, this  particular\r\n\r\nproviso  would be entirely unnecessary.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  there points to the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nintention  was that interest should be  paid  from\r\n\r\nthe moment of paying in contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pointer in the same direction\r\n\r\nregarding the intention of the original  Bill,  to\r\n\r\nwhich  I am glad the Minister gives credit to  the\r\n\r\nProgressive   Party,  is  the  proviso   which   I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier. Mr Chairman, the proviso  to section  11  (2)  of the principal Ordinance,  and\r\n\r\nthere  you  have  the very same thought  and  idea\r\n\r\nrunning  through the Ordinance - that, in  cases  of\r\n\r\nwithdrawal, interest shall be paid for the  period\r\n\r\nof  the  year up to the time the withdrawal  takes\r\n\r\nplace.  An  attempt is being made to  correct  the\r\n\r\nsituation now so that the Board can interpret this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in  the way in which  it  has  in  fact\r\n\r\ninterpreted it, namely, only to allow one interest\r\n\r\npayment  on  the 1st of January, by the Government\r\n\r\namendment  before us, that is by  calling  this  a\r\n\r\ncleaning  up  of an ambiguity. It is  not.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to put straight the interpretation of  the\r\n\r\nBoard     for     its    entirely    unjustifiable\r\n\r\ninterpretation;  and  that  is  the  point,   that\r\n\r\nthrough  this  mis-interpretation of the  original\r\n\r\nintentions  of the Ordinance, the contributors  in\r\n\r\n1956  and  1957  to  date  have  been  denied  the\r\n\r\ninterest  on  their contributions to  which  under\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance they were entitled. The case seems\r\n\r\nto   me   not  to  have  been  proved   that   the\r\n\r\nadministration costs would be too high to allow of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance being properly interpreted  and  so\r\n\r\nintended, unless facts and figures are given  with\r\n\r\nwhich to convince us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Sir, we are not convinced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 and 11 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, lines 29 to 30, to leave out\r\n\r\n\"appointed in accordance with\" and insert\r\n\r\n\"nominated under\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subsection (5) which appears immediately\r\n\r\nabove this uses the word \"nominate\", and the\r\n\r\namendment proposed is to improve the drafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

These vehicles, Sir, are, of course,\r\n\r\ncommonly   known  as  \"pirate\"  taxis   and   they\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  operate in Singapore in  considerable\r\n\r\nnumbers. The Commission of Inquiry into the Public\r\n\r\nPassenger  Transport  System  of  Singapore  which\r\n\r\nreported  in  January 1956 had before it  evidence\r\n\r\nthat  the total number of these taxis was  of  the\r\n\r\norder  of 5,000 and there is no reason to  suppose\r\n\r\nthat the number is substantially lower today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that to some members of the\r\n\r\npublic,  pirate taxis may appear to be a  blessing\r\n\r\nrather  than a menace as they have been  described\r\n\r\nand  I  propose therefore to refer briefly to  the\r\n\r\ncase   against  it - the  case  which,  in   effect,\r\n\r\njustifies  in  the  view  of  the  Government  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this Bill. That case was summarised\r\n\r\nin paragraph 385 of the Commission of Inquiry into\r\n\r\nthe Public Passenger Transport System of Singapore\r\n\r\nand,  with your permission, Sir, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nread that paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The operation of these 'pirate' taxis is in our\r\n\r\nview  a  practice which should be stamped out, it\r\n\r\npermits  fares to be charged which  would  not  be\r\n\r\npossible  if the 'pirate' taxis paid their  proper\r\n\r\nlicence  fees. It can undermine the  finances  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  services, and in the  end  result  in\r\n\r\npoorer  services for those who rely upon them.  It\r\n\r\ntakes  business away from the taxis proper,  which\r\n\r\nare regularly inspected and properly licensed.  It\r\n\r\ninvolves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   carriage  of  passengers  without  insurance\r\n\r\ncover, for the insurance policy is invalid in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  accidents which occur when the  vehicles\r\n\r\nare  improperly used. It adds to congestion on the\r\n\r\nstreets, because of the small carrying capacity of\r\n\r\nthe vehicles compared with buses. And in any event\r\n\r\nit is illegal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I think that hon. Members will\r\n\r\nprobably  agree  that  one  of  the  most  serious\r\n\r\nobjections to the use of pirate taxis on the roads\r\n\r\nis  the fact that their use is not covered by  any\r\n\r\nform of insurance. In consequence, the only remedy\r\n\r\nleft to persons, including the passengers in these\r\n\r\nvehicles,  who may be injured in the event  of  an\r\n\r\naccident  in  which one of these vehicles  may  be\r\n\r\ninvolved is an action against the driver  with  no\r\n\r\nright  of indemnity against any insurance  company\r\n\r\nand,  as  a  result,  Sir, in  such  a  case,  the\r\n\r\ndependants  of persons killed or injured  in  an\r\n\r\naccident  of  that  kind may  very  well  be  left\r\n\r\nentirely destitute. Another factor is that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe experience of the police that pirate taxis are\r\n\r\nfrequently   used  by  law-breakers  because   the\r\n\r\ntracing  of a pirate taxi is, of course,  often  a\r\n\r\nvery difficult matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, the authorities have\r\n\r\nalways done what they can to take action to  bring\r\n\r\ndrivers of pirate taxis before the courts but they\r\n\r\nhave  been considerably hampered by reason of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties   they  have  experienced   both   in\r\n\r\ninvestigating  particular cases and  in  producing\r\n\r\nevidence,  in effect, in proving charges.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  Sir,  it  does seem  clear  that  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  on the number of taxis  which  may  be\r\n\r\nlicensed, which has only recently been lifted, was\r\n\r\nan  important contributory cause of the activities\r\n\r\nof  pirate  taxis  and it has therefore  been  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   view  that  any   new   legislation\r\n\r\ndesigned to make the control of pirate taxis  more\r\n\r\neffective  should  only be introduced  after  this\r\n\r\nlimit had been removed. As Members of the Assembly\r\n\r\nare,  I think, generally aware, this has now  been\r\n\r\ndone.  The  limit on the number of vehicles  which\r\n\r\nmay  be  licensed as taxis has been, so to  speak,\r\n\r\nabolished and, in consequence, Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nin  introducing this Bill does so in the hope and,\r\n\r\nof  course, with the intention that it  will  give\r\n\r\nthe   authorities  the  powers  they  require   to\r\n\r\nsuppress the activities of pirate taxis. For this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\npurpose  the Bill is designed to enable action  to\r\n\r\nbe  taken against the owners of vehicles which are\r\n\r\nused as pirate taxis as well as against those  who\r\n\r\ndrive  them  and  it provides for imprisonment  in\r\n\r\naddition or as an alternative to a fine for second\r\n\r\nor  subsequent convictions. That, Sir, is provided\r\n\r\nfor by clause 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 contains the major part of the\r\n\r\namendments  which  are now proposed  to  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Ordinance  and  the  proposals  which  it\r\n\r\nmakes,  Sir, if they are adopted, will  confer  on\r\n\r\nthe Registrar of Vehicles and on his officers,  if\r\n\r\nthey are in uniform, certain additional powers  in\r\n\r\ncases where they have grounds for believing that a\r\n\r\nvehicle  is  being  used as a taxi  without  being\r\n\r\nlicensed   for  that  purpose.  These   additional\r\n\r\npowers,  Sir,  include the  power  to  arrest  the\r\n\r\ndriver if the Registrar suspects that the name and\r\n\r\nthe  address which he has given are false and  the\r\n\r\nBill also proposes to confer on the Registrar  and\r\n\r\nhis officers, if they are in uniform, and also  to\r\n\r\nconfer on any police officer in uniform, the power\r\n\r\nto  arrest any person who appears to have  been  a\r\n\r\npassenger in a pirate taxi if that person  refuses\r\n\r\nto  give his name and address. This will, Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  hoped  ensure  that  their  evidence  will  be\r\n\r\navailable should it be required if proceedings are\r\n\r\ninstituted against the driver or the owner of  the\r\n\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not much more to say, Sir, at this stage,\r\n\r\nbut  I  would just summarise the position in  this\r\n\r\nway.  The  Government takes the  view  that  these\r\n\r\nadditional  provisions to deal with  pirate  taxis\r\n\r\nare  the  minimum necessary and I hope  that  that\r\n\r\nview  will be shared generally by Members of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  It may be suggested that the Bill  does\r\n\r\nnot  go  far  enough  and  that  greatly  enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties including perhaps the power to order the\r\n\r\nconfiscation of vehicles should have been provided\r\n\r\nfor.  It  is, however, the view of the  Government\r\n\r\nthat the primary object of this legislation should\r\n\r\nbe  to enable effective action to be taken against\r\n\r\npersons  who operate unlicensed vehicles as  taxis\r\n\r\nrather than to impose very heavy penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, takes the view that the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill combined with the  effects\r\n\r\nof  delimitation will enable the activities of the\r\n\r\npirate taxis to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  very  greatly  reduced but if experience  does\r\n\r\nshow  that  this Bill does not go far enough,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not hesitate to come back to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  to  ask for further  powers  to  be\r\n\r\nconferred   on  the  appropriate  authorities   by\r\n\r\nlegislation. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government\r\n\r\nmay  introduce any number of Bills. Government may\r\n\r\nintroduce  all  sorts of measures  but  Government\r\n\r\ncannot introduce a Bill to force co-operation. Co-operation must come willingly from the people  and\r\n\r\nwhatever Bill is to be introduced depends  on  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill of the people concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, Government will have to do a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  more  to infuse confidence  into  the\r\n\r\npublic  and make them want to co-operate with  the\r\n\r\nauthorities. The existence of pirate taxis  is  an\r\n\r\nevil,  not because it comes about of its own  free\r\n\r\nwill.  It is created by our bad transport  system.\r\n\r\nIf  our transport system had been good and  if  it\r\n\r\nhad  been  convenient for everybody to  travel  by\r\n\r\nthis  means  to  their places  of  employment  and\r\n\r\nhomes,  pirate taxis cannot exist:  I  should  say\r\n\r\nthat  people  would not even want to  own  private\r\n\r\ncars  if  the public transport system is  good.  I\r\n\r\nhave been to London and I noticed that they have a\r\n\r\ngood  system of public transport. Even  owners  of\r\n\r\ncars  do not make use of their cars but prefer  to\r\n\r\nuse public transport which is cheap and efficient.\r\n\r\nThis evil is not because of anything else, but  is\r\n\r\ndue to Government being slow in making this public\r\n\r\ntransport system efficient. Another cause for  the\r\n\r\nexistence of pirate taxis, I will say, stems  from\r\n\r\nanother   fault  of  the  Government - unemployment.\r\n\r\nNobody in this world would want to go against  the\r\n\r\nlaw  if  he  can  help it. Nobody  would  want  to\r\n\r\noperate a pirate taxi knowing that operating it is\r\n\r\nagainst the law but when faced with the problem of\r\n\r\nstarvation for himself and for his family  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  job available, there is  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying that it is better to postpone death than to\r\n\r\nhave   immediate  death.  In  this  case,  it   is\r\n\r\nunemployment that has caused these pirate taxis to\r\n\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, Sir, that we are introducing\r\n\r\nthis  system  in  order  to  make  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore observe the law. We must be aware,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  in  Singapore there are people  who  operate\r\n\r\nsuch taxis because of necessity. It is wrong to do\r\n\r\nthat.  I do not say that it is right. These people\r\n\r\nneed  to  have some time to find alternative  jobs\r\n\r\nand Government must help them in this.

It\r\n\r\nhas  come  to my knowledge that it is not possible\r\n\r\nto  obtain a new car from the car dealers. All new\r\n\r\ncars  have  been booked up - all cars  that  can  be\r\n\r\nconverted  into  taxis  have  been  booked  up  by\r\n\r\ncertain individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> By the Progressive Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It has been pointed out by\r\n\r\nmany   people  outside  this  Assembly  that  huge\r\n\r\nprofits have been made out of this. If this  is  a\r\n\r\nmeasure put forward by the Government to introduce\r\n\r\nnew  taxis and somebody is cashing in on it, well,\r\n\r\nsomething  is definitely wrong. I think  about  it\r\n\r\nthis  way. You want to take away the pirate  taxis\r\n\r\nand you want the owners to become legally licensed\r\n\r\ntaxi owners. The way to go about it is not to say,\r\n\r\n\"You must have a new car before you can be granted\r\n\r\na  licence.\"  Why not allow existing  cars  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered? There is a certain standard which must\r\n\r\nbe  maintained and we can make them  observe  that\r\n\r\nstandard:  get  their  cars repaired  to  a  state\r\n\r\nwhereby  it will be safe for the people.  If  this\r\n\r\nwere  to be implemented, then it would give a true\r\n\r\nchance   to  those  people  who  are  at   present\r\n\r\noperating  these pirate taxis to get licences  for\r\n\r\nnew  taxis;  but if the system of licensing  taxis\r\n\r\nonly  when  they come fresh from the salesroom  is\r\n\r\nimposed   this   will   only   help   unscrupulous\r\n\r\nindividuals to corner the market, make  the  money\r\n\r\nand  yet  deny the chance of lawful employment  to\r\n\r\nthose  people  who are affected.

Whether such services  rendered\r\n\r\nare  to be taken into account, I do not know, but\r\n\r\nI  think that if the Government is a fair one - one\r\n\r\nthat  thinks  of  the  good  a  section  of   the\r\n\r\npopulation has done - then it should be taken  into\r\n\r\naccount and a period of grace should be given  to\r\n\r\nthese people.

The\r\n\r\nHon. the Attorney-General stated that not only do\r\n\r\nthese  pirate taxis break the law by  not  paying\r\n\r\nlicence  fees,  but the important thing  is  that\r\n\r\nmost of them are not covered by proper insurance.\r\n\r\nTherefore   the  passengers  are  not  positively\r\n\r\ncovered. Also, most of the pirate taxis have been\r\n\r\nused  to  break the law. I am sure that  no  hon.\r\n\r\nMember can deny these facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us trace the history of the existence\r\n\r\nof  these pirate taxis. I cannot agree more  with\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Serangoon  when  he  just  now\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  the existence  of  these  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis was mainly due to mass unemployment. People\r\n\r\nfind it hard to get a job, so they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntry  to find an easier way. If there is a supply,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a demand, and vice versa. There  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  transport  services,  especially  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  strike  on by the  buses.  I  still\r\n\r\nremember, Sir, during the Hock Lee riots and  the\r\n\r\nstrike by the Singapore Traction Company, that  I\r\n\r\nsuggested  the  relaxation  of  certain  measures\r\n\r\nagainst  the  pirate taxis because,  during  that\r\n\r\ntime,  it could be said that our entire transport\r\n\r\nfacilities had come to a stop and that the pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis then rendered a valuable service. They were\r\n\r\nrunning  in the most reasonable way. For example,\r\n\r\nI took three trips-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> In a pirate taxi?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> One from Robinson Road to\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Road, for which I paid 50 cents;  from\r\n\r\nBras  Basah  Road to Serangoon Road,  I  paid  70\r\n\r\ncents, and from Changi Market to Changi Point,  I\r\n\r\npaid 50 cents. I think it was a wonderful service\r\n\r\nto the public during that period. Therefore there\r\n\r\nis  a  reason for their existence and they  could\r\n\r\nrender  a valuable service, of course, at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen we need such services but, of course, we  do\r\n\r\nnot hope to have a general transport strike every\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also remind the House that the\r\n\r\nrural  population always rely on the pirate taxis\r\n\r\nfor  their transport which hon. Members who  stay\r\n\r\nin  town  or  who  have their own  cars  may  not\r\n\r\nrealise.  Sir,  as an Assemblyman for  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  I  know quite well that the rural  people\r\n\r\nfind  it  hard  to  get  a taxi  especially  when\r\n\r\nsomebody is sick. They rely mostly on the five or\r\n\r\nten  pirate  taxis run by the kampong  folk.  The\r\n\r\noperators  of  the pirate taxis are also  kampong\r\n\r\nfolk   and  they  know  one  another  very  well.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when a member of the family  is  sick,\r\n\r\nthey simply say, \"Come on, I need you. Send us to\r\n\r\nthe  hospital  or  somewhere else.\"  Therefore  I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  put  forward  this  point   for\r\n\r\nconsideration - that  in  the  rural   areas,   the\r\n\r\nexistence of pirate taxis in many ways has become\r\n\r\na necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, Sir, at present, we have two\r\n\r\ntypes of taxis. One is what we know as taxis now,\r\n\r\nand the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  garage  licences and the  letters  on  their\r\n\r\nlicence  plates.  Although  these  cars  with  the\r\n\r\nletters  \"SZ\" on their licence plates are  private\r\n\r\ncars,  the main purpose, as I learned, is to allow\r\n\r\nService personnel to make use of them, but,  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, these licensed  cars  which  are\r\n\r\nsupposed to be reserved for Service personnel  are\r\n\r\nusually  used  by  the public as well.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nsince   the  Service  personnel  have  a   special\r\n\r\nprivilege, why can we not consider another  system\r\n\r\nfor  the service of the rural residents too?  Poor\r\n\r\npeople  mostly  stay in the rural areas  and  they\r\n\r\nhave no cars. They need a quick and cheap means of\r\n\r\ntransport  and  the pirate taxis  can  serve  that\r\n\r\npurpose. So if we have taxis with the letters \"SZ\"\r\n\r\non  their  licence plates, why can we  not  create\r\n\r\nanother  class  of transport to be made  available\r\n\r\nfor  the  rural  folk in the most  convenient  and\r\n\r\neconomical  way? We can register all those  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis running in the rural areas, especially those\r\n\r\nstationed  in kampongs, reduce the fare  and  also\r\n\r\nreduce  some  of  the  so-called  checks  on   the\r\n\r\nvehicles, like a change of vehicles after three or\r\n\r\nfive  years,  and  so on, which the  rural  people\r\n\r\ncannot  afford. So my suggestion is that we should\r\n\r\ngive  consideration to the rural area pirate taxi-runners  and  try  to find a  way  to  settle  the\r\n\r\nproblem  in the light of a long-term policy.  They\r\n\r\nknow  that they are breaking the law and they know\r\n\r\nthat they will be punished if they are caught  but\r\n\r\nthey are forced to do so because of unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to touch upon is that as\r\n\r\nsoon  as this Bill has been passed - it is now going\r\n\r\nthrough  its Second Reading and I am sure that  it\r\n\r\nwill pass its Third Reading - new and unlimited taxi\r\n\r\nlicences  will be issued. Sir, although I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  with  the views contained in  an  anonymous\r\n\r\nletter  which I received since I pressed  for  the\r\n\r\nsetting   up   of   an   Anti-Corruption   Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission,  I  received several complaints  about\r\n\r\nthe issue of new taxi licences. To demonstrate the\r\n\r\ntrue  democratic spirit, limitation in the  number\r\n\r\nof taxi licences to be issued should be decided by\r\n\r\nthe taxi-drivers themselves. Public opinion is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  divided.  Some say that the taxi-drivers  are\r\n\r\nfighting  very  hard against the  delimitation  of\r\n\r\ntaxi  licences. Others say, \"No, that is not true.\r\n\r\nThey  are  only influenced by a few remnants  with\r\n\r\nthe  support of capitalists. They sell  their  own\r\n\r\ntaxis  and  now  they want to try and  make  their\r\n\r\nmoney  back.\" So there is a controversy about  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  new  taxi  licences.  Why  cannot   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  take  a stand to call  all  registered\r\n\r\ntaxi  licensees  to attend a meeting  and  take  a\r\n\r\ndecision?  That is the easiest and most democratic\r\n\r\nway.  Some of the registered licensed taxi-drivers\r\n\r\nwant  more taxi licences to be issued. Others say,\r\n\r\n\"No,  we do not want that. At present, we find  it\r\n\r\nvery  hard to make enough money.\" My suggestion  I\r\n\r\nthink,  will  clear up a lot of misunderstandings,\r\n\r\nrumours, allegations of corrupt practice,  and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a legislator, I am bound by duty to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Bill  to  allow  the  Government  to\r\n\r\ninstitute  law  and order but, as a representative\r\n\r\nof  the  rural people, I hope that the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  consider  the  few  points  I  have  raised,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  issue  of new  licences  and  the\r\n\r\ncalling  of  a general meeting of all taxi-drivers\r\n\r\nto take a decision democratically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have  a  small point to mention.

As  a  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, he is fully aware that pirate taxis are\r\n\r\nillegal,  but  he  himself has travelled  in  and\r\n\r\nencouraged the running of pirate taxis. I  cannot\r\n\r\nreally  understand, Sir. It is not a question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  you get cheaper fares or whether  it  is\r\n\r\nconvenient  or inconvenient to get  a  taxi.  The\r\n\r\nquestion is one of law and we must, as Members of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  stick to  the  law.  He  himself\r\n\r\nclaims to be a legislator of all legislation  and\r\n\r\nyet  he  comes to this Assembly to say, \"I  think\r\n\r\nthat  it is beneficial to the public and that  we\r\n\r\nshould co-operate with them.\" The thing is  this.\r\n\r\nIn  asking the Government to create another class\r\n\r\nof  taxis, I think the Member is fully aware that\r\n\r\nthere  is already another class under the  serial\r\n\r\nof  \"SZ\" and if anybody wants to run pirate taxis\r\n\r\nlegally,  he  could  apply to  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  for that serial of \"SZ\".  There  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion of any limitation on \"SZ\" at all.

Firstly, up to  very  recently,  the\r\n\r\npublic transport system was not under the control\r\n\r\nof  the Government at all. It was entirely  under\r\n\r\nthe  control of the City Council - a City  Council\r\n\r\ndominated by the Liberal-Socialist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Of course. Pirate taxis are\r\n\r\nnot  only the result of the bad transport  system\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. Pirate taxis are the result of the\r\n\r\npolicy of a Liberal-Socialist City Council  which\r\n\r\nkept the vested interests of those who held taxis\r\n\r\nof  paramount importance against the needs of the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this city has grown in population and in\r\n\r\nsize.  Suburbs have been developed and  therefore\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  more taxis has been apparent  for\r\n\r\nmany, many years and yet we find the City Council\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  a  running battle, preventing  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  from carrying out  its  policy  of\r\n\r\ndelimitation of taxis. \"The limit should be 1,560\r\n\r\nand  no more\" and that limit was there for  years\r\n\r\nand years in spite of the city increasing in size\r\n\r\nand  in  boundary! Sir, the Labour  Front  had  a\r\n\r\ntough  time in the City Council to carry  through\r\n\r\nits  policy  of delimitation of taxis.  There  is\r\n\r\nsuch a thing as the law of supply and demand  and\r\n\r\nthe  demand  was  there for more  taxis  but  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists in the City Council refused to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the demand so that the vested  interests\r\n\r\ncould continue their exploitation. Yet we hear of\r\n\r\nglib   talk  of  Government  not  making   public\r\n\r\ntransport  efficient - the public transport  which\r\n\r\nwas  under  their  control  all  the  time  until\r\n\r\nGovernment  thought  it  wise  to  take  it  over\r\n\r\nrecently!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the plea, \"Unemployment is another\r\n\r\ncause  for  these poor people who go  out  taking\r\n\r\npirate  taxis to earn a living.\" Why can you  not\r\n\r\nlegalise  it?  Why do you stand  in  the  way  of\r\n\r\nlegalizing  it?  Let them have them  as  licensed\r\n\r\ntaxis.  They will be willing to go and get  their\r\n\r\nlicences.  But  no,  you want  to  keep  them  as\r\n\r\nillegal operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Stewart):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have His\r\n\r\nExcellency's recommendation and consent to proceed  with\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond  time.\"  As pointed out in the Explanatory  Note,\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of this Bill is to enable part-time members\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Military Forces to be used on internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  measures. The need to use them  to  supplement\r\n\r\nthe  police and regular military units has been felt for\r\n\r\nsome time. We are conscious of the need to fully utilise\r\n\r\nour  resources  in  internal security  measures.  I  may\r\n\r\nmention,  Sir, that in October last year, for  instance,\r\n\r\nmany  members of the Singapore Military Forces including\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen  offered  their  services  in   any\r\n\r\ncapacity  in which they could be of use to the authority\r\n\r\nin restoring law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Singapore Military Forces Ordinance,\r\n\r\nhowever,  only three types of service, are provided  for\r\n\r\npart-time  members,  namely,  Colour  Training  Service,\r\n\r\nReserve Service and Mobilised Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not usually be practical nor desirable to\r\n\r\ntake the major step of mobilising the Singapore Military\r\n\r\nForces in whole or in part to deal with civil disorders.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, their employment on internal security\r\n\r\nduties would not be covered by either Colour Training or\r\n\r\nReserve Service as defined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ordinance.  Their use on  internal  security\r\n\r\nduties  would therefore raise consequential difficulties\r\n\r\nover their legal status in carrying out their duties and\r\n\r\nover compensation for any injury sustained. The only way\r\n\r\nto get over these difficulties is to amend the Singapore\r\n\r\nMilitary Forces Ordinance and this is what clauses 3 and\r\n\r\n4 of this amending Bill seek to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 14 of the Ordinance to allow\r\n\r\npart-time  members  to  be used  for  internal  security\r\n\r\nduties  when called upon by order of the General Officer\r\n\r\nCommanding,  Singapore  Base District,  under  whom  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Military Forces operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 34 of the principal Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  effect  of  these amendments to section  34  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  pay of members employed  on  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity duties, and the intention is that men so called\r\n\r\nout  would be paid the rates of pay they now receive  on\r\n\r\ncontinuous  training. In the case of  death  or  injury,\r\n\r\npensions and gratuities would be paid at the same  rates\r\n\r\nas  if  they were called out on actual service, that  is\r\n\r\nmobilised service, both to the men themselves and/or  to\r\n\r\ntheir  dependants. Provision for this has  already  been\r\n\r\nlaid  down in the rules governing the Singapore Military\r\n\r\nForces, namely, the Singapore Military Forces (Pensions,\r\n\r\nGratuities and Other Grants) Rules, 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as stated in the Explanatory Note, the\r\n\r\nopportunity  has also been taken to substitute  for  the\r\n\r\nreferences  to the Army Act in the principal  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nreferences  to  the  Army Act,  1955.  This  has  arisen\r\n\r\nbecause  a  new Army Act came into force on 1st  January\r\n\r\nthis  year  and  the old Act lapsed at  the  same  time.\r\n\r\nClauses  2  and  5 of the Bill merely provide  for  this\r\n\r\nsubstitution and nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill which enables part-time members of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Military Forces to be used when necessary  on\r\n\r\ninternal  security duties in support of the  police  and\r\n\r\nregular  military units is a further indication  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention and determination to maintain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order in Singapore which is  so  vitally\r\n\r\nnecessary for the Island's well-being.

It  also\r\n\r\nmakes  enabling  provision  for  members  of   the\r\n\r\nMalayan Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve to be called\r\n\r\nout  to  assist in internal security duties.  Like\r\n\r\ntheir  brothers in the Singapore Military  Forces,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Malayan  Royal  Naval  Volunteer\r\n\r\nReserve,  who are composed entirely of volunteers,\r\n\r\nare  also desirous to play their part in times  of\r\n\r\ncivil disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, however, the Malayan Royal Naval\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Reserve  Ordinance  (Cap.  78  of   the\r\n\r\nRevised  Edition) provides for only two  types  of\r\n\r\nservice,  namely,  service  when  attached  to  or\r\n\r\notherwise  acting  as part of or  with  the  Royal\r\n\r\nNavy,  and  actual service (which means  mobilised\r\n\r\nservice),  neither of which covers the eventuality\r\n\r\nin  mind.

Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has the same objects and reasons as\r\n\r\nthe  two  previous  Bills  just  passed  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  By  this Bill, it  is  proposed  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Singapore section of the Malayan\r\n\r\nAuxiliary Air Force should be enabled to  assist\r\n\r\nin  internal  security duties along  with  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in  the Singapore Military  Forces\r\n\r\nand  the  Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer  Reserve\r\n\r\nwithout  having  to  be  called  out  on  actual\r\n\r\nservice   under  section  17  of  the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this amending Bill now provides for\r\n\r\ntheir being called out during civil disorders by\r\n\r\nan  order  of  the  Air Officer Commanding,  and\r\n\r\nclause  4  provides that when  called  out  they\r\n\r\nshall be subject, for disciplinary purposes,  to\r\n\r\nthe  Air Force Act. Clause 5 of the Bill enables\r\n\r\nrules  to  be  made  to  provide  for  pay   and\r\n\r\nallowances,  and the intention is  to  prescribe\r\n\r\nthe same rates of pay and allowances for service\r\n\r\non   internal  security  duties   as   are   now\r\n\r\nprescribed for continuous training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal Ordinance already provides for\r\n\r\nrules  governing  the payment  of  pensions  and\r\n\r\ngratuities in the event of death or injury,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the Bill becomes law, steps will be  taken\r\n\r\nto   make   rules  prescribing  the   rates   of\r\n\r\ncompensation payable in the event of  injury  or\r\n\r\ndeath of a member of the force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as also stated in the Explanatory Note,\r\n\r\nthe opportunity is also being taken, in clause 2\r\n\r\nof this amending Bill,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto ensure that all references to the Air Force Act\r\n\r\nin  the  Malayan  Auxiliary  Air  Force  Ordinance\r\n\r\nrelate  to  the new Air Force Act which came  into\r\n\r\nforce on 1st January this year, and not to the old\r\n\r\nAir Force Act which has lapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the other two previous Bills, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat for the reasons given this Assembly will also\r\n\r\npass this amending Bill.

This is  one\r\n\r\nof the many questions that are constantly engaging\r\n\r\nmy  attention. I am sure the hon. Member will  not\r\n\r\nwish  me to anticipate any statement that I  might\r\n\r\nwish to make at a future date.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Sir, I did not press for an\r\n\r\nanticipated statement because I fully realised the\r\n\r\ncomplicated nature of the consultations  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Federation of  Malaya,  but  I\r\n\r\nasked  whether  there had been  any  consultations\r\n\r\nwith  that Government and the reply was,  \"I  have\r\n\r\nnothing more to add.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really surprises me, Sir, that in spite of\r\n\r\nthe  admission  by  the Hon. the Acting  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary   that  this  matter  has  engaged   his\r\n\r\nattention for some time, no attempt had been  made\r\n\r\nto  negotiate or commence consultations  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya. The answer\r\n\r\ngiven  last month was most unsatisfactory and  has\r\n\r\nprompted  me  to table my motion today  because  I\r\n\r\nrealise  that filing in more questions will  serve\r\n\r\nno  useful purpose. If I had not put in my  motion\r\n\r\ntoday,  I am quite certain that, at the expiry  of\r\n\r\nthe   term  of  office  of  the  Government,   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance will remain what it is today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows, Sir, that Government, including\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Financial Secretary, is fully  aware\r\n\r\nof  the anomalies in the Income Tax Ordinance, yet\r\n\r\nit  has taken no action on the matter. Why has  it\r\n\r\nadopted a tida apa attitude? I believe, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  most probable reason is that most of them are\r\n\r\nnow Ministers drawing fat salaries and do not mind\r\n\r\nbeing taxed at all, whatever the amount may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

A few\r\n\r\nmonths  ago,  Sir, the Labour Front,  through  its\r\n\r\nGeneral Secretary, Mr Tang Peng Yeu, made a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic announcement that it was going to call upon\r\n\r\nthe  Government to set up a committee on the  same\r\n\r\nprinciple as set out in my motion, but right up to\r\n\r\ntoday  nothing  more  has  been  heard.  What  has\r\n\r\nhappened?  I  do  not know. Nobody  has  made  any\r\n\r\nfurther  announcement.  I think,  from  a  further\r\n\r\nannouncement  by the General Secretary,  that  the\r\n\r\nproposal  has  died a natural death.  I  will  not\r\n\r\ncomment  on what that statement was. I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Chief Minister or the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  will  be  able  to  explain  better\r\n\r\nbecause  I am not in the Front and I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat its activities are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the delay in amending the Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance is causing great concern to the  public.\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   an   Asian   country   and   with\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  in progress, I believe  that  this\r\n\r\nIsland  will  be fully Asianised (not Malayanised)\r\n\r\nin  five to ten years' time. If that be the  case,\r\n\r\nSir, let us adopt the Asian way and attitude;  let\r\n\r\nus  frame our legislation on the same principle - in\r\n\r\nthe Asian way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This delay in amending the Ordinance has\r\n\r\nprompted  the formation of a new body  called  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Taxpayers' Association. The  anomalies  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  and the tida apa attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has prompted this Association to send a\r\n\r\nmemorandum to the Government. I have a  copy  with\r\n\r\nme.  I  am happy the memorandum has been submitted\r\n\r\nas  it  will  save me from making a  long  speech.\r\n\r\nWithout it, I might have had to elaborate  on  the\r\n\r\ntechnicalities  or details of the  Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\npoints which I intend to raise this afternoon  are\r\n\r\nalmost  identical  with  those  contained  in  the\r\n\r\nmemorandum,  so  there  is  no  need  for  me   to\r\n\r\nelaborate my motion much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Ordinance, Sir, gives a lot of power\r\n\r\nto  the  Comptroller of Income  Tax,  but  to  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer there is no way out at all. There  is  no\r\n\r\nprivilege at all for him. He is oppressed. Even if\r\n\r\nhe  should submit an appeal, it will serve him  no\r\n\r\ngood.   I   will  quote,  Sir,  what  the   Income\r\n\r\nTaxpayers' Association has said about appeals:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In the case of an appeal, the appellant is\r\n\r\nrequired to furnish a statement of the grounds  of\r\n\r\nappeal,  and  he  is not allowed to  rely  on  any\r\n\r\nground other than those in the statement save with\r\n\r\nthe consent of the Board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Review. This cannot but operate to the detriment  of\r\n\r\nthe  appellant  as where the grounds are  divulged,  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  is allowed time to prepare his defence  and\r\n\r\nput  forth counter-proposals without the former  knowing\r\n\r\nwhat those proposals are. In addition, when we take into\r\n\r\naccount  the  fact that the taxpayer is not  allowed  to\r\n\r\nrely  on  any grounds for appeal besides those contained\r\n\r\nin  the statement, it is felt that the Ordinance is one-sided.  The  burden  of proving that  an  assessment  is\r\n\r\nexcessive is onerous enough without these provisions. We\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the words 'a statement of the  grounds  of\r\n\r\nappeal'  in  section 75 (1) (b) together with subsection\r\n\r\n(6) of section 75 should be deleted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the Association had to say. Apart from\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that an appeal will serve no useful  purpose,\r\n\r\nthe present personal reliefs granted to the taxpayer are\r\n\r\nfar from adequate. It has been stated again and again in\r\n\r\nthis   Assembly   by   many  Members,   Government   and\r\n\r\nOpposition,  that the reliefs are very, very inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe  present reliefs are for the wife and children only.\r\n\r\nBut what about parents? Oh, do not mind them at all! The\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister himself is an Asian and I think\r\n\r\nhe  knows  that he has the responsibility of maintaining\r\n\r\nhis parents if they are unemployed. If such be the case,\r\n\r\nwhy  forget  about  such reliefs in the  Ordinance?  Two\r\n\r\nyears  have passed, yet nothing has been done. It is  an\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  Ordinance which provides  only  for  the\r\n\r\nwife and children but nobody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote again from the letter of the Taxpayers'\r\n\r\nAssociation, on the matter of reliefs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Child allowance - Section 35 (2) (d) provides allowance\r\n\r\nfor children whether legitimate or adopted maintained by\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayer,  but  it is too often that  the  taxpayer\r\n\r\nbrings up his younger brother or sister, or the children\r\n\r\nof  his  Sister or brother who is destitute or deceased.\r\n\r\nHe may also have to support his aged parents who have no\r\n\r\nincome  of  their  own, as is the custom  in  the  East.\r\n\r\nAllowance  for these dependants should be deducted  from\r\n\r\nthe  income of the taxpayer before it is subject to tax.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the United Kingdom [United Kingdom,  it\r\n\r\nsays,  Sir] apart from personal allowance of \ufffd440  to  a\r\n\r\nsingle  person or \ufffd240 for a married man in addition  to\r\n\r\ntwo-ninths of the net earned income, a maximum  of  \ufffd450\r\n\r\nfor the following allowances are allowed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) Dependant relatives: \ufffd60, if a taxpayer maintains\r\n\r\na  relative of himself or his wife. Children:  \ufffd100  for\r\n\r\neach  child, stepchild or adopted child under 16  years.\r\n\r\nHouse-keeper or person looking after children:  \ufffd60  for\r\n\r\nwidow or widower with female\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelative   or   house-keeper  looking  after   children.\r\n\r\nUnmarried  men  with  widowed mother,  or  husband  with\r\n\r\nincapacitated wife, daughters' service: \ufffd40 if  daughter\r\n\r\nis  maintained by and lives with taxpayer because he  or\r\n\r\nhis wife is infirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There are innumerable cases which have come to our\r\n\r\nnotice why, by reason of the execution of the father  by\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese or his death during the enemy  occupation,\r\n\r\nhis children are being supported by other relatives.  It\r\n\r\nis  formally recommended that consideration be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  amendment of section 35 (2) (d) to provide for  the\r\n\r\ndeductions  to  be allowed in respect of such  dependant\r\n\r\nrelatives or child.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you see from what the Taxpayers' Association\r\n\r\nwrites  that  even in the United Kingdom allowances  are\r\n\r\nprovided  for  the  father, mother, children  and  close\r\n\r\nrelatives of the taxpayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My motion, Sir, does not seek to ask the Government to\r\n\r\namend  the Ordinance straightaway. What it calls for  is\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of a committee to review the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance  with  a  view to granting  reliefs  for  aged\r\n\r\nparents  and  close relatives. I am fully aware  of  the\r\n\r\ncomplications which that may involve. As  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nActing  Financial Secretary has said, he has to  consult\r\n\r\nthe Government of the Federation of Malaya before he can\r\n\r\namend the Ordinance. What I want now, Sir, is to have  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  set up to review the Ordinance and report  to\r\n\r\nGovernment.  With  that report, the Government  can  hold\r\n\r\nconsultations  with  the  Federation  and  see   whether\r\n\r\namendments   can  be  made  to  suit  both  territories.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  hope, Sir, that both sides of  the  House\r\n\r\nwill accept my motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, Sir, may I make it clear that by\r\n\r\n\"committee\"  I  do not mean a select committee  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  but one set up by Government of experts  such\r\n\r\nas accountants and economists who can really go into the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Ordinance and make recommendations. A select\r\n\r\ncommittee  of this Assembly will not serve much  purpose\r\n\r\nas  I can see very few accountants here; apart from  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Acting Financial Secretary, I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nanyone  else here can claim to be an expert on  figures.\r\n\r\nSo  I  do  hope,  Sir, that my motion will  receive  the\r\n\r\nunanimous support of the Assembly. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion moved by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown.

Sir, there, if you maintain  a\r\n\r\nrelative   of  yourself  or  your  wife   who   is\r\n\r\nincapacitated by old age or infirmity, or  if  you\r\n\r\nmaintain  your  widowed  mother  or  your   wife's\r\n\r\nwidowed mother, although she may not be incapable,\r\n\r\nyou  can claim an allowance of \ufffd60 for each person\r\n\r\nso maintained. This allowance, however, is reduced\r\n\r\nby one pound for every pound of the relative's own\r\n\r\nincome   excluding  voluntary  contributions   and\r\n\r\nincome specifically exempted from income tax  such\r\n\r\nas  unemployment benefit and national  assistance.\r\n\r\nThe  maximum allowance is \ufffd105; if the  income  is\r\n\r\n\ufffd160 or more, there is no allowance. In Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe do not have national assistance or unemployment\r\n\r\nbenefit, but I see no reason why the allowance for\r\n\r\nmaintaining  relatives  granted  in   the   United\r\n\r\nKingdom  cannot  be introduced into  this  Colony,\r\n\r\nwhere  the taxpayer usually has several dependants\r\n\r\nto support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, I would like to quote the case of\r\n\r\na  bachelor.  His  present personal  allowance  is\r\n\r\n$3,000   per  annum  or  $250  a  month.  If   the\r\n\r\nadditional benefit of \ufffd105 is given, at  the  rate\r\n\r\nof $8.50 to a pound we get $892.50, making a total\r\n\r\nallowance  of $3,892.50 per annum or  $324.38  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  A  bachelor in Singapore  earning  $320  a\r\n\r\nmonth  with one dependant therefore need  not  pay\r\n\r\nincome   tax.  If  he  has  two  dependants,   his\r\n\r\nallowance  will  be  $892.50  multiplied  by  two,\r\n\r\ngiving  $1,985,  plus $3,000, making  a  total  of\r\n\r\n$4,985 per annum or $415.45 per month, under which\r\n\r\nfigure he need not pay tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of married couples, Sir, the husband\r\n\r\nis  now entitled to $3,000 and the wife to $2,500,\r\n\r\nmaking  a  total  of  $5,500.  If  they  have  one\r\n\r\ndependant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  benefit will mean an  allowance  of\r\n\r\n$892.50, making it $6,392.50 per annum or  $532.75\r\n\r\nper  month.  Married  couples  earning  $530  will\r\n\r\ntherefore not be liable to tax if we introduce the\r\n\r\nextra  benefit. If they have two dependants, their\r\n\r\nallowances  will total $5,500 plus $1,985,  making\r\n\r\n$7,485  per  annum or $623.75 per  month.  Couples\r\n\r\ndrawing $620 a month will therefore not be  liable\r\n\r\nto pay tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known, Sir, that we Asians living in\r\n\r\nthis  country  have to support parents  and  other\r\n\r\ndependants  on  account of filial love,  which  is\r\n\r\nknown to the world. I am not challenging the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Acting  Financial Secretary but, speaking  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of the people of Singapore, who are mostly\r\n\r\nwage-earners,  I  ask the Government  to  consider\r\n\r\nintroducing this benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move an\r\n\r\namendment to the motion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all words after \"set up\" in line 1\r\n\r\nto  \"Ordinance\"  in  line  4  and  to  insert  \"an\r\n\r\nindependent committee without delay to review  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  the  Income Tax Ordinance  and  the\r\n\r\nworking of the Income Tax Department with  a  view\r\n\r\nto  recommending such amendments to the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nas  to  allow  of a more efficient  and  equitable\r\n\r\ncollection of income tax revenue, and\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I think  that  I  have  the\r\n\r\nacceptance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby   the  hon.  Member  for  Queenstown  of   this\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion then, as amended, is a simple one - that\r\n\r\nthis  House  is of the opinion that an independent\r\n\r\ncommittee be set up to look into the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe    present    Income   Tax   Ordinance,    its\r\n\r\ninconsistencies,  anomalies and  injustices.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance  has been in operation  for  about\r\n\r\nnine years. During all this time there has been no\r\n\r\nthorough  examination of the way in which  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen operated. There has been no consideration  by\r\n\r\nan  independent body as to how far this  Ordinance\r\n\r\nhas   been   adapted  to  suit  the  customs   and\r\n\r\ntraditions  of a multi-racial population,  and  to\r\n\r\nsuit   the   particular   needs   and   conditions\r\n\r\nprevailing  on  a  small island  depending  almost\r\n\r\nsolely   on  trade  for  its  existence.  Let   me\r\n\r\ntherefore  give  some examples  of  the  questions\r\n\r\nwhich deserve close and careful examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first example is that of errors or mistakes in\r\n\r\nassessments and returns. The taxpayer has only  30\r\n\r\ndays in which to lodge a valid objection or appeal\r\n\r\nagainst   an   assessment  before  the  assessment\r\n\r\nbecomes  final and conclusive. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax  Department can raise  additional\r\n\r\nassessments under section 73 (1) of the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nat any time within six years. In other words, if a\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  has made a genuine error or  mistake  in\r\n\r\nhis  return,  after 30 days he  has  no  means  of\r\n\r\ncorrecting  his error, and the Department  is  not\r\n\r\nobliged to reopen and amend his assessment. But if\r\n\r\nthe Department makes a mistake, it can rectify the\r\n\r\nassessment  at  any time up to six years.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  said  that  the Department  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nreopen  assessments in cases of genuine errors  by\r\n\r\ntaxpayers, but the public of Singapore is entitled\r\n\r\nto  written  safeguards  so  that  the  Department\r\n\r\ncannot change its policy at any time according  to\r\n\r\nits  fancy, and so that there can be no  suspicion\r\n\r\nof   discrimination  between  one   taxpayer   and\r\n\r\nanother.  In  the  United  Kingdom  Act  of  1952,\r\n\r\nsection  66 allows relief in respect of  error  or\r\n\r\nmistake at any time not later than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsix years after the end of the year of assessment.\r\n\r\nHere is an injustice limited to Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nFederation   which   quite  clearly   requires   a\r\n\r\ncommittee of enquiry to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is then the question of personal\r\n\r\nreliefs  on  which the Members for Queenstown  and\r\n\r\nKampong Kapor have already touched, and I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  repeat  their  arguments.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthere  are  three points which should be  subjects\r\n\r\nfor  consideration. The first is the allowance for\r\n\r\na  wife.  In  the year of marriage, a taxpayer  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is assessed, firstly, on his own  income\r\n\r\nof  the  previous  year on the normal  basis,  and\r\n\r\nsecondly, a proportion of the wife's income of the\r\n\r\nprevious year, but no personal allowance  for  the\r\n\r\nwife is granted. While it is true that the wife is\r\n\r\ngranted  a personal allowance for herself  against\r\n\r\nthe  balance of her income for that year, it  must\r\n\r\nbe  pointed out that the combined effect is to tax\r\n\r\ntotal income at a higher rate than normally.  This\r\n\r\nis  extremely unjust and this anomaly falls  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  the young couple is most  in  need  of\r\n\r\nfunds  to  go on their honeymoon or to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nhome. In brief, the method of assessing the wife's\r\n\r\nincome is such as to be either a dis-incentive for\r\n\r\nmarried  women  to  work, or an  encouragement  to\r\n\r\nliving  in sin. Our view is that the wife's earned\r\n\r\nincome   should   be  subject  to  an   additional\r\n\r\nallowance  (it is in the United Kingdom;  why  not\r\n\r\nhere?) based on a certain percentage of income and\r\n\r\nsubject  to  a certain maximum, let  us  say,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  $1,000. This allowance of course  should\r\n\r\nbe  granted  in the year of marriage, also,  at  a\r\n\r\ntime when it is most needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another form of allowance which needs\r\n\r\nconsideration is an education allowance in respect\r\n\r\nof a son or daughter studying at the University of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Allowances are given to parents  who  can\r\n\r\nafford  to send children to universities overseas.\r\n\r\nShould not an appropriate allowance be allowed  to\r\n\r\nparents  who  cannot  even afford  to  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren to our own university?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a committee of enquiry should consider\r\n\r\nthe question of earned income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelief.  From  the  point of view  of  equity,  we\r\n\r\nconsider that greater relief should be accorded to\r\n\r\na person who earns his income by personal exertion\r\n\r\nthan  to  a recipient of investment income,  whose\r\n\r\nmonetary  reward  is not obtained from  productive\r\n\r\neffort.  In  other  words,  there  should   be   a\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  income  from  salaries   and\r\n\r\nincome  from dividends. I believe, Sir, that  this\r\n\r\nmatter was considered some years ago shortly after\r\n\r\nthe  Income Tax Ordinance was introduced,  but  it\r\n\r\nwas  rejected at that time on the ground that  the\r\n\r\nrates  of tax were low and the personal allowances\r\n\r\ngenerous.  Those  grounds, in  our  view,  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger valid. Firstly, the rates of tax have  been\r\n\r\nincreased and, secondly, personal allowances which\r\n\r\nmight have been generous then, are no longer so in\r\n\r\n1957 due to increases in the cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject of dividends,\r\n\r\nconsideration should be given to the  question  of\r\n\r\nmaking assessable for tax, dividends received from\r\n\r\na  source  outside Malaya by persons  resident  in\r\n\r\nMalaya. At present, such dividends are only liable\r\n\r\nto Malayan tax if they are exclusively received in\r\n\r\nMalaya. It appears wrong, to say the least of  it,\r\n\r\nthat  persons resident in Malaya may invest  their\r\n\r\nmoney   abroad,  leaving  dividends  or  interests\r\n\r\nabroad  and  not  paying Malayan tax.  Since  this\r\n\r\ncountry   needs  money  for  investment   in   new\r\n\r\nenterprises,  such a provision may  deter  persons\r\n\r\nfrom investing abroad and induce them to invest in\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it might be considered by\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  these points do  not  merit  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a special independent committee  of\r\n\r\nenquiry, that the things which are wrong purely as\r\n\r\na  matter of opinion or policy do not need special\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  But  I will  now  go  into  detail\r\n\r\nregarding  a  matter  which is  very,  very  wrong\r\n\r\nindeed.  Sir,  at question time on  20th  November\r\n\r\nlast  year,  the Hon. the Financial Secretary  was\r\n\r\nasked to give the figures of the number of persons\r\n\r\nwho  had  left  the  Colony without  paying  their\r\n\r\nincome tax, the total amount of income tax due  by\r\n\r\nthem  and  the break-down for each year since  the\r\n\r\ncoming into force of the Income Tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The Hon. the Financial Secretary,  who\r\n\r\nwas Mr Hart at that time, replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...since the Income Tax Ordinance came into\r\n\r\nforce,  1,827 persons have left Singapore  without\r\n\r\npaying  their  income tax. The total  amounts  due\r\n\r\nfrom these persons are ... $1,102,007.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  will  not worry you with the details  for  each\r\n\r\nyear  but  I will ask you to note that the  figure\r\n\r\nwas  just over $44,000. Now Sir, I have to  submit\r\n\r\nto this House that the picture presented to us was\r\n\r\nextremely  misleading. When the Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  stated  that  1,827  persons  had  left\r\n\r\nSingapore without paying their income tax  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of eight or nine years, what he meant  was\r\n\r\n1,827  persons known to the Income Tax  Department\r\n\r\nleft  Singapore without paying their  income  tax.\r\n\r\nLet  me  give  you  the real  facts.  The  present\r\n\r\npractice of the Income Tax Department is, in  view\r\n\r\nof  section 10 (1) (b) and section 12 (4)  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  to  consider all  persons  other  than\r\n\r\nBritish  subjects  or  Commonwealth  citizens  who\r\n\r\nvisit Singapore for business purposes as liable to\r\n\r\ntax,  and  liable moreover at the rate of  30  per\r\n\r\ncent without the benefit of personal reliefs.  Let\r\n\r\nme read to you the relevant sections. These are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Section 10 (1) (b) Income tax shall, subject to\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Ordinance, be  payable  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate or rates specified hereinafter for  each\r\n\r\nyear  of assessment upon the income of any  person\r\n\r\naccruing in or derived from the Colony or received\r\n\r\nin  the  Colony from outside the Colony in respect\r\n\r\nof gains or profits from any employment;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Section 12 (4) The gains or profits from any\r\n\r\nemployment exercised in the Colony shall be deemed\r\n\r\nto be derived from the Colony whether the gains or\r\n\r\nprofits from such employment are received  in  the\r\n\r\nColony or not.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 (4) is the more important of the two\r\n\r\nfor  it  means that any person visiting  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  business reasons for however short a time  is\r\n\r\nsubject  to  tax even if the income or  salary  he\r\n\r\nreceives  is  paid to him elsewhere. In  effect  I\r\n\r\nshould  make  it clear that this applies  to  non-British subjects only because British subjects  or\r\n\r\nCommonwealth citizens will be covered, as a  rule,\r\n\r\nby double taxation arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us look at the facts. If we turn\r\n\r\nto the 1955 Report of the Income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTax  Department, Abstract B, on page  8,  we\r\n\r\nfind  that  the number of persons non-resident  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  assessed  for tax for  the  year  1955  is\r\n\r\n1,786.  Our next enquiry is on the 1955 Report  of\r\n\r\nthe Immigration Department, Appendix B, which is a\r\n\r\nstatement of persons arriving in Singapore  during\r\n\r\n1955 by sea and air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Head \"Aliens\", those other than\r\n\r\nBritish  subjects who come under another head,  we\r\n\r\nfind  that  the  number of aliens who  arrived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore on business visits in 1955 was 6,565. In\r\n\r\naddition,  a  further 18,377 visited Singapore  in\r\n\r\ntransit,  making a total of nearly 25,000 persons.\r\n\r\nNow  it  may  be argued that most of those  18,377\r\n\r\nwere  only  here for a night or two and  were  not\r\n\r\nhere  for  business reasons, but nevertheless  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Department pursued some of them. I have\r\n\r\nknown of a case only recently of a businessman who\r\n\r\nwas  here  in transit for only a couple  of  days,\r\n\r\narriving  by  one plane and waiting  to  leave  by\r\n\r\nanother, who received a letter from the Department\r\n\r\nasking  the  purpose  of  his  visit  and  for   a\r\n\r\nstatement of his income paid to him in the  United\r\n\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, however, leave aside the 18,377 transit\r\n\r\nvisitors  and consider the 6,565 persons  here  on\r\n\r\nbusiness.  As  the  income tax figures  show,  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  caught  only 1,786.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\n4,779  left Singapore without paying tax in  1955,\r\n\r\nwhereas the Financial Secretary gave us the figure\r\n\r\nof  1,827 persons over a period of nine years.  It\r\n\r\nis  clear, therefore, that section 12 (4)  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  badly enforced, and  a  rule  badly\r\n\r\nenforced is worse than no rule at all. Since 6,565\r\n\r\naliens entered the colony for business, presumably\r\n\r\nall  should  have paid tax on their income  earned\r\n\r\nwhilst  in the colony; and yet the 1955 Report  of\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax Department shows that only  1,786\r\n\r\ndid  so.  In  fact,  it  is well  known  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of these people do not pay.  Only  those\r\n\r\nunfortunate  enough to come under the Department's\r\n\r\neye  through  newspaper reports and other  sources\r\n\r\nreceive   the  usual  demand  for  a  return   and\r\n\r\neventually  for payment of tax. This naturally  is\r\n\r\nleading  to  two  results:  firstly,  people   are\r\n\r\ndeliberately evading tax; and, secondly, Singapore\r\n\r\nis losing business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand foreign currency as the minority who  are\r\n\r\ncaught are advising others to by-pass this island.\r\n\r\nIt  would be the duty of a committee of enquiry to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether  persons bringing  business  and\r\n\r\nwealth to Singapore should be asked to pay 30  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  their  earnings over to  the  colony  as\r\n\r\nincome  tax,  and whether in truth  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\ndirect  discouragement to the expansion  of  trade\r\n\r\nand  industry  in this country which  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  professes  to wish  to  encourage.  An\r\n\r\nAmerican businessman arrives in Singapore  wishing\r\n\r\nto  make business contacts and interested  in  the\r\n\r\npossibilities  of building a new  factory  on  the\r\n\r\nisland.  In  a  misguided moment he expresses  his\r\n\r\nintentions  to newspaper reporters at the  airport\r\n\r\nand  finds himself the subject of an article on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  page  of  the  Straits  Times  or  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Standard. What is the first response  he\r\n\r\ngets?  A  letter  from the Income  Tax  Department\r\n\r\nasking  for  30 per cent of his earned  income - and\r\n\r\nhis response is to take the next plane out of Paya\r\n\r\nLebar Airport before the Department can catch him,\r\n\r\nand with no further interest in building a factory\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, there are many persons coming here\r\n\r\nfor a short period who cannot afford to pay 30 per\r\n\r\ncent  in tax and maintain themselves here  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time. Indeed it would be pertinent to enquire\r\n\r\nfrom  the Department how much tax on non-residents\r\n\r\nhas  had to be written off through their inability\r\n\r\nto  pay. Let us take the case at random of a Dutch\r\n\r\nbank  assistant earning the equivalent of  $800  a\r\n\r\nmonth  in  Holland who comes out from his homeland\r\n\r\nto  relieve  a colleague for a few months  who  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on leave. His salary is taxed at a straight\r\n\r\n30  per cent, leaving him with $560 per month  and\r\n\r\nno  benefit of reliefs or allowances.  If  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom a non-resident is immune from  tax\r\n\r\nfor  a stay of six months until he becomes defined\r\n\r\nas  a  resident, we see a number of reasons to  do\r\n\r\nthe  same here if businessmen are to be encouraged\r\n\r\nto come to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that I am going to be told that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot afford to lose  the  $2,343,456\r\n\r\nwhich the 1,786 non-residents paid in tax in 1955.\r\n\r\nThere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis,  however,  in  our view, a simple  answer  to  this.\r\n\r\nInstead  of spending their energies and their  staff  on\r\n\r\ntracking  down  non-residents who bring wealth  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry,   the  Department  should  first   turn   their\r\n\r\nattention to those entering the country to reside  here.\r\n\r\nOnce  again, we turn to the Immigration Department table\r\n\r\ngiving  the  number of persons who arrived in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor residence during 1955, that is, those filling in  an\r\n\r\nImmigration  Landing Card. Let us take the  males  only,\r\n\r\nleaving out females and children who, in the main,  will\r\n\r\nof  course  not be subject to tax. We find  that  16,939\r\n\r\nBritish  subjects  or Commonwealth citizens  and  13,585\r\n\r\naliens entered Singapore, making a total of 30,524 males\r\n\r\nwho  entered Singapore for the purposes of residence  in\r\n\r\n1955, and let it be noted that of this number 8,246  (or\r\n\r\nmore than one-quarter) were Europeans almost all of whom\r\n\r\nwould be liable to tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, allowing for those males entering who would not\r\n\r\nbe  liable  to  tax - and that number is  limited  by  our\r\n\r\nimmigration  laws - for  those entering  the  colony  from\r\n\r\noverseas  more than once during the year, for those  who\r\n\r\nhave  left the colony, and for those who proceed  direct\r\n\r\nto  the Federation, there must be a very fair number  of\r\n\r\ntaxable   persons  taking  up  residence  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhether  the  figure - and it is obviously  not  30,000 - is\r\n\r\n20,000 or 10,000 or even 5,000, it is still a large  one\r\n\r\nif taken into conjunction with my next point. If we look\r\n\r\nat  the Income Tax Department Reports for 1954 and 1955,\r\n\r\nwe  will  note  that  18,752 resident  individuals  were\r\n\r\nassessed in 1954 and 19,340 in 1955, a total increase of\r\n\r\nonly  588.  Is it conceivable that the number of  30,000\r\n\r\nentries  can  be whittled down as low as that,  and  you\r\n\r\nmust  in any case allow for an increase in old Singapore\r\n\r\nresidents becoming subject to tax?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here then is the position. New residents are coming\r\n\r\ninto  the  country  at the rate of thousands  per  year,\r\n\r\nwhereas the increase in the number being assessed  is  a\r\n\r\nfew  hundred  per  year.  I  must  confess  that  I  was\r\n\r\nstaggered when I examined these figures, and I hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be shocked into the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrealisation that there must be evasion on a large scale,\r\n\r\nand that our request to the Government from this side of\r\n\r\nthe House for the setting up of an independent committee\r\n\r\nis  thoroughly  justified.  Indeed  there  seems  to  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  evidence to suggest that the  tax  clearance\r\n\r\nscheme  before  people  leave  the  country  should   be\r\n\r\nconsidered,  as  it  is  adopted  in  Australia  or  New\r\n\r\nZealand.  Consideration needs to be given as to  whether\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Department is using or is being allowed to\r\n\r\nuse   all   possible   legitimate  ways   of   obtaining\r\n\r\ninformation.  There seems to be a case  for  considering\r\n\r\nwhether section 64 of the Ordinance empowering heads  of\r\n\r\nfirms  to send in a list of employees liable to  tax  is\r\n\r\nenough when one knows the numbers of representatives  of\r\n\r\noverseas firms residing here who have no heads of  firms\r\n\r\nhere sending in those returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget debate last November the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary said, \"I consider that the Department has done\r\n\r\nand  is  doing  a splendid job.\" In the  face  of  these\r\n\r\nfigures, we beg to differ. If there has been an  excuse,\r\n\r\nit  has always been that of a lack of experienced  staff\r\n\r\nand  trained  income tax officers. In our view,  if  the\r\n\r\nexisting staff - and it is a hard-working staff - were taken\r\n\r\noff  the  job of chasing non-residents who stay in  this\r\n\r\ncountry for three days and turned their attention to the\r\n\r\ndetection of new residents through more street  surveys,\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax Department would be more respected  and\r\n\r\nmore revenue would flow to our coffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have said enough to convince the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  this present situation  is  thoroughly\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  and  that  the  time  has  come  for  an\r\n\r\nindependent  enquiry into the operation of an  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich was drafted in something of a hurry just after the\r\n\r\nwar  and  has not been given a thorough enough  scrutiny\r\n\r\nand  attention. I congratulate the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nfor  introducing  this motion. We on this  side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  are  fully  in support of it,  coupled  with  the\r\n\r\namendment which I have moved and which merely widens its\r\n\r\nscope.

The difference, as I see it,\r\n\r\nbetween my motion and the amendment is the working\r\n\r\nof the Income Tax Department and the efficient and\r\n\r\nequitable  collection of income  tax.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid.  Sir,  Chapter 166 covers 12 items  and  all\r\n\r\nthese  items do include the working of the  income\r\n\r\nTax  Department  as  much  as  the  efficient  and\r\n\r\nequitable collection of income tax. These 12 items\r\n\r\nare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Deductions and disbursements;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Foreign companies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Dividends;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Funds for retirement;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Losers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Depreciation of buildings;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Stock valuation;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Commencement and cessation of business;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Allowances (which are personal allowances)\r\n\r\nor reliefs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Statements of accounts;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) Mistake of facts;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the working of the Income Tax Department and\r\n\r\nthe  collection of tax could be covered in any  of\r\n\r\nthese  12  items, so I do not see much purpose  in\r\n\r\nmoving the amendment. The Member for Tanglin  said\r\n\r\nthat  I  agreed originally. Sir, I have agreed  to\r\n\r\nthe  submission of the amendment, but I  have  not\r\n\r\ncommitted  myself by saying that I will  agree  to\r\n\r\naccept  the amendment. I do not think I  have  any\r\n\r\nright  to stop any hon. Member from submitting  an\r\n\r\namendment, but it is my right to vote according to\r\n\r\nmy  conscience  and whether I support  or  do  not\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difference that I can see is the word\r\n\r\n\"independent\" appearing in the amendment.  It  has\r\n\r\nthe  words  \"independent  committee\",  whereas  my\r\n\r\nmotion has the word \"committee\" only. Sir, in  the\r\n\r\nlast  part  of my speech, I think I made  it  very\r\n\r\nclear  that the word \"committee\" does not  mean  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  of  this  Assembly.  The   word\r\n\r\n\"committee\" means an independent committee  to  be\r\n\r\nset  up  by the Government composed of independent\r\n\r\nindividuals who are experts in the Income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTax  Ordinance  and know the working of the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment. So I do not see much purpose in  moving  the\r\n\r\namendment.  To do so is just to overshadow the  original\r\n\r\nmotion,  and as the Member for Kampong Kapor has rightly\r\n\r\nsaid,  it becomes a clash of Parties. I think this House\r\n\r\nis  more prepared to accept a motion in the name  of  an\r\n\r\nIndependent where no Party inclinations are involved. In\r\n\r\nthe circumstances.

This has been recommended by  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  Committees.\" But when it comes  to  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  an independent Tax  Committee  to\r\n\r\nadvise  Government on the whole  matter,  it  says\r\n\r\nthat it cannot give the power to such a Committee.\r\n\r\nWhere  is  the  logic of this? It applies  in  one\r\n\r\ncase;  it does not apply in another case. I cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  attitude of the Government.  What\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should  do  is  to  express  its\r\n\r\ngratitude for the assistance of the Opposition  in\r\n\r\nbringing   to   its   notice   all   the   various\r\n\r\nshortcomings  of  a department in  helping  it  to\r\n\r\ncollect  more  tax. After all, the  Government  is\r\n\r\nspending  more  than what it earns,  and  if  this\r\n\r\nstate of affairs carries on with more spending and\r\n\r\nless   saving,  Singapore  will  one  day   become\r\n\r\ninsolvent.  Somebody  comes  along  to  help   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  this is the  way  the  Government\r\n\r\nreceives  it! It rather reminds me of rendering  a\r\n\r\ngood  act  and  in  return being  back-bitten  for\r\n\r\noffering that help. This is setting a bad  example\r\n\r\nfor people to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has voiced his opinion of the\r\n\r\nvarious  ways in which the Government can  collect\r\n\r\nmore  tax.  My colleague has said that  there  had\r\n\r\nbeen  a  large number of people who had made money\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and then left for their  homelands.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the expatriate officers I  expect  and\r\n\r\npeople  who  come from investing countries  making\r\n\r\ntheir pile and then going away from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis country. In fact, I almost feel that the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin is voicing something that the Government usually\r\n\r\nwould  not believe, he himself being of European extract\r\n\r\nand  the voicing of such a sentiment for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is really a credit to my colleague, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin. The Government cannot deny that there  are\r\n\r\nsuch tax evasions and the number of such people involved\r\n\r\nis  not  too  many - a few thousand people  perhaps.  When\r\n\r\nthese people are about to leave this country, they  have\r\n\r\nto  go through the Immigration Department. Co-ordination\r\n\r\nbetween  the Immigration Department and the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  should make the collection of such  taxation\r\n\r\neasier. I know that the tax clearance scheme is not  new\r\n\r\nin  this  world. Many of the Western countries have  had\r\n\r\nthat  for  many, many years and a suggestion  like  this\r\n\r\nshould  not  be spurned. Furthermore, the amendment  did\r\n\r\nnot exclude any real substance from the original motion.\r\n\r\nIt  also asks that the whole question be investigated as\r\n\r\nregards  reliefs  to  close relatives  who,  of  course,\r\n\r\ninclude aged parents, dependants, brothers, sisters  and\r\n\r\nchildren probably exceeding nine in number, but  I  hope\r\n\r\nit  does  not include secondary wives or kept mistresses\r\n\r\nwhich I think would be a wrong thing to include.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I am of the opinion that the\r\n\r\namendment to the motion is a really good one and whoever\r\n\r\nopposes such an amendment, opposes it not because it  is\r\n\r\nnot  good but because probably of personal reasons.  Any\r\n\r\nopposition to such a motion, Sir, means that the  Member\r\n\r\nis  not having the interest of Singapore at heart but is\r\n\r\ncalculating on what will be gained by his own person  or\r\n\r\nby his Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The alarming figures given by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  of  the  number of visitors to Singapore - aliens\r\n\r\nand  otherwise, Sir - is no indication that the Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  allowed these people to  escape  paying\r\n\r\nincome  tax,  because referring to the same  section  12\r\n\r\nreferred  to  by the Member for Tanglin, we  will  find,\r\n\r\nSir,  under  that  section  that  where  a  non-resident\r\n\r\ncarries  on business partly in Singapore and partly  out\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, the profits he derives from such business\r\n\r\noperation  shall  be deemed to have  been  derived  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  which are not directly derived  from  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and these profits are liable for  assessment\r\n\r\nfor taxation. Further, Sir, in another section, a person\r\n\r\nmust  have  resided here for six months in the  year  of\r\n\r\nassessment before he becomes liable.

In fact, Sir, consideration is being\r\n\r\ngiven  to  review the case for the grant  of  such\r\n\r\nallowances.   As   will   be   appreciated,   this\r\n\r\nadditional  form of relief cannot  be  arbitrarily\r\n\r\nfixed.  There  are about 19,000 taxpayers  in  the\r\n\r\nColony, and if this additional form of relief were\r\n\r\ngranted  without careful examination  of  all  the\r\n\r\nimplications involved in the proposal, it may well\r\n\r\nbe  that  there  will  be a considerable  loss  of\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax is and will be one of the main sources\r\n\r\nof  revenue to this country.

If it is intended that the\r\n\r\nsocial  and economic services should be maintained\r\n\r\nat  the present level of activity, it is essential\r\n\r\nthat this source of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevenue  should  not only be maintained  but  also\r\n\r\nincreased to cope with a mounting expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present scale of allowances is:\r\n\r\n<pre>  \r\n\r\n                                                $\r\n\r\n          (a)  Personal                       3,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          (b)  Allowance for wife             2,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          (c)  Allowances up to a maximum of $3,150\r\n\r\n                  for nine children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>                    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are very generous compared with those granted\r\n\r\nin  other countries.

The difficulties involved in checking\r\n\r\nthe   bona  fides  of  claimants  will   be   very\r\n\r\nconsiderable.  At  the  moment  when  the  limited\r\n\r\nresources  of  the  department  are  strained   to\r\n\r\ncollect  as much revenue as possible, it  will  be\r\n\r\nappreciated that any diversion of manpower to deal\r\n\r\nwith  this  new  work  will affect  adversely  the\r\n\r\nworking   of  the  department  as  well   as   the\r\n\r\ncollection of revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the legislation and practice in other\r\n\r\nAsian countries which have had a lot of experience\r\n\r\nwith  this tax will have to be undertaken in order\r\n\r\nto  obtain some guidance in fixing the quantum  of\r\n\r\nsuch   allowances.

I  remember\r\n\r\nthat  during the Budget sittings for the years 1955  and\r\n\r\n1956  regarding the review of income tax, I did  mention\r\n\r\nthat    the    paramount   importance   of   ideological\r\n\r\nindependence  should be closely considered.  The  second\r\n\r\npart of the motion reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... as to suit local conditions, with particular\r\n\r\nreference to personal reliefs to aged parents and  other\r\n\r\nclose relatives solely dependent on the taxpayer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  must  understand  the  true  feeling  of  our  Asian\r\n\r\ntradition.  Sir, if you will allow me to  quote - although\r\n\r\nthe audience is very poor - one example -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

I was referring\r\n\r\nto  a  friend sitting in the public gallery. I know  him\r\n\r\npersonally. He has not only to support a wife,  children\r\n\r\nand  parents,  but he has also to pay for the  secondary\r\n\r\neducation of his brothers. He is only a journalist.  How\r\n\r\nmuch  money  can a journalist earn? Yet the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  chases him round and round for  more  money,\r\n\r\nand he can only claim reliefs for his wife and children.\r\n\r\nIt  is  his plain duty not only to support his  parents,\r\n\r\nbut  also to pay for the education of his brothers. This\r\n\r\nis  the  custom in our Asian country and it is necessary\r\n\r\nespecially because a social security system has not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the first reason why I support the motion\r\n\r\nis  that  I  believe  it is of prime importance  to  our\r\n\r\nideological   advancement.  The  second  is   that   the\r\n\r\ncommittee, in the course of its discussions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  be  able  to  recommend  measures   to\r\n\r\nencourage   badly  needed  industrialisation   in   this\r\n\r\ncountry.  I  am sure the Hon. the Minister for  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  will be most pleased if measures  can  be\r\n\r\nfound to encourage not only local investors but also  to\r\n\r\nattract   foreign   ones   as   well   to   boost    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. The third reason why  I  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion  is  that  quite a number of  facts  against  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Ordinance have been given by the hon.
