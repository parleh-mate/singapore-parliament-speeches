The provision of associations  on  these\r\n\r\nlines  accords with the practice in force both  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya  and  in  the  United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this Bill was published, Sir, certain\r\n\r\nrepresentations have been made by the inspectorate\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  the provisions of  clause  20  and\r\n\r\nclause  28 of the Bill which provide for  the  discharge   or   dismissal   of   inspectors.   These\r\n\r\nrepresentations can properly be considered at  the\r\n\r\nCommittee stage of the Bill when those clauses are\r\n\r\nconsidered and it is my intention to move that the\r\n\r\nBill should be committed to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have also been received\r\n\r\nregarding  the period of time allowed  for  appeal\r\n\r\nunder clauses 27 and 28 of the Bill and it will be\r\n\r\nmy  intention at the Committee stage to move  that\r\n\r\nthe  ten  days  provided in  the  Bill  should  be\r\n\r\nchanged to 30 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are certain other amendments to the\r\n\r\nBill to be moved at the Committee stage of which I\r\n\r\nhave given notice but these are mostly of a formal\r\n\r\nnature   and   do   not  affect  the   substantive\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill. The only one on  which  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to comment at this stage is clause  51\r\n\r\nof the Bill which deals with the administration of\r\n\r\nintestate  estates. As the clause  is  at  present\r\n\r\ndrafted, it is doubtful whether the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy Commissioner will have powers to deal  with\r\n\r\nmoney  as  well  as  with goods and  chattels.  To\r\n\r\nclarify the position, it is proposed to substitute\r\n\r\nthe  expression \"movable property\" for \"goods  and\r\n\r\nchattels\" and to redraft the clause accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I need say any more at this stage and I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and five Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.

The  Government  agreed  with   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations in the White Paper  on  Government\r\n\r\npolicy relating to local government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Local Government Bill, 1957, which has been\r\n\r\npassed by the Legislative Assembly, makes enabling\r\n\r\nprovision for local authorities to make bylaws now\r\n\r\nfor  the  control, regulation and  supervision  by\r\n\r\nregistration,  licensing or  otherwise  of  places\r\n\r\nused  for  real  performances, theatres,  wayangs,\r\n\r\nconcerts  and other public exhibitions  and  enter\r\n\r\ntainments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable part of the Theatres Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Cap.   229)   which   assigned   some   of   this\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the police consequently  becomes\r\n\r\nobsolete and fit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  repeal. In addition, other provisions of  the\r\n\r\nsame  Ordinance  have become out of  date  through\r\n\r\nchanges in the social life of the community  since\r\n\r\nit  was enacted in 1909. It is timely therefore to\r\n\r\nrepeal the whole of the Theatres Ordinance and  to\r\n\r\nreplace  it  by  a new Ordinance directed  to  the\r\n\r\nregulation  of public entertainments  in  general.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  has  accordingly been framed  so as  to\r\n\r\nrequire  that the Licensing Authority  constituted\r\n\r\nunder  it  should  have regard  primarily  to  the\r\n\r\nnature of public entertainments for which licences\r\n\r\nare  sought; while also concerned that  these  are\r\n\r\nheld only in places suitable to their nature,  the\r\n\r\nLicensing  Authority is permitted to  presume  the\r\n\r\nsuitability of buildings and other premises to the\r\n\r\nextent to which this has been certified by a local\r\n\r\ngovernment authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, which repeals the present\r\n\r\nTheatres  Ordinance  and the  Billiards  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich is equally out of date and will no longer be\r\n\r\nnecessary if this Bill is enacted, is based on the\r\n\r\nfollowing  considerations  and  requirements:  the\r\n\r\ninterest    of    the   State    in    controlling\r\n\r\nentertainments to which the public has  access  is\r\n\r\nfourfold - to preserve peace and good order:\r\n\r\nto prevent moral, social and political degeneracy:\r\n\r\nto  prevent physical injury and suffering  whether\r\n\r\nto  performers or to audiences: to secure  revenue\r\n\r\nsufficient  at  least  to offset  the  expense  of\r\n\r\ncontrol;  the definition of \"public entertainment\"\r\n\r\nwhich   should   be  as  clear  as  possible   and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive enough to take account of  the  much\r\n\r\ngreater  range  of  popular  amusements  available\r\n\r\nnowadays  so  that  loopholes  in  the  system  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  could be prevented as much  as  possible;\r\n\r\nthe  statutory exemptions of some kinds of  public\r\n\r\nentertainment   because  their   sponsorship   and\r\n\r\ncircumstances  adequately  guarantee  the  State's\r\n\r\ninterest  being  safeguarded; the  exemption  from\r\n\r\ncontrol either wholly or in part of other kinds of\r\n\r\n\"public entertainment\" the nature of which  cannot\r\n\r\nreadily  be  perverted  to ends  contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nState's interest; the introduction of a system  of\r\n\r\nlicensing of \"public entertainment\" which provides\r\n\r\nfor the identification of all persons on whom lies\r\n\r\nthe onus of compliance with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconditions of licences; the declaration in advance\r\n\r\nof   the  precise  nature  of  the  entertainment;\r\n\r\napproval  of the place in which it is intended  to\r\n\r\nprovide    entertainment;    the    refusal    and\r\n\r\ncancellation   of  licences;  the  suspension   of\r\n\r\nlicences on reasonable suspicion that they will be\r\n\r\nabused or will result in breaches of the peace  or\r\n\r\ninjury  or  suffering to animals or performers  or\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  audience;  recourse  to   expert\r\n\r\nopinion in cases of doubt whether an entertainment\r\n\r\nshould be licensed or not; the collection of fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the intention of the Government that\r\n\r\nafter  the Second Reading of this important  Bill,\r\n\r\nit should be committed to a Select Committee. I do\r\n\r\nnot  propose therefore to go into great detail  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture. Hon. Members will also  have  read\r\n\r\nthe  explanatory statement at the end of the Bill.\r\n\r\nI  would  like however to dwell at this  stage  on\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  more  important clauses  and  implications of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"public entertainment\" under\r\n\r\nthe  14  headings  is intended  to  be  absolutely\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  of  all existing and  all  probable\r\n\r\nforms   of   public  entertainment,  without   any\r\n\r\nimplication  as  to the inherent  desirability  or\r\n\r\notherwise  of  the  particular  types  of   public\r\n\r\nentertainment  mentioned. The final  part  of  the\r\n\r\ndefinition excludes absolutely from the  operation\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance  certain categories  of  public\r\n\r\nentertainment associated with the State, official,\r\n\r\nreligious, business and political occasions, it is\r\n\r\nconsidered not only necessary for the avoidance of\r\n\r\nembarrassment  and administrative congestion,  but\r\n\r\nalso  essential to preserve freedom of association\r\n\r\nfor  those  categories to be statutorily  exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  application of this  Bill.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  indicated above, it is contemplated  that\r\n\r\nother  exemptions will also be granted and  clause\r\n\r\n15  of  the  Bill  gives the  Minister  unfettered\r\n\r\ndiscretion to make orders for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will wish to be made aware  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 10 (2) of the Bill which will\r\n\r\nenable  the Licensing Officer to prohibit  at  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion the admission of children under the age\r\n\r\nof sixteen years to the licensed public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentertainment.   There  is   ample   occasion   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today  for the use of  every  available\r\n\r\nmeans  of  protecting the younger generation  from\r\n\r\nbad    influence   in   the   field   of    public\r\n\r\nentertainment.  The  onus  of  responsibility  for\r\n\r\nseeing  that this prohibition is carried out  will\r\n\r\nfall  on the licensee of the public entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis would apply even to cinemas. If this Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed,  classification of films  as  suitable  or\r\n\r\nunsuitable for children to see could be made under\r\n\r\nthe  Cinematograph Films Ordinance. The  Licensing\r\n\r\nOfficer under this Bill could then impose  on  the\r\n\r\nlicensees of cinemas that one of the conditions of\r\n\r\na licence should be that no children under the age\r\n\r\nof  sixteen years should be admitted to see  films\r\n\r\nclassified as unsuitable for children by the  Film\r\n\r\nCensor.  This provision, Sir, is a very  important\r\n\r\none  and  it  is  my intention to ask  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee to examine the implications of this  provision in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 13 and 14 deal, as the explanatory\r\n\r\nstatement  shows,  with the refusal,  cancellation\r\n\r\nand   suspension  of  licences.  The  clauses  are\r\n\r\nstraightforward and are in keeping with  the  main\r\n\r\nconsiderations  and requirements on  which,  as  I\r\n\r\nstated earlier, the Bill is based.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 is for the resolution of doubt whether\r\n\r\nany entertainment was \"public\" or not. Attempts to\r\n\r\nrebut  changes under the Bill on the grounds  that\r\n\r\nentertainments   were   not   \"public\"   must   be\r\n\r\nanticipated. In placing the onus of proof  on  the\r\n\r\nperson  alleging  that  the entertainment  is  not\r\n\r\n\"public\", regard has been given  to  the  circumstance  that such doubt will be material only  when\r\n\r\nan  offence  under the Ordinance has  prima  facie\r\n\r\nbeen  committed, and to the extensive  exemptions\r\n\r\nallowed  for statutorily and expected  to  be  conferred by the Minister under the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another important clause is clause 22 which\r\n\r\nintroduces   a  provision  long  sought   by   the\r\n\r\nLicensing  Authority under the Theatres  Ordinance\r\n\r\nto  allow effective recourse to the best available\r\n\r\nexpert  advice in determining whether a particular\r\n\r\npublic entertainment, especially if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the nature of a professional sporting contest,\r\n\r\nfor  example, boxing or wrestling contests, should\r\n\r\nbe  licensed or not. The clause provides that  \"it\r\n\r\nshall  be  sufficient  reason  for  refusing\"   to\r\n\r\nlicense such an entertainment if the expert advice\r\n\r\ngiven  is that it should be refused but final  discretion  is given to the Licensing Officer whether\r\n\r\nhe  wishes to act in accordance with the advice he\r\n\r\nhas received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have indicated earlier, I do not\r\n\r\npropose  to go into matters of detail which  could\r\n\r\nof  course  be dealt with in the ordinary  way  in\r\n\r\nCommittee  but  it  is the Government's  intention\r\n\r\nafter  its  Second Reading to have  the  Bill  committed to a Select Committee. I am confident, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  purpose of this Bill and the principles\r\n\r\non  which it is based will commend itself to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  and  that they will give  it  its  Second\r\n\r\nReading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.37 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we welcome this Bill\r\n\r\nas a reasonable and sensible measure to improve on\r\n\r\nan  outdated Theatres Ordinance enacted nearly  40\r\n\r\nyears  ago. We also welcome the decision  to  send\r\n\r\nthe Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that all entertainments from tiddly-winks to\r\n\r\ncoconut-shies in a fun-fair are brought within its\r\n\r\nscope,  it is clearly necessary to give it  closer\r\n\r\nexamination before it becomes law and I hope  very\r\n\r\nmuch that the proprietors and sponsors of all the\r\n\r\nmultifarious  forms of entertainment available  in\r\n\r\nthis  modern  age in Singapore will  come  forward\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Select Committee to give evidence  so\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill is not only comprehensive  but  as\r\n\r\nfair  as  possible to all concerned. Speaking  for\r\n\r\nmyself,  I  am  acquainted  with  some  forms   of\r\n\r\nentertainment - some    professional    and     some\r\n\r\namateur - and I would therefore like to touch  on  a\r\n\r\nfew    points    which   will   require    careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, there is the question as to\r\n\r\nwhether  public entertainment should be controlled\r\n\r\nby  a Licensing Officer and assistants as provided\r\n\r\nby  the  Bill or by a Licensing Board.  The  advantages of a Licensing Board would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  approval  of entertainments  or  their\r\n\r\ndisapproval  could be carried  out  according  to\r\n\r\nreliably  and  reasonably fixed  standards  which\r\n\r\nwould vary very little from place to place in the\r\n\r\nisland.  The system at present is that  an  entertainment  has  to be approved by the  officer  in\r\n\r\ncharge of the police station in the area in which\r\n\r\nthe  entertainment is to be held. The  result  is\r\n\r\nthat a more liberal interpretation of what may be\r\n\r\nshown can differ in one district than in another.\r\n\r\nLet   me   take  perhaps  the  somewhat   obvious\r\n\r\nexample - striptease acts and shows of that nature.\r\n\r\nI  know  of  establishments where the  police  definitely  do not permit any form of striptease - in\r\n\r\nour  opinion,  on this side of the  House,  quite\r\n\r\nrightly   too.  I  also  know  of  one   or   two\r\n\r\nestablishments operating in the city  at  present\r\n\r\nwhere  striptease acts are being presented  night\r\n\r\nafter  night.  In  other  words,  Sir,  different\r\n\r\nstandards  are being followed in different  areas\r\n\r\nby different police stations. I sometimes look at\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  newspapers. I cannot  read  Chinese\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  but I do not  have  to  know  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  to  understand the pictures advertising\r\n\r\nplaces  of entertainment and some of these  leave\r\n\r\nnothing  to  the imagination. The question  today\r\n\r\narises  as to whether Government permits or  does\r\n\r\nnot  permit striptease acts. In theory, it claims\r\n\r\nthat  it does not, but in practice, it winks  the\r\n\r\nother  eye. In this very youthful community which\r\n\r\nis  Singapore  today, striptease  acts  and  nude\r\n\r\nshows  should surely not be permitted. There  are\r\n\r\nplenty  of other forms of entertainment  for  our\r\n\r\npopulation and for our tourists. I would like the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   come  out   with   a   definite\r\n\r\ndeclaration as to where they stand in this matter\r\n\r\nand  what their policy is. It is not for them  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  it is a police matter; the  Government\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  police. I hope that  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Minister to the Chief  Secretary  will\r\n\r\nmake  the  position clear during  his  reply.  My\r\n\r\nargument  therefore  is, Sir,  that  a  Licensing\r\n\r\nBoard  would  have  an advantage  over  Licensing\r\n\r\nOfficers as they would be in a better position to\r\n\r\nmaintain  consistent standards of what should  or\r\n\r\nshould not constitute \"public\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentertainment  and to interpret regulations  laid\r\n\r\ndown  by  the  Government. On the other  hand,  a\r\n\r\nBoard,  it  is true, would present disadvantages:\r\n\r\nthe  main one being the speed with which licences\r\n\r\ncould  be  obtained.  A Board  cannot  remain  in\r\n\r\ncontinual session whereas a Licensing Officer  is\r\n\r\nor   should  be  permanently  available.   Often,\r\n\r\nlicences  are  needed  at a moment's  notice  nor\r\n\r\nshould  they be denied a promoter at  a  moment's\r\n\r\nnotice  if reasonably possible. The possibilities\r\n\r\nof  combining  the  system of both  a  Board  and\r\n\r\nLicensing Officers are worth considering: a Board\r\n\r\nto see that consistent standards of licensing are\r\n\r\ncarried  out in the more difficult categories  of\r\n\r\nentertainment and Licensing Officers empowered to\r\n\r\nauthorise  at short notice the routine  forms  of\r\n\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next come to clause 14 regarding the\r\n\r\ncancellation  or suspension of a licence.  Clause\r\n\r\n11,  in  certain circumstances, goes with it.  An\r\n\r\naggrieved  person whose licence is  cancelled  or\r\n\r\nsuspended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"may, within fourteen days of the service\r\n\r\non  him  of  the grounds of such cancellation  or\r\n\r\nsuspension,  appeal in writing to  the  Minister,\r\n\r\nwhose decision thereon shall be final. Where  the\r\n\r\nMinister  decides to restore a  licence,  he  may\r\n\r\nimpose such conditions as he thinks fit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I think the procedure laid down here  needs\r\n\r\nto  be examined extremely carefully. Cancellation\r\n\r\nof   a  licence  in  certain  cases  may  involve\r\n\r\nforfeiture  of security under clause 11.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  to  hear the  appeal,  I  feel  the\r\n\r\naggrieved  party should be given the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  appear  in  person  or with  his  lawyer  and\r\n\r\nwitnesses  and evidence on oath should be  taken,\r\n\r\nthe  Licensing  Officer  and  his  witnesses   to\r\n\r\nsupport  the cancellation of the licence and  the\r\n\r\nforfeiture of the security, the licensee and  his\r\n\r\nwitnesses  to  show cause why the licence  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  cancelled  and the  security  forfeited.\r\n\r\nUnless   evidence  is  given  on  oath,  I   fear\r\n\r\nwitnesses  may  take advantage  and  issue  false\r\n\r\nreports or statements to the Licensing Officer or\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister. The licensee  should  also  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses\r\n\r\nwho give evidence for the Licensing Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be inclined to go even further. I would\r\n\r\nquestion  whether, in fact, it is  right  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to hear appeals against the cancellation\r\n\r\nof  licences.  Why not appoint a  district  judge,\r\n\r\ncivil  or criminal, to hear such appeals?  To  compare   sections  416  and  417  of  the   Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code, there is, for example, sub-section\r\n\r\n(1) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of a\r\n\r\ncourt that any bond taken under this Code has been\r\n\r\nforfeited,  the court shall record the grounds  of\r\n\r\nsuch  proof  and may summon before it  any  person\r\n\r\nbound  by such bond and call upon him to  pay  the\r\n\r\npenaliy thereof or to show cause why it should not\r\n\r\nbe paid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Section 417 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All orders made under section 416 by any\r\n\r\nMagistrate's  Court  or District  Court  shall  be\r\n\r\nappealable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Either  some such procedure should be followed  or\r\n\r\nit  should be made much clearer in the Bill or  in\r\n\r\nRules   published  under  the  Bill  as  to   what\r\n\r\nprocedure the Minister will adopt when considering\r\n\r\nthe appeal of an aggrieved person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is this. Under clause 8 of the existing Ordinance, police officers not\r\n\r\nunder the rank of sergeants may enter premises  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  the conditions of a licence are  being\r\n\r\nobserved. In the Bill before us, clause 16 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any Licensing Officer or police officer may\r\n\r\nenter   any   place   where  a   licensed   public\r\n\r\nentertainment  is being provided with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nascertaining whether the conditions of the licence\r\n\r\nand  the  provisions of this Ordinance  are  being\r\n\r\ncomplied with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This,  in our opinion, is going too far. We  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  qualification not  below  the  rank  of\r\n\r\ninspector would be reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would refer to the very difficult point already touched on by my hon.\r\n\r\nFriend    opposite   which   will   need   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration in Select Committee,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nproposal under clause 10 (2) which prescribes that\r\n\r\nchildren under the age of sixteen years shall  not\r\n\r\nbe admitted to certain forms of entertainment. The\r\n\r\ntheory  of it is an admirable one and I would  not\r\n\r\nquarrel with it, but the practical application  of\r\n\r\nit is quite another matter. On whom is the onus to\r\n\r\nbe placed of preventing admission: the promoter of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentertainment  whose  only  recourse  will  be  to\r\n\r\ndemand  the production of identity cards from  the\r\n\r\nmajority of his would-be patrons - if identity cards\r\n\r\ncan be accepted as evidence of age; or the parents\r\n\r\nor  guardians  who should in fact be  responsible?\r\n\r\n\"X\"  films  for  adults only are approved  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom and I know cinema proprietors  have\r\n\r\ngreat  difficulty in deciding whether a  child  is\r\n\r\nabove  or below the prescribed age. In this multi-racial  community, I would challenge the Hon. the\r\n\r\nAssistant Minister, if 100 children aged either 15\r\n\r\nor  16  years were ranged up in front of  him,  to\r\n\r\nplace  them in the right category from looking  at\r\n\r\nthem. And should the dividing line be 16? Why  not\r\n\r\n15  or  17? How did the Government arrive at  this\r\n\r\nfigure? These are some of the questions which, we\r\n\r\nwill agree in this House I think, need further and\r\n\r\nvery careful consideration and I would say, in all\r\n\r\nhonesty,  that  on most of them, I  have  an  open\r\n\r\nmind. But the basis of a Bill of this kind is  not\r\n\r\nin  the  clauses  of the Bill itself  but  in  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  and  the  rules  which  the  Government\r\n\r\nadvances  to  make them work. That  is  the  vital\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government of the day rather\r\n\r\nthan of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this Bill is\r\n\r\nmost  welcome. As a matter of fact, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nI  think  that  this  Bill seeks  to  control  the\r\n\r\n\"Funland\"  operators of juke-boxes and pin-tables.\r\n\r\nThis  is  far  long overdue and it has  taken  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  six years to consider the introduction\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill.  However, it is better  late  than\r\n\r\nnever. The shops in which these pin-tables or juke-boxes  are operated do not only disturb  or  annoy\r\n\r\nthe  neighbours  but they also at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nencourage the proper trading shops to change their\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  set themselves  up  as  \"Funland\"\r\n\r\noperators.  Most  of  the shops  which  find  that\r\n\r\nbusiness  is slackening nowadays prefer  to  close\r\n\r\ndown  their  businesses and set themselves  up  as\r\n\r\n\"Funland\"  or \"Gayland\" operators. Some  of  these\r\n\r\nFunland operators of \"games\", as they are called,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  in  fact  encouraging gambling  within  their\r\n\r\npremises, like a certain case that was decided  in\r\n\r\ncourt recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, the Bill is good but there are some\r\n\r\nclauses  in  this  Bill which can  be  subject  to\r\n\r\nabuse,  for example, the clause which gives powers\r\n\r\nto  only  one single man - a Licensing Officer.  The\r\n\r\ndiscretion of one single man is apt to  be  abused\r\n\r\nby  either the Licensing Officer himself or any of\r\n\r\nhis  junior  officers  who  investigate  before  a\r\n\r\nlicence  is considered. I also know that there  is\r\n\r\nanother  clause in this Bill which allows  appeals\r\n\r\nto  the Minister but whatever appeals are made  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, they are always considered  on  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Licensing Officer.  When  an\r\n\r\napplication for a licence is made to the Licensing\r\n\r\nOfficer, he sends out his investigators or  junior\r\n\r\nofficers  to  investigate and make a  report.  The\r\n\r\nreport  is submitted to the Licensing Officer  and\r\n\r\nhe  makes his decision. Should the appeal  against\r\n\r\nthe  refusal of granting a licence come before the\r\n\r\nMinister,  the Minister has to base his discretion\r\n\r\non  the report from the Licensing Officer and  his\r\n\r\njunior officers. So it is rather difficult for the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  decide favourably and he  will  then\r\n\r\nhave   to   stand   by   his  Licensing   Officer.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Sir, the powers vested in one  single\r\n\r\nman  will  also encourage corruption.  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly and the City Council have  promised\r\n\r\nthat they will wipe out corruption. The passing of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  at any time today or after its  Second\r\n\r\nReading  will  certainly make us a  party  to  the\r\n\r\nencouragement of corruption. What is  there,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  prevent the Licensing Officer from being tempted  into  corruption? He can try his very best  to\r\n\r\nmake  the granting of an application for a licence\r\n\r\nas  difficult  as  possible.  Naturally,  when  an\r\n\r\napplicant submits an application, he wants  it  to\r\n\r\nbe approved and if difficulties arise, there is no\r\n\r\nother   alternative  than  to  seek  the  backdoor\r\n\r\nsource - and  I  am quite sure that  the  Government\r\n\r\nknow  what  that backdoor source is. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand, Sir, if the Licensing Officer is a friend of\r\n\r\none  applicant  and  is not  friendly  to  another\r\n\r\napplicant he could certainly show more favours  to\r\n\r\nhis  friend  than to the other man. Is this  fair,\r\n\r\nSir? I will quote an instance. Mr A\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nis  the Licensing Officer and Mr B is friendly to\r\n\r\nhim.  Mr  B  submits his application  and  it  is\r\n\r\napproved but Mr C may have his application turned\r\n\r\ndown  by  Mr A through the influence  of  Mr  B,\r\n\r\nalthough his shop may be very near to that of  Mr\r\n\r\nB.  Is  this fair to one and all? I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat this is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of licences for hotels and bars,\r\n\r\nI  understand that the authority is  vested  in  a\r\n\r\nBoard  of Licensing Justices comprising a Chairman\r\n\r\nand  a  few members of the Justices of the  Peace.\r\n\r\nEven  restaurants  or eating-houses,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  the City Council, are also considered\r\n\r\nby  the  Health  Committee of  the  City  Council.\r\n\r\nThough the Health Officer has a good say in it, he\r\n\r\nhas got  to  submit  his  report  to  the   Health\r\n\r\nCommittee and the Health Committee after  deciding\r\n\r\non  the  application has to submit it to the  full\r\n\r\nBoard or Council for confirmation. So you can  see\r\n\r\nvery well in this case that it is not one man  who\r\n\r\nmakes his decision but a number of persons forming\r\n\r\na Board or a Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a new piece of legislation and I\r\n\r\nfully agree with the Member for Tanglin (Mr John Ede)\r\n\r\nthat  there are advantages and disadvantages in  a\r\n\r\nBoard  of Licensing Justices when compared with  a\r\n\r\nLicensing  Officer.  There  may  be  cases   where\r\n\r\nimmediate attention is needed such as small shows,\r\n\r\nand so on. Well, in those cases, they can then  be\r\n\r\ndecided  by the Licensing Officer but where  these\r\n\r\njuke-boxes or pin-tables are concerned,  there  is\r\n\r\nno necessity for a rush or urgent case-sitting. It\r\n\r\ncan  certainly be referred to a Board of Licensing\r\n\r\nJustices.  We should consider the applications  in\r\n\r\nthe   same   way   as  those  for  bars,   hotels,\r\n\r\nrestaurants,  coffee-shops  or  eating-houses.   I\r\n\r\nthink   that  Government  should  specify  certain\r\n\r\ncategories   which  can  be  considered   by   the\r\n\r\nLicensing  Officer and certain categories  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Licensing  Justices  because,  if   you\r\n\r\nclassify or band the whole thing into one, it will\r\n\r\nbe  rather difficult for the Licensing Officer  or\r\n\r\nthe  Board of Justices to make decisions.  As  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin rightly pointed out, we should\r\n\r\nhave  two separate bodies and I am quite sure that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  could specify certain  categories\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Bill for each body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government is going to send\r\n\r\nthis  Bill to Select Committee as we have  got  to\r\n\r\ntake  public  opinion. The Member for Tanglin  him\r\n\r\nself  is  a  man  who  is closely  connected  with\r\n\r\nentertainment professionally and as an amateur and\r\n\r\nI  am  quite sure that he would like to  give  his\r\n\r\nviews  to the Select Committee. There may be  juke\r\n\r\nbox  or pin-table operators who also want to  give\r\n\r\ntheir  views. We should not be accused of  rushing\r\n\r\nthrough or forcing upon the people a Bill of  this\r\n\r\nnature. So I welcome the statement that this  Bill\r\n\r\nis to be referred to Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.55 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not intend to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  this Bill and I have not  much  opinion\r\n\r\neither way on the matters that were raised by  the\r\n\r\ntwo Members of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was one matter that was raised by\r\n\r\nboth of them and that was the question of abuse of\r\n\r\ncertain  powers given to one man: maybe he  is  an\r\n\r\nofficial or when it comes to an appeal it  is  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Sir, the question raises  an  issue  on\r\n\r\nprinciple  and  that  is that in  the  present-day\r\n\r\nlife,  there are thousands of matters, Sir,  which\r\n\r\nrequire  to  be regulated in order that  relations\r\n\r\nbetween citizen and citizen of the State and  also\r\n\r\nbetween  the  citizen and the State  are  properly\r\n\r\nconducted,  and also that the obligations  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizen  to  the State are properly  carried  out.\r\n\r\nNow,  in  every-day life today, there are hundreds\r\n\r\nof   matters  which  require  approval  from  some\r\n\r\nauthority or other and therefore the question does\r\n\r\narise  as to who should be responsible for  giving\r\n\r\nthe necessary approval for all these small things,\r\n\r\nlike  hawkers' licences - in this case, the licences\r\n\r\ngiven by the Licensing Officer - and also who should\r\n\r\nbe  responsible for refusal to grant such licences\r\n\r\nor  who  should  be responsible for revoking  such\r\n\r\nlicences   and  where  the  appeal   should   lie.\r\n\r\nNormally,  in a democratic society,  Sir,  one  is\r\n\r\nvery chary of giving away to individuals powers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   could  be  exercised  by  the   individual\r\n\r\nunfairly  and  could be abused. In a  totalitarian\r\n\r\nsociety  and  in communist countries,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no question of abuse of powers  because\r\n\r\nall the powers are vested with certain individuals\r\n\r\nand  nobody  dares to query as to the  rights  and\r\n\r\nwrongs  of decisions of those individuals because,\r\n\r\nif  they  do, well they get locked up.  There  are\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  matters that arise every  day  which\r\n\r\nrequire   approvals  and  disapprovals,  but   the\r\n\r\nquestion arises: how far should those persons who make the laws  of\r\n\r\nthe  country go in order to create machinery which\r\n\r\nwould  be  the machinery responsible for  granting\r\n\r\nsuch  approvals;  whether the  Legislature  should\r\n\r\nwant in every case that approvals and disapprovals\r\n\r\nand appeals should go to a tribunal or a court  or\r\n\r\na  judge and if that is so, Sir, how far can  such\r\n\r\nmachinery  be  workable when  thousands  of  petty\r\n\r\ncases  are concerned? That is a question that  the\r\n\r\nLegislature has got to think about. If the Legislature  thinks that every case should go to  a  very\r\n\r\nhigh  authority because injustice or  abuse  might\r\n\r\ntake  place, well then the State will have to  set\r\n\r\nup a very complex judiciary machinery, which means\r\n\r\nthat   the   State  will  have  to   incur   heavy\r\n\r\nexpenditure. If the Legislature thinks that  these\r\n\r\nmatters  are not big enough to go to such  a  high\r\n\r\nlevel  and  that  the official and,  in  cases  of\r\n\r\nappeal, the Minister, could be competent to decide\r\n\r\nand  could  decide, shall we say,  in  most  cases\r\n\r\nimpartially - because after all human nature has got\r\n\r\ncertain   failings -  well  then,   I   think   the\r\n\r\nLegislature should say, \"Right, we draw the  limit\r\n\r\nhere  and beyond this, we think individuals should\r\n\r\nbe  responsible.\" I think that is a question which\r\n\r\nMembers will have to consider carefully because it\r\n\r\nmeans  involving the State in a lot of expenditure later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome this Bill being\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Select Committee.

We  know  that\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to control public entertainment\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit and protection of the people,  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  what is good is shown to  them;  but  I\r\n\r\ncertainly  feel that it is also the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to retard healthy activities  which\r\n\r\ncome under this definition. If this Bill should go\r\n\r\nthrough, then all forms of activities indulged  in\r\n\r\nby  sports  organisations, youth clubs,  and  even\r\n\r\ncultural associations will have to come under this\r\n\r\ndefinition. No matter what they do, they will have\r\n\r\nto  seek permission to get a licence. Under clause\r\n\r\n15 the Minister doubtless may by order exempt them\r\n\r\nfrom  obtaining a licence, but until such promises\r\n\r\nare  incorporated into the law, all  organisations\r\n\r\nwhich run sporting contests such as boxing matches\r\n\r\nand  football  matches to which  the  public  have\r\n\r\naccess  will  have  to come  for  a  licence.  The\r\n\r\ntournaments  which  the  youth  clubs  run   among\r\n\r\nthemselves  are,  according  to  this  definition,\r\n\r\npublic  entertainment, and if we are going to  put\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  their  way,  then  we  will   be\r\n\r\nretarding  their healthy growth.

The definition of\r\n\r\n\"public  entertainment\" is  so  wide  that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to come to a decision quickly,  and  the\r\n\r\nformality and delays incurred by a Licensing Board\r\n\r\nwould, in my opinion, make it unsuitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same argument also applies to an Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard.  Here  again  the  argument  is  that   the\r\n\r\nformality and delays of an Appeals Board would  be\r\n\r\nunsuitable  to deal with public entertainment.  We\r\n\r\ndid   consider   having  a  board  for   licensing\r\n\r\nentertainments, but we felt that in the  interests\r\n\r\nof  both the Government and the applicants  for  a\r\n\r\nlicence, the system as suggested in the Bill would\r\n\r\nbe more satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of cancellation and the\r\n\r\nforfeiture  of bond has been raised by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin. It is not desirable in the interests\r\n\r\nof  implementing this Bill that we  should  invite\r\n\r\nlawyers,  etc, to appear before the Minister  when\r\n\r\nappeals  are heard, but there is nothing  to  stop\r\n\r\nthe Minister from calling the applicant should  he\r\n\r\nrequire  further information to be  placed  before\r\n\r\nhim before a final decision is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the standards of shows like strip-tease, as mentioned by the hon.

We  could  either  put\r\n\r\nsomething  into the rules or the Government  could\r\n\r\nhave some sort of policy which could be applied in\r\n\r\nthe case of applications for shows. I do not think\r\n\r\nwe have had many complaints about this in the past\r\n\r\nand  I  hope that in the event of this Bill  being\r\n\r\nimplemented  there  will not  be  many  complaints\r\n\r\nregarding the standardisation of these shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the powers of the police\r\n\r\nunder  clauses 16 and 17 has been raised. We  gave\r\n\r\nvery careful consideration to this question and we\r\n\r\ncame  to  the conclusion that it is not  right  to\r\n\r\nmention in this Bill that the powers of the police\r\n\r\nshould  be restricted to the rank of an inspector.\r\n\r\nIt  may well be that at the time of the commission\r\n\r\nof  an  offence,  namely,  the  violation  of  any\r\n\r\nconditions,  a  police constable is  on  duty  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  no action can be taken until  a  police\r\n\r\ninspector  arrives; and it is not  easy,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nhave  so many inspectors supervising these  shows.\r\n\r\nBut,  however, if at any time it is found  that  a\r\n\r\npolice  constable or any other police officer  has been so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfoolish  as  to act, I can assure the hon.

It  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy, Sir, to  exempt  all  normal\r\n\r\nhealthy activities of the community - schools, youth\r\n\r\nclubs, athletic associations and so on - and I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the  hon.

Up to now the standards of safety have been\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in  the  Machinery Ordinance  (Chapter\r\n\r\n223),  which was brought into operation  in  1921,\r\n\r\nand amended by Ordinances No. 11 of 1931, No. 34 of 1935, No. 14 of 1937, No. 33 of 1952, No. 37 of 1952, and No. 4 of 1954.  That  Ordinance provides for the inspection\r\n\r\nof boilers, engines and other machinery and the re\r\n\r\ngulation,  control and working of such  machinery.\r\n\r\nIt  has  however no provision relating to electric\r\n\r\nor portable machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protection of Workers Ordinance (Chapter 152), amended by Ordinance No. 37 of 1952, provided for protection against disease and\r\n\r\naccidents   of   workers  engaged   in   dangerous\r\n\r\noccupations, but it has never been implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these two Ordinances is really\r\n\r\nsuitable   for  present-day  conditions.   It   is\r\n\r\nconsidered,   therefore,  that  they   should   be\r\n\r\nrepealed and the Factories Bill introduced to make\r\n\r\nworking   conditions  in  factories  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nconform  with internationally recognised standards\r\n\r\nas   laid   down  by  the  Inter-rational   Labour Organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be realised that in passing such a Bill\r\n\r\nwe  are  looking after the interests of more  than\r\n\r\n120,000  persons, who represent about  one-quarter\r\n\r\nof   the   total  population  who  are   gainfully\r\n\r\nemployed.  This  Bill is primarily  based  on  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom legislation which follows  closely\r\n\r\nthe International Labour Organisation's convention\r\n\r\nand  recommendations. It is necessary in  a  legislation of this magnitude to have some modification\r\n\r\nto  suit  local conditions. This has been done  in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the Singapore  Labour  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard,  the  City  Council and representatives  of\r\n\r\nconsulting engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the armed services are in\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the proposed application  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill to their establishment,  as\r\n\r\nsub-clause  (4) of clause 73 has been incorporated\r\n\r\nat their request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to set down the\r\n\r\nminimum standards of health, safety and welfare of workers in factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation of the Bill will involve\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  an expenditure  of  the  order  of\r\n\r\n$146,000  per  annum of which $59,000  is  largely\r\n\r\nmade  up  of  the salaries of extra  staff  which,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the present staff in the  Factories\r\n\r\nInspectorate  of  the Labour Department,  will  be\r\n\r\nneeded to implement the provisions of the Bill. To\r\n\r\na  large  extent, however, this is  offset  by  an\r\n\r\nanticipated revenue of $98,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of the expression \"factory\"\r\n\r\ncovers premises in which manual labour is used for\r\n\r\na  wide  number  of purposes. The remaining  parts\r\n\r\ncover  provisions  for  health,  safety,  welfare,\r\n\r\nadministration and penalties for offences  against\r\n\r\nany   provisions  of  the  Bill.  The  explanatory\r\n\r\nstatements  briefly  cover  the  purposes  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is proposed, Sir, should this motion be\r\n\r\ncarried, to submit the Bill to a Select Committee,\r\n\r\nit  is hardly necessary for me to go through it in\r\n\r\ndetail. I now move that the Bill be read a  Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.13 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, while we welcome the introduction of the\r\n\r\nFactories Bill, I must draw attention to the large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  premises  or trades  which  will  come\r\n\r\nwithin the definition of \"factory\". We must always\r\n\r\nremember  that in Singapore there are niany  small\r\n\r\ntraders who have a little place where they earn  a\r\n\r\nliving for themselves and their families. In  many\r\n\r\nsuch  places  you  will  probably  find  that  the\r\n\r\nworkmen consist of members of the family and maybe\r\n\r\none  or  two  more other workers. I refer  to  the\r\n\r\npremises  as  defined in clause 6  (1)  (a).  Sir,\r\n\r\ntailor shops and dress shops, whether they are big\r\n\r\nor  small,  come  within this  category.  Sundries\r\n\r\nshops - they do a bit of packing of articles  to  be\r\n\r\nsold - will  also  come  under this  category.  Even\r\n\r\nfishermen repairing their nets seem to come within\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  definition. If this Bill is going  to  cover\r\n\r\nsuch  a wide range of trades, I believe it is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to encourage people to expand their business\r\n\r\nor try to earn a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people hate most, I think, especially the\r\n\r\nsmall  people, is to have a health officer  coming\r\n\r\nalong  and  poking his nose into their houses  and\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Look, you may be carrying on a  business\r\n\r\non  your own, but this is under the definition  of\r\n\r\n`factory' and you must not have this done here  or\r\n\r\nthat   done  there.  Also,  you  do  not  have   a\r\n\r\nsufficient amount of safeguards.\" These  pinpricks\r\n\r\nshould be removed. We all know that health, safety\r\n\r\nand  welfare  are very important  factors,  but  I\r\n\r\ncertainly feel that we must not overdo it. This is\r\n\r\nthe  East  and it has to learn. We are adapting  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of things from the West, but until  we\r\n\r\nprogress to a certain standard where we can be compared  with  the West, it should be  our  duty  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the small businessmen to  expand  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  help them along. If this  Bill  has\r\n\r\nthis  in view, I am for it, but if it is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  another source of nuisance for the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, then I think we will have to  fight  it\r\n\r\nout  in  the  Select Comniittee to see that  small\r\n\r\nbusinessmen are allowed to carry on their business\r\n\r\nwithout interference from the Nosy Parkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.17 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Sir, on a broad\r\n\r\nprinciple,  there is not very much  in  this  Bill\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  quarrel with. It  is  properly  the\r\n\r\nconcern of Government that factory conditions  are\r\n\r\nsuch that the workers' health and safety should be\r\n\r\nproperly  protected.  But we  must  remember  that\r\n\r\nGovernment is at the same time trying to encourage\r\n\r\nindustry, and therefore care must be taken to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the small industries especially are not  too\r\n\r\nmuch  affected,  and  that not  much  hardship  is\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the implementation of the regulations\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill.  The  cost to the small  industries\r\n\r\nwould  increase  if  they have  to  observe  these\r\n\r\nregulations, and there are some regulations  where\r\n\r\nthey  cannot even afford to put up the capital  in\r\n\r\norder  to comply with them. I think it is  clearly\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintention  of  the  Government to  exempt  certain\r\n\r\nsmall industries from these hardships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that clause 6 (4) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No premises shall be deemed to be a\r\n\r\nfactory  in  which less than six  persons  are  employed ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore,  the figure that will come  within  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  this  Bill  is  six.  Imagine  a  small\r\n\r\nbusiness employing six persons of mixed sexes - male\r\n\r\nand female. Under the Bill it will have to provide\r\n\r\nitems like separate sanitation, washing facilities\r\n\r\nand  so forth, as laid down in clauses 17 and  51.\r\n\r\nIn a small business there might easily be no space\r\n\r\nfor  these  facilities, and even  if  there  were,\r\n\r\nthese  could  easily  cost quite  a  few  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars  in  order to qualify for the  meaning  of\r\n\r\n\"proper separate accommodation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the solution is that until we can clear\r\n\r\nthe  major portion of our slums in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\naverage working place is still a better place from\r\n\r\nthe  health  point  of  view  than  the  congested\r\n\r\ncubicles in which the major portion of the workers\r\n\r\nhave  to  live, and we certainly will be depriving\r\n\r\nthe  worker  of a job if there is no common  sense\r\n\r\nbalance  struck  between the  conditions  existing\r\n\r\nhere and the conditions as envisaged in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Government has taken a\r\n\r\ncareful  survey  of the small industries  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of people employed in each of them, but  in\r\n\r\norder   to  avoid  possible  hardships  to   these\r\n\r\nindustries  which  the  Government  is  trying  to\r\n\r\nencourage,  I would strongly urge that the  number\r\n\r\nto   be   exempted  from  the  interpretation   of\r\n\r\n\"factory\" should be 12 instead of 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.22 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Speedy  police\r\n\r\ninvestigation  and  the  apprehension   of   those\r\n\r\nbreaking  the law are often impossible  when  such\r\n\r\ninvestigation has to be preceded by the contacting\r\n\r\nof   a  Justice  of  the  Peace,  the  laying   of\r\n\r\ninformation before him and the formal issue of the\r\n\r\nnecessary   warrant.   Secondly,   those    giving\r\n\r\ninformation are often unwilling to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappear  and  repeat their information  before  a\r\n\r\nstranger  in the person of the Justice. Finally,\r\n\r\nthe  time  involved in arranging for depositions\r\n\r\nto  be sworn before a Justice of the Peace  adds\r\n\r\nto  the delay in initiating action against those\r\n\r\nbreaking the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, owing to the frequent necessity of\r\n\r\nobtaining  such  warrants  to  search   premises\r\n\r\nwithout  delay,  the practice arose  some  years\r\n\r\nago,  following that in the United  Kingdom,  of\r\n\r\nappointing  police officers as Justices  of  the\r\n\r\nPeace.  This  practice is open to objection  and\r\n\r\nhas in fact been stopped now for some time past,\r\n\r\nsince the exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial\r\n\r\nfunctions   and   the  exercise   of   executive\r\n\r\nfunctions  should properly be kept separate  and\r\n\r\ndistinct, and because it is undesirable  that  a\r\n\r\npolice  officer issuing search warrants  on  his\r\n\r\nown  information  or that of some  other  person\r\n\r\nclosely associated with him should appear to  be\r\n\r\nexercising  a judicial discretion in  doing  so.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  Sir, it is highly desirable  that\r\n\r\npolice  investigations should begin  immediately\r\n\r\non   receipt   of  information  concerning   the\r\n\r\ncommission  or intended commission of  a  crime,\r\n\r\nand  the  purpose of clauses 2  and  3  of  this\r\n\r\namending  Bill, and of the two further Bills  of\r\n\r\nwhich  I  shall  be  moving the  Second  Reading\r\n\r\nimmediately, is to remedy this present  position\r\n\r\nand  to grant police officers not below the rank\r\n\r\nof   Assistant  Superintendent  of  Police   the\r\n\r\nnecessary    authority    to    issue    written\r\n\r\nauthorisation for entry and search  of  premises\r\n\r\nupon  written  information with which  they  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied  and  after any further  investigation\r\n\r\nthey deem to be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should point out that these\r\n\r\namendments  do  not  confer  any  indiscriminate\r\n\r\nright   of  entry  and  search  on  the  police.\r\n\r\nWarrants  to  search  or  written  authority  to\r\n\r\nsearch  are  still a prerequisite to  the  entry\r\n\r\ninto  premises  and such warrants  can  only  be\r\n\r\nissued  by  a  Justice of  the  Peace,  and  the\r\n\r\nwritten  authority  by senior  police  officers,\r\n\r\nthat is, Assistant Superintendents and above.

I beg to move,  \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already indicated, Sir, in moving the\r\n\r\nMilitary  Maneuvers  (Amendment)  Bill,  the  main\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this  Bill is also to  recognise  the\r\n\r\nchange  in organisation of both the R.A.F. in  the\r\n\r\nFar East and the Malayan Auxiliary Air Force as  a\r\n\r\nconsequence of the independence of the  Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly the Commander of the Auxiliary Air Force\r\n\r\nas  a  whole was appointed jointly by the Governor\r\n\r\nand  the High Commissioner in the Federation,  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  providing that the person so appointed,\r\n\r\nif  he were not the Air Officer Commanding, R.A.F.\r\n\r\nMalaya  in  person,  should be under  his  orders.\r\n\r\nSince  the  Federation  became  independent,   the\r\n\r\nappointment of Air Officer Commanding, Malaya, has\r\n\r\nbeen  abolished and a joint Commander is therefore\r\n\r\nno  longer appropriate. The Bill accordingly seeks\r\n\r\nto  provide for the appointment by the Governor of\r\n\r\na Commander of the Singapore section only who will\r\n\r\nexercise, in regard to the Singapore section,  the\r\n\r\npowers  formerly  exercised  by  the  Air  Officer\r\n\r\nCommanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make\r\n\r\ncertain  further amendments to the Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  of these is that the Bill seeks to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  a  Reserve  of  Airmen  in  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReserve  of Officers. Previously the functions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Auxiliary Air Force  were  primarily\r\n\r\nconcerned with flying, and it is perhaps for  that\r\n\r\nreason that the Ordinance originally provided only\r\n\r\nfor  a  Reserve of Officers. The primary role  has\r\n\r\nnow  however changed to the provision  of  fighter\r\n\r\ncontrol  units whose members undergo  lengthy  and\r\n\r\nscientific training and whose task is to man radar\r\n\r\nreporting  stations in the event of war or  threat\r\n\r\nof  war.  It  is therefore desirable that  trained\r\n\r\nmembers  of  such units should be available  in  a\r\n\r\nreserve,  more especially since of all  the  local\r\n\r\nforces it is the fighter control unit which  would\r\n\r\nalmost certainly be required to be mobilised in an\r\n\r\nemergency at the shortest possible notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill seeks to give recognition to\r\n\r\nthe  new status of Singapore citizenship by making\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens eligible to join the force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill seeks to clarify a provision in\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance regarding the payment  of  pensions\r\n\r\nand  gratuities to widows and families of  members\r\n\r\nwho  die  from  injuries as well  as  from  wounds\r\n\r\nreceived  in  the  course of  service.  Since  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was  amended to permit members  of  the\r\n\r\nAuxiliary  Air  Force  to  be  used  on   internal\r\n\r\nsecurity    duties,    this    clarification    is\r\n\r\nparticularly desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.

Certain  functions\r\n\r\nunder the parent Ordinance are vested in the  Flag\r\n\r\nOfficer,  Malayan Area, an appointment  which  has\r\n\r\nnow  been  abolished, the functions  of  the  post\r\n\r\nhaving  been taken over by the Commander-in-Chief,\r\n\r\nFar  East.  This Bill accordingly  seeks  to  give\r\n\r\nlegal recognition to this transfer of functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, opportunity has been taken to\r\n\r\nmake  certain further amendments to the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the Bill also recognises the new  status\r\n\r\nof Singapore citizenship. Secondly, the Bill seeks\r\n\r\nto give effect to a promise made by the Government\r\n\r\nat  the  time  when the M.R.N.V.R.  Ordinance  was\r\n\r\namended last year to enable volunteers to be  used\r\n\r\non  internal security duties. Clause 8 of the Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to  provide for the award  of  pensions  or\r\n\r\ngratuities to volunteers wounded or injured in the\r\n\r\ncourse of their service, including service on\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninternal security duties, and also for the payment\r\n\r\nof  pensions  or  gratuities  to  the  widows  and\r\n\r\nfamilies of such members who are killed or who die\r\n\r\nof  wounds received in the course of, or  from  an\r\n\r\nillness directly attributable to, their service as\r\n\r\nsuch  members.  This clause brings the  M.R.N.V.R.\r\n\r\ninto line with the other volunteer forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken in the Bill\r\n\r\nto  make various minor amendments to the Ordinance\r\n\r\nin order to clarify, and in some cases to amplify,\r\n\r\nits   provisions.  These  are  set  out   in   the\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Statement to which I do not  think  I\r\n\r\nneed add.

I beg to move, \"That  the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has always been customary in the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Widows' and  Orphans'  Pension\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  keep in line with the corresponding\r\n\r\nlaw  in  the Federation of Malaya, for the  reason\r\n\r\nthat  a  number of officers have at  times  served\r\n\r\nunder  both Governments and it has with some  been\r\n\r\nlargely  a  matter of chance to which scheme  they\r\n\r\nhave  been required to contribute throughout their\r\n\r\nservice. During the last few years there has  been\r\n\r\nconsiderable consultation with the authorities  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation on the provisions of this Ordinance\r\n\r\nfollowing  an  actuarial examination  of  the  two\r\n\r\nschemes  and the report of a Committee  which  was\r\n\r\nset  up  before the war. As a result of these  consultations  and  subsequent discussions  with  the\r\n\r\nStaff  Side  of the Singapore Civil Service  Joint\r\n\r\nCouncil,   which   have  taken  some   time,   the\r\n\r\namendments   now  proposed  in   this   Bill   are\r\n\r\nintroduced to accord with the amending legislation\r\n\r\nwhich has already been enacted in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill seeks to regularise the\r\n\r\nposition  of  officers on probation  or  agreement\r\n\r\nwith prospects of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermanency  in a pensionable office  between  11th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1950, and 1st January, 1955. Before  the\r\n\r\nearlier  date,  only  persons on  the  pensionable\r\n\r\nestablishment were admitted into the scheme.  With\r\n\r\neffect  from  that date, however,  the  Federation\r\n\r\nextended  the  application  of  their  scheme   to\r\n\r\npersons  on probation or agreement with  prospects\r\n\r\nof  permanency. One of the aims of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAmendment  Ordinance,  1952,  was  to   keep   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Ordinance in line with the Federation in\r\n\r\nthis  respect.  This  was not,  however,  achieved\r\n\r\nowing  to  the  failure to provide  that  the  new\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"public servant\" introduced  by  the\r\n\r\n1952  amending Ordinance should have retrospective\r\n\r\napplication  to  December 1950. Insertion  of  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"on  or  after the 11th  day  of  December,\r\n\r\n1950\",  proposed  in clause 2,  will  repair  this\r\n\r\nomission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making provision in the 1952 amending\r\n\r\nOrdinance, for officers on probation or  agreement\r\n\r\nto  be  required to contribute to this scheme,  it\r\n\r\nwas  also  provided that they could elect  not  to\r\n\r\nbecome, or to cease to be, contributors during the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  probation  or  agreement,  within  six\r\n\r\nmonths  of the date of publication of the amending\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The Ordinance was published in  October\r\n\r\n1952  but  it  was unfortunately not brought  into\r\n\r\neffect  until  17th  August,  1956,  when  it  was\r\n\r\nbrought into force retrospectively to 1st January,\r\n\r\n1955,  by  which time the period of election  had\r\n\r\nlong  expired. Officers on probation or  agreement\r\n\r\nappointed  between 1950 and August 1956 were  thus\r\n\r\ndenied  the  right to elect not to  become  or  to\r\n\r\ncease  to be contributors to the scheme, with  the\r\n\r\nresult  that they are now regarded as contributors\r\n\r\nduring  the period of their probation or agreement\r\n\r\nand  have  been required by the Directors  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme to pay arrears of contribution. In order to\r\n\r\nafford  them  the opportunity for  election  which\r\n\r\nthey have hitherto been denied, clause 3 seeks  to\r\n\r\nprovide for the necessary extension of the  period\r\n\r\nof notice under subsection (1) of section 5 of the\r\n\r\nmain Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the amending Bill deals with the\r\n\r\nrefund  of contributions to bachelors or  widowers\r\n\r\nwithout dependent children. At present, when  such\r\n\r\nofficers retire, they cease to contribute and  are\r\n\r\npaid  a  refund  of  only  50  per  cent  of   the\r\n\r\ncontributions made up to 31st December, 1954, and,\r\n\r\nby  the amendment made in the 1952 Ordinance,  the\r\n\r\ntotal  contributions  made  between  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1955,  and the date of retirement. Clause 4  seeks\r\n\r\nto   provide   for   the  full   refund   of   all\r\n\r\ncontributions  made  to  bachelors   or   widowers\r\n\r\nwithout  dependent  children on their  retirement,\r\n\r\ntogether with the payment of compound interest  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  21  per cent.

Federation  customs  officers  have   been\r\n\r\nauthorised by warrant to perform certain functions\r\n\r\nunder  the Ordinance. These functions include  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  duty,  the  search  of  goods  and\r\n\r\nbaggage within the limits of the station, and  the\r\n\r\npower of arrest without warrant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  an offence has been committed. Under section\r\n\r\n10  of the Ordinance, authorised officers have the\r\n\r\npowers  of  officers  of  the  customs  under  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Customs Ordinance, and  have  power  to\r\n\r\nenforce the provisions of the Ordinance in so  far\r\n\r\nas  they  relate to the collection of  revenue  on\r\n\r\nintoxicating liquors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the function of the\r\n\r\ncollection station established under the Ordinance\r\n\r\nhas  changed.  More and more it has tended  to  be\r\n\r\nused  for the collection of duty on goods imported\r\n\r\ninto the Federation from Singapore rather than for\r\n\r\nthe collection of duty on goods exported from that\r\n\r\nterritory. At the present time, the major  portion\r\n\r\nof  revenue  collected at the station  comes  from\r\n\r\nimports. Commercial firms in Singapore have  found\r\n\r\nit  increasingly convenient to ship goods into the\r\n\r\nFederation through this station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that the time has\r\n\r\ncome  to recognise this change of function of  the\r\n\r\ncollection   station,  and   to   regularise   its\r\n\r\noperations by changing the provisions of the  law.\r\n\r\nConsultations  to this end have taken  place  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government and the Bill  which  is\r\n\r\nnow before the Assembly is the outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is to be expected, Sir, in the circumstances\r\n\r\nthe   overall  effect  of  the  Bill  is  to  give\r\n\r\nextraterritorial  effect  in  Singapore   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Customs  Ordinance,  1952,   and   the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the clauses of the Bill are based  on\r\n\r\nthat Ordinance which, in turn, is very similar  to\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Customs Ordinance (Cap. 160).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not deal with the individual provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill,  Sir.  They are described  in  some\r\n\r\ndetail in the explanatory note, and there is  also\r\n\r\nattached to the Bill a list showing from where the\r\n\r\nvarious clauses of the Bill are derived. This list\r\n\r\nalso  shows which clauses are new. It can be seen,\r\n\r\nSir, on pages 26 and 27 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, Sir, one or two clauses to\r\n\r\nwhich I should invite attention. It will of course\r\n\r\nbe  realised that certain clauses of the Bill give\r\n\r\nofficers of the Federation Government considerable\r\n\r\npowers  within  the  territory of  Singapore.  For\r\n\r\nexample, clauses 14 (2), 24 and 29 give Federation\r\n\r\ncustoms officers power to examine the persons  and\r\n\r\nbaggage  of individuals at collection stations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The original intention was to  examine\r\n\r\npassengers and their personal baggage en route  to\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway.  This was considered  desirable  in\r\n\r\norder   to   avoid  a  long  delay   for   customs\r\n\r\nexamination  at Johore Bahru, and  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nmail  train services to be accelerated. Recently,\r\n\r\nhowever, the Federation Government has come to the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  it  would  be  better   if   the\r\n\r\nexamination  was  to  take place  in  the  railway\r\n\r\nstation at Singapore. Apparently, quite apart from\r\n\r\nthe  inconvenience  caused  tp  passengers  by  an\r\n\r\nexamination while the train is in motion, and from\r\n\r\nthe possibility that it might not be completed  in\r\n\r\ntime,  the  cost  of the staff  required  for  the\r\n\r\noperation  would be out of all proportion  to  the\r\n\r\nrevenue   likely   to  be  collected.   In   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it  is  now  suggested  that   the\r\n\r\nexamination  should  take  place  in  a  specially\r\n\r\nfenced-off portion of the concourse of the railway\r\n\r\nstation.  The cost of establishing and maintaining\r\n\r\nthe  examination point will fall  on  the  railway\r\n\r\nadministration. This suggestion has been  examined\r\n\r\nby the Ministries concerned from the point of view\r\n\r\nof  physical and mechanical practicability, and no\r\n\r\nobjection  is  seen to it. All things  considered,\r\n\r\nexamination  prior to departure would probably  be\r\n\r\npreferred by the large majority of passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that the Federation Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not wish to establish a collection  station\r\n\r\nat  Paya  Lebar  Airport for the time  being.  The\r\n\r\nvolume of traffic, both passenger and freight,  is\r\n\r\nwithin  the  capacity  of  customs  staff  at  the\r\n\r\nairports  in  the  Federation and  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment does not wish to incur the expense  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining a 24-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhour duty roster of customs officers at Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport.  In  addition, there has as yet  been  no\r\n\r\ndemand  from the commercial interests in Singapore\r\n\r\nfor the establishment of such a station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17 to 19 of the Bill provide for the\r\n\r\nexamination in the General Post Office, Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith  the  consent  and  by arrangement  with  the\r\n\r\nController of Posts, Singapore, of postal packages\r\n\r\naddressed to destinations in the Federation. These\r\n\r\nclauses  merely give legal sanction to a  practice\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been followed for a number  of  years.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a considerable source of  supply  of\r\n\r\ndutiable  goods for the Federation. From  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  extensive  use  has  been  made  of  postal\r\n\r\npackages to smuggle small dutiable articles,  like\r\n\r\nwatches  and  fountain pens, into the  Federation.\r\n\r\nWhen  such traffic has been suspected, it has been\r\n\r\ncustomary   for   the   Controller   of   Customs,\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya,  to  arEange   for   the\r\n\r\nController of Posts, Singapore, to have all postal\r\n\r\npackages for a certain destination in the  Federation  examined for a period of days. Normally,  no\r\n\r\npackages  are  opened. If, however,  packages  are\r\n\r\nfound  which might contain dutiable goods, details\r\n\r\nof  the  addresses  are  taken  and  forwarded  to\r\n\r\ncustoms  officers  at  the  destinations  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation so that action can be taken, to  bring\r\n\r\nthe  recipient  to book and to collect  duty.  The\r\n\r\nexamination is also sometimes used as a  check  on\r\n\r\nthe efficiency of customs staff in the Federation.\r\n\r\nIt  is unusual for more than two or three of these\r\n\r\nexaminations  to be required annually,  and  they\r\n\r\ngenerally last for no more than three or four days\r\n\r\nat a time. The examinations cause no inconvenience\r\n\r\nor  dislocation  of business in Singapore  and  no\r\n\r\nobjection is seen to their being held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53, Sir, confers on authorised Federation\r\n\r\ncustoms officers the powers of officers of customs\r\n\r\nunder  the Customs. Ordinance, Singapore, and  the\r\n\r\nDangerous  Drugs Ordinance, Singapore. Examination\r\n\r\nof  the Ordinances in question indicates that  the\r\n\r\npowers  so conferred, are wide and cover  all  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate   activities   of   customs    officers\r\n\r\noperating:\r\n\r\nunder  the customs law in Singapore. In practice,\r\n\r\nhowever, these powers will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimited to those which would follow in the  normal\r\n\r\nway  from  the  discovery  of  an  offence  or   a\r\n\r\nsuspected offence against Singapore law during the\r\n\r\ncourse   of   an  examination  at  an   authorised\r\n\r\npassenger station. For example, a passenger to the\r\n\r\nFederation might, on examination, be suspected  of\r\n\r\nbeing connected with a gang of opium smugglers. It\r\n\r\nmight  be  imperative to follow the trail  without\r\n\r\ndelay.  Under clause 53, this operation  would  be\r\n\r\nconducted   by   authorised   Federation   customs\r\n\r\nofficers  since the delay which might result  from\r\n\r\ninforming  the Singapore Customs Department  might\r\n\r\nmean  that  the law-breakers might be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nescape.  There would be no question of  Federation\r\n\r\nCustoms  officers exercising the powers  conferred\r\n\r\non  them  in  respect of matters not arising  from\r\n\r\nexaminations at collection stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government is fully aware of the\r\n\r\nwideness  of  these  powers  and  has  given  an\r\n\r\nassurance as to their use in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Federation Government undertakes that the\r\n\r\npowers  under the Singapore legislation  conferred\r\n\r\nby  this  section will only be exercised  where  a\r\n\r\nbreach  of the Singapore legislation comes to  the\r\n\r\nnotice  of Federation Customs and Revenue officers\r\n\r\nin  the  execution  of  their  duties  under  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is appreciated that the powers are wide,\r\n\r\nit  is  considered that their grant will make  for\r\n\r\ngreater   efficiency   in   customs   control   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Government is satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\npowers will not be abused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, Sir, be appreciated that an important\r\n\r\nconstitutional question is involved in  this  Bill\r\n\r\nin  so  far  as  it gives officers  of  a  foreign\r\n\r\nterritory rights of search and detention over  the\r\n\r\nperson  and goods of citizens of Singapore in  the\r\n\r\nterritory  of  Singapore. Such an arrangement  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  contemplated because of the close  ties,\r\n\r\neconomic and otherwise, between the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Singapore. It would  be  out  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion between Singapore and any other power. At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, the power o the Bill merely  seeks\r\n\r\nto recognise practice and procedures, the majority\r\n\r\nof which have been in force for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  great number of years in Singapore.

Members will recall that when the Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nand  Advice  Ordinance was passed  in  June  1956,\r\n\r\ncertain  objections to the measure were raised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Bar Committee. Discussions with the\r\n\r\nBar  Committee resulted in ironing  out  areas  of\r\n\r\ndisagreement. This Bill now seeks to  give  effect\r\n\r\nto  the  recommendations made by the Bar Committee\r\n\r\nwhich have been accepted by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Bar Committee's recommendations was\r\n\r\nthat in the working of the scheme, some measure of\r\n\r\nsupervision  should  be  exercised  by  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession,  although the Committee conceded  that\r\n\r\nthe service must be controlled and administered by\r\n\r\nthe Government. This point is met in clauses 2 and\r\n\r\n3 of the Bill which respectively alters section 11\r\n\r\nand  amends section 12 of the Legal Aid and Advice\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1956. It is now made incumbent  on  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Legal Aid that all applications  for\r\n\r\nlegal aid should be approved by a Board consisting\r\n\r\nof the Director of Legal Aid and not less than two\r\n\r\nadvocates and solicitors from the panel maintained\r\n\r\nby the Director of Legal Aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In amending the provisos to section 16 and\r\n\r\nsubsection (1) of section 17 respectively  of  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Aid  and Advice Ordinance, 1956, clauses  4\r\n\r\nand  5  give  effect to the Bar Committee's  recommendation  that  an aided person should  have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  have  his legal affairs  handled  by  a\r\n\r\nlawyer of his own choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the vexed question of fees\r\n\r\npayable  to lawyers working under the scheme,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has power under section 28 of the  Legal\r\n\r\nAid and Advice Ordinance, 1956, to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregulations  relating to fees and no amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance is therefore necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bar Committee has decided to issue no\r\n\r\ndirective  to  members of the Bar with  regard  to\r\n\r\nparticipation  in the scheme, and each  member  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  free to join the panel under section  4\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance as he thinks fit.

In one case, they  informed  me\r\n\r\nthat  the lawyer concerned never interviewed them.\r\n\r\nThey  waited  until the case came  up  before  the\r\n\r\ncourt  and then at that time started dealing  with\r\n\r\nhis  client,  asking him a few questions,  and  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases the people who received legal aid were\r\n\r\nreally  receiving  a  very  shabby  form  of  aid.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be that complaints of this type may\r\n\r\nbe  worth the Bar Committee's while to look  into,\r\n\r\nbut  I  certainly feel that if a person  receiving\r\n\r\naid  has  a  choice  of his lawyer  it  will  help\r\n\r\ntremendously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would say that if lawyers who are\r\n\r\nrendering  aid  in  such cases  are  found  to  be\r\n\r\nwanting  not  only  by  one  person  but  by  many\r\n\r\npersons, then it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans that the work has not been properly done and\r\n\r\nhe might properly come off the schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always note that lawyers always talk about\r\n\r\nfees  and  it is important to them as to how  much\r\n\r\nmoney they would get out of a case. The amount  of\r\n\r\nlegal  assistance  seems to be  dependent  on  the\r\n\r\namount  of money received. Of course I have  heard\r\n\r\nof  famous cases where people are charged sums  of\r\n\r\nthree  figures  and over and lawyers  refusing  to\r\n\r\nhandle cases, although deserving because all  that\r\n\r\nthe  client  can pay is a few hundred dollars.  I\r\n\r\nthink one former Member of the Assembly even  said\r\n\r\nthat his practice brought him well over $10,000  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  What  I am thinking about is  so  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  lawyers  have been talking about  Socialism\r\n\r\nand wanting to help the poor people and today even\r\n\r\nthe Bar Committee talks about fees. It pains me to\r\n\r\nsee  that those who talk loudest about helping the\r\n\r\npoor  people are actually the people  who  try  to\r\n\r\nask, `How much shall we get for our service?'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

In the circumstances,  quite  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the additional work and responsibility which\r\n\r\nwill fall on the Director of Audit as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  termination  of the old connection  with  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General in Kuala Lumpur, it  is  desirable\r\n\r\nthat  the post should be regraded to take  account\r\n\r\nof  the responsibility which will arise out of his\r\n\r\nindependent   position   in   the   hierarchy   of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued with some force that,\r\n\r\nfollowing the example of the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nthe  post should be upgraded to Grade C, that  is,\r\n\r\non  a  par with the permanent secretaries, but  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  decided that Grade D is sufficient,  at\r\n\r\nany  rate  for  the time being. I hope  that  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will support the application for a  token\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most important item in the Paper is\r\n\r\nthe creation of the post of Secretary (Loans).  On\r\n\r\na  number  of occasions in the past, Sir,  I  have\r\n\r\ndrawn attention to the wide gap which is likely to\r\n\r\nexist  in  the  future between the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  central and local government  bodies  and\r\n\r\ncorporations in Singapore for development  capital\r\n\r\nand the total amount of development capital likely\r\n\r\nto  be available. I have also stressed the need to\r\n\r\nmobilise and tap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  available sources of development  capital  in\r\n\r\nSingapore if the gap is to be narrowed. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that anybody who has studied the matter will\r\n\r\ndeny  the  existence of the gap  now  and  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture, or the need to do everything in our  power\r\n\r\nto   narrow   it   by  integrating   and   phasing\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans  on  an island-wide  basis,  by\r\n\r\navoiding  cut-throat  competition  for  the  funds\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  available,  and  to  explore   and\r\n\r\nmobilise   every  possible  source  of  investment\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration and phasing of development plans on\r\n\r\nan   island-wide   basis  is   a   difficult   and\r\n\r\ncomplicated matter but it will have to he done  if\r\n\r\nthe  best  use is to be made of the limited  funds\r\n\r\nlikely to be available. We can no longer afford to\r\n\r\nallow  every development authority to  go  merrily\r\n\r\nahead planning what it considers desirable without\r\n\r\nregard to the needs of other authorities or to the\r\n\r\nfunds  likely to be available. There must  be  co-operation and coordination, and I ask that this co-operation  will  be  given when  the  question  of\r\n\r\nsetting   up  a  suitable  coordinating  body   is\r\n\r\ndiscussed with the various authorities concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be generally agreed that it\r\n\r\nwould   be   folly  for  the  various  authorities\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  development  in  Singapore   to\r\n\r\nindulge  in  cut-throat  competition  for  the\r\n\r\nlimited   funds   likely  to  be   available   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment in Singapore. Clearly there is a  case\r\n\r\nfor one authority, in this case the Government, to\r\n\r\nmobilise  and  tap all resources and to  apportion\r\n\r\nthe  proceeds between the various authorities  for\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of a phased,  integrated  and\r\n\r\nagreed island-wide development plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobilisation of investment, capital will be far\r\n\r\nfrom  easy. It will involve not only the flotation\r\n\r\nof  loans  of  all  kinds necessary  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  local investors,  but  also  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the issue of Treasury bills, the  creation  of short-term deposits and the like. It will\r\n\r\ninvolve   the  servicing  of  these   loans,   the\r\n\r\noperation  of  sinking funds,  the  investment  of\r\n\r\nsinking  fund money, the redemption and conversion\r\n\r\nof the loans, and so on. It will involve the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration   and  implementation   of   savings\r\n\r\ncampaigns. It will involve the gradual building up\r\n\r\nof  a  local money market, thus giving  a  greater\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  liquidity than exists at  present  to\r\n\r\nlocal  trustee securities. It involves  such  questions as the investment policy of provident funds,\r\n\r\ninsurance companies operating locally, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a task which will call for a high degree\r\n\r\nof  specialised knowledge and financial experience\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  available in the Treasury  at  the\r\n\r\npresent time The Treasury is understaffed and  the\r\n\r\nofficers  at present serving in it are lacking  in\r\n\r\nfinancial experience. It is in my opinion of vital\r\n\r\nimportance  not  only  to the  immediate  pressing\r\n\r\nproblem of mobilisation of investment capital, but\r\n\r\nalso to the general efficiency of the Treasury  to\r\n\r\nrecruit a Secretary (Loans)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the qualifications and\r\n\r\nexperience   required  for  this   task,   it   is\r\n\r\nconsidered   necessary  to  offer  the   inclusive\r\n\r\nemoluments  which  are proposed.  This  particular\r\n\r\nquestion has been most carefully examined and I am\r\n\r\ncertain  that we would not obtain the services  of\r\n\r\nthe kind of man we want for anything less. I trust\r\n\r\nthat  hon. Members realise the importance  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter and support me in this application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 130 seeks a revote in connection with the\r\n\r\ninvestigation of the Oriental Telephone & Electric\r\n\r\nCompany's assets. Hon. Members will note that  the\r\n\r\nexplanatory  note  refers to the  need  to  go  to\r\n\r\narbitration.   That   is  indeed   the   position.\r\n\r\nValuations were exchanged in 1956 and,  as  agreed\r\n\r\nat  the  time  of the conclusion of  the  purchase\r\n\r\nagreement,  valuers  on  both  sides  subsequently\r\n\r\nentered   into  negotiations  with   a   view   to\r\n\r\nclarifying  points of difference and  making  such\r\n\r\nsettlements   and  compromises   that   might   be\r\n\r\npossible.  These negotiations have been protracted\r\n\r\nbut considerable progress has been made in certain\r\n\r\naspects  of  the  valuation. There  are,  however,\r\n\r\ncertain  major points involving considerable  sums\r\n\r\nof   money   which  have  proved   to   be   quite\r\n\r\nunsusceptible of compromise. These must  now  go\r\n\r\nto  arbitration  under the terms of  the  original\r\n\r\nindenture. Arrangements are now being made to  set\r\n\r\nup an arbitration tribunal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich,  it is hoped, will sit in Singapore in  the\r\n\r\nautumn  of  this year. Hon. Members  will  realise\r\n\r\nthat  I  cannot at this stage make any comment  on\r\n\r\nthe  details  of  the negotiations  or  about  the\r\n\r\nmatters which have been referred to arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 133 and 134 deal with the pan-Malayan\r\n\r\ndevelopment of trunk telephone facilities  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation. Singapore's share of\r\n\r\nthe project amounts to roughly $1.3 million but  I\r\n\r\nam assured by the Minister that it will remove the\r\n\r\nserious  bottleneck existing  at  the  moment  and\r\n\r\nprovide facilities which will meet with the  needs\r\n\r\nof  the  peninsula  for a considerable  number  of\r\n\r\nyears  to  come.  More important,  it  will  be  a\r\n\r\nproject   which   will  pay  for   itself   in   a\r\n\r\ncomparatively short period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion committed to Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion and Schedule considered in Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

There  was  the\r\n\r\npossibility of a somewhat involved legal  argument\r\n\r\nwhich might have become extremely expensive and on\r\n\r\nconsidering the case as a whole, it was decided to\r\n\r\ncompromise the issue and offer a sum of  money  in\r\n\r\nsettlement  of  the claim that had been  made  and\r\n\r\nthat  sum  has  been accepted. It  is  not  always\r\n\r\npossible  to  forecast  with  any  certainty   the\r\n\r\noutcome  of a case before the courts. Fortunately,\r\n\r\nfor  lawyers,  there  are differences  of  opinion\r\n\r\noccasionally  as  to  the  effect  of   particular\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  law and, in  this  particular\r\n\r\ncase,  the  matter  was one of  some  considerable\r\n\r\ndoubt.  It  was  because  of  the  doubt  and  the\r\n\r\npossibility of the expensive results of litigating\r\n\r\nthat  doubt  that  it was decided  to  settle  the\r\n\r\nmatter. Having settled the matter, steps have been\r\n\r\ntaken   to   explain  to  the  officers  concerned\r\n\r\nprecisely  how  in future they will  exercise  the\r\n\r\npowers  that have been given to them.

I\r\n\r\nam,  of  course, aware of the fact  that  in  many\r\n\r\ninternational airports announcements are made both\r\n\r\nin   English,  which  has  been  accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organisation  as  the\r\n\r\nlingua  franca  of the air, and  in  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage of that country.

And on 11th February, 1957, I replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I have to acknowledge with many thanks the\r\n\r\nreceipt  of your letter M.C. & W. 41/57  dated  8th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1957,  in connection  with  my  request\r\n\r\nthat multilingualism should be  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nairport authorities in announcing the arrival and\r\n\r\ndeparture   of   planes   in   the   Paya    Lebar\r\n\r\nInternational Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is not so important whether you\r\n\r\nwill  subscribe to the view that there  have  been\r\n\r\nmany  instances in which passengers missed or went\r\n\r\nto  the  wrong  plane just because they  were  not\r\n\r\nconversant  in English; but the facts reported  by\r\n\r\nme  in  my letter are supported by witnesse  and,\r\n\r\nmoreover,   since  such  \"instances\"   are   never\r\n\r\nreported  to the airport Authorities, it  is  very\r\n\r\nprobable  that you are ignorant of such  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.  Besides, the inconveniences  experienced\r\n\r\nby  the  non-English speaking  passengers  in  the\r\n\r\nairport can never be appreciated by those in power\r\n\r\nwho   normally  cannot  understand  or   are   not\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the real needs of  the  Asians  in\r\n\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am at a loss to understand why only Malay\r\n\r\nannouncements  are  to  be experimented  when  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the passengers using planes  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation of Malaya,  Sarawak,\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo,  Indonesia and other  countries  is\r\n\r\nChinese.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And the Minister replied to me on 10th April as follows :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, In your letter to me of 28th January, 1957, you said, \"that there are many instances in\r\n\r\nwhich passengers missed or went to the wrong plane\r\n\r\njust  because  they do not know English\",  and  in\r\n\r\nyour letter of 11th February, you added that these\r\n\r\ninstances are supported by witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, we are experimentally making\r\n\r\nannouncements in Malay as well as English;  and  I\r\n\r\nam  also considering reports on the points  raised\r\n\r\nin  your letters. It would greatly help me if  you\r\n\r\ncan  give me details of the instances referred  to\r\n\r\nabove;  or, if you yourself have not got  details,\r\n\r\nif  you can give me the names and addresses of the\r\n\r\nwitnesses  from whom I can get the facts.  What  I\r\n\r\nneed to know is:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the date of each instance referred to;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the country to which the passenger intended travelling;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the airline on which he was supposed to travel;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the passenger's name and address;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the languages and dialects spoken by the passenger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can the Minister expect me to check the\r\n\r\nnames  and  addresses of the  passengers  and  the\r\n\r\ndialects  spoken by them? Why not ask about  their\r\n\r\nages  and  the  number  of wives  they  have  too?\r\n\r\nFrankly,  Sir, what I am fighting for is a  matter\r\n\r\nof  principle, having  at heart  the  progress  and\r\n\r\nprosperity   of   Singapore.  Singapore   has   an\r\n\r\ninternational  airport. I have been  to  Hongkong\r\n\r\nand  the  authorities  over  there  think  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to introduce the Cantonese  dialect  as\r\n\r\nwell  as English to announce the arrival and departure  of planes because the majority of the people\r\n\r\nthere  speak  Cantonese. We say that  we  want  to\r\n\r\nattract tourists and trade and yet we do not  have\r\n\r\nthe  same facilities here. I can assure the House,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  most of the Indonesian passengers  who\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore and bring trade and wealth  to\r\n\r\nthis  country speak Mandarin. I am not asking  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to introduce only the Mandarin language.\r\n\r\nI  am asking him to introduce something which this\r\n\r\nAssembly    has   already   passed,    that    is,\r\n\r\nmultilingualism, and I cannot understand  why  the\r\n\r\nMinister should take such a negative attitude.  Is\r\n\r\nhe  so  shortsighted not to see that  this  is  an\r\n\r\ninternational airport and that we want progress in\r\n\r\nthis country?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can quote a few instances. For example,\r\n\r\ntake the case of a Chinese lady passenger who does\r\n\r\nnot  speak  English but only the Chinese language.\r\n\r\nWhilst  she is having coffee in the lounge  or  in\r\n\r\nthe  bar  of the airport, suddenly an announcement\r\n\r\ncomes  over the air regarding the arrival  or  the\r\n\r\ndeparture of a plane. You will see that this  same\r\n\r\npassenger will rush to the reception desk or  will\r\n\r\napproach  the other passengers and ask  them  what\r\n\r\nthe  announcement  was about. That  clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat she does not understand English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also quote another instance. There were\r\n\r\nhundreds  of supporters from the various political\r\n\r\nparties  in  Singapore who were  waiting  for  the\r\n\r\ndelegates  to  arrive back from London  after  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks but the plane  was  delayed.\r\n\r\nThe  airport manager instructed somebody there  to\r\n\r\nmake  an  announcement in English to say that  the\r\n\r\nplane had been delayed and asked the people to  go\r\n\r\nback home, but nobody went back because they could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot    understand   English.   Subsequently,    an\r\n\r\nannouncement  was made in Malay but it  still  did\r\n\r\nnot  make  any  difference. The  crowd  was  still\r\n\r\nthere.  Eventually,  in  desperation,  I  think  a\r\n\r\nreporter  of  the Sin Chew Jit Poh was  approached\r\n\r\nand  he  got  up to a microphone to speak  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Mandarin. Thereafter, the  crowd  just\r\n\r\ndispersed like the April mist in the July sun. All\r\n\r\nof  them went back home. That clearly shows,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  most of the people who go to the airport  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand English. I am quite sure that  the\r\n\r\nmajority   of  the  people  in  Singapore   today,\r\n\r\nSir - about  50  per cent - understand Mandarin.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment say that they have already experimented\r\n\r\nwith  the  Malay language and I can see  that  the\r\n\r\nreason  why that has not been successful  is  that\r\n\r\nnot many of the passengers who use the airport are\r\n\r\nMalays - I  am  quite  sure  that the percentage  is  very\r\n\r\nsmall.  I  am  not arguing about the facts.  I  am\r\n\r\narguing   about   the  principle  of   introducing\r\n\r\nmultilingualism in the airport because  it  is  an\r\n\r\ninternational airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I second the motion standing on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very easy to satisfy the general\r\n\r\npublic,  Sir,  being of various nationalities  and\r\n\r\nspeaking  different dialects if announcements  are\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  four main languages  of  this  City\r\n\r\nespecially   at   arrivals   and   departures   of\r\n\r\naeroplanes  to  and from different countries.  For\r\n\r\nexample, English, Malay and Mandarin will  suffice\r\n\r\nfor  planes  to and from Indonesia or for  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways;  English  only  and  possibly  a   second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  Malay, for planes to and  from  Europe;\r\n\r\nTamil  can be added for planes to and from  India.\r\n\r\nThis can very easily be done in order to help  the\r\n\r\ntravelling  public in understanding  announcements\r\n\r\nof  arrivals and departures of planes to  or  from\r\n\r\nthe  various  countries. I do not  think  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  cost  the authorities very much to  provide\r\n\r\nthese facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I would like to assure you, Sir,\r\n\r\nand  the  hon.  Members of the House through  you,\r\n\r\nthat  the  principle  of  multilingualism  at  the\r\n\r\nairport  and  in civil aviation generally  is  one\r\n\r\nwhich is fully accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) has\r\n\r\ndescribed   his  long  and  so  far   unsuccessful\r\n\r\nstruggle  to get Mandarin included in the  airport\r\n\r\nlanguages but of course the thing goes far further\r\n\r\nback than that - before he had even been elected  to\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. The question of what  languages  to\r\n\r\nuse  at  the  new  Paya  Lebar  Airport  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscussed and consideration given to it and to all\r\n\r\nthe  factors  involved long before it was  opened,\r\n\r\nbecause  that is part of the professional work  of\r\n\r\ncivil  aviation  officers, that they  should  make\r\n\r\nsure  that their airport is as efficient  as  they\r\n\r\ncan  possibly  make it and for  that  reason  they\r\n\r\nconsider  the movement of passengers and how  they\r\n\r\nare  going to get to and fro without getting  lost\r\n\r\nor held up. Naturally, the announcements which are\r\n\r\nmade  at the airport are part of the matters which\r\n\r\nare  considered and I would give the  House  every\r\n\r\nassurance  that if there appeared to be  any  real\r\n\r\nneed  for the introduction of additional languages\r\n\r\nwhich  would  lead  to increased efficiency,  then\r\n\r\nthey  should  certainly be put in,  but  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter to be judged on the question of efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member read at length from his letters\r\n\r\nto  me and from my replies. He remarked also  that\r\n\r\nhis  constituents had complained. Now he  told  me\r\n\r\ncategorically  that there were many  instances  of\r\n\r\npeople  who missed their planes because  they  did\r\n\r\nnot  understand the announcements and he said that\r\n\r\nhe had witnesses prepared to come forward and tell\r\n\r\nme all about it. I wrote to him back in April last\r\n\r\nyear  saying,  \"Please tell me who your  witnesses\r\n\r\nare.  This  is the sort of information I  want.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  know who it was, when he was travelling,\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  so  that I can check  up.\"  Thirteen\r\n\r\nmonths   have  passed  and  he  has  produced   no\r\n\r\nwitnesses  at all, nor has he produced any  actual\r\n\r\ncase at all except for the imaginary lady\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrinking coffee in the lounge and rushing  to  the\r\n\r\ninformation desk because she did not understand an\r\n\r\nannouncement. He is not able to tell me what  lady\r\n\r\nit  was  and on what occasion. It is just \"take  a\r\n\r\ncase  and  there  it is\". The only other  concrete\r\n\r\ninstance he produced was of a crowd seeing off the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks delegation in 1957. There was\r\n\r\na  delay  by  the  aircraft,  and  the  crowd  not\r\n\r\nunderstanding  announcements in the ordinary  way,\r\n\r\nspecial  arrangements were made at my request  for\r\n\r\nan announcement to be made in Mandarin and through\r\n\r\nthe    co-operation   of   a   newspaperman,   the\r\n\r\nannouncement  was  made. That is very  appropriate\r\n\r\nand  proper,  and it surely does  not  argue  that\r\n\r\nbecause  on  one occasion there was  a  particular\r\n\r\ncrowd  which  needed  a special  announcement,  we\r\n\r\nshould  retain permanent staff able to make  other\r\n\r\nannouncemets   which  are  not  necessary.   Well,\r\n\r\nalthough  his  researches have  not  produced  any\r\n\r\nsingle  case of anybody who can be identified  and\r\n\r\nwho  has  required announcements in  Mandarin,  we\r\n\r\nhave  gone  into this as thoroughly  as  possible,\r\n\r\nsince I wrote to him last year. If I remember, for\r\n\r\nan  Answer  to a Question in the year 1956/57,  we\r\n\r\nfound  one person who had missed his plane through\r\n\r\nnot  understanding the announcements. That  person\r\n\r\nwas  a  German.  In  the year 1957/58,  one  other\r\n\r\nperson  also went astray through not understanding\r\n\r\nthe languages used at the airport. That person was\r\n\r\na  Turk. There was one other person who missed her\r\n\r\nplane  at the time of the Malayan Airways  strike.\r\n\r\nShe was a young lady and I believe she went to the\r\n\r\nbank.  In  any case, she did not hear the announcement  and as the Malayan Airways was short-staffed\r\n\r\nand  overworked, they did not manage to get to the\r\n\r\ninformation   desk  for  a  special   announcement\r\n\r\ncalling  for her and the result was that  she,  in\r\n\r\nfact, did not catch her plane. It was not a matter\r\n\r\nof  the  language;  it was a  matter  of  her  not\r\n\r\nhearing  the original announcement and not getting\r\n\r\na  subsequent  special call for herself  by  name.\r\n\r\nThose  are  the only three cases that I have  been\r\n\r\nable  to unearth, and that is why I was so anxious\r\n\r\nthat the hon. Member should produce his cases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  he  is so confident occurred; but until  he\r\n\r\ndoes,  I  am afraid I must rank him with  all  the\r\n\r\nother  sort  of  speeches that are  made  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly in which furious accusations are made but\r\n\r\nno   evidence  whatever  is  brought  forward   in\r\n\r\nsubstantiation. I need not instance  the  sort  of\r\n\r\ncases  that  have  occurred, but I  personally  do\r\n\r\nrequire  to  be convinced before I am prepared  to\r\n\r\nassume that a person is talking sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are various practical problems\r\n\r\nabout - simply a matter of efficiency, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir - how  we  are going to run our airport  to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  convenience of the persons  who  want  to\r\n\r\ntravel   through  it.  It  is  correct  that   the\r\n\r\ninternational  language  for  civil  aviation   is\r\n\r\nEnglish. French and Spanish are also used  and  in\r\n\r\nmany airports the language of the country is added\r\n\r\nif  there is a large flow of people who do not use\r\n\r\nthe  English  language. In Hongkong, as  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  pointed out, it is English and  Cantonese.\r\n\r\nIn Jakarta, it is English and Javanese-Indonesian.\r\n\r\nI  beg  your  pardon; I think it is  the  Javanese\r\n\r\nvariant  of Indonesian. In Bangkok, it is  English\r\n\r\nand  Thai.  In Kuala Lumpur, it is English,  full-stop.  In  Singapore,  we have  experimented  with\r\n\r\nMalay announcements. I gave Malay priority because\r\n\r\nit  is,  or will, I hope be, the national language\r\n\r\nfor Singapore as it is for the Federation, and  it\r\n\r\nseemed  to me proper that we should give it  first\r\n\r\nconsideration. As far as could be observed, nobody\r\n\r\nwanted  Malay announcements in respect of  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  flights  and  recently,  after  a  year's\r\n\r\nexperiment,  we  took  them off  again  and  again\r\n\r\nnobody noticed or commented about it. Not a ripple\r\n\r\nwas  noticed by anybody concerned. The fact of the\r\n\r\nmatter  is  that  people  at  present  are  moving\r\n\r\nconveniently  and satisfactorily in  the  airport,\r\n\r\nand  this  is  a matter of the expert  opinion  of\r\n\r\npeople  dealing with airport matters.  The  people\r\n\r\nmost  deeply  concerned are  perhaps  the  airline\r\n\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member was under the impression that if\r\n\r\na  person  missed his or her plane,  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwould not hear about it. I can assure you that  if\r\n\r\nany passenger is inconvenienced at the airport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough defects in the airport organisation,\r\n\r\nwe  shall most certainly hear about it because the\r\n\r\nairline  operators will come to us and say,  \"What\r\n\r\nis  this?  Our airline missed a passenger  because\r\n\r\nyou  have done something inefficient.\" The airline\r\n\r\noperators  are  intensely  competitive,  extremely\r\n\r\nefficient, and extremely conscious of the need for\r\n\r\nspeedy handling and convenience of passengers, and\r\n\r\nto  suppose  that  they would sit  down  under  an\r\n\r\nairport which was providing an incompetent service\r\n\r\nis  to  underestimate the business ability of  the\r\n\r\nairlines.  They  would not.  If  they  wished  for\r\n\r\nannouncements and if they thought that they  would\r\n\r\nserve  any purpose, it would be very important  to\r\n\r\nthem   to  press  for  announcements  in  whatever\r\n\r\nlanguage  they thought was necessary. We have,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  an  informal, unofficial Airline  Operators\r\n\r\nCommittee which sits with the airport manager  and\r\n\r\nI have been in contact with all of them. We had re\r\n\r\nports a year ago when the hon. Member brought this\r\n\r\nup.  We  had reports again in consequence of  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  All  we managed to elicit  was  that  one\r\n\r\nGerman  and  one Turk missed their planes  because\r\n\r\nthey  did not understand announcements in English.\r\n\r\nThat  is all that the airline operators were  able\r\n\r\nto  produce in the way of complaint about  the  announcements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we are going to have announcements, we\r\n\r\nmust have them in a way which is going to match up\r\n\r\nwith  the traffic of the airport. At peak periods,\r\n\r\nthere are, in fact, eight flight movements such as\r\n\r\nan  arrival or departure in the course of an  hour\r\n\r\nand  there may be further ones. If the plane comes\r\n\r\nin  delayed  or early on its schedule, that  would\r\n\r\nadd  to the number. There may be other unscheduled\r\n\r\nmovements  as well. If we multiply the  number  of\r\n\r\nflight  movements by the time taken  for  a  fully\r\n\r\nmultilingual airport, you would have a  continuous\r\n\r\nseries  of announcements flowing out one after  an\r\n\r\nother so that the unhappy passenger would never be\r\n\r\nable  to  wait and say, \"Well, I wonder whether  I\r\n\r\ncan  have a cup of coffee.\" He has to sit with his\r\n\r\nears   open  all  the  time  to  catch   a   hasty\r\n\r\nannouncement of his flight number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere   will  be  a  pandemonium  of   noise   and\r\n\r\nexperience  shows  that, in  fact,  that  sort  of\r\n\r\ncontinuous  announcement  defeats  itself  because\r\n\r\nnobody listens to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison between multilingual facilities in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly and multilingual facilities in  the\r\n\r\nairport  is  really  out of  the  world.  In  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, hon. Members will have to put  on  their\r\n\r\nearphones  and  listen  to whichever  wave-band - or\r\n\r\nwhatever  you call it - they want to, and they  will\r\n\r\nsit  down  comfortably in their seats; whereas  in\r\n\r\nthe  airport the passengers have to walk about  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  their luggage is checked and get  their\r\n\r\ntickets from the office, and so\r\n\r\non. They cannot have earphones on their heads,  as\r\n\r\nthese   must  be  connected  to  listen   to   the\r\n\r\nannouncements. This is not possible  in  a  moving\r\n\r\nbody  of people in a large space engaged in  other\r\n\r\nthings besides listening to announcements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I do not want to make a great deal of this.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member spoke with some feeling about this\r\n\r\nmatter  but I would like to suggest to this House,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, that this is not a  matter  for\r\n\r\nfeeling or for emotion. It is simply a matter  for\r\n\r\nobjectively considering what is going  to  conduce\r\n\r\nto  efficient  movement at the  airport.  If  this\r\n\r\nHouse were to take it on itself to decide business\r\n\r\nmatters  without  taking expert  advice,  then  it\r\n\r\ncould  do  great harm. I have tried to  give  this\r\n\r\nsome basis of expert advice and I have pointed out\r\n\r\nthat the airline operators - and this, of course, includes  airlines  like the  Union  of  Burma,  the\r\n\r\nGaruda,  the Thai, Air India, in addition  to  the\r\n\r\nHongkong  line, the Australian line  and  all  the\r\n\r\nother  lines - have their means of  discussing  with\r\n\r\nthe  airport manager matters of the running of the\r\n\r\nairport  in the Airline Operators Committee.  They\r\n\r\nalso  can  come and see me if they  want  to,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  question  that  if  they  felt  any\r\n\r\nimprovement is needed they would have put  it  up,\r\n\r\nbut,  in fact, what they have done was to ask that\r\n\r\nMalay should be removed because they felt that  it\r\n\r\nhindered the smooth handling of passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People at the airport have not observed the rush\r\n\r\nto which the hon. Member referred; the mad rush of\r\n\r\nfighting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers running to the information bureau  when\r\n\r\nan  announcement was made to say,  \"Was  that  for\r\n\r\nme?\"  It does happen, of course, with people in  a\r\n\r\nconversation  who suddenly wake  up  and  say,  \"I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  that is for me!\", and they go  across\r\n\r\nand  ask,  \"Was  that flight so and  so  you  were\r\n\r\nannouncing?\",  but to describe it  as  a  sort  of\r\n\r\ngeneral state of affairs is not, in fact, the case\r\n\r\nin  my  own  observation. Persons  experienced  in\r\n\r\ntravelling on world flights, say to Zurich, where,\r\n\r\nI  believe, they use French and German in addition\r\n\r\nto  English  and possibly Romansh,  say  that  the\r\n\r\neffect  of  a  number of announcements  one  after\r\n\r\nanother in different languages is that by the  end\r\n\r\nof it, you do not hear anything at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) in\r\n\r\nseconding  the motion referred to the question  of\r\n\r\ncost  and,  of  course, if we are  going  to  have\r\n\r\nflight  announcements made through  the  whole  24\r\n\r\nhours  a  day in whatever languages are  necessary\r\n\r\nand  to have standby staff because even though  no\r\n\r\nscheduled flight is coming in, nevertheless, there\r\n\r\nmay  be an unscheduled flight or some special late\r\n\r\narrival   or   early  departure,  it  would   mean\r\n\r\nrecruiting additional staff in quite a big way and\r\n\r\nextra  work in training because the staff  changes\r\n\r\nvery   frequently.   The   girls   that   do   the\r\n\r\nannouncements are nubile and tend to  get  married\r\n\r\nand very often give up their career life. It would\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  add  to  the  expense.  I  have   not\r\n\r\nattempted to estimate how much because I  hope  we\r\n\r\nshall not be involved in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other point I should like to make is\r\n\r\nthat  although  the hon. Member  withdrew  it,  he\r\n\r\nreferred to me as an expatriate. I am, in fact,  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen and would like to have it on record-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

About a quarter  of  a  million\r\n\r\npassengers pass through the airport every year and\r\n\r\nit  is important that their convenience and smooth\r\n\r\nhandling should be as efficiently looked after  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said in my opening remarks and I repeat it\r\n\r\nagain  that  I fully accept that the announcements\r\n\r\nmust   be  such  as  will,  in  fact,  serve   the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of the airport and the convenience  of\r\n\r\nthe  passengers. There is no evidence at  all  and\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member has produced none in every  year\r\n\r\nsince  I  wrote  to  him to show  that,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nanybody  is suffering inconvenience from  lack  of\r\n\r\nannouncements  in  Mandarin.  Although  the   hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has produced no evidence, I have made  the\r\n\r\nmost  diligent search myself in contact  with  the\r\n\r\nairline operators, officials and others who  would\r\n\r\nbe in the best position to know and they have also\r\n\r\nproduced    no    evidence   of   anybody    being\r\n\r\ninconvenienced. There is no doubt at all  that  to\r\n\r\nintroduce additional languages is inconvenient and\r\n\r\ncan  be  expensive. It could be  done  if  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary;  one inconvenience must be accepted  if\r\n\r\nit  removes a greater inconvenience. There  is  no\r\n\r\nevidence at all, however, that it is necessary now\r\n\r\nand until it is shown to be necessary, we must not\r\n\r\nintroduce unnecessary languages which do not  help\r\n\r\nefficiency but reduce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when this\r\n\r\nmotion  came  into  my hands, I  had  in  mind  to\r\n\r\nintroduce an amendment to leave out \"Mandarin\" and\r\n\r\ninsert  \"multilingualism\" and when I  appealed  to\r\n\r\nthe  mover of the motion, it appears that, for the\r\n\r\ntime being, Mandarin is just enough. That is why I\r\n\r\nam  not  moving  any  amendment  today  and  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared to support the motion as it stands  until\r\n\r\nsuch   time  as  the  Government  will,  I   hope,\r\n\r\nintroduce the other two languages if it finds that\r\n\r\nthe  use  of Mandarin announcements at the airport is satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister, Sir, it appears to me\r\n\r\nthat the announcements made at the airport are for the benefit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the passengers only. He never thinks about the\r\n\r\nfriends and relatives who go to the airport either\r\n\r\nto meet or to send off passengers. What he is only\r\n\r\nworried about is the efficient running of the  airport as well as the convenience of the passengers.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many cases where friends and relatives\r\n\r\nof  incoming  passengers go to the airport.  If  a\r\n\r\nplane  is delayed, an announcement is made on  the\r\n\r\nmicrophone  and unless friends and  relatives  are\r\n\r\naware  of that announcement, they will stay on  at\r\n\r\nthe airport for hours for nothing which is just  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of  time for them but if they are aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  announcement  that a plane is  delayed,  then\r\n\r\nthey  can go home and, come back at the right time\r\n\r\nwhen the plane comes in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, according to the Minister, it is\r\n\r\nthe concern of the airport authorities to see that\r\n\r\nthe airport is run efficiently. He may be correct,\r\n\r\nbut times, have progressed, Sir. The days are gone\r\n\r\nwhen  very  few Chinese-speaking people travel  by\r\n\r\nplane.  The  days are gone when only the  English-speaking people travel by air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Turks and Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Only one Turk and one German\r\n\r\nas quoted by you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even people from China who used to dread hearing\r\n\r\nan aeroplane in the old days do travel by air now.\r\n\r\nSo  why  then,  Sir, this show of favour  for  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking people only? There are many  non-English speaking people who travel by air and  are\r\n\r\nwe  not  to provide facilities for the convenience\r\n\r\nof  these people at all - just only for the  benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  English-speaking people, and not for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, multilingualism has come to stay, as I have\r\n\r\nalways    said   so.   So   why   not    introduce\r\n\r\nmultilingualism in the airport as well?  Why  only\r\n\r\nin the Assembly and in the City Council? It should\r\n\r\nbe  introduced everywhere if it is for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  citizens, and not only  at  a  privileged\r\n\r\nplace  like this Assembly. The airport happens  to\r\n\r\nbe not a privileged place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why the Minister said that so\r\n\r\nfar  he has got no evidence of any people who have\r\n\r\nmissed a plane or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngone  to  a  wrong plane is because  most  of  the\r\n\r\npassengers  who  travel by air bring  along  their\r\n\r\nfriends who speak English. It is very rare to  see\r\n\r\na  passenger going to the airport alone.  You  can\r\n\r\nalways  see  that he is surrounded by  either  his\r\n\r\nfriends or relatives who can understand and  speak\r\n\r\nEnglish  and this being the case, he can  rely  on\r\n\r\nthem  to interpret the announcements. That is  the\r\n\r\nreason why the Minister has got no evidence so far\r\n\r\nof anybody who has missed his plane or gone to the\r\n\r\nwrong  plane. He has quoted so far a Turk  and  a\r\n\r\nGerman. It is rather unfortunate that the Turk  or\r\n\r\nthe  German  did not have relatives in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  were foreigners and they came in as  foreign\r\n\r\ners. So as such, they could not bring along - I  see\r\n\r\nMinisters laughing on the opposite side; it  is  a\r\n\r\nfact,  and  it  is no laughing matter  at  all - any\r\n\r\nfriends to guide or bring them to the airport  and\r\n\r\nto  interpret the announcements to them. I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it is right that just because the Minister\r\n\r\nlacks the evidence he is not prepared to introduce\r\n\r\nother  languages at the airport for announcements.\r\n\r\nI think it is very wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William\r\n\r\nTan)  or the mover of the motion says that because\r\n\r\nthere  is a common language, Cantonese, spoken  in\r\n\r\nHongkong, the airport authorities of that  country\r\n\r\nput  over Cantonese announcements and the Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  admitted that in Indonesia, you  have  Indonesian and English and in Thailand you have Thai\r\n\r\nand  English.  But, we have many languages  spoken\r\n\r\nhere.  Our  country is quite different from  other\r\n\r\ncountries where it is a case of only one language.\r\n\r\nIt  is  Thai in Thailand, Indonesian in Indonesia,\r\n\r\nand  so  on. Singapore is a place where  you  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  nationalities and the  welfare  of  all\r\n\r\nthese  people has got to be looked after.  Let  us\r\n\r\nnot  always  think  of  the  privileged  class - the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking class. Nowadays, it is  not  only\r\n\r\nthe   English-speaking   who   can   be   elected.\r\n\r\nEverybody, even a trishaw-rider who does not speak\r\n\r\nEnglish,  can be elected. The airport is  more  or\r\n\r\nless a Government concern and it is not a domestic\r\n\r\nor commercial concern \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand in the interest of everybody, I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment should help everybody to understand the\r\n\r\nannouncements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion temporarily as it stands\r\n\r\nuntil  such  time as the Government, I hope,  will\r\n\r\nintroduce more languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure he does not suffer from any racial prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are just two things I would like to say.\r\n\r\nOne  is  that  I  am going to oppose  this  motion\r\n\r\nbecause I do not think it was very well presented.\r\n\r\nIn  one  case,  the  Member for Tiong  Bahru  (Mr\r\n\r\nWilliam  Tan)  talked about Indonesia,  the  trade\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia  and the number of Chinese  coming\r\n\r\nfrom  Indonesia.  I  myself spent  five  years  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia and I would guarantee that every Chinese\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia  can speak Malay or  its  Indonesian\r\n\r\nvariant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is this, that he says about 50 per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  people here speak  Mandarin.  Well,\r\n\r\nthere  is a sort of snobbism about Mandarin  these\r\n\r\ndays  and  it may be that, as 50 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation of Singapore are under 21, the  younger\r\n\r\npeople  do indeed speak Mandarin. Certainly,  they\r\n\r\nare  all  making  a valiant effort  to  learn  the\r\n\r\ninternational Chinese, as it is called but I would\r\n\r\nvery  gravely  doubt if 50 per cent of  the  adult\r\n\r\nChinese   population   of  Singapore   can   speak\r\n\r\nMandarin. I should have thought that there  was  a\r\n\r\nfar better case for having Hokkien or Cantonese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  spite of the opposition to this motion, I must\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  am  not  convinced  at  all  by  the\r\n\r\narguments put forward by the Hon. the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works that Mandarin should  not\r\n\r\nbe used at the international Paya Lebar airport.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned, Sir, that long before the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) was elected  to\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, the matter of appropriate languages\r\n\r\nwas  considered  but  at that  time,  Sir,  nobody\r\n\r\nthought  of  having  any  other  language   except\r\n\r\nEnglish.  Now, we have advocated the  introduction\r\n\r\nof  multilingualism in the Assembly. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications and Works  said  that  he  had\r\n\r\nalready introduced announcements in Malay and that\r\n\r\nthey  were not much of a success. I am not in  the\r\n\r\nleast surprised at that because there are not many\r\n\r\nMalays  in Singapore as compared with the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIf  Malay  announcements were to be introduced  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, they would be welcome and popular\r\n\r\nand  I  think would be well received.  Here,  Sir,\r\n\r\napart  from the Malay population which  is  small,\r\n\r\nmany of them do not travel by air. The majority of\r\n\r\nthe people who travel by air are the Chinese. Even\r\n\r\ncompared with the Europeans, the Chinese  are  the\r\n\r\nmajority of people who travel by air today and for\r\n\r\nthose  who  speak the different Chinese  dialects,\r\n\r\nMandarin  can  be  used  as  the  common  language\r\n\r\nmedium.  I think, Sir, that Mandarin announcements\r\n\r\nwill be very useful and helpful to the people here\r\n\r\nas  well  as  to  the  people of  South-East  Asia\r\n\r\nbecause even in South-East Asia, there are  a  lot\r\n\r\nof Chinese. If the Minister for Communications and\r\n\r\nWorks  had already experimented with announcements\r\n\r\nin  Malay  and failed, I do not see why he  should\r\n\r\nnot  try them in Mandarin. I am quite sure he will\r\n\r\nfind out that they will be very useful and helpful\r\n\r\nto the travelling Chinese population of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt is the Government's duty to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I have heard a very unconvincing speech from\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Communications and Works this  af\r\n\r\nternoon.

It  serves\r\n\r\nthe  routes  of  the  world. It  also  serves  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  requirements. It also serves  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia.  There are three distinct types of  services\r\n\r\nrendered  by the Paya Lebar Airport.  As  for  the\r\n\r\ninternational air lines, English is a must. As for\r\n\r\nthe  South-East  Asian  air  lines,  probably   we\r\n\r\nrequire  English  and another  language  that  can\r\n\r\neasily be understood by South-East Asians. For our\r\n\r\ninternal  airline, I think it is a must;  we  must\r\n\r\nhave announcements in languages that are known  to\r\n\r\nthe people who use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told so many times this afternoon\r\n\r\nthat  the  Airport is going to be run  efficiently\r\n\r\nand  for the convenience of the passengers. If  we\r\n\r\nmove   amongst   the  passengers,  knowing   their\r\n\r\nlanguages  and knowing how they feel  and  knowing\r\n\r\nhow  anxious  they are, we will then realise  that\r\n\r\nthey  have always been asking their friends. \"What\r\n\r\nis  that announcement about?

This is for the plane that is  going\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\" Well, Sir, the Minister countered  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"No,  we cannot have multilingualism  here.\r\n\r\nYou  know it is so very difficult. Our air traffic\r\n\r\nis  so  heavy  and if we have multilingualism  and\r\n\r\nmake  announcements one after another,  the  whole\r\n\r\neffect  is lost; you cannot hear a thing and  with\r\n\r\nour  volume  of  traffic, you will have  a  never-ending string of announcements.\" I am certain that\r\n\r\nSingapore is not as busy as any of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  European air ports, and if those European air\r\n\r\nports  can use at least two languages - English  and\r\n\r\ntheir own language - I do not see why Singapore  can\r\n\r\nnot do the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, has the Minister considered that to\r\n\r\novercome  the  difficulties,  instead  of   having\r\n\r\nannouncers, we can have the announcements  flashed\r\n\r\non  a screen in words in Chinese so that everybody\r\n\r\ncan  read them in whatever dialects they want  to?\r\n\r\nFor planes going to Hongkong, you can just put the\r\n\r\ntime down on a board and hang it up. That might be\r\n\r\ntried  out.  It  would save  having  to  make  the\r\n\r\nannouncements and you will probably have a quieter\r\n\r\nairport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that the airlines must be very\r\n\r\nefficient,  as competition amongst  them  is  very\r\n\r\nkeen. I am certain that there is no competition so\r\n\r\nfar as the internal airlines go. You either travel\r\n\r\nby  Malayan  Airways or you go by any means  other\r\n\r\nthan by air, and whether a passenger is going with\r\n\r\nyou  on  this plane or the next plane, you can  be\r\n\r\nsure  that  he will be in a Malayan Airways  plane\r\n\r\nfor  internal  travel. And there  you  are!  Where\r\n\r\nthere  is a monopoly and where the people who  run\r\n\r\nit  feel  that they have done a good job,  patting\r\n\r\nthemselves  on  the back, we see  no  improvement,\r\n\r\nbecause  the Minister will always tell us that  he\r\n\r\nhas had expert advice. We have had a lot of expert\r\n\r\nadvice  coming  to this Assembly; some  accept  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they happen to think in the same  way  as\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers do, but many spurn it because  they\r\n\r\nhappen  to think contrariwise. So after all,  what\r\n\r\nis  the use of expert advice? If you are going  to\r\n\r\nlisten  to expert advice, probably you will  still\r\n\r\nhave  the  Governor  presiding  over  a  nominated\r\n\r\nLegislative Council run by a nominated  Executive.\r\n\r\nThat  would  be the best way - the best advice  from\r\n\r\nthe  best  experts.  But  it  is  quite  fortunate\r\n\r\nsometimes  to  have politicians  who  shout  their\r\n\r\nheads  off!  That is why I see so  many  important\r\n\r\npeople  sitting  right in front of  me;  otherwise\r\n\r\nthey would not be as important as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

We  need  not  have\r\n\r\nearphones supplied to passengers so that they  can\r\n\r\nlisten  in  to any special channels, but  I  think\r\n\r\nthere will be very little inconvenience if we  try\r\n\r\nand adopt methods that can fit into our programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications and Works,  1  would  like  to\r\n\r\nreiterate that Government would certainly consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  multilingualism if it  was  convinced\r\n\r\nthat such was necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key word in all the speeches from the\r\n\r\nMembers of the opposite side is \"multilingualism\".\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  a confusion of thought,  for  the\r\n\r\nmover of this motion has only directed himself  to\r\n\r\none  particular language, namely Mandarin,  to  be\r\n\r\nused  in the airport. Listening to him, I wondered\r\n\r\nin  what  language the would-be passengers  bought\r\n\r\ntheir  tickets  from the various airlines - whether\r\n\r\nit   be  Q.A.N.T.A.S.,  K.L.M.,  Pan-American   or\r\n\r\nB.O.A.C. - and  how they understood the instructions\r\n\r\non  the tickets that they had to be at the airport\r\n\r\nhalf an hour before departure time. I have been to\r\n\r\nseveral  airports - Madrid,  Portugal,  London,  and\r\n\r\nothers. The announcements are made in English  and\r\n\r\nin  the  particular language of the  country,  and\r\n\r\neven if one listens to the particular language  of\r\n\r\nthe  country,  one  can always understand  that  a\r\n\r\nplane is going to Rome or to London, and so forth;\r\n\r\nand  anyone who listens at our airport to whatever\r\n\r\nlanguage  is used can always know that a plane  is\r\n\r\ngoing to Bangkok. If this motion had been confined\r\n\r\nto  Malayan  Airways - our internal  lines,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Serangoon   suggested - I   could\r\n\r\nunderstand it and would advocate  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat we add not only Mandarin but  Malay  in\r\n\r\nparticular, as I would certainly say that  90  per\r\n\r\ncent of those going to the Federation speak Malay.\r\n\r\nIf  indeed  any  languages were to be  adopted,  I\r\n\r\nwould  personally  think that  English  and  Malay\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  ones, because  as  the  hon.  Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland said that in the several years he spent\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia  he found that all the  Chinese  who\r\n\r\ntravel by air from Indonesia to Singapore and vice\r\n\r\nversa speak the language of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat that Government would be\r\n\r\nonly  too  happy  to introduce multilingualism  if\r\n\r\nthey  felt that it was a necessary thing to do  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment but I think we are all satisfied  that\r\n\r\nat  this  stage  just  to adopt  Mandarin  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nconcerned with the fact that a Turk and  a  German\r\n\r\nmissed  their planes. As I have already  explained\r\n\r\nwhen  I  moved  the  motion, the  principle  I  am\r\n\r\nfighting  for is the progress of the  country  and\r\n\r\nsurely it is the duty of the Minister in charge to\r\n\r\noffer  facilities to all and sundry,  particularly\r\n\r\nto those passengers who cannot understand English.\r\n\r\nThey  may understand Malay, Mandarin or Tamil  and\r\n\r\nif  you  want to introduce multilingualism in  the\r\n\r\nAirport, by all means do so. In my first letter to\r\n\r\nthe Minister, I said that the announcements should\r\n\r\nbe  made  in Mandarin, Malay as well as in  Tamil.\r\n\r\nThat is multilingualism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the letter the Minister wrote to me\r\n\r\ndated 10th April, 1957, asking me to produce proof\r\n\r\nin  the way of witnesses' names and addresses, may\r\n\r\nI inform the Minister that I am one of the elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthat it is not my duty - particularly when I do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the facilities and so on - to submit the names\r\n\r\nand  addresses of the witnesses, the  airlines  on\r\n\r\nwhich they travelled, the countries to which  they\r\n\r\nintended  to  go, the dates in each instance,  and\r\n\r\nthe languages and dialects spoken by them?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the Minister said that on the\r\n\r\noccasion  when the last delegation came back  from\r\n\r\nLondon,  the  plane was delayed and  that  when  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper reporter announced in Mandarin  to  that\r\n\r\neffect, the crowd dispersed. That is proof  enough\r\n\r\nthat   most   of  the  people  who   go   to   the\r\n\r\nAirport - passengers or visitors - understand Mandarin\r\n\r\nperfectly well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the hon.

Is not 40 big enough?  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, Sir, I think it might not be out of place\r\n\r\nif I say a few words about the hospital itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hospital was founded in 1910, at a time\r\n\r\nwhen the population of Singapore was only 300,000.\r\n\r\nToday we have one and a half million. All the  so-called  thickly  populated  areas  of  today  were\r\n\r\njungles  then.  This hospital is situated  at  the\r\n\r\njunction of Serangoon Road and Balestier Road  and\r\n\r\nis  known  as Rumah Miskin, the Poor House.  This\r\n\r\nhospital is entirely free and takes care of  about\r\n\r\n450 patients. In addition, it has to take care  of\r\n\r\nabout 100 outdoor patients every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, the Committee spent nearly\r\n\r\n$600,000   in   renovating  and  rebuilding   this\r\n\r\nhospital,  and  building is still  going  on.  The\r\n\r\nannual expenditure is about a quarter of a million\r\n\r\ndollars, whereas it was only $50,000 pre-war.  The\r\n\r\nreason  why  we  are  asking for  an  increase  of\r\n\r\nCommittee members is this:\r\n\r\nit  has  been found most convenient to  appoint  a\r\n\r\nCommittee member in each district so that  he  can\r\n\r\ncollect subscriptions from the Chinese, especially\r\n\r\nthe   Cantonese - more  than  95  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\ncontributions are from the Cantonese - and,  at the same time, hear any complaints  from\r\n\r\npatients  admitted from that locality. As  I  said\r\n\r\nbefore,   when  the  hospital  was   founded,   40\r\n\r\nCommittee members were considered sufficient,  but\r\n\r\ntoday, owing to the extension of the city and  the\r\n\r\nexistence of many more new districts, we find this\r\n\r\nnumber  is  insufficient. We consider 60  will  be\r\n\r\nnearer  to requirements. That is why we are asking\r\n\r\nfor this amended figure of 60.
