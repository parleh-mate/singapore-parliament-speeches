In 1973 I said that if the situation  did  not\r\n\r\nappear  to  get better I would say something  about  it\r\n\r\nagain, and that is why I am standing up before you here\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information in the old volumes of\r\n\r\nHansard, in March 1973 a total sum of nearly $125,000\r\n\r\nwas paid out in compensation. According to a question\r\n\r\nwhich I tabled for written\r\n\r\nanswer, the total for FY 74 for the 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths  of  1974 is $376,398.80, a sum that  represents\r\n\r\nthree  times what it was in 1973. The matter has really\r\n\r\nbecome  much  worse. But to compound the  situation  it\r\n\r\nwould appear that compensation has to be paid even  for\r\n\r\naccidents involving Police vehicles because  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$62,000  has  been  paid out in  respect  of  accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving  the  Police. Under such  circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  requires some very strong admonition  either\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister or in some way through the Attorney-General's Chambers. It is for this reason that  I  have\r\n\r\nrisen to speak on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the appropriation for 1974 is\r\n\r\n$100,000 while the sum that is going to be paid out  or\r\n\r\nhas  been paid out so far is $376,000. This discrepancy\r\n\r\nbetween  the appropriation and the actual sum paid  out\r\n\r\nhas  appeared again and again in the Estimates. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that when the next Estimates are  prepared  we\r\n\r\nput  in  a sum that is perhaps closer to the experience\r\n\r\nthat  we  have had so that Members can have an idea  of\r\n\r\nthe  extent of compensation that has been paid, instead\r\n\r\nof having to find out by asking for a written answer to\r\n\r\na question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as for accidents involving Government\r\n\r\nvehicles,  the  expenditure under  this  head  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1974-75 up to 28th February this year is\r\n\r\n$139,489.92.  This sum was required  to  settle  claims\r\n\r\narising  out of accidents involving Government vehicles\r\n\r\nwhich  were settled out of court. The vast majority  of\r\n\r\nthese cases were dealt with under the provisions of the\r\n\r\nTreasury Collision Agreement between the Government and\r\n\r\n48  insurance  companies. The  Agreement  provides  for\r\n\r\ncontribution towards the cost of repairs to  Government\r\n\r\nvehicles  insured by one of the signatory companies  in\r\n\r\nthe event of accidents between these vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of the vote was used to settle claims in\r\n\r\naccidents caused or contributed to by the negligence of\r\n\r\nGovernment drivers.

This can be said to be due\r\n\r\nto  the  increasing  number of  vehicles  used  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Government Ministries and departments.  Whilst\r\n\r\nthe  number of vehicles used by the Ministry of Defence\r\n\r\nis  not known to me, the fleets of the Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  and the Police Department  have  increased\r\n\r\nconsiderably. In 1972, the Ministry of the  Environment\r\n\r\nhad  350 vehicles but by 1974 this number had increased\r\n\r\nto  419.  The  Police  fleet  has  increased  from  664\r\n\r\nvehicles in 1972 to 842 in 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another consideration which perhaps has a greater\r\n\r\nbearing  on  this expenditure is the sharp increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  cost of repairs. The sum of $100,000 allocated  to\r\n\r\nmeet  accidents for the financial year  1974-75  was  a\r\n\r\nconservative figure. The sum expended in the  financial\r\n\r\nyear 1973-74 amounted to nearly $150,000. For the first\r\n\r\n11  months  of  the financial year 1974-75,  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$139,489.92  has been spent, and we expect this  figure\r\n\r\nto  increase  to  about $150,000 by the  close  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year. For these reasons a budget of  $150,000\r\n\r\nfor the new financial year would not be an unreasonable\r\n\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for the discrepancies between the\r\n\r\namount  asked for in previous financial years  and  the\r\n\r\nactual  amount spent was the unforeseen sharp  increase\r\n\r\nin  the  cost of repairs and the increase in the number\r\n\r\nof accidents. In 1971, for example, the average cost of\r\n\r\neach  accident was about $370 but by 1974  the  average\r\n\r\ncost per accident had increased to $550.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers of Government vehicles are subject to a far\r\n\r\ngreater degree of control than the ordinary driver.

It is  essential  that  we\r\n\r\ndevelop parks because more than 40% of our people  live\r\n\r\nin   high-rise  flats  and  need  an  environment   for\r\n\r\nrelaxation, lots of trees, greenery and serenity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in MacRitchie a restaurant enables those\r\n\r\nwho  can  afford to refresh themselves. I  presume  the\r\n\r\nrental is high and so the cost for refreshment is  also\r\n\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the park authorities to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  park is not littered and stringent  measures\r\n\r\nhave been taken to ensure that this is adhered to. Soft\r\n\r\ndrinks  are  not  allowed  in  the  park  for  fear  of\r\n\r\nlittering, and rightly so. It would also result in  the\r\n\r\nrestaurant being put out of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of each year, many school\r\n\r\nchildren frequent the MacRitchie Reservoir, not because\r\n\r\nthey  want  to enjoy the serenity of the park  and  its\r\n\r\nsurroundings  but  because, as  part  of  their  school\r\n\r\nactivities,  they need to participate in  cross-country\r\n\r\nraces.  These children go there as groups organised  by\r\n\r\ntheir schools. Of course, the usual formalities have to\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out  when applications  are  made  by  the\r\n\r\nschools  to  the Ministry of Education for the  use  of\r\n\r\nMacRitchie  Reservoir as a cross-country  track.  These\r\n\r\napplications  are  normally  approved  by   the   Water\r\n\r\nDepartment, Public Utilities Board, and conditions  are\r\n\r\nset  down  governing the use of the reservoir premises.\r\n\r\nThese   conditions  are  issued  by  the  Chief   Water\r\n\r\nEngineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions to be observed are on standard\r\n\r\ncyclostyled sheets and there are ten conditions in all.\r\n\r\nMost  conditions  stress  on anti-littering  and  anti-pollution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  need  to be taken. However,  regulation\r\n\r\n(10),   \"No   soft  drinks  are  allowed  in  reservoir\r\n\r\ngrounds\", puzzles me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is usual for children, after having run a cross-country race of 2.1 miles for girls and 3.1 miles for\r\n\r\nboys, to want to quench their thirst with some ice-cold\r\n\r\nwater  or  soft  drinks. To run between two  and  three\r\n\r\nmiles  is  pretty tiring especially in our hot climate,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  more than usual for children to need  more\r\n\r\nthan  one  bottle of iced soft drink or more  than  one\r\n\r\nglass of ice-cold water at the end of the race. But  as\r\n\r\nsoft  drinks are not allowed in the reservoir  grounds,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  alternative  but  for  the  children  to\r\n\r\npurchase these drinks from the restaurant at the fairly\r\n\r\nexorbitant price of 35 cents a bottle which, mind  you,\r\n\r\nis  not  iced  because  the great  number  of  children\r\n\r\nparticipating makes it very difficult for  the  caterer\r\n\r\nto ice hundreds of drinks. So the children will have to\r\n\r\nmake-do   with  warm  bottled  drinks  which  is   most\r\n\r\nunsatisfying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many of the children do without drinks at\r\n\r\nall  because  they cannot afford them at  such  prices.\r\n\r\nMany children have to dig into their savings for thirst\r\n\r\nquenchers  during  cross-country races  at  MacRitchie.\r\n\r\nSome  children,  because they  are  more  capable,  are\r\n\r\nchosen  to  represent  their schools  in  cross-country\r\n\r\nruns, so they turn up more than once to MacRitchie  and\r\n\r\nincur still greater costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fail to understand why if these cross-country races\r\n\r\nare  organised  by schools, and school  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  are responsible people, the PUB  cannot  make\r\n\r\nsome  arrangements so as to enable schools to  organise\r\n\r\ntheir  own thirst quenching facilities in the car  park\r\n\r\nin  the reservoir ground. Children can then be provided\r\n\r\nwith   cheaper   and  ice-cold  drinks.   If   properly\r\n\r\norganised, the drinks would cost no more than 5 cents a\r\n\r\nglass   or   even   cheaper.  The  money   saved,   the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction derived by the children, and the assurance\r\n\r\nthat MacRitchie is not littered, would be enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narguments  for the Chief Water Engineer to  allow  soft\r\n\r\ndrinks  into  the  reservoir grounds  during  organised\r\n\r\ncross-country races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think the key to the complaint\r\n\r\nmade here is the term, \"if properly organised\". In  the\r\n\r\nexperience of the PUB, on many occasions when  students\r\n\r\nparticipated  in cross-country runs in the  reservoirs,\r\n\r\nthey  were  found  littering. So  I  say  \"if  properly\r\n\r\norganised\"  is  the answer. Our experience  shows  that\r\n\r\nthese  runs  have not been properly organised  on  many\r\n\r\noccasions.  That  is  the  reason  why,  among  the  10\r\n\r\nconditions imposed by the Chief Water Engineer for  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  MacRitchie Reservoir is one  disallowing  soft\r\n\r\ndrinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after listening to the eloquent appeal from the\r\n\r\nhon.

I will take this matter up with  the  Chief\r\n\r\nWater Engineer of the PUB, and between the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation and the PUB they should be able to work out a\r\n\r\nscheme  to prevent littering in the reservoirs as  well\r\n\r\nas to provide cheap cold drinks for the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, that was the most satisfactory answer by the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister.

The  consumers   are   of\r\n\r\ndifferent   levels  of  education  and  have  different\r\n\r\ncapacities for understanding. The PUB has to depend  on\r\n\r\nsome 160 meter-readers to go from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse  to  house to read the meters for the calculation\r\n\r\nof consumers' monthly bills. It is not an easy task for\r\n\r\neach  meter  reader to visit some 3,000  households  to\r\n\r\nread  meters to any degree of satisfaction.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nmost of the monthly bills give actual readings once  in\r\n\r\nevery   two   months  or  are  based  on  the   average\r\n\r\nconsumption over three months. This mode of calculation\r\n\r\nis  contained in the bills sent by the PUB to consumers\r\n\r\nfor their information. Using the pretext of shortage of\r\n\r\npersonnel  or the wording as appearing on the  bill  in\r\n\r\norder  to  arrive  at  any calculation  is  groundless,\r\n\r\ninaccurate  and unreliable. For instance, in  the  last\r\n\r\nyear  certain consumers' bills suddenly jumped by  100%\r\n\r\nto  200%. After enquiries by letter, the bill  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  month returned to normal. But after  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  months  the bill would again increase  by  200%.\r\n\r\nThis is rather erratic and puzzling. To the rich people\r\n\r\nit  does  not matter very much, but to people in  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group who have very tight budgets, it  it  very\r\n\r\ndisturbing to have to meet the high cost of PUB bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Yeo, are you on the right subhead - Loan to  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, I am talking first on the complaints about PUB\r\n\r\nbills, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the low income group people, it is a big burden to\r\n\r\nthem.

As  long  as\r\n\r\nconsumers  take their readings correctly and send  them\r\n\r\nin by the scheduled date, the PUB will be able to check\r\n\r\nthem  from  time to time. That will save us  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  engaging meter-readers.  There  are  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  400.000  accounts, and  there  are  about  a\r\n\r\nmillion meters to be read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working on a documentary with the RTS at the\r\n\r\nmoment  and  it  is expected to be ready  by  May.  The\r\n\r\ndocumentary will teach the public how to read their own\r\n\r\nmeters.  We  are also printing cards for  consumers  to\r\n\r\nrecord their meter readings. These readings can then be\r\n\r\nchecked by the meter readers from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take this opportunity to say that\r\n\r\nthe complaint about 100-200% increase in the consumers'\r\n\r\nbill is not quite true. I have come across cases where,\r\n\r\nin actual fact, consumers have used a 100% or more than\r\n\r\nthe previous month's consumption. In one of my Meet-the-People sessions, I had a consumer who showed me his PUB\r\n\r\nbills.  The  average for six months was about  $80  per\r\n\r\nmonth,  but for the month in question the amount billed\r\n\r\nwas  about  $200.  I  asked  him  whether  he  had  any\r\n\r\ncelebration  in his house. He said no. On investigation\r\n\r\nit  was found that a dinner party took place for  three\r\n\r\nsuccessive nights to celebrate a wedding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB bills can increase substantially because of a\r\n\r\nleaking  water  pipe  or a faulty  meter.  Under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the consumer can ask for the meter to be\r\n\r\nchecked, and if the meter is proved to be faulty, there\r\n\r\nwill be a refund or the leak detected and repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not fabricating all these complaints about\r\n\r\nthe  undue increase of PUB bills by 100-200%. In  fact,\r\n\r\non  Friday, the 14th of March this year at my Meet-the-People session I met a member of the public who came to\r\n\r\nsee  me  with his PUB bills. His monthly bills were  at\r\n\r\nfirst $14.56 and then it increased to $51.88. So if  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary, I can give the Minister a photostat copy\r\n\r\nof the bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for accepting\r\n\r\nmy  proposal to educate the consumers to take their own\r\n\r\nmeter readings, as this will solve the problem and give\r\n\r\na  lot  of  convenience to the people. I beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,247,700 for Head J ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $54,120,800 for Head J ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1002 (The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that we had a very short time\r\n\r\nin  which to build up a credible defence. But under the\r\n\r\nenlightened  leadership and planning  of  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned, we have made great achievements and  success\r\n\r\nin  this  regard. The strength of our Armed Forces  has\r\n\r\nbeen  increasing from day to day and they are  able  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  the responsibility of defending our  country.\r\n\r\nThese  are  achievements which  are  not  mean  by  any\r\n\r\nstandard,   particularly  for  a  small  country   like\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  should be proud of  such  achievements.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the defence build-up has been on  the  proper\r\n\r\nlines   and   is   proceeding  smoothly   for   further\r\n\r\ndevelopment, there are some shortcomings which  require\r\n\r\nour attention. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nbring up three points for the attention of the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the relaxation of part-time national\r\n\r\nservice.  I have received complaints that the only  son\r\n\r\nin  the  family has not been exempted from the national\r\n\r\nservice, particularly when his parents are old or  sick\r\n\r\nand  are unable to look after their own business. Under\r\n\r\nsuch  circumstances the only son is  required  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  small  family  business  which  cannot   be\r\n\r\nproperly run by the aged or sick parents. But exemption\r\n\r\nis   not   normally  granted  in  such  cases.  Another\r\n\r\ncomplaint  I have received is from an only son  who  is\r\n\r\nrequired to help his aged parents to rear pigs. He  has\r\n\r\nasked  for a change from full-time service to part-time\r\n\r\nservice,  but his application was rejected.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  cases  of financial difficulties which  make  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  for national servicemen to ask for part-time\r\n\r\nservice  instead of full-time service. There  are  also\r\n\r\nrequests for national service call-up for brothers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be staggered. But all these applications have  been\r\n\r\nrejected.  The  cases that I have cited  are  deserving\r\n\r\ncases because these people come from very poor families\r\n\r\nand  they are faced with great financial (difficulties.\r\n\r\nSo  I  feel that the Minister concerned should consider\r\n\r\ntheir   cases  more  sympathetically  and  grant  their\r\n\r\napplications for transfer to part-time service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a need to provide more recreational\r\n\r\nand  cultural activities in the camps. Over the  recent\r\n\r\nyears we have such activities in the camps. It is  good\r\n\r\nfor  the  national servicemen and our soldiers to  take\r\n\r\npart in wholesome and cultural activities. This is part\r\n\r\nand  parcel  of  the  build-up of  their  cultural  and\r\n\r\nspiritual  life. I would like to support this  kind  of\r\n\r\nactivity, as it will provide our soldiers and  national\r\n\r\nservicemen opportunities for recreational and  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of content perhaps there is still room for\r\n\r\nimprovement. According to my understanding,  the  songs\r\n\r\nand the music played during such activities are more of\r\n\r\nthe  popular type. No doubt they may be quite  pleasing\r\n\r\nto the ears hut they are not cultural music in the true\r\n\r\nsense of the word. They are pop music, a crazy type  of\r\n\r\nmusic,   very  loud  and  boisterous  and  will   cause\r\n\r\nspiritual   degradation.  So  for  our  soldiers   such\r\n\r\ndissipating  type of music should not be encouraged.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to propose to the Minister concerned  that\r\n\r\nthe   cultural  and  recreational  activities  provided\r\n\r\nshould   contain  marches  and  other  healthy   songs.\r\n\r\nListening in to more and more marches will heighten the\r\n\r\nSpirit of our soldiers and boost their morale. In  this\r\n\r\nway   our   soldiers  will  feel  a  sense  of   pride.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I understand that the physical  activities\r\n\r\nlike  sports  and  games are quite  popular  among  our\r\n\r\nsoldiers  in  the  camps.  Unfortunately  there  is  no\r\n\r\nsystematic training for such sports and games. I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore like to propose the setting up of a sports or\r\n\r\nphysical  education unit in the Armed  Forces  for  the\r\n\r\npromotion of physical education among our soldiers.  In\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  there  can  be  more  sportsmen  trained  for  our\r\n\r\nnational teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there have been quite a lot of complaints\r\n\r\nabout  misconduct on the part of our soldiers.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived   complaints  that  some  soldiers  misbehaved\r\n\r\nthemselves in public. Some soldiers have been  said  to\r\n\r\nhave made catcalls to girls, when driving in their army\r\n\r\ntrucks.  This is a very serious matter and is a  breach\r\n\r\nof  good conduct on the part of the soldiers. This will\r\n\r\nbring  our  army into disrepute. Though the  number  of\r\n\r\nsoldiers  guilty of such misconduct may be very  small,\r\n\r\nit  will nevertheless affect the good reputation of the\r\n\r\ngreat  majority. Therefore, I would like  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned to pay special attention to this complaint of\r\n\r\nmisconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that some soldiers, and even\r\n\r\nofficers,  keep  long hair. Since there  is  an  Action\r\n\r\nCommittee  against  long hair  in  Singapore  and  that\r\n\r\npeople  with long hair are to be served last,  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  ruling should be strictly enforced in  our  Armed\r\n\r\nForces.  We  should not tolerate long  hair  among  our\r\n\r\nsoldiers.  Our  Senior Parliamentary Secretary  in  the\r\n\r\nDefence  Ministry  has already set a  good  example  by\r\n\r\ncutting  his  hair short! So our soldiers and  officers\r\n\r\nshould  emulate him. There is every reason to stick  to\r\n\r\nthe short hair rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  from the region was followed by  a  Defence\r\n\r\nAgreement  between Australia, Britain and  New  Zealand\r\n\r\naimed  at strengthening our defence capabilities.  Now,\r\n\r\nthe  Australian  troops  have been  withdrawn  and  the\r\n\r\nBritish  troops are reported to be on the  verge  of  a\r\n\r\ncomplete withdrawal. Only the New Zealanders are  left.\r\n\r\nIt  seems  as  though some of our defence partners  are\r\n\r\nvery  unreliable.  Furthermore, this  sort  of  defence\r\n\r\nagreement drawn up by countries thousands of miles away\r\n\r\nseems  to  suit their convenience rather than ours.  Do\r\n\r\nyou  not think, Sir, it is better that we draw up a new\r\n\r\nDefence Agreement among the ASEAN countries, which  are\r\n\r\ncloser to the shores of Singapore, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  play  an  effective  role  in  the  defence   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and also in the defence of each country?  We\r\n\r\ncannot rely on foreigners. Instead we should rely  more\r\n\r\non our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been reported that the army regulars have\r\n\r\nbeen  given a $25 increment to overcome inflation. This\r\n\r\nis  unfair. The national servicemen are doing the  same\r\n\r\nwork and they have to meet the same expenses. They  too\r\n\r\nhelp  in  the defence of the country. They too help  in\r\n\r\nthe maintenance of their families. Furthermore, married\r\n\r\nregulars   are   provided  free   transport,   gratuity\r\n\r\nallowances  and quarters, which benefits  the  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  are not entitled to. There is  considerable\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction because of this disparity  between  the\r\n\r\nregulars  and the national servicemen as  far  as  this\r\n\r\nincrement is concerned. Would it not be wiser  to  give\r\n\r\nthis  increment  to  all  servicemen,  irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether they are regulars or national servicemen, since\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  living  affects everybody  and  not  one\r\n\r\nparticular group alone. Why cannot we be fair to all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this year onwards the National Day Parade, on an\r\n\r\nexperimental basis, will be decentralised. It  will  be\r\n\r\nheld  in different districts in different forms. May  I\r\n\r\nknow   how   these   programmes   are   going   to   be\r\n\r\ndecentralised? Will there be a variety of parades, etc.\r\n\r\nor is it going to be the same everywhere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago I queried the conduct of army drivers\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  numerous  accidents  they  had   been\r\n\r\ninvolved in. We were then assured that the standard  of\r\n\r\ndriving  would improve. Unfortunately, I have to  raise\r\n\r\nthis  question again because I continue to see reckless\r\n\r\ndriving by some army drivers. It seems that some of the\r\n\r\narmy drivers and our bus drivers are equally bad on the\r\n\r\nroads.  Once an army driver is in a 3-tonner, he  seems\r\n\r\nto  think  that he owns the road and all other vehicles\r\n\r\nlike  cars, motor cycles and bicycles are just midgets.\r\n\r\nIt is a common sight to see army drivers speeding along\r\n\r\neverywhere. Their recklessness is a source of danger to\r\n\r\nother  drivers. It is high time that stern  action  was\r\n\r\ntaken against these reckless drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army, in fact, the Defence Department introduced\r\n\r\nSAFE  Supermarkets, one in Beach Road and the other  at\r\n\r\nDempsey  Road. Business must have been very bad because\r\n\r\na  lot of passes had been issued to Government servants\r\n\r\nand  to  numerous  Statutory Boards. Unfortunately,  it\r\n\r\nseems  that  the  purpose of the  SAFE  Supermarket  at\r\n\r\nDempsey Road is lost because of the distance. A look in\r\n\r\nthis Supermarket will clearly reveal the very few items\r\n\r\non display and these are of poor quality. Rusty-looking\r\n\r\ntins  or  containers are displayed in a shoddy  manner.\r\n\r\nMaybe something could be done to reorganise the Dempsey\r\n\r\nRoad  SAFE Supermarket. In these Supermarkets only army\r\n\r\npersonnel  are  allowed to buy beer at special  prices.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  the reservists are not allowed  to  buy\r\n\r\nbeer from this Supermarket. May I know why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that in the establishment of\r\n\r\nthe  Army,  there  are many senior posts  like  Warrant\r\n\r\nOfficers,  etc, which are still left vacant,  although\r\n\r\nmany loyal and dedicated men who have put in many years\r\n\r\nof  service  could fill these vacancies.  But  this  is\r\n\r\nnever done. Why is this so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junior officers, like the staff sergeants, are\r\n\r\nquite   frustrated   because  of  lack   of   promotion\r\n\r\nprospects.  Furthermore, the pay of these officers  are\r\n\r\nnothing   compared  to  the  salaries  of  the   Police\r\n\r\nsergeants. Could something be done to revise the salary\r\n\r\nscales of the army in general?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang is quite wrong about\r\n\r\nMindef policy in regard to the call-up of only sons who\r\n\r\nhave to look after the aged parents. The policy is that\r\n\r\nif  the  young man is the sole supporter of the family,\r\n\r\nhe  is not called up for full-time service. In fact, in\r\n\r\n1974,  238 such cases were approved when they  appealed\r\n\r\nagainst full-time national service. During the Meet-the-People  sessions and elsewhere, Members  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nare  told  rather biased stories by parents,  which  on\r\n\r\ninvestigation turn out to be inaccurate. But if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  fact  is  that he is the sole breadwinner  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily  and  enlistment  into  national  service  would\r\n\r\nimpose  hardship  because of decline  in  income,  then\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  clear case for exemption  from  full-time\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding cultural activities in the SAF, every person\r\n\r\nhas  his taste and if the Member for Sembawang does not\r\n\r\nlike  pop songs and loud music he need not turn  up  at\r\n\r\nthe  road  shows of the SAF. But he is quite  wrong  in\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  if we only play marches  and  rousing\r\n\r\nmusic  the  soldiers'  morale  will  go  up.  This   is\r\n\r\nentertainment and relaxation for them and they want  to\r\n\r\nforget the rigours of military training. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nhave   to   give  them  something  which  they   enjoy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  the  Member for  Sembawang's  taste  of\r\n\r\nmusic does not coincide with that of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of sports, there is a sports officer\r\n\r\nin  every  unit. The trouble is this. We  do  not  have\r\n\r\nenough  sports fields and even in the biggest and  best\r\n\r\nbattalion  camp  you  often  find  there  is  only  one\r\n\r\nfootball  field  and  perhaps two or  three  basketball\r\n\r\npitches. That is about all that is available for nearly\r\n\r\na   thousand  men.  This  is  totally  inadequate.  The\r\n\r\nsolution is that we have to make-do with what we  have,\r\n\r\nin  view  of the shortage of land and money being  none\r\n\r\ntoo  plentiful. The ideal solution is beyond the  grasp\r\n\r\nof SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding misbehaviour and catcalls to girls, in my\r\n\r\nfive   years   as  Defence  Minister  I  received   two\r\n\r\ncomplaints on this subject from girls who were outraged\r\n\r\nby  soldiers making catcalls at them. On investigation,\r\n\r\nit  was  found  that it was not just a  matter  of  the\r\n\r\nsoldiers  being  high-spirited  but  they  were  rather\r\n\r\nnasty.  So the soldiers were duly court martialled  and\r\n\r\nsentenced  to  40 days' jail. But there were  only  two\r\n\r\ncases in five years. If the hon. Member's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngirl friends are subject to this kind of treatment, and\r\n\r\nif  they  object  to it, then please let  me  have  the\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding long hair, I think this is a very general\r\n\r\nallegation.  Standards are being  maintained.  I  would\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Member for Sembawang to  look  at  an  RTS\r\n\r\nillustration  of what constitutes long  hair  and  what\r\n\r\ndoes  not  constitute long hair. I can assure him  that\r\n\r\nthe hair style of my Senior Parliamentary Secretary  is\r\n\r\nnot taken to be the ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wants the $25 increase to be\r\n\r\nextended to national servicemen. When we decided not to\r\n\r\ngive  this  additional sum to national  servicemen,  we\r\n\r\nexplained that the purpose of this $25 is to  meet  the\r\n\r\nadditional  cost  of food, transport and  clothing,  as\r\n\r\nagainst  the  NWC 9% increase which is  the  result  of\r\n\r\neconomic  growth and general sharing of prosperity.  So\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  distinguish these two  elements  of  wage\r\n\r\nincrease. The $25 is meant to offset the rising cost of\r\n\r\nliving  last year and the subsequent 9% increase  which\r\n\r\nwas  a  share of the bigger GNP growth which  Singapore\r\n\r\nachieved.  Nearly  all  the  national  servicemen   are\r\n\r\nunmarried and they live in camps. They are fed and they\r\n\r\nget  free  transport, free meals and free clothing.  So\r\n\r\nthey are protected from the cost of living increases to\r\n\r\nthat  extent. In fact, it is the taxpayer  who  has  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  additional cost of feeding and clothing  the\r\n\r\nsoldiers,  whose  cost  has nearly  doubled  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears. On the other hand, the regular soldier generally\r\n\r\nlives  outside the camp and he has to feed himself.  He\r\n\r\nhas got to look after his family and clothe them. He is\r\n\r\nnot  protected,  to  the same extent  as  the  national\r\n\r\nservicemen,  from  the effects of price  increases.  So\r\n\r\nthere is really no case for giving this $25 increase to\r\n\r\nnational servicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether National Day parades will\r\n\r\nbe  the  same  or  whether there will be  variety,  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is that there will be variety. The form of  the\r\n\r\nparade  will be under the direction of the Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge. Generally speaking, what we aim to achieve is a\r\n\r\nmore informal atmosphere, a happier and less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprecise  parade, as compared with the central  National\r\n\r\nDay parade at the Padang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reckless driving, I do not think the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  can  say that his complaint last  year  had  not\r\n\r\nbrought any result. Partly because of what he said, the\r\n\r\nSAF has bought equipment to catch army drivers speeding\r\n\r\nby installing radar traps in various places. The Member\r\n\r\nwill  be glad to hear that last year 328 soldiers  were\r\n\r\nfined  between $20 and $100 each for speeding.  But  by\r\n\r\nand  large,  the  accident rate in  the  Army  has  not\r\n\r\nreached  the  dangerous limit. I  will  give  him  some\r\n\r\nfigures  if  he is interested. In 1974, there  was  one\r\n\r\naccident  per 45,000 kilometres, and in 1973 there  was\r\n\r\none  accident per 47,000 kilometres. So in  1974  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  slight deterioration. We are trying to  improve\r\n\r\nthe situation as best as we can, but so long as most of\r\n\r\nthe drivers are national servicemen (and this will have\r\n\r\nto  be  the position in the national service army)  you\r\n\r\ncannot expect the same high standard of driving  as  in\r\n\r\nthe  regular army where all the drivers are experienced\r\n\r\nand long-term professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point about NCOs. Here again, the Member has\r\n\r\nbeen  misinformed. Last year there were four  promotion\r\n\r\nexercises  carried out for regular NCOs. About  480  of\r\n\r\nthem were promoted, which comes to about three-quarters\r\n\r\nof  those who were within the promotion zone. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of vacancies in the senior  ranks  of  the\r\n\r\nNCOs, a vital cadre of the Army, is so serious that the\r\n\r\nrisk  is the other way round - we promote people faster\r\n\r\nthan they normally would be promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

When  we\r\n\r\nopened the Dempsey Road Supermarket in April 1974,  the\r\n\r\nreason  was that the Beach Road Supermarket was  rather\r\n\r\ncrowded  as it comprises only a very small room.  There\r\n\r\nwere spare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuildings in Tanglin Barracks and we thought  we  would\r\n\r\nopen  a supermarket there. We were almost certain  that\r\n\r\nhaving  two supermarkets would be too big for  the  SAF\r\n\r\nwhich  after all is not all that big, and therefore  we\r\n\r\ndecided to extend in stages to various departments  and\r\n\r\nbranches of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the two supermarkets have a combined\r\n\r\nannual  turnover of about $4 million. For instance,  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1975 Beach Road Supermarket had a turnover  of\r\n\r\n$202,000   in   that  month  alone  and  Dempsey   Road\r\n\r\nSupermarket had a sale of $189,000. I do not think  the\r\n\r\nMember  is correct in saying that the goods in  Dempsey\r\n\r\nRoad Supermarket are inferior. They are the same as  in\r\n\r\nBeach  Road Supermarket. In fact, they are the same  in\r\n\r\nsupermarkets  elsewhere. They buy  the  same  brand  of\r\n\r\ngoods. But Dempsey Road Supermarket will be moving into\r\n\r\nconsumer durables and will enter into some kind of easy\r\n\r\ninstalment  payments for members of  the  SAF  and  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service,  who  will  be  able  to  buy  consumer\r\n\r\ndurables  like  refrigerators, radios,  tape-recorders,\r\n\r\netc, on fairly good terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Has any thought  also\r\n\r\nbeen   given  to  the  use  of  monsoon  winds  as   an\r\n\r\nalternative  source of energy? It may seem  ridiculous,\r\n\r\nbut  I  am  afraid  to  say that we  have  been  rather\r\n\r\ncomplacent  on  the study of energy resources  or  even\r\n\r\nutilising  alternative sources  of  energy  instead  of\r\n\r\nincreasing our dependence on oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that the recent student trouble we had\r\n\r\nwitnessed in Singapore has been mainly caused by  non-citizens.

I  wonder to what  extent  can  this\r\n\r\nbuilding accommodate our students. Sir, I have  to  ask\r\n\r\nthis  question because, at the present time, it is  not\r\n\r\neasy  for  our  students to gain entry into  our  local\r\n\r\nuniversity, because of competition and also because  of\r\n\r\nthe  high  standards set. As such, many of our students\r\n\r\nare  thinking  of  enrolling in  overseas  universities\r\n\r\nwhere  chances  of admission are very much  greater.  I\r\n\r\nwould,  therefore, urge the Minister to  see  that  our\r\n\r\nstudents  do  get  their higher education  in  our  own\r\n\r\nhigher institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Our main consideration, of  course,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  to  collect information and data on  the  use  of\r\n\r\nnuclear   energy,  in  conjunction  with   the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must warn the Member for Anson that my\r\n\r\nMinistry is not directly in charge of generating energy\r\n\r\nfor public consumption. All that we do is to act as  an\r\n\r\ninformation  gathering centre  which  can  be  used  to\r\n\r\nprovide  relevant data for the Public Utilities  Board.\r\n\r\nNo  decision has been made on the use of nuclear energy\r\n\r\nin  the  near  future as there are still many  pressing\r\n\r\nproblems  which the Public Utilities Board  is  facing,\r\n\r\nover  and  above which the Public Utilities  Board  has\r\n\r\nstill  to operate its new fossil fuel power station  at\r\n\r\nSenoko.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some research has been conducted by the\r\n\r\nMechanical Engineering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  the  University  of  Singapore  on  the\r\n\r\npossibilities of using solar energy. The Member may  be\r\n\r\naware  that  Singapore  is not a desert.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ncovered with clouds very frequently and it seems to  be\r\n\r\nraining  almost every day. But we have first to collect\r\n\r\ninformation on how much sunlight or radiation from  the\r\n\r\nsun  falls  on Singapore throughout a whole year.  This\r\n\r\ninformation has now been obtained and we are using  the\r\n\r\ndata  to formulate ways and means by which solar energy\r\n\r\ncan  be  used. The use of solar energy for  cooking  in\r\n\r\nvillages which are not supplied with electricity or gas\r\n\r\nis  quite  common in India and other African countries.\r\n\r\nThese   solar  cookers  can  be  bought  very  cheaply.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not foresee in the near or distant future\r\n\r\nSingapore  housewives  turning  on  to  solar  cookers.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it is our intention that we should conduct\r\n\r\nexperiments  so that solar energy can be  utilised  for\r\n\r\nindustrial  purposes rather than for domestic  purposes\r\n\r\nand  in  this way we hope we will be able  to  be  less\r\n\r\nreliant  on fossil energy. Or equally, with the growing\r\n\r\nuse   of  air-conditioning  in  supermarkets,  shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes   and  domestic  homes,  the  Department   is\r\n\r\nconducting research into methods of using solar  energy\r\n\r\nfor  air-conditioning. However, the  research  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  completed because the Department is still waiting\r\n\r\nfor  vital pieces of equipment which are necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe  development of apparatus that will be used  as  an\r\n\r\nair-conditioner. This is all that I can say as  far  as\r\n\r\nalternative sources of energy are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Member for Anson will realise that even\r\n\r\nthe  oil-producing countries are less interested in the\r\n\r\nuse  of solar energy but more interested in the use  of\r\n\r\nnuclear energy. If he had read the newspapers two  days\r\n\r\nago  he  would have learned that the Shah of  Iran  had\r\n\r\nalready  ordered nine nuclear reactors from the  United\r\n\r\nStates.  I  think it is in our interest that we  should\r\n\r\nlook  for  alternative sources of energy. I share  with\r\n\r\nhim his concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of non-citizens in the University of\r\n\r\nSingapore who have taken\r\n\r\na leading part in creating problems, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  only add that the Member for Anson must be aware\r\n\r\nthat prohibition of entry against six non-citizens  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  issued and they will not be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nenter into Singapore again. But we do take note of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation or proposal made by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nthat  non-citizens  should not  be  permitted  to  hold\r\n\r\noffice in student organisations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Member has asked how many students can be\r\n\r\naccommodated at Kent Ridge. I am in full sympathy  with\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson and all other parents who find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  their  children  to  enter  our   local\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I must say that the difference  in  points\r\n\r\nfor  admission  of students into the University  varies\r\n\r\nfrom  a  maximum  of  64  points  obtained  at  an  HSC\r\n\r\nexamination  to  a  minimum of 32 points,  which  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference  of  100%.  We cannot  go  lower  than  that\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  undertaken a statistical  study  and\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  there  is a correlation  between  the\r\n\r\ngrades  obtained at the A level and performance at  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  This has not only been our experience  but\r\n\r\nit  has also been the experience of universities in the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of other indicators of ability, we have\r\n\r\nto  rely  entirely on the grades obtained  at  the  HSC\r\n\r\nexamination.  For  this reason  we  can  only  take  in\r\n\r\nstudents who satisfy not just the minimum grade but the\r\n\r\naccepted  grade. For example, in areas  of  study  like\r\n\r\nmedicine and engineering, we require students who  have\r\n\r\nperformed  very well in the HSC examinations. Otherwise\r\n\r\namong  the  students who have been  taken  below  these\r\n\r\naccepted grades, the possibility of their dropping  out\r\n\r\nis  very high. They will drop out of the course in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  or second year, because these are tough courses.\r\n\r\nI believe that it is preferable for us to train doctors\r\n\r\nwho can cure than to train doctors who cannot cure.  So\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Anson  will  accept  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nstandards have to be maintained and that we just cannot\r\n\r\nabsorb  or  admit students on an ad hoc  basis  without\r\n\r\nbearing in mind quality, as well as the possibility  of\r\n\r\nmeeting our manpower needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of doctors, if the Member for Anson had read\r\n\r\nhis  newspaper two days ago, he would have come  across\r\n\r\nan article published by the medical profession in which\r\n\r\ncomplaints were made of doctors in Singapore  migrating\r\n\r\noverseas.  Obviously it seems a bit absurd that  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to keep on taking in more doctors or more students\r\n\r\nfor training in medicine and the end-result is to cause\r\n\r\nmore   migration  because  they  cannot  compete  among\r\n\r\nthemselves,  then we are investing in a  holed  pocket.\r\n\r\nFor  this reason there is a need for a quota. We cannot\r\n\r\nkeep  on taking in endless numbers of students who,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue of the profession they are trained in, have very\r\n\r\ngreat   mobility.  Medicine  is  one  profession  which\r\n\r\nprovides  a  student with this particular mobility.  He\r\n\r\ncan move from one country to another country. Canada is\r\n\r\nshort  of  doctors. Australia is short of doctors.  New\r\n\r\nZealand  is  short of doctors, and so also  the  United\r\n\r\nStates. So doctors can move very freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very important that those who are\r\n\r\naccepted  into  the medical school in Singapore  should\r\n\r\nhave some sense of obligation. Considering that we have\r\n\r\nspent  a  considerable sum of money  on  their  medical\r\n\r\neducation, they should at least devote their skills for\r\n\r\nsome  years to patients in Singapore rather than  think\r\n\r\nof  their own selfish interest. Their running away from\r\n\r\ncompetition  among  themselves, or  the  so-called  rat\r\n\r\nrace, is not going to help us solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our anticipation is that by 1980 the\r\n\r\nUniversity  will  be able to taking a  total  of  6,700\r\n\r\nundergraduates  as  compared to the present  number  of\r\n\r\n5,500 undergraduates, i.e. 1,200 more by 1980. This  is\r\n\r\nanother  five years' time. This represents  probably  a\r\n\r\n22%  increase.

Some Members may wonder  why.\r\n\r\nBut  let me say one thing - we are not progressing fast\r\n\r\nenough  in  the  implementation of metrication  in  all\r\n\r\naspects  of  life in Singapore. Take the  markets,  for\r\n\r\nexample. We still find weights being measured in katis,\r\n\r\ntahils,  pounds and ounces. The daching - the notorious\r\n\r\ninstrument  used by businessmen to swindle consumers  - has not changed in the least. When is metrication going\r\n\r\nto be a feature of life in the markets, particularly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that a higher provision is being voted for the\r\n\r\nMetrication Board as it plans to intensify the pace  of\r\n\r\nmetrication  in  the retail sector. May  I  also  know,\r\n\r\nbesides the retail sector, what other divisions has the\r\n\r\nMetrication Board in mind to promote metrication in the\r\n\r\nnext financial year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was stated in\r\n\r\nthe   Addendum   to  the  Presidential   Address   that\r\n\r\nmetrication  in  the public sector has  been  completed\r\n\r\nmore  or less and that efforts of the Metrication Board\r\n\r\nwill  be directed at the private sector beginning  this\r\n\r\nyear. However, before we embark upon this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncampaign it is necessary that the infrastructure should\r\n\r\nbe laid. It is true that metrication appears to be slow\r\n\r\nin  the  private sector but, in reality, if the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson were to visit supermarkets, emporiums and  if\r\n\r\nhe  buys  petrol  at  petrol stations,  he  would  have\r\n\r\nnoticed  that all measures are now in metric. What  has\r\n\r\nhappened,   of  course,  is  that  we  have  introduced\r\n\r\nmetrication so gradually and so painlessly that it  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  felt. But we have got to be very careful  at\r\n\r\nthe  retail  trade sector, particularly in the  markets\r\n\r\nwhere  housewives and servants do not fully  understand\r\n\r\nthe  relationship between the traditional kati and  the\r\n\r\nmetric measures of a kilogram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metrication Board has come out with a model of a\r\n\r\ndaching calibrated on the metric scale. Unless we first\r\n\r\nabolish  the present daching scale which is  calibrated\r\n\r\nin katis, it is obviously very wrong and foolish of the\r\n\r\nMetrication Board to suggest introducing two  types  of\r\n\r\ndachings,  because  then housewives would  be  cheated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a considerable amount of propaganda and some\r\n\r\nlegislation  may  be  necessary before  we  can  induce\r\n\r\nhawkers  to  convert to the metric system. The  Weights\r\n\r\nand  Measures Office, which is attached to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance,  is really concerned with the daching  and\r\n\r\nthey have to be consulted. With due consultation it  is\r\n\r\nquite  possible  that we can abolish  the  daching  and\r\n\r\ninsist on other types of measuring instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Member for Anson had experience in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  businessmen, traders or hawkers,  he  will  fully\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  regardless of what type  of  weighing\r\n\r\nmachines  we  use, there are always ways and  means  by\r\n\r\nwhich dishonest traders can cheat housewives. It is not\r\n\r\nthe  metric system or the imperial system that is being\r\n\r\nused  to  cheat housewives. It is the machine  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  used. So the Member for Anson has to be a little\r\n\r\nmore  patient before we can find effective results next\r\n\r\nyear.  In fact, I anticipate that it will take  another\r\n\r\nthree  to four years before metrication in the  markets\r\n\r\nbecomes feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It will be  important  to\r\n\r\ncooperate  with our neighbours to safeguard our  common\r\n\r\ninterest. ASEAN can play an important role in lessening\r\n\r\nthe  leverage  the great powers can otherwise  have  in\r\n\r\nexploiting differences and conflicts within the region.\r\n\r\nIt  can  also quicken the pace of regional co-operation\r\n\r\nand economic development. This in turn will\r\n\r\nstrengthen stability and peace in the area.  ASEAN  can\r\n\r\nhelp  member  states adjust to the rapid  geo-political\r\n\r\nchanges  in the region as the consequences of  American\r\n\r\nwithdrawal from direct involvement with the problems of\r\n\r\nIndo-China  work  themselves through,  and  a  regional\r\n\r\nbalance   is   established  without  any  great   power\r\n\r\nhegemony.  ASEAN will soon have a permanent Secretariat\r\n\r\nwhich  will  coordinate  the  many  regional  economic,\r\n\r\nsocial and cultural projects being implemented.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on the President's Address on 25th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  I had referred to this particular aspect  of\r\n\r\nforeign  affairs. I am more concerned with the question\r\n\r\nof  regional cooperation and I am happy to see  that  a\r\n\r\npermanent  Secretariat for ASEAN  will  be  established\r\n\r\nalthough,   as  stated  very  broadly,  its   functions\r\n\r\nprimarily will be to co-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nordinate the  many  regional,  economic,  social  and\r\n\r\ncultural projects to be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Hon. Minister for Law and\r\n\r\nNational  Development, who is the Acting  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs, what are the scope and  functions  of\r\n\r\nthis  ASEAN Permanent Secretariat to be set  up?  I  am\r\n\r\nfully  in support of the policy stand as laid  down  in\r\n\r\nthe  Addendum to the President's speech with regard  to\r\n\r\nour  foreign  policy. I believe that ASEAN,  since  its\r\n\r\ninception,  has  progressed  to  the  extent  that  the\r\n\r\nrelationship among its member-states is getting closer,\r\n\r\nboth bilaterally and regionally. In that respect, ASEAN\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  very important role to  play  in  global\r\n\r\naffairs.  As  such,  how  and  in  what  way  can  this\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretariat  help  ASEAN  to  achieve   this\r\n\r\nobjective?  I  would  like the  Minister  concerned  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, undeniably, our efforts in matters of foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  have  reaped considerable  success  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.  Because of our foreign policy of non-alignment,\r\n\r\nwe  have  now  won  the  general  friendship  and  good\r\n\r\nrelationship   with  our  neighbouring  countries.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to  our original ties of mutual contact  with\r\n\r\nour  neighbouring countries in this region, we are  now\r\n\r\nhaving more ties by setting up bilateral relations with\r\n\r\nWest  Asian  countries  for  the  promotion  of  mutual\r\n\r\ninterests.  At the moment we are living in a  world  in\r\n\r\nwhich  every  one is mutually dependent on  the  other.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  for the sake of survival and in  the  long-term  interests, we must be more careful and active  in\r\n\r\ncarrying out our foreign policy to win more friends and\r\n\r\nto  get more benefits. For these reasons, I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister two questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What more active foreign policy measures will the\r\n\r\nMinistry  carry out to promote friendly relations  with\r\n\r\nWest  Asian  countries in order to get the benefits  of\r\n\r\nmutual trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In what countries will our foreign consulates and\r\n\r\nembassies be established?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nunder  this  Head, I wish to raise a matter  of  policy\r\n\r\naffecting the interests of our ambassadors and  mission\r\n\r\nstaff serving in our missions abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the question of citizenship status of\r\n\r\nchildren  of  the  ambassadors and mission  staff  born\r\n\r\nabroad.  As you know, the provisions on citizenship  in\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution  provides for citizenship  status  by\r\n\r\nbirth,  by  descent and by registration. Only  a  child\r\n\r\nborn  in Singapore of a citizen parent is a citizen  by\r\n\r\nbirth.  A  child born abroad is a citizen only  if  the\r\n\r\nchild's  father at the time of the child's birth  is  a\r\n\r\ncitizen by birth or by registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further provision requires that a minor becoming a\r\n\r\ncitizen  by descent must take the oath of renunciation,\r\n\r\nloyalty  and  allegiance to the State within  one  year\r\n\r\nafter reaching the age of 21 years, and that if such  a\r\n\r\nchild does not on reaching adulthood make this oath  of\r\n\r\nallegiance he loses his citizenship status completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ambassadors and mission staff abroad are serving\r\n\r\nthe country and sometimes under stress and tension, not\r\n\r\nto  mention  the frustrations which the officials  from\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury  from  time to time manufacture  for  our\r\n\r\nmission staff abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously our ambassadors and mission staff are\r\n\r\nconsidered  loyal since they represent  our  nation  in\r\n\r\nnational matters in the international scene. Yet  their\r\n\r\nchildren born abroad are citizens by descent and suffer\r\n\r\nthe  adverse presumption of disloyalty since the  child\r\n\r\non  reaching adulthood would have to make  an  oath  of\r\n\r\nrenunciation  and  of allegiance  and  loyalty  to  the\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now even criminals serving in prison have the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  despite  their overt  disloyalty  to  the\r\n\r\nState  and  country,  of  having  their  children  born\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore by birth and that too in a State-subsidised hospital. But our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nambassadors  and  mission staff in  this  respect,  you\r\n\r\nmight say, come off much worse than criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as I have noted earlier, the child born\r\n\r\nabroad  is a citizen only if the child's father at  the\r\n\r\ntime of the child's birth is himself a citizen by birth\r\n\r\nor registration. This is a recent amendment which makes\r\n\r\nit  more unfavourable for the child of an ambassador or\r\n\r\na  mission  staff born abroad. Since  the  child  of  a\r\n\r\nmission  staff  born  abroad  would  be  a  citizen  by\r\n\r\ndescent,  that child on reaching adulthood and marrying\r\n\r\nand,  in turn, having a child who is born abroad  would\r\n\r\nnot   be  a  citizen  at  all.  This  works  out   most\r\n\r\nunfavourably  for  our  ambassadors  and  their   staff\r\n\r\nabroad. In other words, there is an in-built deterrence\r\n\r\nin   this   situation  which  prevents  or  discourages\r\n\r\nofficials  in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  serving\r\n\r\nabroad  from  advising their children to serve  in  the\r\n\r\nForeign   Service   abroad  in  future,   because   the\r\n\r\ngrandchild will not be a citizen at all, if born abroad\r\n\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to this freak situation, as it appears to\r\n\r\nme,  is to amend the Constitution to include a proviso,\r\n\r\nas it has been done in other Constitutions, to make the\r\n\r\nchild born abroad a citizen by birth if, at the time of\r\n\r\nthe  child's birth, his father himself is a citizen and\r\n\r\nin the service of the State. Aside of that I do not see\r\n\r\nhow  this problem can be solved, apart from taking  the\r\n\r\ncourse of action of making it possible for the wife  of\r\n\r\nthe  ambassador or the mission staff serving abroad  to\r\n\r\ncome  back  to  Singapore for the birth of  her  child.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, would entail considerable expenses and\r\n\r\nthe  officials  in the Treasury would  shrink  back  in\r\n\r\nhorror.   It   is  unfortunate  that  this   unpleasant\r\n\r\nsituation has been allowed to go on to this date, and I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Minister to take measures to remedy this\r\n\r\nsituation  in fairness to our ambassadors  and  mission\r\n\r\nstaff  presently serving abroad and who may be  serving\r\n\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, would you like to answer\r\n\r\nthese questions first?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

With your permission, I would rather deal\r\n\r\nwith three of them instead of six at one go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Punggol who is interested in the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Secretariat. From its modest beginning  in  1967\r\n\r\nwhen the ASEAN Declaration was signed in Bangkok, ASEAN\r\n\r\nhas   steadily  grown  into  an  effective  and  lively\r\n\r\nregional  organisation.  ASEAN  has  now  11  Permanent\r\n\r\nCommittees and seven Ad Hoc Special Committees to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the ever-increasing activities which come  within\r\n\r\nthe ambit of intra-regional cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ASEAN has not remained closed and exclusive.\r\n\r\nASEAN  continues to seek close contact and  cooperation\r\n\r\nwith  its  immediate neighbours as well as  with  other\r\n\r\nnations  and  regions.  ASEAN has  now  established  an\r\n\r\nofficial  dialogue  with  the EEC,  Australia  and  New\r\n\r\nZealand.  Even the United States is also keen  to  have\r\n\r\nsuch  a  dialogue with ASEAN. Until now,  these  varied\r\n\r\nactivities  of  ASEAN were dealt with by  the  national\r\n\r\nsecretariats  in  the member-countries,  and  as  ASEAN\r\n\r\ngrows  these  activities will also widen in  scope  and\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has therefore come for ASEAN to have a\r\n\r\ncentral  Permanent Secretariat to coordinate all  these\r\n\r\nactivities.  Hence, the decision of the  ASEAN  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters to establish such a secretariat for ASEAN  in\r\n\r\nJakarta is not only another indication of the viability\r\n\r\nand  permanency  of  ASEAN but  also  of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nstreamline and to coordinate its growing activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year a meeting of the ASEAN senior\r\n\r\nofficials from the establishment of the Secretariat was\r\n\r\nheld  in  Thailand,  and  it  was  decided  tentatively\r\n\r\namongst  other  things  that the  proposed  Secretariat\r\n\r\nshall be a compact and efficient body designed to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  ASEAN.  The  Secretariat  will  have  a\r\n\r\nSecretary-General whose rank will be equivalent to that\r\n\r\nof an Ambas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsador; three Bureau Directors responsible for economic,\r\n\r\nscience  and  technology, social and cultural  matters,\r\n\r\nwill  assist the Secretary-General. The other staff  of\r\n\r\nthe proposed Secretariat consist of a Foreign Trade and\r\n\r\nEconomic  Relations Officer, an Administrative Officer,\r\n\r\na  Public  Information Officer,  two  Auditors  and  an\r\n\r\nAssistant  to the Secretary-General. Serving Government\r\n\r\nofficials  in the ASEAN countries will be  selected  to\r\n\r\nfill   the  various  posts  in  the  proposed   central\r\n\r\nSecretariat. It is hoped that this Secretariat may come\r\n\r\ninto being some time this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Sembawang - the provision\r\n\r\nof  $2 million has been entered under subhead BAA  4001\r\n\r\nfor staff and expenses for established missions abroad.\r\n\r\nThe  creation of new posts of Ambassadors as  and  when\r\n\r\nthe  need  arises  will be made  by  the  issue  of  an\r\n\r\nEstablishment Warrant. This is necessary because, until\r\n\r\na  firm  decision has been reached to establish  a  new\r\n\r\nmission, it will be pointless to provide for more posts\r\n\r\nof Ambassadors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major difficulties in setting up missions\r\n\r\nabroad is to find persons of calibre and experience  to\r\n\r\nfill  Head  of  Mission  appointments.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $2 million is adequate  for  any  urgent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  that  might  be  required  in  setting  up\r\n\r\nmissions before recourse has to be made to the Treasury\r\n\r\nfor additional funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is interested in West Asia.\r\n\r\nThe  Government recognises the position West  Asia  now\r\n\r\nholds  internationally, and the Ministry will therefore\r\n\r\nspare no effort in, creating goodwill between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  West Asia and will actively encourage official and\r\n\r\nprivate  visits  to  West Asia to seek  more  areas  of\r\n\r\ncooperation  with the countries there. If manpower  and\r\n\r\nfinance  permit,  it  is  the  intention  to  establish\r\n\r\ndiplomatic missions in two or three countries  of  West\r\n\r\nAsia  and  to  complement residential home-based  staff\r\n\r\nwith a system of Consuls or Honorary Consuls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has a point. Under\r\n\r\nArticle  55 (1) of the Singapore Constitution, a  child\r\n\r\nof a member of our foreign office staff born abroad and\r\n\r\nregistered  at  a  consulate or  embassy  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecomes a Singapore citizen by descent. However,  I  am\r\n\r\naware that foreign service officers, who are parents of\r\n\r\nchildren   born  abroad  and  by  registration   become\r\n\r\ncitizens by descent, are disturbed by this. The  reason\r\n\r\nis  that, under the provisions of Article 55 (2) of the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  a  minor  who  becomes  a   citizen   of\r\n\r\nSingapore by descent may lose his citizenship status if\r\n\r\nhe  does  not take the oath of renunciation, allegiance\r\n\r\nand  loyalty  in the prescribed manner and  within  the\r\n\r\nstipulated  period,  which is within  12  months  after\r\n\r\nreaching  the  age of 21 years. These officers  rightly\r\n\r\nfeel  that  since  they are required by  Government  to\r\n\r\nserve  abroad,  their children born  outside  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  enjoy  the  same  citizenship  status  as   the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  home  civil  service  officers  born   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider this to be a proper matter for the Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned to look into with a view to finding out  ways\r\n\r\nand  means  whereby foreign service officers'  children\r\n\r\nborn  outside  Singapore could, by  registration  at  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  consulate  or embassy,  become  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore by birth rather than by descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe deteriorating situation in Vietnam and Cambodia and\r\n\r\nthe absence of US forces in the region, particularly in\r\n\r\nSouth-east  Asia, and the very recent  announcement  by\r\n\r\nthe  new  Thailand  Prime Minister-designate  that  the\r\n\r\n25,000  US  troops  will have to  be  pulled  out  from\r\n\r\nThailand - all these appear to me to cause a threat  to\r\n\r\nthe  security of the countries in South-east  Asia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  -  would  the Acting  Minister  for  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs inform this House what alternative arrangements\r\n\r\nwill  be  made to fill the vacuum, and is any  military\r\n\r\narrangement being considered by ASEAN to safeguard  the\r\n\r\nsecurity   and  political  stability  of  its   member-countries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, whether American troops withdraw from\r\n\r\nThailand  or  not  is  a  matter  for  the  Thais   and\r\n\r\nAmericans. As for the conflict in Indo-China, it is  an\r\n\r\ninternal  matter for the people of these  countries  to\r\n\r\ndecide.  We  are  witnessing a civil  war  between  two\r\n\r\nparties.  In dealing with each country, our  Government\r\n\r\nhas  consistently  adopted a policy of non-interference\r\n\r\nand  has  recognised  the government  in  situ  as  the\r\n\r\ngovernment in power, irrespective of its ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view the security of Southeast Asia is best\r\n\r\nensured  by  the existence of a multi-polar balance  of\r\n\r\npower. The presence of a number of powers including the\r\n\r\nmajor  powers  will enable Singapore to  safeguard  its\r\n\r\nsovereignty  and  independence  since  the  choice   of\r\n\r\nalignment  with individual states on particular  issues\r\n\r\nwould  depend on the merits of each case. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  single power hegemony may mean that our  freedom\r\n\r\nof  action  could  be  limited by  the  need  to  avoid\r\n\r\nantagonising the dominant power even when our interests\r\n\r\nare adversely affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for ASEAN, there are no multilateral military\r\n\r\narrangements being considered by the member  countries.\r\n\r\nEach  country maintains its own defence forces. ASEAN's\r\n\r\nmost  useful  role would be to serve as a catalyst  for\r\n\r\nregional  economic integration and assist in  fostering\r\n\r\ncloser links between Southeast Asian leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This is a good sign. What have we done\r\n\r\nso  far  in furthering or improving our relations  with\r\n\r\nthe Middle East countries? The Middle East counries are\r\n\r\nnow  playing  a  very crucial part in world  trade  and\r\n\r\nworld  politics.  It  is high time that  Singapore  too\r\n\r\nplayed  an  important part in bettering trade relations\r\n\r\nand  diplomatic relations with the various Middle  East\r\n\r\ncountries. We do stand to benefit a very great deal  by\r\n\r\nestablishing a close relationship with these countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every year a few ASEAN training awards are given\r\n\r\nand  a  few  of  our local personnel have been  trained\r\n\r\noverseas.

In   the\r\n\r\nmeanwhile, I will do my best to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, this is the first visit by a Singapore\r\n\r\nMinister to China. It has provided a useful opportunity\r\n\r\nfor an exchange of views on international,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregional and bilateral matters. This visit has  enabled\r\n\r\nthe Minister to engage in face-to-face discussions with\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Chinese Government and they  must  have\r\n\r\nobtained a clearer understanding of Singapore.  Another\r\n\r\nbeneficial  aspect of the visit is that it has  enabled\r\n\r\nthe  two  sides to discuss ways and means of  expanding\r\n\r\ntrade with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has stated on several occasions that we\r\n\r\nrecognise  the People's Republic of China. However,  we\r\n\r\nshall  wait  for  our closest neighbours  to  establish\r\n\r\ndiplomatic relations before doing so. In the meanwhile,\r\n\r\nexchanges of visits and every other form of cooperation\r\n\r\nwill  be  explored.  We  have,  in  fact,  had  several\r\n\r\nexchanges of sports teams since Singapore responded  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the Afro-Asian Table Tennis  Tournament\r\n\r\nin  1971. The Chinese badminton team has been here, and\r\n\r\nso  has  their  soccer team. Sixteen  delegations  from\r\n\r\nprofessional  and business organisations  have  visited\r\n\r\nChina  since  1971 and there will be more  such  visits\r\n\r\nthis  year. Extensive trade ties exist with  China.  In\r\n\r\nfact, China is our 12th largest trading partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for improving relations with West Asian countries,\r\n\r\nI  have  nothing further to add to what 1 have said  in\r\n\r\nreply to the Member for Sembawang.

But  perhaps  I\r\n\r\nshould  repeat that the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia,\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore met in Singapore in February  to\r\n\r\nconsider and agree upon measures to enhance the  safety\r\n\r\nof  navigation in the Straits of Malacca and  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  particular reference to the safe passage of  Very\r\n\r\nLarge  Crude  Carriers.  The meeting  did  not  discuss\r\n\r\nmatters  pertaining to the status of the  Straits,  the\r\n\r\nthree countries agreeing that the proper forum for this\r\n\r\nquestion  is  the  Law of the Sea  Conference,  now  in\r\n\r\nprogress at Geneva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the meeting, a Traffic Separation\r\n\r\nScheme  for  the Straits is expected to be implemented.\r\n\r\nExperts of the three countries are studying the details\r\n\r\ninvolved.  Essentially, the Scheme  demarcates  certain\r\n\r\nareas  in the Straits for vessels in passage, with  the\r\n\r\nobjective   of   avoiding  collisions.   It   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented in such a manner as to minimise  disruption\r\n\r\nto  traffic  through the Straits; the  whole  objective\r\n\r\nbeing  the avoidance or minimization of collisions  and\r\n\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been recognised that owing to the depth of the\r\n\r\nStraits  and other topographical factors,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nlimit  to the physical capacity of the Straits to carry\r\n\r\nvery large vessels exceeding a certain draught. A group\r\n\r\nof  technical experts from the three countries has been\r\n\r\nformed  to study the limitations that should be imposed\r\n\r\non  these vessels and to submit recommendations to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, could I ask the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs to answer the question on ASEAN awards?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  the  Member  for  Punggol  also  has   an\r\n\r\namendment (The amendment standing in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting\r\n\r\nreads as follows:(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of Head AAA 4001.)  on the same subject.

If  the answer is yes, may we know where  they\r\n\r\nare going to be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the answer is that as Singapore is  a\r\n\r\nsmall   country   with   relatively   small   financial\r\n\r\nresources, care has to be taken to ensure that there is\r\n\r\nfull  utilisation  not  only of manpower  but  also  of\r\n\r\npublic  funds.  It has been the policy necessarily  for\r\n\r\nour  missions  to  have  a small staff,  unlike  larger\r\n\r\nnations  with  different  budget  priorities  who   are\r\n\r\nwilling  to  have  a large set-up.  Every  one  of  our\r\n\r\noverseas  officers is expected to pull his  weight  and\r\n\r\nwork hard as with his counterparts in the civil service\r\n\r\nin Singapore. Thus, while it is generally true that the\r\n\r\nstaff  in  our  missions work hard, it  would  only  be\r\n\r\nduring  periods of intense activity when  they  may  be\r\n\r\nconsidered to be overworked, and this is also the  case\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the staffing position is good, as\r\n\r\nestablished  posts are filled even if this  is  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of Headquarters. There is a constant review  of\r\n\r\nwork  of  individual  missions  and  the  staffing   is\r\n\r\nincreased   where  demand  and  priorities  make   this\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Foreign Service Scheme\r\n\r\nproper  with  effect from 1st June, 1972, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas   been  actively  recruiting  its  own  staff   and\r\n\r\nreturning seconded officers who had not opted  to  join\r\n\r\nthe  Foreign Service back to their parent services.  In\r\n\r\nDivision I, because of high standards and requirements,\r\n\r\nrecruitment  levels  have not  caught  up  with  annual\r\n\r\nexpansion and the number of officers returning to their\r\n\r\nparent  services.  In Division II,  the  percentage  of\r\n\r\nvacancies  is  less and recruitment is done  mainly  to\r\n\r\nmeet annual expansion. Divisions III and IV continue to\r\n\r\nbe  drawn from the home civil service as these are  not\r\n\r\ncareer grades in the Foreign Service. Therefore, it can\r\n\r\nbe  generally  said that the majority of  our  overseas\r\n\r\nmissions  are  not understaffed although  they  may  be\r\n\r\nworking extra hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the opening of new embassies, I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier  that  we intend to open two or three  in  West\r\n\r\nAsia and there might be one or two more elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Fifty-six of  the  training\r\n\r\nawards offered by Singapore were taken up by the  other\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries. However, I am pleased to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  as  we increase the number  of  offers  of\r\n\r\ntraining the response has also been better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that by considerably in-creasing the number of\r\n\r\nawards  and  by  giving more notice of the  awards  and\r\n\r\ngreater publicity to the offers, we may achieve  better\r\n\r\nresults.  For the financial year 1975-76,  we  will  be\r\n\r\noffering  more than 100 training awards in 36  courses,\r\n\r\nand  again  not  duplicating  the  fields  of  training\r\n\r\noffered  by Singapore under the Colombo Plan so  as  to\r\n\r\nmake available a wider choice of courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, the courses we are offering under\r\n\r\nSingapore's  ASEAN Training Awards Scheme  for  1975-76\r\n\r\ncover  many  subjects  such as  public  health,  public\r\n\r\nutilities,   engineering,  industrial  training,   port\r\n\r\nmanagement and laboratory techniques. These are  fields\r\n\r\nwhich   Singapore   can  be  said  to   have   acquired\r\n\r\nconsiderable  experience and expertise and  which  will\r\n\r\nserve to complement the efforts of our ASEAN neighbours\r\n\r\nin these fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also increased the attractiveness of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  ASEAN Training Awards Scheme  by  granting\r\n\r\nthe  participants a living allowance ranging from S$400\r\n\r\nto  S$500  a month depending on the type and  level  of\r\n\r\ntraining.  Where fees are payable or books or equipment\r\n\r\nrequired,  these  will  be provided  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment. Medical and dental facilities in accordance\r\n\r\nwith current regulations will also be made available to\r\n\r\nthe trainees, if required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the answer given by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment, standing in the name of Mr Ng\r\n\r\nKah Ting, was not proceeded with:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the total sum to be allocated for Head M in\r\n\r\nrespect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $25,566,470 for Head M ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1003 (The  same  amendment also stood in  the  names  of Messrs P.

In the Addendum on the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour, it is stated that the Ministry will\r\n\r\namend the Employment Act to allow young persons between\r\n\r\n14   and   16  years  of  age  to  work  in  industrial\r\n\r\nestablishments  without  the  prior  approval  of   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour. That means they will  be  free\r\n\r\nto    be   employed   in   commercial   or   industrial\r\n\r\nestablishments. This is a good proposal and will enable\r\n\r\nyoung persons to take on some light jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past few years, we find that more and more\r\n\r\nyouths  are roaming about in the streets. It is  mainly\r\n\r\nbecause  they  cannot pass the Primary  School  Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination and therefore cannot be promoted to  higher\r\n\r\nclasses.  These  youngsters  are  not  willing  to   be\r\n\r\napprenticed in factories. So they while away their time\r\n\r\nin  the streets doing nothing. This situation has given\r\n\r\ncause for concern to the parents and has also created a\r\n\r\nkind of social burden to our society. If this situation\r\n\r\nis  not  remedied  by certain corrective  measures  and\r\n\r\nallowed  to deteriorate, then in the end the number  of\r\n\r\ndelinquent   crimes  will  increase.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nproposed amendment to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Employment Act by the Ministry of Labour will, I am\r\n\r\nsure, meet with the general approval of the parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of young persons to enable them to\r\n\r\nacquire  a  skill  instead  of  roaming  about  in  the\r\n\r\nstreets,  so that they can make a contribution  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic development of our country, is something  that\r\n\r\nis  very  good because it will also help them in  their\r\n\r\nfuture  life. But these youngsters are still of  tender\r\n\r\nage  and their physique is not strong enough for  heavy\r\n\r\nlabour.   So   the  department  concerned  should   pay\r\n\r\nattention  to  this. I would like to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  what  kind of measures the  department  will\r\n\r\ntake  in  order  to  safeguard the interests  of  these\r\n\r\nyoungsters,  and  what  are the plans  to  train  these\r\n\r\nyoungsters   after  which  they  can  be  employed   in\r\n\r\nfactories  or commercial establishments so  that  their\r\n\r\nwelfare may be looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

At a time when foreign countries are facing\r\n\r\nperiods of recession and economic depression, I do  not\r\n\r\nsee  any  reason why we should encourage foreigners  to\r\n\r\ntake the jobs of our local citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present regulation requiring non-citizens earning\r\n\r\nless  than $750 to apply for work permits is inadequate\r\n\r\nand  totally  out  of  proportion  to  present  working\r\n\r\nconditions.  I feel that all non-citizens, irrespective\r\n\r\nof  the  quantum of salary should be issued  with  work\r\n\r\npermits,  as is being done in most countries.  $750  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  great amount or a proper gauge to draw  a  line\r\n\r\nbetween  those  persons who require  work  permits  and\r\n\r\nthose who do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a wise move to encourage the young to go to\r\n\r\nwork.  This  move will reduce the number of delinquents\r\n\r\nroaming  the streets aimlessly. In fact, if  this  move\r\n\r\nhad been carried out earlier we would not be faced with\r\n\r\nso  many  problems of delinquency as we are  facing  at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the daily-rated workers who have been playing a\r\n\r\nvery  important part in our development  schemes  since\r\n\r\nthe  late 40's appear to be dissatisfied with the  quan\r\n\r\ntum  of payment due on their retirement. It is a  known\r\n\r\nfact  that  when  they  retire, they  will  be  paid  a\r\n\r\ngratuity  of  20  days' pay for each  year  of  service\r\n\r\nrendered.  This was the agreement reached in  the  late\r\n\r\n40's and there has been no change since then. With  the\r\n\r\npresent  standard of living, surely this mere 20  days'\r\n\r\npay for each year of service rendered is too little for\r\n\r\nthe  many years of loyal service they have rendered.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that the Minister review this quantum  of\r\n\r\npayment and pay these poor workers a reasonable sum  in\r\n\r\norder  that they can survive after their retirement.  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  mention this because I have received numerous\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from daily-rated workers who  have  retired\r\n\r\nand  have  found life very difficult.  So  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent\r\n\r\nCommittee on Crime and Delinquency has found  that  the\r\n\r\nrequirement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  which  young  persons seeking  employment  in\r\n\r\nindustry must obtain certificates of registration  from\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner  for Labour has  contributed  to  the\r\n\r\ndelinquency of young school dropouts. In the  light  of\r\n\r\nthis, the Committee has recommended that the Employment\r\n\r\nAct be amended to allow children between the ages of 14\r\n\r\nand  16  to  seek employment in industrial undertakings\r\n\r\nwithout  having to obtain the approval  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry.    The    Government   has   accepted    this\r\n\r\nrecommendation  and my Ministry is consequently  taking\r\n\r\naction  to  amend  the Employment Act  to  allow  those\r\n\r\nbetween  the  ages of 14 and 16 to work  in  industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings  without  having  to  obtain   the   prior\r\n\r\napproval of the Commissioner for Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee believes that this measure will reduce\r\n\r\ndelinquency among the young and afford opportunity  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  gain  industrial training which  will  better\r\n\r\nequip  them for gainful employment at a later stage.  I\r\n\r\nnote  that  the Member for Sembawang also  shares  this\r\n\r\nview.  As he may be aware, the Ministry of Labour  will\r\n\r\nin  addition be amending the Employment Act in order to\r\n\r\nallow children between the ages of 12 and 14 to work in\r\n\r\nindustrial  undertakings if they are  engaged  to  work\r\n\r\nunder  approved apprenticeship schemes. This  amendment\r\n\r\nis  being  made  to enable children who are  unable  to\r\n\r\npursue  academic  education to take  up  apprenticeship\r\n\r\nemployment,  and  thus prevent them from  falling  into\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure the Member that the Ministry will not\r\n\r\nlose  sight  of  the need to ensure  that  the  safety,\r\n\r\nhealth   and   welfare  of  these  young  workers   are\r\n\r\nadequately  protected, when eliminating the requirement\r\n\r\nfor  young  persons  to  obtain  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner   for   Labour  to  work   in   industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings.  The  existing  provisions  relating   to\r\n\r\nsafety,  health  and  welfare  of  the  employment   of\r\n\r\nchildren and young persons as presently embodied in the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act  will  be consolidated  and  re-enacted\r\n\r\nunder the new regulations relating to the employment of\r\n\r\nchildren  and young persons, which will be  made  under\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that employers comply, provisions will be\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  regulations for heavy  penalties  to  be\r\n\r\nimposed  on  employers  employing  children  and  young\r\n\r\npersons  contrary to the provisions of the regulations.\r\n\r\nIt  is not practical for the Ministry of Labour to  run\r\n\r\nany  scheme of practical training for any young persons\r\n\r\nprior   to   allowing  them  to  work   in   industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings.  Nor has it the resources,  manpower  and\r\n\r\nexpertise   to  undertake  such  massive   and   varied\r\n\r\ntraining.  Rather, the prospective employer  should  in\r\n\r\nhis  own  interest  introduce such a  practical  scheme\r\n\r\nrelevant  to his own industrial undertaking.  I  would,\r\n\r\nhowever,  like  to  point out that children  and  young\r\n\r\npersons  can  avail themselves of the various  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes and apprenticeship scheme presently  run  by\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Training  Board  and  other  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies   before  taking  up  employment  in  industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has expressed concern over\r\n\r\nforeigners  taking  on jobs in the  Republic  which  he\r\n\r\nfeels  should  be offered to our citizens.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nassure  him  that work permit policies  are  formulated\r\n\r\nwith  the interests of our citizens in mind and  taking\r\n\r\ninto  consideration  the manpower requirements  of  our\r\n\r\nindustries.  The Ministry will continue to  issue  work\r\n\r\npermits  to  skilled  workers,  especially  for   those\r\n\r\nindustries  in  which the local supply is insufficient.\r\n\r\nAs for the semi-skilled or unskilled jobs, work permits\r\n\r\nwill  only be granted if the Ministry is satisfied that\r\n\r\nthese  are  jobs which Singaporeans themselves  do  not\r\n\r\nwant or if they are unavailable. The Member may wish to\r\n\r\nknow  that  foreign  workers constitute  only  a  small\r\n\r\nproportion of the Republic's total labour force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to further reduce our reliance on foreign\r\n\r\nlabour, it is necessary for us to attract more capital-intensive  and  higher  technology  industries  and  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  sufficient local skills to meet  the  manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements of industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, the Industrial Training Board  has\r\n\r\nstepped  up  its  technical courses and  apprenticeship\r\n\r\ntraining scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also feels that the salary limit of $750\r\n\r\nper month, by which non-citizens have to apply for work\r\n\r\npermits, is inadequate and out of proportion to present\r\n\r\nday working conditions. I do not think this ceiling  of\r\n\r\n$750 has been overtaken by events, as it cannot be said\r\n\r\nthat  wages  for  the unskilled and  semi-skilled  have\r\n\r\ngenerally gone beyond this figure. According to Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund statistics, about 86% of about  622,000\r\n\r\nemployed  persons  at the end of December,  1974,  earn\r\n\r\nless  than  $750 per month, inclusive of  overtime  and\r\n\r\nother  allowances.  The ceiling of  $750  is  therefore\r\n\r\nstill  adequate  for  the  purpose  of  regulating  the\r\n\r\nemployment of non-citizen workers for the unskilled and\r\n\r\nsemiskilled categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the reviewing of the quantum of gratuity for\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  workers, I take it  that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson is referring to daily-rated workers in the public\r\n\r\nsector.  These  public  daily-rated  workers  are  well\r\n\r\nrepresented by trade unions which are affiliated to the\r\n\r\nNTUC.  Therefore, any proposed revision of the gratuity\r\n\r\nscheme   should  be  taken  up  with  the   appropriate\r\n\r\nauthority  by the respective unions through the  normal\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has given a detailed reply, and I am\r\n\r\nvery satisfied with it.

According to the\r\n\r\nLabour Force Survey of Singapore 1974 there is a  total\r\n\r\nof  about  42,500 persons employed in the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry alone, of whom some 34,800 or nearly 83%  earn\r\n\r\nunder  $399 per month. There is also a large number  of\r\n\r\ncontract   workers  in  the  shipbuilding   and   ship-repairing,  transport  and  other  industries.  In  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  any  statistical  information,  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  contract  workers  in  all  industries   in\r\n\r\nSingapore is not exactly known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract workers, by the nature of their work, are\r\n\r\ntermed casual or temporary workers because of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat their job is either insecure or seasonal. They are\r\n\r\nfurther  not employed by the principal contractors  but\r\n\r\nby  sub-contractors, or even sub-sub-contractors.  They\r\n\r\nwork  in  the  open - particularly in the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  -  and  are victims of the  vagaries  of  the\r\n\r\nweather. When it rains, for instance, they cannot  work\r\n\r\nwhich means that they are not paid for the period  they\r\n\r\nare  unable  to  work, because of circumstances  beyond\r\n\r\ntheir control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, they work extremely long hours and are not\r\n\r\npaid overtime rates, nor do they enjoy such benefits as\r\n\r\nholidays,  rest days and annual leave. And  above  all,\r\n\r\nwhilst   other  workers  enjoy  the  benefits  of   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions,  the contract workers  are  denied  this\r\n\r\nbenefit. Why should these workers be left high and  dry\r\n\r\nin their old age? And why should the contractors escape\r\n\r\nfrom   the  liability,  as  other  employers   do,   to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  CPF? There is no  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nactual  earnings of these workers for the  period  they\r\n\r\nhave   worked  should  not  form  the  basis   of   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   If  it  is  argued  that   there   are\r\n\r\nadministrative    difficulties    and    problems    in\r\n\r\nimplementing a system to ensure this, such an  argument\r\n\r\nis,  in my view, untenable. Surely it is not beyond our\r\n\r\ningenuity or the capacity of the Ministry of Labour  to\r\n\r\ndevise a scheme for the registration of all contractors\r\n\r\nand  contract  workers  and  to  ensure  that  contract\r\n\r\nworkers are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupplied from a registered pool of workers. This  would\r\n\r\nfacilitate   keeping  track  of  the  distribution   of\r\n\r\ncontract  workers by employers, their wages  and  their\r\n\r\nearnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise, Sir, that contract workers comprise\r\n\r\na  significantly  large group of our workers  and  that\r\n\r\nthey,   through  hard  and  gruelling  work  in  trying\r\n\r\ncircumstances, contribute so much to the development of\r\n\r\nSingapore, evidence of which can be so clearly seen  in\r\n\r\nthe modern, high-rise buildings all over Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in addition, some labour contractors, who\r\n\r\nhave on their rolls, large work forces, who have worked\r\n\r\nfor them continuously for long periods of two, three or\r\n\r\nmore  years. And yet they are called temporary  workers\r\n\r\nand  denied the opportunities to join trade unions  and\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  various benefits prescribed in  our  labour\r\n\r\nlaws.  And the contractors concerned get away scot-free\r\n\r\nfrom their obligations. I am somewhat surprised at  the\r\n\r\nsilence of the Ministry of Labour in dealing with  such\r\n\r\nlabour contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, heartening to note that the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry is reorganising its conciliation machinery  by\r\n\r\nsetting  up an Industrial Relations Division to provide\r\n\r\nconciliation  services as well as preventive  mediation\r\n\r\nto  eliminate areas of industrial friction.  Preventive\r\n\r\nmediation  is the corner-stone of industrial relations.\r\n\r\nThis  was  recognised in the past, but in the last  few\r\n\r\nyears  the  Labour Ministry has not given due attention\r\n\r\nto  this  area. Far too often the emphasis has been  on\r\n\r\nthe letter of the law. I am not suggesting that the law\r\n\r\nshould  not be observed. There should not, however,  by\r\n\r\nany  insistence  that  the legal procedures  should  be\r\n\r\nfollowed  when  immediate and urgent action  should  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  prevent  a  dispute  from  blowing  up  into\r\n\r\nsomething  serious.  The NTUC and its  affiliates  have\r\n\r\nalways   recognised   the  importance   of   preventive\r\n\r\nmediation  for industrial peace and stability  and  we,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  welcome  the Ministry's  policies  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of CPF contributions, I would like to\r\n\r\nmake  further observations. The Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nAct  has  been  in existence for a long time,  and  the\r\n\r\ncontributors to the Fund have always been  workers  and\r\n\r\ntheir employers. The time has now come to consider  the\r\n\r\nenlargement of the scope of the Fund which has become a\r\n\r\nmajor  source of savings. The savings generated by  the\r\n\r\nscheme have both economic and social connotations which\r\n\r\nhave  brought benefits to all classes of people in  our\r\n\r\nsociety and not only the workers. This being so,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  why certain privileged classes of our people,\r\n\r\nsuch as those who derive income from a trade, business,\r\n\r\nprofession  or  vocation, should not  contribute  their\r\n\r\nshare in boosting national savings from which they  are\r\n\r\nall  already  accruing benefits. The Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Act  provides  powers to  the  Minister  to  make\r\n\r\nregulations  in  this  regard  and  I  would  ask  that\r\n\r\nconsideration    be   given   for   introducing    such\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, members of the CPF are allowed\r\n\r\npermission  to  make use of their contribution  to  buy\r\n\r\nHousing Board fiats. This scheme was implemented  about\r\n\r\ntwo years ago. However, such members are not allowed to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  their contribution to  purchase  private\r\n\r\nhousing   units.   Generally  speaking,   this   scheme\r\n\r\ngenerally  benefits the CPF members by permitting  them\r\n\r\nto make use in advance of whatever savings they have in\r\n\r\nthe CPF to buy Housing Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I wish to air certain views. Members\r\n\r\nof  the CPF have deposits in the CPF belonging to  them\r\n\r\nin  the  same  way that we have deposits in  the  bank.\r\n\r\nWhatever  deposits have been credited in the bank,  the\r\n\r\ndepositors are at liberty to make use of whatever money\r\n\r\nthey have in the bank. But in the case of contributions\r\n\r\nin  the CPF, although the money belongs to the members,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has imposed certain restrictions on the\r\n\r\nuse of these contributions. One restriction which has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  lifted  is in respect of purchase of Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board flats. But they are not  allowed  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  these contributions, which are  actually\r\n\r\ntheir  money, to buy private housing units.  There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a  certain  amount of discrimination.  Some\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the CPF may not like to buy HDB  flats  as\r\n\r\nthey  prefer  to  buy private houses in  localities  of\r\n\r\ntheir own choice. Therefore, I think members of the CPF\r\n\r\nshould be given the liberty to exercise their right  on\r\n\r\nhow  to  use their money in the purchase of  houses.  I\r\n\r\nwould ask the Minister to consider giving permission to\r\n\r\nmembers of the CPF to buy private houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, the hon. Member for Boon  Teck  has\r\n\r\nurged  the  Ministry to ensure that in the re-organised\r\n\r\nset-up of the Industrial Relations Division, preventive\r\n\r\nmediation  should play an effective role in  preventing\r\n\r\ntrade disputes. I would like to assure him that this is\r\n\r\nwhat  we  intend  to  do. Emphasis will  be  placed  on\r\n\r\npreventive   rather   than   conciliation   work.   The\r\n\r\nPreventive  Mediation Section will seek to diffuse  and\r\n\r\neliminate nascent areas of friction between labour  and\r\n\r\nmanagement before they develop to the stage of dispute,\r\n\r\nwork stoppages or strikes. It will help both parties to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  continuing  good relationship  through  the\r\n\r\nelimination  of disruptive practices and the  evolution\r\n\r\nof sound in-plant policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, contract labour has been in\r\n\r\nexistence ever since immigrant labour was brought in on\r\n\r\na  large  scale  from China and India in  the  mid-19th\r\n\r\ncentury. The development and growth of Singapore to its\r\n\r\npresent   eminence  as  the  most  developed   of   the\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries in Asia with the highest  GNP  per\r\n\r\ncapita outside Japan and the fourth largest port in the\r\n\r\nworld  owe  in  no  small measure  upon  the  backs  of\r\n\r\ncontract   labour.  Our  industrialisation   programme,\r\n\r\npublic  housing  and school building programmes,  would\r\n\r\nnot  have  been so successful had it not been  for  the\r\n\r\nvaluable contribution of contract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlabour.  Because  of the relatively high  productivity,\r\n\r\nmobility  and  flexibility, contract  labour  has  been\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  invaluable especially  in  such  labour-intensive  industries as the building construction  and\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  and  ship, repairing  industries   where\r\n\r\nvolume of work is subject to severe fluctuation thereby\r\n\r\nmaking  the  maintenance of a large standing  permanent\r\n\r\nwork force uneconomic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the system of contract labour can be\r\n\r\nabolished at our present stage of economic development.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I notice that more and more public works  are\r\n\r\nlet  out on contract. The question is: are our contract\r\n\r\nworkers  being  ruthlessly exploited today  as  in  the\r\n\r\nfifties or the early sixties? I do not deny that  there\r\n\r\nmay  have  been  certain instances of  exploitation  of\r\n\r\nthese  contract workers by some unscrupulous employers.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  suggest  that in  a  tight  labour  market\r\n\r\nsituation, the recent retrenchment notwithstanding,  it\r\n\r\nis  not possible for an employer to continue exploiting\r\n\r\nhis  workers  ruthlessly and in-humanly without  losing\r\n\r\nhis  workers  to another. True, some contract  workers,\r\n\r\nbecause of the casual nature of their job, may  not  be\r\n\r\nenjoying  certain benefits such as CPF, paid  holidays,\r\n\r\npaid  annual  leave, paid sick leave, etc. However,  it\r\n\r\nmust  also  be admitted that this takes place sometimes\r\n\r\nwith mutual consent between employer and employee.  The\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund Act lays down  explicitly  the\r\n\r\nliabilities   of  employers  and  the  entitlement   of\r\n\r\nemployees.  The contract worker, if he  wants  to,  can\r\n\r\nalways  complain to the Ministry of non-payment of  CPF\r\n\r\nby his employer. Very often he does not because he is a\r\n\r\nparty to this non-payment, preferring to have more take-home  pay  than  save  for his old age.  Similarly,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of paid holidays, annual leave and  paid  sick\r\n\r\nleave  which  are provided in the Employment  Act,  the\r\n\r\ncontract worker can always seek redress from the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry. The fact that this is not done is because  of\r\n\r\nthe  relatively higher pay for contract workers and the\r\n\r\nrelative  freedom of working as and when  they  please.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, does not mean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the Labour Ministry will not intervene on the side\r\n\r\nof  the  contract worker especially if he is unskilled,\r\n\r\nold and immobile and thereby being heavily exploited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last analysis, the consciousness of the workers\r\n\r\nof  his  rights and responsibilities is crucial in  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  against exploitation, and the best  safeguard\r\n\r\nagainst ruthless exploitation lies in trade unionism. I\r\n\r\ntherefore urge the unions in the NTUC to carry out more\r\n\r\nvigorously  its  task  of  educating  the  workers   in\r\n\r\ngeneral,   to  heighten  their  political  and   social\r\n\r\nconsciousness and to recruit them into their  fold  for\r\n\r\nthe well-being of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Central Provident Fund was set\r\n\r\nup  to  provide workers with benefits in their old  age\r\n\r\nthrough the accumulation of compulsory savings based on\r\n\r\na  percentage of their wages. For obvious reasons,  the\r\n\r\nself-employed workers and professionals have  not  been\r\n\r\nbrought within the CPF scheme. Firstly, it is difficult\r\n\r\nto  ascertain  the monthly income of the  self-employed\r\n\r\nworker.  Secondly, the need for compulsory savings  for\r\n\r\nold  age  does  not arise in the case of, for  example,\r\n\r\nself-employed  professionals who  by  virtue  of  their\r\n\r\nrelatively  higher income and education can  well  look\r\n\r\nafter  themselves.  There  may  be  a  number  of  non-employees who require old age benefits, but due to  the\r\n\r\nnature   of  their  undertaking  in  terms  of  earning\r\n\r\ncapacity  insistence on contributions  can  reduce  the\r\n\r\nviability   of   their  ventures,  even   though   such\r\n\r\ncontributions will be to their long term benefit. It is\r\n\r\ntherefore  not  proposed  at  present  to  bring  self-employed workers and professionals within the ambit  of\r\n\r\nthe CPF Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained just now, the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund was established to provide compulsory savings  for\r\n\r\nworkers   for  their  old  age  or  when  they   become\r\n\r\npermanently  disabled. It would  be  inconsistent  with\r\n\r\nthis  objective if members are permitted to  use  their\r\n\r\ncredit in the fund as ready sources of finance for  any\r\n\r\nother purpose, such as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacquiring properties for investment or speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, two exceptions have been made in respect of\r\n\r\nflats  built by the Government under its public housing\r\n\r\nprogramme. Members with family incomes up to $1,500 per\r\n\r\nmonth  have  been  using their  CPF  credit  under  the\r\n\r\napproved housing scheme to acquire flats constructed by\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and Development Board or the Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation, while those with family incomes of  up  to\r\n\r\n$4,000 per month will be able to utilise part of  their\r\n\r\ncredit  to  acquire middle-income fiats  built  by  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Urban Development Co. (Pte) Ltd.  In  both\r\n\r\nthese  instances,  the flats must be  occupied  by  the\r\n\r\nmembers  and their families. The construction of  these\r\n\r\nproperties  is  not  oriented  towards  profit   on   a\r\n\r\ncommercial basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are provisions in both schemes for\r\n\r\nthe restoration of the members' CPF accounts should the\r\n\r\nownership  of  the property be changed  so  that  their\r\n\r\nprotection  against old age or permanent disability  is\r\n\r\nstill valid. These two housing schemes go a long way to\r\n\r\nassist  the  great majority in acquiring  property  for\r\n\r\nowner-occupation.  The  Ministry,  therefore,  has   no\r\n\r\nintention  of allowing the use of CPF for the  purchase\r\n\r\nof private houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the satisfactory\r\n\r\nreply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ammendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead ACA 1111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two questions under this\r\n\r\namendment.   The   first  question   relates   to   the\r\n\r\nregistration of applications for work permits.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  many  complaints from various quarters  about\r\n\r\nthe difficulties people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencounter  in  the  application for work  permits.  The\r\n\r\npeople  who  apply  for work permits  include  barbers,\r\n\r\nclerks, shop assistants, drivers, waiters or waitresses\r\n\r\nin  restaurants  and  other  catering  services.  As  I\r\n\r\nunderstand it, the difficulties encountered by  barbers\r\n\r\nhad  already  been considered by the Singapore  Barbers\r\n\r\nAssociation. The Association has requested the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  relax the regulations on the issue of work  permits\r\n\r\nin  view  of the shortage of barbers in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nyounger  barbers have already changed jobs.  They  have\r\n\r\nfound greener pastures elsewhere. The older barbers are\r\n\r\ndying  out.  So  it is necessary for  barber  shops  to\r\n\r\nrecruit barbers from outside Singapore, otherwise  they\r\n\r\nwill have to close shop in no time. Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nWork  Permits Office does not seem to have  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  difficulties encountered  by  the  barber\r\n\r\nshops.  I  would  like to appeal  to  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nsympathetically  consider  the  applications  for  work\r\n\r\npermits from barbers, so that barber shops in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be able to solve the present shortage of barbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of applications for marriage\r\n\r\nbetween  non-citizens  and citizens.  In  my  Meet-the-People  sessions,  I  receive many complaints  from  my\r\n\r\nconstituents  on  this  matter.  For  example,  a  male\r\n\r\ncitizen  came  to me one day and told me  that  he  had\r\n\r\napplied  for  permission to marry  a  non-citizen  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia, but  was  rejected on the  ground  that  his\r\n\r\nfiancee  had been holding a work permit for only  three\r\n\r\nyears.  This period is two years short of the  required\r\n\r\nperiod  stipulated by the Government.  I  attempted  to\r\n\r\npersuade  him  to  wait  for  two  more  years   before\r\n\r\nmarrying. I also told him that young people should  not\r\n\r\nmarry  too  early.  I advised him to  firmly  establish\r\n\r\nhimself  first before getting married. But  he  replied\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be impossible in his  particular  case\r\n\r\nbecause he was already 31 years old and his fiancee was\r\n\r\n26  years  old,  and that the parents of  both  parties\r\n\r\ndesired\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  to  marry  early.  He  also  said  he  was  quite\r\n\r\nestablished, earning quite a handsome income and  would\r\n\r\nbe  able  to raise a family. He told me also  that  his\r\n\r\nfiancee was prepared to return the work permit with the\r\n\r\nundertaking  that she would not apply for another  work\r\n\r\npermit.  It  was  on  this ground  that  he  asked  for\r\n\r\npermission  to marry. But my advice to him  was  to  no\r\n\r\navail. I would like to appeal to the Minister to  relax\r\n\r\nthe  restriction in special cases, or even  in  general\r\n\r\ncases, by reducing the five-year period to three years.\r\n\r\nIn  this way people in love will be able to get married\r\n\r\nearlier,  and  our  Minister will  be  a  very  popular\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, another similar case was\r\n\r\nbrought  to my attention. The same requirement  applies\r\n\r\nto  a  blue identity card holder, who is a non-citizen,\r\n\r\nwanting  to  marry a citizen. In this particular  case,\r\n\r\nalthough  the person i5 a non-citizen he is a permanent\r\n\r\nresident holding a blue identity card, and he is  still\r\n\r\nrequired to apply for permission. I wonder whether this\r\n\r\nrequirement is really necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have not filed\r\n\r\nan amendment on this subhead.

I feel that although some  barber  shops\r\n\r\nare able to employ male barbers, somehow they prefer to\r\n\r\nemploy  female barbers.

If  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang is referring to those shop assistants who are\r\n\r\nemployed  in  provision  shops  and  groceries,  it  is\r\n\r\nadmitted  that  traders may be facing  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nengaging and retaining them. The reasons are not far to\r\n\r\nseek.  It is a fact that shop assistants have  to  work\r\n\r\nlong hours and in poor working conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the present shortage of skilled manpower in our\r\n\r\nindustries and the emphasis on skill-intensive and high-technology  industries  in our  industrial  development\r\n\r\nstrategy,  it is of vital importance that the  manpower\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  our industries should  first  be  met.\r\n\r\nTowards this end the Government has been granting  work\r\n\r\npermits  liberally  to  workers seeking  employment  in\r\n\r\nfactories  and  other  industrial undertakings.  Hence,\r\n\r\nwhite-collar jobs and soft jobs in the service sectors,\r\n\r\nsuch   as   clerks,  shop  assistants,   salesmen   and\r\n\r\nsalesgirls are given low priority. It is expected  that\r\n\r\nthis position would remain for some time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the Work Permits Office has\r\n\r\ngranted  work permits, though in a limited  number,  to\r\n\r\nshop   assistants  and  other  white-collar   jobs   in\r\n\r\ndeserving cases. The Ministry is keeping a close  watch\r\n\r\nover the employment situation of shop assistants and if\r\n\r\nneed  be  the  Ministry  is  prepared  to  review   the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the employment of barbers, it is a fact\r\n\r\nthat  few Singaporeans are interested in taking up such\r\n\r\nemployment. The Member for Sembawang may wish  to  know\r\n\r\nthat  my  Ministry has not been unduly  restrictive  in\r\n\r\ngranting work permits to non-citizen barbers working in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  According to our records, there  are  about\r\n\r\n676  non-citizen barbers on work permit at the  end  of\r\n\r\nDecember  1974. However, to ensure that the  applicants\r\n\r\nhave at least the requisite skill in the occupation for\r\n\r\nwhich they have applied for, work permits are only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngranted  to  those barbers who have passed a  practical\r\n\r\ntest conducted by the Adult Education Board. Since  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this testing scheme in November  last\r\n\r\nyear,  a total of 92 applicants have been referred,  of\r\n\r\nwhich  to-date 81 have passed the test and subsequently\r\n\r\ngranted work permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang may perhaps recall that the\r\n\r\nprimary  objective of imposing the marriage restriction\r\n\r\nscheme  was  to discourage workers on work permit  from\r\n\r\nmarrying early before they are fully adjusted  to  life\r\n\r\nin  our  Republic. With effect from 1st July,  1973,  a\r\n\r\ncondition  was accordingly imposed requiring  all  work\r\n\r\npermit   holders,  having  less  than  five  years   of\r\n\r\ncontinuous employment in Singapore, to seek  the  prior\r\n\r\napproval  of the Commissioner for Employment before  he\r\n\r\nor  she marries a Singapore citizen. As this scheme has\r\n\r\nonly  been  implemented one and a half  years  ago,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  deems it a bit too premature at this juncture\r\n\r\nto  consider  reducing the five-year qualification  for\r\n\r\nsuch  cases. Perhaps I should take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that the five-year work permit requirement  is\r\n\r\nnot   the   end-all  criteria  for  approving  marriage\r\n\r\napplications. This requirement is waived in respect  of\r\n\r\nskilled work permit holders who are in possession of an\r\n\r\nacceptable diploma or degree or who have passed a skill\r\n\r\nevaluation  test  conducted by the industrial  Training\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These skilled work permit holders, in addition to\r\n\r\nhaving  their marriage applications approved, are  also\r\n\r\ngranted three-year work permits and will be immediately\r\n\r\neligible for permanent residence upon completion of two\r\n\r\nor  more  years  of  employment  in  the  Republic.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  those  who  have satisfied  the  residential\r\n\r\nqualification  of 10 years may be granted  citizenship.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  open  to  those  who  desire  their\r\n\r\nmarriage  to be approved without waiting for  the  full\r\n\r\nfive  years to make every effort to improve or  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  skills  so as to qualify for a waiving  of  this\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify further.

In\r\n\r\nJanuary  1960,  the  two  posts  were  amalgamated  and\r\n\r\nupgraded  to  HEO  (Seamen's Welfare).  This  post  was\r\n\r\nsubsequently transferred to the Ministry of  Labour  in\r\n\r\n1961, and it has since appeared in the Estimates of the\r\n\r\nMinistry   under  the  Seamen's  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\nSection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Section deals with matters relating to the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of seamen including resolving disputes between\r\n\r\nthem and their employers. Because of the different  and\r\n\r\nmultifarious  nature of the sea career,  employment  of\r\n\r\nSingapore seamen is not governed by the Employment Act.\r\n\r\nThey  are recruited through the National Maritime Board\r\n\r\nand  are  bound by the individual contracts of  service\r\n\r\nmade  between them and the shipping companies or  their\r\n\r\nagents.  In  addition,  Singapore  seamen  engaged   on\r\n\r\nSingapore-registered vessels are also  partly  governed\r\n\r\nby   the  Merchant  Shipping  Act  which  contains  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  adjudication of  disputes  by  the\r\n\r\nShipping  Master. Whenever there is a  complaint  of  a\r\n\r\nbreach of contract or an internal dispute, the Seamen's\r\n\r\nWelfare  Officer is called upon to effect a settlement,\r\n\r\nand this is often done in association with the National\r\n\r\nMaritime Board and the Mercantile Marine Office.

A  seaman in doubt can also seek his  advice  on\r\n\r\ninterpretation and clarification of specific terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of their contract with the ship owners.  The\r\n\r\nSeamen's  Welfare Officer works in close  liaison  with\r\n\r\nForeign  Ministry officials to assist Singapore  seamen\r\n\r\nin  distress while in foreign countries.

In my view the administration of\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  in  Singapore  by  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nleaves room for improvement. It is for this reason that\r\n\r\nI  was happy to note in the Addendum to the President's\r\n\r\nspeech  at the opening of Parliament that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nintended to reorganise itself and, among other  things,\r\n\r\nset up an Industrial Relations Division with more punch\r\n\r\nthan  the  existing industrial Relations  Section.  But\r\n\r\nafter  reading  through the Budget  estimates  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  I  begin to have doubts about  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the Ministry has up to now not said one\r\n\r\nword  as  to  when  the  proposed Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nDivision will be set up. If the Budget estimates are  a\r\n\r\nreliable  guide, it would appear that the Ministry  has\r\n\r\nno  intention  of  setting Lip  the  proposed  Division\r\n\r\nduring 1975. The proposed Division was, reportedly,  to\r\n\r\nhe  staffed  by  more  high  level  officers.  But  the\r\n\r\nestimates  show that, during the financial  year  1975,\r\n\r\nthe  number of Division I posts in the Head  Office  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is to be reduced from 11 to  7,  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Division I posts in the existing Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Section remains at 2. It is only natural that\r\n\r\nI begin to wonder where the high-level staff, necessary\r\n\r\nto  give  added  strength to the Ministry's  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Division, are to come from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three probable explanations. One is that the\r\n\r\nextra personnel is to\r\n\r\nbe  found at the expense of the other sections  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  The second is that there is no intention  to\r\n\r\nset up the proposed Division in 1975. The third is that\r\n\r\nthe   decision  was  taken  too  late  for  the  Budget\r\n\r\nestimates  to  be  revised. I personally  hope  that  a\r\n\r\nsupplementary budget appropriation later this year will\r\n\r\nprove my third explanation to be correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, whatever the true explanation may be,\r\n\r\nthe  air  of  uncertainty over the Ministry's  proposed\r\n\r\nIndustrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations Division serves to confirm my dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nwith   the  Ministry  on  its  handling  of  industrial\r\n\r\nmatters.  Singapore  depends on  its  human  resources,\r\n\r\nincluding labour, for survival and success. Thus  great\r\n\r\nimportance has been placed on the concept of tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation in Singapore. I would have thought that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  would pay chose attention to the  supervision\r\n\r\nof   industrial   affairs  and   would   give   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  the  ways  and  means  of  improving\r\n\r\nindustrial affairs. If it is so, then it would not have\r\n\r\nbeen   necessary  for  the  belated  decision  on   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the Industrial Relations Section.  It\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that either the Ministry does  not  give\r\n\r\nsufficient  thought  to  industrial  matters   or   the\r\n\r\nofficers dealing with industrial matters are lacking in\r\n\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House may he aware, the enactment\r\n\r\nof   various   employment  legislation  in   1968   had\r\n\r\neffectively removed certain industrial matters  out  of\r\n\r\nthe   scope   of  negotiation  between  employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees, and then vested these matters wholly  within\r\n\r\nthe  discretion  of  employers,  the  Minister  or  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court. Now, one of these matters\r\n\r\nis the retrenchment of employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a constituent complained to me that he was\r\n\r\nunfairly  retrenched by a prominent hotel and that  his\r\n\r\ntrade  union  could not do anything for him  except  to\r\n\r\nsecure   his  retrenchment  benefit  which  was   quite\r\n\r\nsubstantial.  He  wanted work,  not  money  payment.  I\r\n\r\ninvestigated  into  the  matter  and  found  that   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  transferred him to another section  of  the\r\n\r\nhotel  and he was working there for a short time  until\r\n\r\nhis  retrenchment consequent upon the closing  down  of\r\n\r\nthat section by the management. I have every reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve the employee's allegation that the transfer was\r\n\r\ncynically effected by the management for the purpose of\r\n\r\nretrenching him and that the management had at the same\r\n\r\ntime  engaged  new  employees for the  section  he  was\r\n\r\nformerly   working  in.  The  retrenched  employee   in\r\n\r\nquestion is healthy, able and willing to work, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas a good work record. His only \"crime\" is that, after\r\n\r\nmany  years of faithful, loyal service, he has  reached\r\n\r\nthe top of his wage-scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that under the existing laws retrenchment\r\n\r\nis  the absolute prerogative of the management. But all\r\n\r\nthe  same,  the officers of the Ministry, if they  want\r\n\r\nto, can  bring their considerable powers of persuasion\r\n\r\nto   bear   on  employers  who  abuse  their  statutory\r\n\r\nprivileges. This House has presumably enacted the  far-reaching  employment  legislation  in  the  belief  and\r\n\r\nexpectation  that  the civil servants  responsible  for\r\n\r\nadministering  the legislation would  see  to  it  that\r\n\r\nerring  employers do not take unfair advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  It  would appear now that such  belief  and\r\n\r\nexpectation  have turned to be mistaken, as  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants in question are not able or willing to act  as\r\n\r\nreferees  and  ensure fair play between  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees. If it is not possible for civil servants  to\r\n\r\nbe  effective  referees, then it may be  time  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to consider retransferring its quasi-judicial\r\n\r\nfunction  in  industrial matters to  a  more  effective\r\n\r\nthird party such as the Industrial Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  caution  the Ministry,  however,  that\r\n\r\nrecruiting  staff for Industrial Relations Division  is\r\n\r\none  thing, but recruiting the right calibre of  staff,\r\n\r\nwho must not only gain the confidence of management but\r\n\r\nalso  of  labour, is necessary for the success  of  the\r\n\r\nDivision.  Gaining the confidence of one party  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of the other is hound to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on the President's speech, I also\r\n\r\nmade   some   remarks  in  respect   of   the   special\r\n\r\nretrenchment Unit of the Ministry of Labour [col.  96].\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for the Minister's comments on what\r\n\r\nI said then. To refresh his memory, I mentioned that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must in a concerted manner take steps to prevent or\r\n\r\nminimise the impact of retrenchment. These measures are\r\n\r\neffected  within  the framework of a rational  economic\r\n\r\nanalysis   of   the   retrenchment   situation   within\r\n\r\ntripartite  relationship of active cooperation  between\r\n\r\nGovernment,  trade unions and employers,  with  special\r\n\r\nemphasis  placed  on  increasing  productivity  through\r\n\r\nadoption  by management of new productivity techniques,\r\n\r\nskill  acquisition by workers and preference  given  to\r\n\r\njob  deployment and part-time work as against  complete\r\n\r\nretrenchments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore employers whose industries are hit by\r\n\r\neconomic recession should be required, if necessary  by\r\n\r\nlegislation, to give the Labour Ministry and the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  advance  notice  of any impending  retrenchment\r\n\r\nexercise.  I  am  aware that the  Labour  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nadvised  the industries to do so. But I am doubtful  as\r\n\r\nto  how many employers are complying with this request.\r\n\r\nThey should provide the Ministry with a list of workers\r\n\r\nto be retrenched and the reasons for their action. This\r\n\r\nwould   enable   the  Labour  Ministry  officials,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary  with  the  help of the Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard, to advise them on how best to tackle the various\r\n\r\nproblems involved. This also will help the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nmonitor the labour situation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I wish to express my support for the sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  my  colleagues, the  Members  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  and  Aljunied,  on  the  necessity  of  having\r\n\r\nexperienced  officials  in  the  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\nDivision  that  would  be set up  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about retrenchment exercises, it is common\r\n\r\npractice  among many employers to take the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  dispense  with  the so-called trouble  makers,  the\r\n\r\nactive  trade unionists, and so on. This tends to  sour\r\n\r\nup  the  relationship  between the  employers  and  the\r\n\r\nemployees.  I  would suggest, in support  of  what  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Telok  Blangah  has  said,  that  certain\r\n\r\nguidelines be set up for employers to follow, that  is,\r\n\r\nwhether they should retrench workers in accordance with\r\n\r\npriorities  and  not  at  the  whims  and  fancies   of\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recruitment of staff for the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nDivision is of paramount importance to the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement. From experience we find that whenever a trade\r\n\r\nunion and an employer fail to reach agreement over  the\r\n\r\nnegotiation  table, they have recourse to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Labour, at present the Industrial Relations Section,\r\n\r\nfor  conciliation. If they do not have an officer  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  experience and who has  the  confidence  of\r\n\r\nemployers or the trade unions, then nothing much can be\r\n\r\ndone.  As  a result, unions are forced to withdraw  the\r\n\r\ncase and take industrial action. At the same time there\r\n\r\nare    several   instances   where   because   of   the\r\n\r\nineffectiveness  of  the  conciliation  officer,   both\r\n\r\nparties,   the   employer  and  the   union,   are   so\r\n\r\ndisillusioned with the role played by the  conciliation\r\n\r\nofficer that they are reluctant to refer any more  such\r\n\r\ncases to the Labour Ministry for conciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to touch on is this. As a\r\n\r\ntrade unionist it would seem to be inappropriate for me\r\n\r\nto  speak in support of the unorganised. As we all  are\r\n\r\naware, there is still a large group of workers who, for\r\n\r\nsome  reason or other, through intimidation or cohesion\r\n\r\nare  unable to organise themselves as a trade union and\r\n\r\nare   thus   deprived   of  the  benefits   of   labour\r\n\r\nconciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to touch on is on medical\r\n\r\nbenefits   and  treatment.  Many  employers  who   have\r\n\r\nemployees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho   are  unorganised  have  taken  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nsubsidised  medical treatment provided by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health in the various Government outpatient clinics\r\n\r\nor  dispensaries.  I would like to  ask  why  must  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer subsidise the health service to the benefit of\r\n\r\nemployers  who  do not maintain a clinic or  dispensary\r\n\r\nwithin  their  organisation. If the employees  of  such\r\n\r\nemployers   have  to  seek  medical  treatment   in   a\r\n\r\nGovernment outpatient dispensary, they have to wait for\r\n\r\nlong  hours  before  they get any treatment.  And  upon\r\n\r\ntheir   return  to  their  place  of  work,  they   are\r\n\r\nreprimanded  by  their employers for having  taken  too\r\n\r\nmuch  time  for  medical treatment.  This  category  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who,  as  I mentioned earlier  that  for  some\r\n\r\nreason  or  other are unable to organise themselves  in\r\n\r\nthe trade unions, are at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry should use section\r\n\r\n118  of the Employment Act to compel such employers  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a clinic or dispensary within their  premises\r\n\r\nor, if this is not possible, they should employ a panel\r\n\r\nof  doctors or medical practitioners to look after  the\r\n\r\nhealth of their employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the hon. Members of Telok Blangah,\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh and Aljunied wish to know more about the new\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Division set up in the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nin  particular,  the recruitment of suitable  officers.\r\n\r\nThe  new Industrial Relations Division has been  formed\r\n\r\nthrough  the bringing together under one administrative\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  three  separate  sections  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry, namely, the Industrial Relations, the  Labour\r\n\r\nCourt  and  the  Registry  of  Trade  Unions.  The  new\r\n\r\nDivision comprises three new key sections, namely,  the\r\n\r\nConciliation Section, the Preventive Mediation Section,\r\n\r\nand  the  Registry of Trade Unions. There  is  also  an\r\n\r\noffice administration unit within the Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conciliation Section comprises two units - one for\r\n\r\ndisputes involving unionised workers, formerly known as\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Relations Section, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  for  disputes  involving non-unionised  workers,\r\n\r\nformerly   known  as  the  Labour  Court.  With   their\r\n\r\nfunctions   properly  streamlined,   the   quality   of\r\n\r\nconciliation work rendered by the units should improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preventive Mediation Section is a new section of\r\n\r\nthe   Division.  It  will  be  involved  in  preventive\r\n\r\nmediation  as  well  as  labour  assessment  work.  The\r\n\r\npreventive mediation services to he provided will  seek\r\n\r\nto assist labour and management to develop a continuing\r\n\r\nharmonious   relationship   through   elimination    of\r\n\r\ndisruptive  practices and through  the  development  of\r\n\r\neffective  policies  which foster better  understanding\r\n\r\nand  cooperation.  This section will also  monitor  and\r\n\r\nassess the state of labour/management relations in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  so  that  early corrective  policies  can  be\r\n\r\nformulated and industrial grievances resolved promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Industrial Relations Division, as has been\r\n\r\nstated earlier, will be headed by a Principal Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretary   who  will  be  assisted  by  two  Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretaries, four Administrative Assistants, two Senior\r\n\r\nExecutive Officers, four Higher Executive Officers  and\r\n\r\neight Executive Officers. The Establishment Warrant for\r\n\r\nthe   new  posts  has  been  approved  by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry, which is presently in the process of  posting\r\n\r\nsuitable staff to this new Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, there is a dearth of\r\n\r\nAdministrative   and  Executive   Officers   with   the\r\n\r\nnecessary experience in industrial relations.  However,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  will  do its best to  ensure  that  those\r\n\r\nofficers  sent by the Finance Ministry will  be  suited\r\n\r\nfor industrial relations work. If they are found to  be\r\n\r\nunsuitable, and should the need arise, I am sure we can\r\n\r\ncall  on  personnel  in the NTUC  for  assistance.  The\r\n\r\nexisting  experienced staff in the former Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Section, the Labour Court and  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nSection  are  being  retained  in  the  new  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Division to provide continuity. It  is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat the mix of new Administra-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntive  Officers and the existing staff will ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe quality of services rendered will be maintained and\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has also expressed concern\r\n\r\nover  the  possible abuse of the right of employers  to\r\n\r\nretrench workers. I wish to inform the Member that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  monitoring  the  retrenchment  situation.\r\n\r\nLabour officers are being deployed to keep a close  tab\r\n\r\non  the  reasons  offered by employers for  retrenching\r\n\r\nworkers. The services of the Economic Development Board\r\n\r\nare  also  called  in  to  assess  the  health  of  the\r\n\r\nparticular  company  concerned so  as  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nemployers  are  retrenching workers  because  they  are\r\n\r\ngenuinely  affected by the current economic  situation.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Ministry has made known to employers  that\r\n\r\nthey  should explore all other means of resolving their\r\n\r\ntemporary difficulties, such as reduction in the number\r\n\r\nof  shifts,  shorter  working week or  shorter  working\r\n\r\nhours,  and that a retrenchment exercise would only  be\r\n\r\nembarked upon as a last resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, employers have been cooperating with the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Cases of abuse of the right to retrench  are\r\n\r\nan exception rather than the rule. If however, there is\r\n\r\nabuse of this right, the worker or his union can always\r\n\r\ncomplain  to  the  Ministry  and  the  matter  will  be\r\n\r\ninvestigated into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member might like to know that the present\r\n\r\nemployment  situation is not as bad as  in  some  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  given the present world economic situation.\r\n\r\nOur  unemployment rate stands at 4.5% in February 1975.\r\n\r\nThe  monthly  retrenchment rate has  declined  from  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  2,927 workers in the last five  months  of\r\n\r\n1974 to an average of 1,476 in the first two months  of\r\n\r\n1975.  Major  industrial  countries  are  expected   to\r\n\r\nexperience  an  economic upturn in the second  half  of\r\n\r\nthis  year.  We  are  expected to feel  the  beneficial\r\n\r\neffects in the latter part of 1975 or early 1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, the Ministry is of the view that there is no need to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namend the Industrial Relations Act to make retrenchment\r\n\r\nissues negotiable again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has just mentioned\r\n\r\nthat there is a dearth of experienced officers.

Much  asbestos  is  being  used  in  industry,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the ship-building, building construction\r\n\r\nand  pipe-making  sectors.

Its high  tensile  strength  and\r\n\r\nflexibility, on account of the extremely small ultimate\r\n\r\ndiameter  of  the fibres, gives it properties  not  yet\r\n\r\nachieved  by  any  man-made fibres at comparable  cost.\r\n\r\nThat  asbestos  is  used in industry because  of  these\r\n\r\nreasons  and  that large amounts of asbestos  dust  may\r\n\r\nconstitute a health hazard are reasons enough  for  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Health  Unit  to  be  ever-vigilant   when\r\n\r\ninspecting plants using asbestos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am anxious to know whether the incidence of\r\n\r\nasbestosis,  a compensable disease under the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Act, is on the increase in Singapore  due\r\n\r\nto  its  ever-increasing use in Singapore.

Members  will recall that since  asbestosis  was\r\n\r\nfirst  listed as a notifiable industrial disease  under\r\n\r\nthe Sixth Schedule to the Factories Act, 1973, only two\r\n\r\ncases  of  asbestosis were notified and confirmed.  Two\r\n\r\nother  suspected  cases  are being  followed  up.  More\r\n\r\nrecently, from November 1974 to February this  year,  a\r\n\r\nmedical survey was conducted in the shipyards. Out of a\r\n\r\nsample examination of 216 workers exposed to asbestosis\r\n\r\nhazards,  only  one  person  was  suspected   to   have\r\n\r\nasbestosis. From the medical evidence so far available,\r\n\r\nit   can  be  safely  stated  that  the  incidence   of\r\n\r\nasbestosis  in Singapore is low. However, this  may  be\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  fact  that  asbestosis,  like  silicosis,\r\n\r\nrequires a fairly long period of exposure, say five  to\r\n\r\nten years before definite medical evidence appears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has taken a number of tests to prevent\r\n\r\nthe  occurrence of such a disease.

In the case of factories with a dust  hazard,\r\n\r\nthey  are  required to introduce dust control measures.\r\n\r\nAll  workers exposed to dust are required  to  have  an\r\n\r\nannual  X-ray. Proper respirators must be supplied  and\r\n\r\nworn  by workers during their work.

In addition,  this\r\n\r\nmove could most certainly limit the number of accidents\r\n\r\nin  industry. I am wondering why the Hon. Minister  has\r\n\r\nnot  utilised  the proviso in this section  since  this\r\n\r\nlegislation came into force in 1973? Why has  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  not  considered it  necessary  to  make  this\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  safety  officers  mandatory  in   some\r\n\r\naccident-prone industries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this section enables the Minister to\r\n\r\nstipulate  the qualification and training  requirements\r\n\r\nof safety officers. There are many safety officers who,\r\n\r\nthrough  no  fault of their own, arc not qualified  and\r\n\r\ntrained  enough to be of effective use in the promotion\r\n\r\nand  assurance  of safety and health in industry.  This\r\n\r\nnecessitates the stipulation of their qualification and\r\n\r\ntraining  before  they  are recruited  by  industry  as\r\n\r\nsafety  officers.  Why has the Hon. Minister,  to-date,\r\n\r\nnot  stipulated such qualifications and /  or  training\r\n\r\nrequirements?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 65 of the same Act requires safety committees\r\n\r\nto be set up in factories employing 50 or more persons.\r\n\r\nThese committees are to be represented by employees and\r\n\r\nmanagement. The functions of such committees  are  also\r\n\r\nclearly  spelt out in this section. Records in relation\r\n\r\nto  the  work  of such safety committees, like  factory\r\n\r\ninspections, for example, are required to be kept in  a\r\n\r\nregister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into any details with regard to the\r\n\r\nimportance of safety committees and their work. Let the\r\n\r\nfact   that  it  is  a  requirement  under  legislation\r\n\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to know whether the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour is monitoring the work of such safety committees\r\n\r\nto ensure that they exist not only in name. As far as I\r\n\r\nam  aware,  no  safety  committee registers  have  been\r\n\r\nlooked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this state of affairs going to continue any longer?\r\n\r\nIt  will be close to two years soon since the enactment\r\n\r\nof the Factories Act, 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, following our success in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, particularly the  rapid  development\r\n\r\nof   the   shipbuilding   and   building   construction\r\n\r\nindustries,   there  has  been  a  sharp  increase   in\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents. As a result many skilled  workers\r\n\r\nhave lost their lives, thus causing a great loss of our\r\n\r\nmanpower.  This  has  caused a loss  not  only  to  our\r\n\r\neconomy but also a hardship to the bereaved families of\r\n\r\nthe workers concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the problem of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents has engaged the attention of many Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House.  My colleagues have repeatedly  asked  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned to take steps to prevent industrial\r\n\r\naccidents. But unfortunately, Sir, day after day,  year\r\n\r\nafter  year, nothing seems to have been done to improve\r\n\r\nthe  situation.  On the contrary, the  whole  situation\r\n\r\nseems  to  have  deteriorated. For example,  last  year\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  very  serious explosion  at  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nShipyard  resulting in the loss of 13  lives.  This  is\r\n\r\njust  one  very  clear example of the  gravity  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation. I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned   whether  any  effective  steps  are   being\r\n\r\ncontemplated  to  prevent industrial accidents  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide safer working environment for our workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year we heard that because of a shortage of\r\n\r\nFactory  Inspectors it was not possible  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nmore frequent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninspections in the factories. One year has  elapsed.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the problem of manpower  shortage  has\r\n\r\nbeen  solved,  and whether the Ministry  concerned  has\r\n\r\nrecruited  more Factory Inspectors. If after the  lapse\r\n\r\nof  one year the number of Factory Inspectors is  still\r\n\r\nthe  same,  then the manpower shortage in  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  will  be  even  more  serious  with   the\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of  factories.  It  will  then   be\r\n\r\nimpossible to carry out checks. I have listened to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Potong Pasir who raised similar problems. He\r\n\r\nhas  said that although there are mandatory provisions,\r\n\r\nthese have not been enforced even up to this day.  This\r\n\r\nis rather surprising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Member  for  Potong Pasir  has  raised  some\r\n\r\nquestions  relating  to  safety committees  and  safety\r\n\r\nofficers. I wish to state that a very comprehensive set\r\n\r\nof  regulations governing the duties and appointment of\r\n\r\nsafety   officers   has   already   been   drafted.   A\r\n\r\nnotification governing the qualifications and  training\r\n\r\nof  safety officers has also been drafted. This set  of\r\n\r\nregulations  and notification will be  enacted  in  the\r\n\r\nvery near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry has been\r\n\r\nkeeping  a  close watch on the effectiveness of  safety\r\n\r\ncommittees.  This  is done in two  ways.  Firstly, the\r\n\r\nInspectorate requires occupiers of factories that  have\r\n\r\nto  form  safety  committees to submit  the  names  and\r\n\r\nparticulars of the chairman, secretary and  members  of\r\n\r\nthe   safety  committee.  Secondly,  Inspectors   check\r\n\r\ndocuments  such  as the minutes of meetings  of  safety\r\n\r\ncommittees and the Factory Inspector's reports  of  the\r\n\r\nsafety   committees  during  their  routine  visit   to\r\n\r\nfactories. Feedback information on the effectiveness of\r\n\r\nthe  safety  committees  has been  received.  They  are\r\n\r\nlargely  obtained during inspection visits to factories\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Inspectors. It is hoped  that  when  the\r\n\r\nregulations  governing the duties  and  appointment  of\r\n\r\nsafety  officers  have been enacted, a  greater  effort\r\n\r\nwill   be  made  in  ensuring  safety  in  the  various\r\n\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern of the Member for Anson was that non-compliance with the safety regulations by employers has\r\n\r\nbeen  allowed to remain undetected for long periods  of\r\n\r\ntime   because  of  the  small  staff  in  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate.  The  technical  wing  of   the   Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate has a staff of 39 officers comprising  the\r\n\r\nChief   Inspector  of  Factories,  the   Deputy   Chief\r\n\r\nInspector  of  Factories,  two  Senior  Inspectors   of\r\n\r\nFactories,  nine  Inspectors of Factories,  two  Senior\r\n\r\nTechnical  Officers, eight Technical  Officers  and  16\r\n\r\nTechnicians. Although the technical staff is small  and\r\n\r\ninadequate   to   cope  with  the   volume   of   work,\r\n\r\nnevertheless the Factory Inspectorate has made and will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to make every effort to ensure that employers\r\n\r\nobserve the safety regulations in their factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate carried out a total of 7,597\r\n\r\ninspections   and  follow-up  visits   on   the   5,067\r\n\r\nregistered factories, and 3,063 items on non-compliance\r\n\r\nwere  notified  to  the occupiers  in  1974.  It  seems\r\n\r\nunlikely  that  the  factory occupiers  can  engage  in\r\n\r\nmalpractice  for any long period of time without  being\r\n\r\ndiscovered, for factories are generally visited once  a\r\n\r\nyear.  Notwithstanding this, I share the  view  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers for Anson and Sembawang that there is still  an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  to  further increase  the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nFactory  Inspectorate.  The  Ministry  has,  in   fact,\r\n\r\nplanned to expand the Factory lnspectorate, and it will\r\n\r\ntake the matter up with the appropriate authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has suggested the introduction of\r\n\r\na  service charge for services performed. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  point  out  that the main function of  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  is to ensure that employers  comply  with\r\n\r\nsafety  and health standards laid down in the Factories\r\n\r\nAct.  It would therefore not be appropriate to  levy  a\r\n\r\nservice  charge for this. However, the Member may  like\r\n\r\nto  know that the Inspectorate does charge a fee of  up\r\n\r\nto $30 for the registration of factories and the annual\r\n\r\nrenewal of their registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share with the Member for Sembawang his concern\r\n\r\nabout   the   high   rate   of  industrial   accidents.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation  has  brought  about  a   concomitant\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the rate of industrial accidents  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic. The rate of accidents has been the highest in\r\n\r\nthe  construction industry and in the shipbuilding  and\r\n\r\nship-repairing industry. My Ministry has already  taken\r\n\r\na  number of measures to bring about a reduction in the\r\n\r\nrate of industrial accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the existing legislation will be amended to\r\n\r\nprovide  for heavier penalties for those who contravene\r\n\r\nsafety  and health standards. New regulations  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  under the Factories Act providing  for  the\r\n\r\ncomposition  and conduct of safety committees  and  the\r\n\r\nqualifications,  registration  and  duties  of   safety\r\n\r\nofficers,  as  stated  earlier. Secondly,  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  has been expanded and training  of  staff\r\n\r\npursued.  The Ministry has also begun the  training  of\r\n\r\nsafety  officers  for industry. Thirdly,  a  bi-monthly\r\n\r\nnewsletter called The New Worker was started in  August\r\n\r\n1973  to  promote  safety  and health  awareness  among\r\n\r\nworkers   and  management.  The  publication   is   now\r\n\r\npublished  monthly.  Another  publication  A  Guide  to\r\n\r\nSafety,  Health and Welfare for Factories has  gone  to\r\n\r\nprint and will be distributed to factories later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry is paying special attention\r\n\r\nto  the construction industry and the shipbuilding  and\r\n\r\nship-repairing industry which have the highest rate  of\r\n\r\naccidents.  The  Ministry has a special  unit  to  look\r\n\r\nafter   the   problems  of  safety  in   the   building\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  In  addition,  in   1973   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  set  up  the  Building  Construction   Safety\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  advise on measures to curb accidents  in\r\n\r\nthe   construction  industry.  This   Committee   which\r\n\r\ncomprises  representatives from Government departments,\r\n\r\nstatutory   boards,   contractors'   associations   and\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies  is making  continuous  review  of\r\n\r\nsafety  problems  in  the  construction  industry.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry is taking more stringent action on work  sites\r\n\r\nwhich are found to be unsafe, Work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsites  which  have serious unsafe conditions  will  be\r\n\r\nordered  to  stop work for rectification of the  unsafe\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang may be aware that my Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  also  published a Code of Practice on  Safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth  at  construction work sites and a pictorial  of\r\n\r\ndos  and  don'ts,  a Safety and Health  Guide  booklet.\r\n\r\nThese  publications are distributed free of  charge  to\r\n\r\nall concerned in the construction industry. As a result\r\n\r\nof  these  measures,  fatalities  in  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  declined from 41 in 1973 to  35  in  1974,  a\r\n\r\nreduction  of 15%, whilst the total number of accidents\r\n\r\ndeclined  from 487 in 1973 to 448 in 1974, a  reduction\r\n\r\nof 9%. Amputation cases registered a drop of 75%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special unit was set up within the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  of the Ministry in January this  year  to\r\n\r\nspecially  look into the safety and health measures  of\r\n\r\nthe shipbuilding and shiprepairing industry. Soon after\r\n\r\nits   formation,  the  unit  immediately  launched   an\r\n\r\nintensive  inspection programme covering shipyards.  As\r\n\r\nearly  as  March 1973, the Ministry appointed  a  study\r\n\r\ngroup  on  accident prevention in the shipbuilding  and\r\n\r\nship-repairing industry to make an in-depth study  into\r\n\r\nthe causes and nature of accidents in this industry and\r\n\r\nto  recommend  preventive and remedial measures.  After\r\n\r\ntwo  years  of  exhaustive study and deliberation,  the\r\n\r\nstudy  group completed its report and presented  it  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry on 15th March, 1975. The Ministry is  now\r\n\r\nstudying  the recommendations of the study  group.  The\r\n\r\nreport  of the study group runs into 70() pages and  it\r\n\r\nis bound into four volumes. I invite interested Members\r\n\r\nto  make  a  study  of the report  and  give  me  their\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, industrial accident prevention is a\r\n\r\ntripartite  affair that calls for the concerted  effort\r\n\r\nof   labour,   management  and   the   Government.   If\r\n\r\ncooperation is forthcoming from workers and management,\r\n\r\none  can  hope  to  see  a reduction  in  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents in our factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I am most grateful and thankful to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  giving  me this very useful information  that  the\r\n\r\nregulations  are  nearly ready and will  be  introduced\r\n\r\nsoon.

Most of  them\r\n\r\narc  girls  or women. In fact, few took the trouble  to\r\n\r\nregister themselves at the Employment Exchange for  new\r\n\r\njobs.  Even  in my Meet-the-People sessions,  barely  a\r\n\r\nhandful  come to look for jobs.

With the increase\r\n\r\nin  road  tax and other disincentives to potential  car\r\n\r\nownership,  two large motor dealer firms  have  already\r\n\r\ntaken  steps to retrench as much as 25% of their staff,\r\n\r\nmainly sales and white collar workers.

Although  unemployment  has  not  reached   a\r\n\r\nserious  level,  we should now take remedial  steps.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Ministry should put into operation the\r\n\r\nprovision   of  section  111  of  the  Employment   Act\r\n\r\nrequiring  all  employers to recruit workers  from  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, it is precisely for the reasons\r\n\r\nenumerated by the Member for Toa Payoh that we  do  not\r\n\r\nconsider it necessary at present to invoke section  111\r\n\r\n(b).  As  mentioned by the Minister for Labour  earlier\r\n\r\non,  the  unemployment rate stands at 4.5% in  February\r\n\r\nthis  year.
