He  has\r\n\r\nbecome  an  institution over the past 11 years.  He\r\n\r\nvisited  this  House on so many  occasions  at  the\r\n\r\nopening of each new session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I last spoke, in this House, of him and his\r\n\r\ngracious lady, when moving his re-election as  Head\r\n\r\nof State in November 1967 for a third term. Shortly\r\n\r\nafterwards he was to fall ill. We did not then know\r\n\r\nhow grave the illness was. During a sea voyage from\r\n\r\nSingapore to Australia in April 1968, the rhythm of\r\n\r\nhis heart beat was upset and he had to be flown  to\r\n\r\nMelbourne  for treatment. We were grateful  to  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  Government, and the doctors and  nurses\r\n\r\nin Melbourne who treated him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prognosis of the Australian specialists was\r\n\r\nnot  encouraging. But, with skill and devotion, our\r\n\r\ndoctors  and nurses who took care of him, stretched\r\n\r\nwhat  could have been a matter of a few months into\r\n\r\n2 1/2  years. Their professional competence made  this\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first came to know the late President early in\r\n\r\n1951.  He had come to seek my advice over an Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu   editor   who   was  detained   under   the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance.  He  was\r\n\r\nnaturally well-mannered. Over the years, I  got  to\r\n\r\nknow him as a deeply religious man, but one who did\r\n\r\nnot  allow  his religion to hinder his relationship\r\n\r\nwith  non-Muslims,  whether they  were  Christians,\r\n\r\nHindus, Buddhists, Confucians, or atheists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood for our multi-racial policies. A recent\r\n\r\nspeech he made to start off the fund for a monument\r\n\r\nto  the  early pioneers of Singapore was one  which\r\n\r\ncould  only have been made by a person who believed\r\n\r\nin   our  multi-racial  approach  to  solving   the\r\n\r\nproblems  of our multi-racial society. At the  same\r\n\r\ntime, he was keen that in this multi-racial milieu,\r\n\r\nour  Singapore  Malays should break  out  from  the\r\n\r\nbounds  of customs which were preventing them  from\r\n\r\nmaking  the same progress as the other communities.\r\n\r\nHe  believed in policies to modernise our  society,\r\n\r\nincluding  our  Malays. He believed  that  all  men\r\n\r\nshould   be   equal,  or  at  least   given   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities  to advance themselves through  their\r\n\r\nown effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember him as the man I spoke of in the\r\n\r\nmotion  for his re-election in November  1967.  The\r\n\r\nlong  illness over nearly three years  reduced  him\r\n\r\nslowly  to  an invalid. It was painful and  sad  to\r\n\r\nwatch  him  go  down  little by little  after  each\r\n\r\nrelapse of his cardiac and respiratory problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden was heaviest on his wife and children.\r\n\r\nAs his condition deteriorated, his usually composed\r\n\r\ndemeanour was affected. He was beset by anxieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw him last on Sunday night, 22nd November, at 9.30 p.m, at the General Hospital. I had spoken to\r\n\r\nhim on Saturday, 21st November, over the telephone.\r\n\r\nHe  told  me  not to see him until  his  attack  of\r\n\r\nherpes,  or  shingles,  was  over.  He  sounded  in\r\n\r\ngreater  pain  than  usual. The  next  day,  Sunday\r\n\r\nafternoon, he had a heart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfailure.  He  was put into an oxygen  tent  at  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital. He must have known that the  end\r\n\r\nwas  near. After a while, when the doctor had given\r\n\r\nan injection to resuscitate him, he came out of his\r\n\r\nplastic  oxygen tent. He insisted on shaking  hands\r\n\r\nwith  the  doctors and nurses who had looked  after\r\n\r\nhim, and with me. I left after 20 minutes.

But it was not to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he retired at the time of his death, the late\r\n\r\nPresident would have been entitled to a pension  of\r\n\r\n$  17.466 per year, or $1,455 per month. As he  was\r\n\r\n60  years of age, he could have taken a gratuity of\r\n\r\n$72,777  (one-third  of  his  full  pension  x  12 \u00bd\r\n\r\nyears), together with a reduced pension of $970 per\r\n\r\nmonth. This formula for computation applies to  all\r\n\r\nMinisterial pensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late President left behind a widow and three\r\n\r\nchildren,  the  youngest of whom is 18.  Under  the\r\n\r\npresent law, Puan Noor Aishah will only be entitled\r\n\r\nto  a  gratuity. This could not have been more than\r\n\r\nthe  gratuity  the late President would  have  been\r\n\r\nentitled to. She is only in the second half of  her\r\n\r\nthirties and so has a considerable life expectancy.\r\n\r\nMy  colleagues and I decided that we  should  amend\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  List  and Pension Act for  her  special\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  without making it a  precedent  for\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this amending Bill, we shall provide her with\r\n\r\na  pension of $2,000 per month for life. As in  all\r\n\r\npensions  to widows, it will cease in the event  of\r\n\r\nre-marriage. There will be a further $500 per month\r\n\r\nfor  her  children,  until  the  youngest  one  has\r\n\r\nreached 21, or on her marriage if it is before 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their house has not yet been built on her\r\n\r\npiece  of  land, we have made available  to  her  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  bungalow she has chosen from  a  number\r\n\r\nwhich  were  suitable. She will pay one-quarter  of\r\n\r\nthe  economic  rent of the house for  a  period  of\r\n\r\nthree  years. During this time her own house  could\r\n\r\nbe built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the declining years of the late President, she\r\n\r\ncarried more of the social responsibilities of  his\r\n\r\noffice.  I  am  sure  the House  will  be  with  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues   and  me  in  wanting  to  make   these\r\n\r\nprovisions for her and her children. This  amending\r\n\r\nBill will give her more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  what  the late President himself  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen entitled to.

It  was  a\r\n\r\ndeliberation spread over 2\u00bd years. After the  death\r\n\r\nof  the  late President, we decided to  invite  Dr\r\n\r\nBenjamin Sheares to undertake this office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a doctor, eminent in his own specialty. By\r\n\r\ndisposition courteous, by nature kind, he has  done\r\n\r\na  great deal for the College of Medicine,  and  is\r\n\r\nlargely responsible for the high standards  of  our\r\n\r\ngynaecologists, nearly all of whom he taught. After\r\n\r\nhe  retired in 1960, he went into private practice.\r\n\r\nHowever,  he  continued  to  help  in  many  fields\r\n\r\nconnected   with  his  expertise.  He   has   given\r\n\r\ngenerously of his time to public duties,  like  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning  Association. As Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nMedical Specialties Board, he was helping to decide\r\n\r\non   which  medical  specialties  Singapore  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  her  resources. He  had  to  recommend\r\n\r\nwhich department had outstanding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecialists, so that the most modern equipment  and\r\n\r\nfacilities  could be provided for the  exercise  of\r\n\r\ntheir  talent,  what  special  support  in  nurses,\r\n\r\nanaesthetists, radiographers, cardiographers,  and\r\n\r\nspecialised workers we must train to support  these\r\n\r\nspecialists in the use of the latest equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he accepted the Government's offer to be\r\n\r\nnominated as President, I explained to Dr  Sheares\r\n\r\nthat  he would have to undertake his duties as from\r\n\r\nthe  2nd of January, 1971. In less than a fortnight\r\n\r\nhe   will   be  receiving  the  Heads  of   various\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  delegations who will be arriving  for\r\n\r\nthe  Conference. His first reaction was to ask  for\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum  vitae  of  the  leaders  of  these\r\n\r\ndelegations,  and  a  note on  the  countries  they\r\n\r\nrepresent, their history, their political, economic\r\n\r\nand social systems. He wanted to know about the men\r\n\r\nhe  will be meeting and the nature of the countries\r\n\r\nthey   represented.  Although  he  has   not   been\r\n\r\nexperienced  in the political or diplomatic  field,\r\n\r\nhis  readiness to bring a disciplined intellect  to\r\n\r\nbear on to a new field augurs well for Singapore. I\r\n\r\nam  confident  that  he will develop  a  grasp  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding   of   persons   and   peoples,    of\r\n\r\nassociations and communities, of nations and  their\r\n\r\nleaders,  their national aspirations and individual\r\n\r\nambitions. It will make what could be a perfunctory\r\n\r\nduty   into  an  interesting  office,  more  of   a\r\n\r\nchallenge than a chore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of President require not only\r\n\r\ndistinction   and   ability,  but   integrity   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding.  He  brings deep  qualities  to  the\r\n\r\noffice  of President. More than that, he is  modest\r\n\r\nand friendly, by nature and habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, Mrs Sheares, speaks Chinese, English\r\n\r\nand  some  Malay.

At\r\n\r\n63,   he  enjoys  good  health,  despite  a   major\r\n\r\noperation  five  years  ago.  Here  is  a  man   of\r\n\r\noutstanding ability.

Indeed,\r\n\r\nin  the  same way as a group of dragons  cannot  go\r\n\r\nwithout a leader, no country can go without a  Head\r\n\r\nof State, and it has become our first task today to\r\n\r\ndecide  on  the question of who shall  succeed  the\r\n\r\nlate President Yusof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the office of President in our\r\n\r\nRepublic  is somewhat different from that of  other\r\n\r\ncountries. He represents, both here and abroad, our\r\n\r\nRepublic and is a symbol of the dignity and  honour\r\n\r\nof our people. He is also a symbol of the unity and\r\n\r\nthe  values  of  our Republic. In  these  turbulent\r\n\r\ntimes  and  in  the course of nation  building  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment, he will have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan important role to perform. Therefore, the office\r\n\r\nof  President cannot be overlooked. It is indeed  a\r\n\r\nvery difficult task to choose a suitable person for\r\n\r\nthis  post.

To  a  big\r\n\r\ncountry with a lot of people the choice of  such  a\r\n\r\nperson presents no difficulty. But to Singapore, it\r\n\r\nis not easy to make such a choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the Prime Minister and read the\r\n\r\ncurriculum   vitae  published  in  the   newspapers\r\n\r\nrecently, I firmly believe that Dr Sheares is  the\r\n\r\nbest  and the most suitable choice, because he  has\r\n\r\nall  the attributes and qualities required for this\r\n\r\nhigh office. He was born and bred in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nhas been brought up as an outstanding figure in our\r\n\r\nRepublic. By his own efforts he has made  his  name\r\n\r\nknown  internationally and has brought great honour\r\n\r\nto Singapore. He has also a distinguished record of\r\n\r\nservice  to our country and our people. He reflects\r\n\r\nin  his own life the finest qualities and the  best\r\n\r\nspirit  of Singapore. These are dedication  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  devotion to society, a  love  of  people,\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  human  welfare,  and  a  profound\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the characteristics of our  multi-racial country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully support the recommendation by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Dr Sheares to this high office. It  is\r\n\r\nour hope that he will, in the same kindly spirit of\r\n\r\na  physician and by his own virtues, carry .on from\r\n\r\nwhere our late President has left off, so that  our\r\n\r\nnew  and  young  Republic will be  able  to  set  a\r\n\r\nshining  example  in turbulent Southeast  Asia  and\r\n\r\nmake  her name felt throughout the world.

This has been the practice since  October\r\n\r\n1959.  If the water-meter installed in any  service\r\n\r\nconnection  is the one and only controlling  meter,\r\n\r\nno  meter rent is charged. However, where there are\r\n\r\ntwo  meters  installed in series in the service  of\r\n\r\nany consumer, the second meter is then called a sub-meter  for which a rent of $1 per month is payable.\r\n\r\nUnder  the existing water supply regulations, these\r\n\r\nsub-meters may be installed in high rise buildings,\r\n\r\nboth  Housing  and  Development Board  and  private\r\n\r\nbuildings  and  also where consumers  request  sub-metering   to  ensure  separately  water  supplying\r\n\r\ndifferent sections of their service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why not all Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  residents pay sub-meter rent is  that  those\r\n\r\nresidents who live on the lower floors of blocks of\r\n\r\nflats get their water supply direct from the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board mains. The supply to  these  flats\r\n\r\ndoes not go through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  bulk  meter  and the roof  tanks.

However, it may be interesting\r\n\r\nto  Members of the House if I read excerpts of  the\r\n\r\nfolklore  behind the imperial Weights and  Measures\r\n\r\nas  compiled  by Lord Ritchie-Calder,  who  is  now\r\n\r\nChairman of the British Metrication Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot is not, as popularly believed, the size\r\n\r\nof  the  human foot. As human feet vary from person\r\n\r\nto  person and because of this great variation, one\r\n\r\nthousand  years ago 36 barley corns or 36 seeds  of\r\n\r\nbarley taken from the middle of the ear placed  end\r\n\r\nto  end  were  regarded as one foot. And  three  of\r\n\r\nthese  barley  seeds placed end to end  constituted\r\n\r\none  inch. A yard was the distance from the tip  of\r\n\r\nKing  Edgar's nose to the tip of the middle  finger\r\n\r\nof  his outstretched arm. A fathom was said  to  be\r\n\r\nthe  length of a Viking's embrace. An acre was  the\r\n\r\namount of land that could be ploughed in a day by a\r\n\r\nyoke  of oxen. The amount could vary, depending  on\r\n\r\nwhether the soil was heavy or light. In those  days\r\n\r\nthe  larger unit was called the hide; it too was  a\r\n\r\nvariable measurement, being based on the amount  of\r\n\r\nland  a  yoke of oxen could plough in a year.  This\r\n\r\namount, which averaged about 120 acres, was  deemed\r\n\r\nenough to support a family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Germany, the length of the road, now known as\r\n\r\nthe  rod  or  pole or perch, was established  by  a\r\n\r\nrandom sample of 16 men coming out of church:  they\r\n\r\nstood  toe-to-heel,  and  the  overall  length  was\r\n\r\naccepted as the standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Romans measured out their mile. Their mile\r\n\r\nwas  a  thousand  paces, equivalent  now  to  1,618\r\n\r\nyards. A pace, however, is a variable unit, and  so\r\n\r\nthe  mile has varied. The British and American mile\r\n\r\nwas standardised at 1,760 yards, but in a number of\r\n\r\nEuropean countries, the mile ranges from less  than\r\n\r\na British-American mile to six such miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while there was much in the old days to\r\n\r\ncommend the units based on the human body, however,\r\n\r\nthe  units based on the anatomy of the human  being\r\n\r\nwere too variable, and therefore the standards used\r\n\r\nvaried from country to country. For example, in the\r\n\r\nNorth of Italy in Leonardo da Vinci's time, lengths\r\n\r\nwere in braccia or arm lengths. Leonardo was a tall\r\n\r\nman  and could outreach most of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIf  he was using his own braccia, he must have  run\r\n\r\ninto difficulties when he had to fit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomething  he  had designed or made  into-something\r\n\r\nmeasured  according  to  other  braccia.  Even  the\r\n\r\nstandard  braccia  varied  from  city  to  city.  A\r\n\r\nFlorentine  door  would have been  too  big  for  a\r\n\r\nMilanese   door-frame.  Throughout  the  centuries,\r\n\r\nmeasurements proliferated in regions, countries and\r\n\r\nlocalities, and persisted long after their original\r\n\r\nsignificance and utility had been forgot- ten. As a\r\n\r\nresult,  there were problems, not only  in  fitting\r\n\r\nbut  also in making sure of honest measure  and  in\r\n\r\navoiding confusion born of misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metrication Act seeks to standardise weights\r\n\r\nand  measures according to an international system.\r\n\r\nThe system now is based on physical units which can\r\n\r\nbe measured extremely accurately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, the comments of the Minister for Science\r\n\r\nand  Technology  on metrication  in  the  House\r\n\r\nduring the last sitting on 4th November,  1970,\r\n\r\nand  his  own  reference just now to  the  arbi\r\n\r\ntrary   basis   of  traditional   weights   and\r\n\r\nmeasures  should leave no doubt that  there  is\r\n\r\nno  argument about whether we-should go  metric\r\n\r\nor  not.  Quoting from Ritchie-Calder whom  the Minister  referred  to  just  now,  the  really\r\n\r\nimportant question is, just when should  we  go\r\n\r\nmetric?  The  answer to this question  is  also\r\n\r\nclear;    namely,   as   soon    as    it    is\r\n\r\norganisationally      and      administratively\r\n\r\nfeasible.  This aspect of feasibility  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  adequately covered in the report  on  the\r\n\r\nproposed  conversion to the metric system.  The\r\n\r\nreport  refers  both  to  metrication  in   the\r\n\r\npublic  and the private sectors. It would  seem\r\n\r\nmost  illogical  for us to continue  using  our\r\n\r\nold  system  of  weights and measures.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the imperial units, for example,  the\r\n\r\ncountry   where  this  system  originated   has\r\n\r\nitself  decided in its own interest  to  change\r\n\r\nover  to the metric system. Where our own local\r\n\r\ncustomary  units  are concerned,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nmost parochial indeed if we were to persist  in\r\n\r\ntheir continued use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  Britain itself it has been clearly seen,  after\r\n\r\ninitial   resistance,  that   the   advantages   of\r\n\r\nmetrication  must outweigh national  sentiments  or\r\n\r\ntraditional  feelings. It is  just  a  question  of\r\n\r\nmaking  a decision and acting logically as a result\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion to metrication is just another\r\n\r\nprocess of modernisation and social change which we\r\n\r\nhave  to  undergo. Our people have shown themselves\r\n\r\nvery  adaptable to such changes. There is no reason\r\n\r\nwhy,   once   the   necessity  has   been   clearly\r\n\r\ndemonstrated,  even the private  sector  and  those\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  retail trade should  not  adjust\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  the  new  system  of  weights   and\r\n\r\nmeasures.  To  facilitate this, not only  are  good\r\n\r\npublicity and public education required,  but  they\r\n\r\nshould be started as soon as possible and sustained\r\n\r\nover as long a period as is necessary to bring home\r\n\r\nthe relevant point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. ----[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment: read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Weights and Measures (Amendment) Bill seeks\r\n\r\nto  legalise  metric  units for  use  in  trade  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose  to  go  over  the same  ground  except  to\r\n\r\nrecapitulate some of the main arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change in enlistment policy derives from a\r\n\r\ndecision  made by Government more than a  year  ago\r\n\r\nthat  students  who proceed from the Higher  School\r\n\r\nCertificate to the university should, in increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers,   do   their   national   service   before\r\n\r\nuniversity education and not after it. It  was  not\r\n\r\ndesirable  to  introduce this change  in  one  fell\r\n\r\nswoop. Instead, deferment will be allowed to H.S.C.\r\n\r\nstudents, but in decreasing proportions over two or\r\n\r\nthree years. For instance, this year about half  of\r\n\r\nthe  H.S.C, students  had their  national  service\r\n\r\ndeferred  until the completion of their  university\r\n\r\neducation.  Next year, the proportion  would  be  a\r\n\r\nquarter,   and  by  1973  everyone  completes   his\r\n\r\nnational  service before going to  the  university,\r\n\r\nexcept   those  awarded  Colombo  Plan  and   other\r\n\r\noverseas  scholarships whose selection  rests  with\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should stress here that deferment means\r\n\r\nprecisely  what  the word purports to  mean.  Those\r\n\r\ndeferred  will  do  their  national  service  after\r\n\r\ngraduation.  There is no question of  letting  them\r\n\r\noff  for  good. It is a commentary on the character\r\n\r\nof   the  Singaporean  that  those  who  had  their\r\n\r\nnational service deferred were considered lucky.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  people would hold  the  same  view\r\n\r\nthree or four years from now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I propose to deal with three aspects of the\r\n\r\ndefence policy. The first is why the defence build-up  is  necessary. The second is the  new  pay  and\r\n\r\nservice conditions for the Armed Forces, details of\r\n\r\nwhich  I promised in my statement last November  to\r\n\r\ngive  on  this  occasion. Third,  I  want  to  give\r\n\r\ndetails  of  what  is  going to  happen  to  H.S.C.\r\n\r\nstudents next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the necessity of our defence build-up,\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid it is necessary from time to time  to\r\n\r\nremind  our  citizens of the hard  facts  of  life.\r\n\r\nLately, I notice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  tendency  among some citizens to be  complacent.\r\n\r\nThe reason probably is that things seem to be going\r\n\r\nreasonably well in the Republic. Some citizens seem\r\n\r\nto   be   incorrigible  optimists  and  erroneously\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the good conditions  now  prevailing\r\n\r\nform  part  of  the natural, normal, and  immutable\r\n\r\nstate  of  the  universe. The  trouble  with  these\r\n\r\noptimists is that at the first sign of danger  they\r\n\r\nare liable to lose their nerve and panic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me therefore recount some of the harsh facts\r\n\r\nof  life  in our part of the world. We were overrun\r\n\r\nby  the Japanese Army less than 30 years ago. Some,\r\n\r\n20,000 to 30,000 men were massacred and most of the\r\n\r\npopulation lived under near-famine conditions. From\r\n\r\n1948  to  1960, the Malayan Communist Party mounted\r\n\r\nwidespread   guerilla  insurgency  in   the   Malay\r\n\r\nPeninsula  which was suppressed at great cost  with\r\n\r\nmuch  difficulty  and  with  the  full  support  of\r\n\r\nBritish  arms. Between 1954 and 1963, the Communist\r\n\r\nUnited  Front Organisations in Singapore  literally\r\n\r\nran  riot. Between 1963 and 1965, while in Malaysia\r\n\r\nwe  were  the  target  of  what  was  virtually  an\r\n\r\nundeclared  low-level  war  waged  by  the  Sukarno\r\n\r\nregime  of  Indonesia.  But  for  British  military\r\n\r\nprotection, we would surely have succumbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around Southeast Asia today, the view\r\n\r\nthat meets the eye is far from reassuring. In South\r\n\r\nVietnam, unlimited American fire-power through  the\r\n\r\ndeployment  of the most scientific weapons  systems\r\n\r\non   land,   sea  and  air,  backed  by  unstinting\r\n\r\nlogistics and communications support, has failed to\r\n\r\ncrush  an  army  of  peasants  equipped  only  with\r\n\r\nrifles. The fighting has spread to Cambodia,  while\r\n\r\nthe  position in Laos remains as insecure as  ever.\r\n\r\nAs  a result of the pressure of public opinion, the\r\n\r\nAmerican  Government has decided to  run  down  its\r\n\r\ncombat  operations in the Indo-China peninsula  and\r\n\r\nleave the fighting to the South Vietnamese regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurgency has raised its ugly head in Northern\r\n\r\nand   Northeast  Thailand  as  well   as   on   the\r\n\r\nThai/Malaysian border. Our two closest  neighbours,\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Indonesia, are faced with acute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndomestic problems. Malaysia is trying to find a new\r\n\r\npolitical  equilibrium and a  new  political  style\r\n\r\nafter  May  13th last year. Indonesia  has  made  a\r\n\r\nreturn  to political stability and economic  sanity\r\n\r\nthrough  military  government  after  more  than  a\r\n\r\ndecade of mis-government by the Sukarno regime. The\r\n\r\nIndonesians  are making welcome progress.  But  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties they are facing are monumental. We can\r\n\r\nonly  hope  that  the Governments of  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia succeed in their endeavours, for if  they\r\n\r\ndo  not,  the troubles that follow may  well  spill\r\n\r\nover their borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British have reversed their earlier decision\r\n\r\nof  total  withdrawal east of  Suez.  However,  the\r\n\r\nforces  that  they  will station  in  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore are small, and even when these are  added\r\n\r\nto   those  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  they\r\n\r\nrepresent no more than a token acknowledgement that\r\n\r\nthese  three  Governments have an interest  in  the\r\n\r\npeace  and  stability  of  the  region.  They  have\r\n\r\npreferred  not  to  close an  important  option  by\r\n\r\npulling  back all their troops. We have to remember\r\n\r\nthat  these  military forces have a different  role\r\n\r\nfrom what they performed previously when there  was\r\n\r\na firm defence treaty, such as that between Britain\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia, supplemented by tacit agreement with\r\n\r\nAustralia   and   New   Zealand.   These    defence\r\n\r\nobligations  were  clearly  spelt  out.  Under  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding   envisaged  under   the   Five-Power\r\n\r\narrangements,  their  only commitment  is  to  hold\r\n\r\nconsultations in the event of a threat to Singapore\r\n\r\nor Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background of general uncertainty in\r\n\r\nthe  region, and in the absence of any firm defence\r\n\r\ncommitments from our Commonwealth associates, it is\r\n\r\na  matter of common prudence that we should  strive\r\n\r\nto  be  as  self-reliant as we can  in  matters  of\r\n\r\ndefence.  Here,  I  have to repeat  what  is  often\r\n\r\nforgotten  in  popular discussion of  the  subject.\r\n\r\nThis  is  that there is a long time lag  between  a\r\n\r\ndecision  taken  to build up a military  capability\r\n\r\nand  the  actual  acquisition of  that  capability.\r\n\r\nBetween  two and four years pass by between placing\r\n\r\nan order for military hardware\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  actual  delivery. Then it takes more  time  to\r\n\r\ntrain men to use these weapons and equipment and an\r\n\r\neven longer period to achieve a high level of skill\r\n\r\nand  competence. The time lag varies  according  to\r\n\r\nthe  sophistication of the weapons systems and  may\r\n\r\nrange  from  a  minimum of three years  for  simple\r\n\r\nmilitary  weapons to seven to ten  years  for  more\r\n\r\nadvanced  weapons  systems.  This  means  that  you\r\n\r\ncannot  wait  until you are in dire trouble  before\r\n\r\nyou decide to build up your defence forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my statement of 4th November, I promised\r\n\r\nimproved  pay  and  service  conditions   for   our\r\n\r\nsoldiers.  I  now mention some of the major  items.\r\n\r\nFull  details  will  be published  shortly  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Gazette and in the Ministry of  Defence\r\n\r\nOrders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of improving pay and general service\r\n\r\nconditions is to make a career in the regular force\r\n\r\nmore  attractive so that the defence  service  will\r\n\r\nreceive  its  fair share of talented and  ambitious\r\n\r\nyoung  men. At the same time, these improved  terms\r\n\r\nof  service are an acknowledgement, albeit somewhat\r\n\r\nbelated, of the loyal and devoted service of  those\r\n\r\nregular  officers  of the 1st and  2nd  Battalions,\r\n\r\nSingapore Infantry Regiment, who had to bear such a\r\n\r\nheavy  responsibility of leadership  in  the  rapid\r\n\r\nexpansion of our defence forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, the pay of Other Ranks will be\r\n\r\nsubstantially increased. A soldier's  pay  consists\r\n\r\nof three components his rank pay, his vocation pay,\r\n\r\ndepending  on whether he is a rifleman, a  cook,  a\r\n\r\nvehicle mechanic, a machine gunner, or whatever  it\r\n\r\nis,  and  a  third element, a new one,  called  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  pay  supplement. Because  of  the  great\r\n\r\nshortage of technical skills, our Armed Forces have\r\n\r\nbeen  unable to recruit sufficient numbers  in  the\r\n\r\ntechnical vocations at the going rates of pay. Rank\r\n\r\npay and vocation pay in these trades are inadequate\r\n\r\ncompared  to what the private sector is paying.  So\r\n\r\ntechnical  pay  supplements are  introduced.  These\r\n\r\nvary  between $40 p.m, and $400 p.m.  Let  me  give\r\n\r\nsome examples of the new pay Structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a private in the army gets a rank pay\r\n\r\nof $90, with an annual increment of $5 to a maximum\r\n\r\nof $115 p.m. The new pay scale will be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          $90: 95: 140x10-170.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corporal now gets a rank pay of $105x10-175.\r\n\r\nThe new pay scale will be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          $115: 170x10-$230.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  represents  an increase of $55  p.m, at  the\r\n\r\nmaximum. Similarly, a sergeant will get an increase\r\n\r\nof $80 p.m, at the maximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrant officers are reasonably well paid; for\r\n\r\ninstance,  Warrant officer I scale is  $350x20-450.\r\n\r\nThe new pay scale will be $390x20-470.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vocation pay will not be affected. Examples of\r\n\r\nvocation pay are as follows. An army tailor gets an\r\n\r\nadditional  $5  p.m, to his rank  pay;  a  rifleman\r\n\r\nClass  II, $10 p.m.; a mortarman $35 p.m. A  seaman\r\n\r\nClass  I  gets an additional $75 p.m, while  a  jet\r\n\r\naircraft fitter Class I receives an additional $200\r\n\r\np.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since those rates are inadequate, a new technical\r\n\r\npay supplement is to be paid to vocation grades  in\r\n\r\nshort  supply.  For  instance, a  corporal  in  his\r\n\r\nsecond  year,  serving  as a  communication  fitter\r\n\r\nClass  I,  now gets a total pay of $240 p.m.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  new  scheme, he will get a total pay  of  $415\r\n\r\np.m., consisting as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          Rank pay                $170\r\n\r\n          Vocation pay            $125\r\n\r\n          Technical Supplement    $120\r\n\r\n                                  ----\r\n\r\n                         Total    $415\r\n\r\n                                  ====\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier who hits the jackpot is the\r\n\r\ncommunication technician Class I. He is normally of\r\n\r\nWarrant  officer rank, and his total pay, that  is,\r\n\r\nrank, vocation and technical supplement, adds up to\r\n\r\nbetween  $1,015  and  $1,160 p.m.  A  jet  aircraft\r\n\r\nfitter  can look forward .to $920 p.m, if he  makes\r\n\r\nthe top grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new rates of pay will come into effect as\r\n\r\nfrom 1st January next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  revision in rank pay will cost the  Government\r\n\r\n$10.3  million  a  year in additional  pay  if  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the current year is filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the retirement and disability\r\n\r\nbenefits  scheme  as well as the new  Army  Pension\r\n\r\nregulations.  Hitherto,  these  were  a  result  of\r\n\r\nhistorical  legacy of the time when  our  Army  was\r\n\r\npart  of the Malaysian Army during 1963-65. Because\r\n\r\nwe had to cope with so many other pressing matters,\r\n\r\nrevision  of the inadequate retirement and  pension\r\n\r\nbenefits had to give way to more urgent tasks. This\r\n\r\ncan  no  longer  be delayed if we want  to  make  a\r\n\r\nservice  career  in the Army attractive  enough  to\r\n\r\ndraw and retain good quality officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full details will shortly be published in the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Gazette and explained in a pamphlet.  I\r\n\r\nwill only give some of the highlights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers are engaged on two different terms of\r\n\r\nservice,  depending on a number of  considerations.\r\n\r\nFirst,  they may be given a limit in the  terms  of\r\n\r\nemployment for definite periods, say three, five or\r\n\r\nseven years, or they may be placed on the permanent\r\n\r\nregular  service,  in the same  way  as  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a sergeant on short service\r\n\r\nengagement as an infantry section leader Class  II,\r\n\r\nwith   five  years'  service,  receives  a   paltry\r\n\r\ngratuity  of $250 on his discharge. Under  the  new\r\n\r\nscheme, his gratuity will be $2,565.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers on the permanent regular service who\r\n\r\nretire on reaching the age of retirement will get a\r\n\r\nlarger  annual pension than present rates  provide.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, a major with five or  six  years  in\r\n\r\nthat rank on completion of 22 years' service in the\r\n\r\nArmy  will  get a pension of $660 p.m, as  against\r\n\r\n$435 p.m, as of now. A Warrant officer I at present\r\n\r\ngets  a  pension of only $122.55 p.m, after serving\r\n\r\n21 years. Under the new scheme, he will get $214.20\r\n\r\np.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a soldier dies in service, even when death\r\n\r\nis  not due to service, such as illness or accident\r\n\r\noutside  working  hours,  his  survivors   get   an\r\n\r\nequivalent of one year's pay or a commuted  pension\r\n\r\nor gratuity, whichever is the greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gratuity is payable whether the soldier is  on\r\n\r\npermanent  regular  service or  full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice,  or a reservist called up for the  reserve\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a soldier in regular service dies as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  injury received in and attributable  to\r\n\r\nservice,  a  pension is payable to  his  widow  and\r\n\r\nchildren, in addition to the gratuity of one year's\r\n\r\npay.  Take, for instance, the case of a Lt. Colonel\r\n\r\nwith twenty years' service drawing $1,850 p.m., who\r\n\r\ndies   in   these  circumstances.  Under  the   new\r\n\r\nregulations,  if  he  leaves  a  widow  with  three\r\n\r\nchildren under 18, the family will get a pension of\r\n\r\n$986.65   p.m.,  in  addition  to  a  gratuity   of\r\n\r\n$27,750.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier who i5 disabled as a result of injury\r\n\r\nreceived  in and attributable to military  service,\r\n\r\nwill receive an annual pension for the rest of  his\r\n\r\nlife,  depending on the degree of disablement,  the\r\n\r\nlength of his pensionable service and his pay.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, a captain with 10 years' service  drawing\r\n\r\na  pay  of  $1,000 p.m, who is totally disabled  in\r\n\r\nthis  way, will receive a pension of $750 p.m, for\r\n\r\nthe rest of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally children of soldiers whose death or\r\n\r\ndisablement  is  due  to  military  service,   will\r\n\r\nreceive assistance in meeting educational expenses.\r\n\r\nThis  will  extend to meeting the cost of  tuition,\r\n\r\nboard or living allowance of children, the cost  of\r\n\r\nbooks,  materials, equipment and so  on  to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  complete  not  only  their  primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary   education  but  also  their  university\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholarships will be made available to\r\n\r\ncommissioned officers and non-commissioned officers\r\n\r\nserving in the permanent regular service. Those not\r\n\r\nin   the   regular   service,  such   as   national\r\n\r\nservicemen,  may  be awarded such  scholarships  if\r\n\r\nthey   sign   on   for   regular   service.   These\r\n\r\nscholarships  will be for study in universities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and,  in  the  case  of  very   talented\r\n\r\nsoldiers, in universities abroad. Where the  course\r\n\r\nof  study is in Singapore, the soldier will be paid\r\n\r\nhis  normal Army pay; if in an overseas university,\r\n\r\nan  overseas  allowance  is  payable  in  addition.\r\n\r\nAllowances vary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording to rank, the country where the courses of\r\n\r\nstudy are taken, and whether board and lodging  are\r\n\r\nprovided.   These  allowances  are  in  line   with\r\n\r\nGovernment rates. However, soldiers studying abroad\r\n\r\nwill  not  be allowed to marry except with official\r\n\r\npermission, and then only to Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Award of scholarships will normally be made on a\r\n\r\ncompetitive   basis   among  eligible   candidates.\r\n\r\nSelection  will be done by a Scholarship  Selection\r\n\r\nBoard  chaired  by  the  Chairman,  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.  In  return  for  benefits  under   the\r\n\r\nscheme, a soldier will be required to enter into  a\r\n\r\nbond  and  will  serve  in  the  Armed  Forces   on\r\n\r\ncompletion of his course of study in the  same  way\r\n\r\nas  other  Government-sponsored  scholarships.  For\r\n\r\nsoldiers of exceptional promise who do not have the\r\n\r\nqualifications to enter a university,  arrangements\r\n\r\nwill be made to allow them time off to acquire such\r\n\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards older officers who may not want to do\r\n\r\na   full   university  course,  special  short-term\r\n\r\ncourses  will  be provided to widen  their  general\r\n\r\nknowledge,  to improve their level of articulation,\r\n\r\nand  generally to enable them to conduct themselves\r\n\r\nwith  the  poise  and  deportment  expected  of  an\r\n\r\nofficer  of the Singapore Armed Forces. In addition\r\n\r\nto these general courses, there will, of course, be\r\n\r\nspecialist  and professional training courses  both\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and in the Training Schools and Staff\r\n\r\nColleges of friendly countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to H.S.C, students and their liability\r\n\r\nfor  national service. Those who have sat for their\r\n\r\nexaminations last month will be called  up  in  two\r\n\r\ngroups  next  year - 900 in January and  the  rest,\r\n\r\nsome 600, in April. Next year the university's term\r\n\r\nwill  begin  in July and not in May. Of  the  1,500\r\n\r\nH.S.C, students expected to pass their examination,\r\n\r\nabout  1,200  will probably gain admission  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal universities in 1971. It is proposed that  25\r\n\r\nper  cent  of those accepted for admission  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal universities be granted deferment. They  will\r\n\r\nbe  taken  out  of their units in July,  enter  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  complete  their  national  service\r\n\r\nafter graduation. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrest,  those  who remain in the Armed Forces,  will\r\n\r\nenter the university in July 1973. The April intake\r\n\r\nwill  not  have done two and a half years and  they\r\n\r\nwill  serve  out  the balance of  national  service\r\n\r\nduring the university long vacation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 25 per cent to be deferred will be selected\r\n\r\nby  ballot, except for medical and dental students,\r\n\r\nwho  will be included automatically in this 25  per\r\n\r\ncent.  Medical  and dental students  will  complete\r\n\r\ntheir  -two and a half years' service on graduation\r\n\r\nas medical and dental officers in the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of balloting differs from the method\r\n\r\nused  this  year  when  preference  was  given   to\r\n\r\nstudents  with  better examination  performance  as\r\n\r\nwell as students admitted to preferred courses such\r\n\r\nas engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my statement of 4th November, I referred to\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of  getting  sufficient  numbers   of\r\n\r\nofficers  in  the support arms units, such  as  the\r\n\r\nartillery, signals and engineers. Officers in these\r\n\r\nunits,  in  addition  to doing the  basic  infantry\r\n\r\nofficers'  course, have to undergo several  months'\r\n\r\nspecialist training in their particular arms.  With\r\n\r\nthe  reduction of officers' service from  three  to\r\n\r\ntwo  and a half years, these support arms units may\r\n\r\nbe  hard  pressed if all national service  officers\r\n\r\nleave after two and a half years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to award a bounty to national service\r\n\r\nofficers  who  volunteer to stay  for  another  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   The  amount  of  the  bounty   is   under\r\n\r\nnegotiation with the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of officers' service from three to\r\n\r\ntwo  and a half years for next year's intake brings\r\n\r\nup  the  problem of equitable treatment  for  those\r\n\r\nenlisted before 1971. It -may be possible to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  term  of  service  of  some  national  service\r\n\r\nofficers  and allow them the option of leaving  the\r\n\r\nArmy  before  the  full  three  years.  It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  extend this to all officers,  but  it\r\n\r\nseems  to  me  that  on grounds  of  equity,  those\r\n\r\nofficers who were born before 1-1-49 have the first\r\n\r\nclaim  for preferential treatment in this  respect.\r\n\r\nThe subject is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  study in my Ministry and a decision will  be\r\n\r\ntaken shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guiding principle in national service\r\n\r\nenlistment  policy should be absolutely  equal  and\r\n\r\nfair  treatment  for all persons belonging  to  the\r\n\r\nsame  category. Whether a boy is the son of a Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  or  of  a banker or a cobbler  makes  no\r\n\r\ndifference  to  his  service liability.  A  further\r\n\r\nideal  would  be  to observe an unchanging  set  of\r\n\r\nselection  criteria  for all  time.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  always possible as the rate  of  our\r\n\r\nmilitary   build-up  must  change   with   changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  This has given rise to  unavoidable\r\n\r\ndisparity and unavoidable discontent and, as far as\r\n\r\npossible,  we  have  tried to meet  the  legitimate\r\n\r\ngrievances  of those who have felt that  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  unfairly  treated. The  fact  that  in  large\r\n\r\nmeasure  these people have been victims  of  chance\r\n\r\ndoes  not  assuage their feelings, but I  think  it\r\n\r\nwill be generally conceded that we have gone as far\r\n\r\nas we could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved terms and conditions of service\r\n\r\nwhich  are outlined will be promulgated shortly  in\r\n\r\nofficial  orders  and Gazette notifications.  These\r\n\r\nwill  be  supplemented  by  explanatory  pamphlets.\r\n\r\nThese improved terms are not ungenerous, but  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think that we have been over-generous. Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Armed Forces  lead  a  hard  and\r\n\r\nstrenuous life while training in peace time. In war\r\n\r\ntime  they risk their lives in the defence  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic. We should not do less than what  we  have\r\n\r\nto recompense them in the way of material award for\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  security of livelihood  for  their\r\n\r\nwives and children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, after having\r\n\r\nheard  the Minister of Defence giving this House  a\r\n\r\nvery  clear and vivid policy on enlistment, I  find\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  taken  up  several  points  which  I\r\n\r\nintended  to raise under this amendment  Bill,  and\r\n\r\nthis has now left me with very little ground indeed\r\n\r\nto cover. Nevertheless, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwish  to  proceed ahead. The main  purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nEnlistment (Amendment) Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact  section 12 of the Enlistment Act,  1970,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  make those persons who are  serving  two\r\n\r\nyears  in  full-time national service and  who  are\r\n\r\nabove the rank of lance-corporal and those who have\r\n\r\nbeen selected for officer training, liable to serve\r\n\r\na period of two and a half years. This is a correct\r\n\r\nmove  and  I shall not be out of step to  touch  on\r\n\r\nsome  other  aspects of the enlistment policy.  But\r\n\r\nshould I appear to digress from the main purpose of\r\n\r\ndebating on the intention of the Bill whilst in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  putting  my views  across  by  way  of\r\n\r\nillustration, I think it merely serves to reinforce\r\n\r\nmy views which I strongly hold. Sir, I do seek your\r\n\r\nindulgence and patience in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister of Defence mentioned pay\r\n\r\nincreases all round by way of basic pay as well  as\r\n\r\nvocational  allowance and other forms  of  monetary\r\n\r\nincentives. This, I think, would be most welcome to\r\n\r\nall  members of the Singapore Armed Forces. In this\r\n\r\nconnection, I had occasion at one time to  table  a\r\n\r\nquestion in the House for oral answer by the former\r\n\r\nMinister of Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable the Singapore Armed Forces\r\n\r\nto  be  better equipped in its tremendous  task  of\r\n\r\nbuilding up a credible defence capability and  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  those university graduates who  have  been\r\n\r\nselected for officer training and who will now have\r\n\r\nto  serve  only  two and a half  years  instead  of\r\n\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, I would like to touch on some\r\n\r\nother  aspects relating to enlistment  policy.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  of Defence on 4th November in this  House\r\n\r\nclarified  certain  points  and  remarked  on  what\r\n\r\nappeared  in the newspapers prior to his speech  on\r\n\r\n4th  November. The articles that were  featured  so\r\n\r\nprominently   in  the  newspapers  were   so-called\r\n\r\ngrouses  and I do not know why they were published.\r\n\r\nSome  of them were completely unfounded and untrue.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  I remember reading  in  one  of  the\r\n\r\npapers  an  article captioned \"S.A.F.T.I, chicken\"\r\n\r\nwhich  went  on  to  state that the  meat  .of  the\r\n\r\nchicken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserved  in  the  Singapore  Armed  Forces  Training\r\n\r\nInstitute was as tough as rubber and that it  could\r\n\r\nnot  be  eaten. I would like to state h-ere that  I\r\n\r\nknow  as  a  fact that this is not  true.  Such  an\r\n\r\narticle  appears to me to be more than  mischievous\r\n\r\nand I strongly urge the Minister of Defence to take\r\n\r\nserious note of this, because I am of the view that\r\n\r\nthe authors of such erroneous and untrue statements\r\n\r\nappearing in certain responsible newspapers,  which\r\n\r\nafter  all  do  not play a role in giving  accurate\r\n\r\nnews  to  the public, should be well aware  of  the\r\n\r\nfact that Singapore needs time to build up its  own\r\n\r\ndefence capability. I am not saying that we do  not\r\n\r\nhave problems. Even those countries with very well-equipped  armies  and  military  might  also   have\r\n\r\nproblems  of their own. To those writers who  wrote\r\n\r\nto   these  newspapers,  whether  intentionally  or\r\n\r\nunintentionally, I would suggest to them that  they\r\n\r\nredirect  their  complaints  to  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nDefence. I am not trying to take on the role of the\r\n\r\nDefence Minister when I make this statement. What I\r\n\r\nmean is that the Ministry of Defence should set  up\r\n\r\na  committee,  though I understand  that  there  is\r\n\r\nalready a committee known as the Welfare Committee.\r\n\r\nThe   Minister  may  wish  to  consider  appointing\r\n\r\nwelfare officers in each unit so that any person or\r\n\r\npersons of any rank in a particular unit can go  up\r\n\r\nto  them  if  they have a personal problem  or  any\r\n\r\nother grievances to bring up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing strikes me most forcefully when I was\r\n\r\nfortunate   enough   to  be   a   member   of   the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  group that visited  several  of  our\r\n\r\ndefence  establishments. It was at S.A.F.T.I, that\r\n\r\nwe  had  the opportunity to come face to face  with\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen who were university graduates.\r\n\r\nFrom  my personal experience and my encounter  with\r\n\r\nthem,  I  felt  that quite a good  number  of  them\r\n\r\nsimply   had  no  heart  to  serve  as  responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens.  I  cannot understand  this  attitude.  I\r\n\r\nwould have thought that, being university graduates\r\n\r\nwith  a higher level of intellect, they would  have\r\n\r\nbrought up more serious problems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  issues  than \"We have not got our pay  for  the\r\n\r\nlast six months!\", or minor grievances about toilet\r\n\r\npaper and low water pressure. Problems of this sort\r\n\r\ncould  have  been sorted out with their platoon  or\r\n\r\ncompany  commanders. I hope that  the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nDefence will look into this also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is a fact that there are many other\r\n\r\nuniversity  graduates  who have  been  going  about\r\n\r\ntheir   duties  without  the  slightest  signs   of\r\n\r\ndiscontentment.  In  fact,  they  accept   national\r\n\r\nservice as a challenging task and more as a duty on\r\n\r\ntheir  part as citizens of Singapore. To this group\r\n\r\nof people, I would like to pay my tribute publicly.\r\n\r\nHowever,  to the other group of national servicemen\r\n\r\nwhom  I have mentioned earlier, I would suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of Defence that we should send  these\r\n\r\ngraduates  for  full combat training.  When  I  say\r\n\r\n\"full  combat  training\", I think the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  of  Defence knows exactly  what  it  is  all\r\n\r\nabout. It is, of course, a very tough course. Why I\r\n\r\nsuggest  this, Sir, is to get this lot of graduates\r\n\r\nto  undergo  such  a  course and reorientate  their\r\n\r\nminds  to  come up to a level with their intellect.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, to give them the necessary  brawn\r\n\r\nthough they may possess the necessary intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out also that the brunt of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  survival  will fall  more  heavily  on\r\n\r\npeople with brains. Therefore, I think people  with\r\n\r\na  good brain but in a weak physical condition will\r\n\r\nbe  of no good to us, and full combat training  for\r\n\r\nthese  people will certainly go a long way  towards\r\n\r\nsecuring a better future for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wanted to touch on the question of giving\r\n\r\nmore  scholarships to members of the  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nwho show special aptitudes in various categories of\r\n\r\nskills.  But  the  Minister  of  Defence  has  very\r\n\r\nexplicitly  enlightened this House  on  how  he  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to give such awards to enable them to render\r\n\r\nbetter   service.   On  that  note,   I   give   my\r\n\r\nwholehearted support to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nGovindasamy, Sir, I would just like to add  a  note\r\n\r\nhere,  that I disagree with what my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Punggol,  has  suggested  about  using\r\n\r\ncombat training to reorientate the attitude of some\r\n\r\nof  the  graduate national servicemen. I  think  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  understand that these  people  have  some\r\n\r\nlegitimate grouses and the Minister of Defence  has\r\n\r\ntried  very hard to remedy some of them. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we  should at any stage give the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  national service, or any part of it,  is,  or\r\n\r\nwill be, used as a punitive device for any purpose.\r\n\r\nI  think that will defeat the entire purpose of the\r\n\r\nprogramme. By all means, let us use exhortation and\r\n\r\nincentive, but do not let us use the stick for this\r\n\r\npurpose,  because  what we want ultimately  is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  attitude  on  the  part  of  everybody  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  whether  graduates or  non-graduates  -\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  willingness,  the  proper  spirit  to\r\n\r\ndefend  this republic of ours. Part of the attitude\r\n\r\nof  these  graduates lies in our  very  success  in\r\n\r\ncreating opportunities, which are so many, and  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  have just come out from the university,\r\n\r\nthey   are   eager  to  get  into  industry,   into\r\n\r\nGovernment  and so on. They see all  the  promotion\r\n\r\nprospects  and  they work hard.  In  the  meantime,\r\n\r\nsince  some of them have been held back by national\r\n\r\nservice  while their colleagues have had  a  faster\r\n\r\nstart  in  industry, they feel that they have  lost\r\n\r\nout  in  the process. I would appeal to Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  here not to think in terms of  national\r\n\r\nservice  in this fashion, namely, to punish  people\r\n\r\nor  even  to use punishment to reorientate people's\r\n\r\nattitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I strongly\r\n\r\nbeg  to differ from the Member for Whampoa,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to clarify. What I suggested was not  a\r\n\r\npunitive  measure  -  to punish  anybody.  National\r\n\r\nservice,  as the Minister of Defence has  just  now\r\n\r\nstated,  should be applied equally to all. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I suggested that probably full combat training\r\n\r\nwould do a lot of good to some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  graduates. After all, as has been admitted\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Whampoa, graduates passing  out\r\n\r\nfrom   the   university  look  forward  to   better\r\n\r\nprospects  in  jobs,  etc. I  myself  served  as  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  from 1960 to 1963, and in  the  People's\r\n\r\nDefence  Force  from 1966 till now,  as  have  some\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament. Perhaps I would suggest  to\r\n\r\nmy  colleague, the Member for Whampoa, to join  the\r\n\r\nP.D.F, as a start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  did  not  intend  to speak at  this  sitting  of\r\n\r\nParliament  as I have not fully recovered  from  my\r\n\r\nrecent illness. However, the Member for Whampoa has\r\n\r\nprompted me to add a few points in support  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister, but I would imagine this support will  go\r\n\r\ndirectly to the Member for Punggol. When the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol  spoke on the subject, he  spoke  with\r\n\r\nauthority.  He  is still actively  serving  in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Defence Force. He has tasted the so-called\r\n\r\n\"S.A.F.T.I, chicken\"  and  not  the   \"S.A.F.T.I.\r\n\r\nchicken\"  in the other connotation of the word.  He\r\n\r\nhas  tasted army food, slept, trained, laughed with\r\n\r\nand enjoyed the company of ordinary soldiers. It is\r\n\r\nnot  for  me  here  to claim too  much  credit  for\r\n\r\nmyself, but I am afraid I have to mention one fact,\r\n\r\nthat  is, I myself am also involved in the training\r\n\r\nin  the army. I have the advantage or disadvantage,\r\n\r\nthe honour or dishonour, of leading some university\r\n\r\ngraduates and undergraduates in training,  some  of\r\n\r\nwhom  might be students in the university at  which\r\n\r\nthe Member for Whampoa is lecturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent sufficient time with these\r\n\r\nprivates.  All the grouses they raised to  me  were\r\n\r\nnothing new, nothing that we do not know of. We are\r\n\r\njust experiencing the teething troubles of building\r\n\r\nup  our  defence capability. There  are  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nproblems that we have to solve, but certainly there\r\n\r\nare  bigger problems for us to think about than  to\r\n\r\ngrumble  about educational allowances  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  believe that if we pay a man $25 more  for\r\n\r\nhis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducational allowance, that $25 does not  make  him\r\n\r\nshoot  any  better, run any faster  or  fight  more\r\n\r\ncourageously than an ordinary private. Some of them\r\n\r\nare  reluctant leaders themselves. I do  not  agree\r\n\r\nthat  by  merely giving them more money, they  will\r\n\r\nmake better soldiers. However, we have to recognise\r\n\r\nthe  additional years they spent in the  university\r\n\r\nand  their thinking capacity. Because of  that,  we\r\n\r\nfeel  that it is fair to pay them a little bit more\r\n\r\nthan  a private, a corporal or even an officer  who\r\n\r\nis not a graduate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what disturbs me is that the word\r\n\r\n\"leadership\" to a graduate or an undergraduate  has\r\n\r\ntwo   meanings.   I  regard  them   as   leadership\r\n\r\npotential, but they regard themselves as  potential\r\n\r\nleadership. They are two different things, Sir.  On\r\n\r\nthe one hand, they claim to be potential leaders of\r\n\r\nthe  country. But when we call upon them  to  serve\r\n\r\nthe  nation,  they  say, \"No.\" We  all  agree  that\r\n\r\nnational service is good. We all agree that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary. But the question they ask is: who is  to\r\n\r\nserve, when to serve, and where to serve? Who is to\r\n\r\nserve - preferably not they, the graduates. When to\r\n\r\nserve  -  preferably not until they get  themselves\r\n\r\nfirmly  established  in the  commercial  world,  by\r\n\r\nwhich  time  it might be too late for  them  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled  up  at all. And where to serve - preferably\r\n\r\nin  the  less  vigorous of the  three  branches  of\r\n\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to be misunderstood on what I\r\n\r\nspeak  here  today, because I am not  a  university\r\n\r\ngraduate.  There  is no question of  what  we  call\r\n\r\n\"sour  grapes\". But I would like to  enlighten  the\r\n\r\nHouse, firstly, on my own views on the matter  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly, on my experience in the Armed Forces.  If\r\n\r\nthe  university  graduates  are  not  regarded   as\r\n\r\nleadership  potential or if  they  are  not  to  be\r\n\r\nlooked upon for leadership, where else can we  look\r\n\r\nfor  leadership,  be  it for the  country,  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community, in the Government, or  in  the\r\n\r\nArmed Forces? If this is their attitude - just  opt\r\n\r\nthemselves  out  as  far  as  Army  leadership   is\r\n\r\nconcerned; but if they are put in as bank managers,\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  all  for  it  -  then  we  must  correct  that\r\n\r\nattitude.  They  may not be conscious  of  it,  but\r\n\r\nsubconsciously they feel that way, Sir,If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  regard  the  university as the incubator  from\r\n\r\nwhich to tap our leadership, where else can we  get\r\n\r\nthem?  Something must be wrong with our educational\r\n\r\nsystem.  If  we  have  to get our  leadership  from\r\n\r\nprimary  and  secondary  schools,  because  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversities the graduates just opt out, where will\r\n\r\nthat lead us, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really regard them as the reluctant leadership.\r\n\r\nSurely   they  should  feel  that  they   have   an\r\n\r\nobligation to discharge to the community, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid  both inside and outside the House.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat they have undergone a course in the university\r\n\r\nand have graduated with a B.A, or B.Sc, degree,  or\r\n\r\nbetter  still  a  Master's degree or  a  Doctorate,\r\n\r\nshows  that  they have sufficient  grey  matter  in\r\n\r\nthem. But if they lack this grey matter, nobody  is\r\n\r\nto  be  blamed. They should realise that  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they can go through all stages of education up\r\n\r\nto  university level is only because as a community\r\n\r\nin  Singapore we provide them' with the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  do  so. In my time, Sir, kindergarten education\r\n\r\nwas  `either  not heard of or it was  considered  a\r\n\r\nluxury.   But   today  you  have  to   go   through\r\n\r\nkindergarten,  six  years of primary  school,  then\r\n\r\nsecondary school and the Higher School Certificate,\r\n\r\nand  finally the university. If these persons  were\r\n\r\nborn in the Congo - I refer to the Congo only as  a\r\n\r\ngeographical entity and not as a republic or  as  a\r\n\r\nsovereign  state - with a land area  50  times  the\r\n\r\nsize  of  Singapore and Malaysia put together,  and\r\n\r\nwith  a  population  very much more  than  that  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaysia put  together,  and  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  only  23 secondary schools,  a  fact  I\r\n\r\ngathered  from  a report - there is no  chance  for\r\n\r\nthem to be graduates, or even have the advantage of\r\n\r\na  kindergarten  or primary school education.  They\r\n\r\nwould  be  tilling  the  soil,  cutting  up  banana\r\n\r\nplantains, or may be in even worse occupations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if a university graduate in Singapore should\r\n\r\nlook at his responsibility to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe community in the perspective that he is what he\r\n\r\nis  today  because the community has  provided  him\r\n\r\nwith  these ,opportunities, then there is no better\r\n\r\nway  for  him  to discharge his obligation  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  than  by doing national  service.  True,\r\n\r\nSir,  a  graduate  can  get  a  better  salary   or\r\n\r\nestablish  a  better  economic  standing   in   the\r\n\r\ncommercial world, but if we were to run  our  Armed\r\n\r\nForces  with leadership material coming  only  from\r\n\r\nthe  primary  schools, then these graduates  having\r\n\r\nestablished  themselves as millionaires  or  multi-millionaires,  after some years of  hard  work,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, might wake up one fine morning to find that\r\n\r\ntheir million dollars might be worth half a cent or\r\n\r\nmight not be worth anything at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really do not see why these people should\r\n\r\nadopt such an attitude towards national service. As\r\n\r\nI  have said, I did not intend to speak today,  but\r\n\r\nhaving been provoked by the hon. Member, I have  to\r\n\r\ngive  my  views  which I would like  the  House  to\r\n\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Govindasamy, Sir, as the Minister has pointed\r\n\r\nout  just now, this Bill expresses our stand on the\r\n\r\nquestion of national service the implementation  of\r\n\r\nwhich  has  had satisfactory results.  No  one  can\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  national service is  essential  to  an\r\n\r\nindependent   country.  It  is  also  a   necessary\r\n\r\nobligation  on  the part of our citizens.  For  the\r\n\r\nlast  few years most of our citizens have responded\r\n\r\nwell  and  fully  supported  and  participated   in\r\n\r\nnational  service.  But  there  are  a  number   of\r\n\r\nanomalies  or defects in the system,  and  we  must\r\n\r\nalways  seek to remedy them whenever we come across\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise four or five points here\r\n\r\nand  I  hope  the Minister will explain  them.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  point  is  this. I have received  complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  many parents whose one and only son has  been\r\n\r\ncalled  up  for national service. The complaint  is\r\n\r\nthat  their only son has a job which pays him  $100\r\n\r\nto $200 every month to support his family. In order\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  requirements  of  the  law,  when  he\r\n\r\nreaches  the  appropriate age group he  has  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled up for full-time national service training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, of course the Minister realises that there is a large difference between the allowance a national serviceman gets and the salary he earns outside. Every month he only gets about $100 while in national service and deductions have to be made for food. So what he can take home\r\n\r\nis  only  a  very meagre sum. I wonder whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister can sympathetically consider allowing such\r\n\r\nboys to do part-time national service only. In this\r\n\r\nway  we  can,  on the one hand, give  him  military\r\n\r\ntraining,  and,  on  the other hand,  we  will  not\r\n\r\ndisrupt the livelihood of these families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is about\r\n\r\nthose  university graduates born in  1946  and  who\r\n\r\nhave already been called up for national service. I\r\n\r\nhave  received a complaint about such a  case.  The\r\n\r\nboy  was  called up and has so far done  about  six\r\n\r\nmonths' training. Last month the Minister announced\r\n\r\na  new policy to exempt those born before 1949 from\r\n\r\nfull-time national service, and to allow them to do\r\n\r\npart-time  national service. I would  Jike  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  those graduates who were born in 1946  can\r\n\r\nbe allowed to do part-time national service, rather\r\n\r\nthan full-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to raise is this.\r\n\r\nOur  Government has given the assurance  that  jobs\r\n\r\nwould be found quickly for those who have completed\r\n\r\ntwo years' national service. But in point of fact I\r\n\r\nhave  received  many  complaints  from  these   ex-servicemen   in  my  meet-the-people  sessions   in\r\n\r\nSembawang. The complaints are that they have waited\r\n\r\nfor  as  long as three months and are still without\r\n\r\njobs. Although we have a Director of Employment  to\r\n\r\nallocate  jobs and there are many commercial  firms\r\n\r\nwhich  require people to fill their vacancies,  how\r\n\r\nis  it that these ex-servicemen still have to  wait\r\n\r\nfor such a long time? Is it because the Director is\r\n\r\ninefficient?  I  would like  the  Minister  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention to these complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is in regard to requests from\r\n\r\nnational   servicemen  to  go   on   honeymoon.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the Ministry gives them only  three\r\n\r\ndays  for  a  honeymoon. I  think  this  is  rather\r\n\r\ninhuman.  We should allow the husband and  wife  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  a longer honeymoon. Three days is too short,\r\n\r\nI   wonder  if  the  Minister  will  consider  this\r\n\r\nquestion sympathetically and grant these people who\r\n\r\nare getting married a longer leave, say, a week  or\r\n\r\ntwo weeks; perhaps a month will be ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, may I reply to the points\r\n\r\nraised  by  Members in the reverse order  in  which\r\n\r\nthey spoke?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Member for Sembawang. As\r\n\r\nregards  his  point whether the only  son,  who  is\r\n\r\nalleged  to  be  able to earn quite easily  between\r\n\r\n$100  and $200 a month, should not be exempted from\r\n\r\nfull-time national service, much as I would like to\r\n\r\noblige him, the answer is no. My advice is for  the\r\n\r\nonly son to work harder in the army so that he  can\r\n\r\nraise  himself to the rank of corporal,  where  his\r\n\r\npay will be more than $200 a month, and in addition\r\n\r\nhe will get board and lodging worth at least $80 to\r\n\r\n$90  a month. So he will be better off in the  Army\r\n\r\nif he works hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards graduates born before 1st January,\r\n\r\n1949,  I have already dealt with the matter  in  my\r\n\r\nSecond Reading speech. I do not have anything  more\r\n\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding jobs for reservists, the majority of\r\n\r\nthem - I do not have the exact number - I think\r\n\r\nfive or six thousand reservists who have left\r\n\r\nthe army, more than 80 per cent of them have\r\n\r\nalready found employment. Those who cannot find\r\n\r\njobs after three months are usually those who\r\n\r\nare quite pernickety. They think they are worth\r\n\r\nmore than what prospective employers value their\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards extending the honeymoon period, my\r\n\r\nadvice to national servicemen is to wait until they\r\n\r\ncomplete their national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Stamford has passed some very\r\n\r\nscathing remarks about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngraduates  in  the army. I am afraid  1  completely\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  nearly  all  he  `has  said   about\r\n\r\ngraduates and undergraduates. He may not  be  aware\r\n\r\nof the fact that the number of graduates who become\r\n\r\nofficers is much larger than that of non-graduates.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  as of now, there are something like  150\r\n\r\ngraduates  who are officers in combat units.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot    think   this   reflects   a   lackadaisical,\r\n\r\nunpatriotic  or negative attitude towards  national\r\n\r\nservice  and towards national leadership. The  vast\r\n\r\nmajority   of   graduates  take  national   service\r\n\r\nseriously and responsibly, and have responded  very\r\n\r\nwell to the challenge of army life. There are a few\r\n\r\nblack  sheep  in  any flock,  but  that  is  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected.  We must remember that in doing  national\r\n\r\nservice,  graduates, as against non-graduates,  are\r\n\r\nat a disadvantage in two respects. First, they lose\r\n\r\nmore  in  the army than when compared to what  they\r\n\r\ncould have earned outside the army. Secondly, it is\r\n\r\nonly  graduates who were born before  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1949, who have been called up, in this respect,  we\r\n\r\nmay  say that the graduates have been discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst.  But it was necessary for us at that  time\r\n\r\nto  get  a large number of officer material and  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  do  this.  I think the  graduates  have  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  grievance  when they  are  called  up  for\r\n\r\nnational  service, and I think it is best  that  we\r\n\r\nface up to it and try to redress the situation  and\r\n\r\nadjust  the  position as best we  can.  To  make  a\r\n\r\nsweeping  condemnation, as the Member for  Stamford\r\n\r\ndid, is quite unhelpful, unjust and unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entirely agree with the Member for Whampoa that\r\n\r\nwe  must  not use national service as  a  means  of\r\n\r\npunishing people. I am sure the Member for  Punggol\r\n\r\nagrees with me that this was not his intention when\r\n\r\nhe said that we should do away with the distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  service officers and combat  officers.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  this category of service officers is  rather\r\n\r\nspecial.  It was created to meet the special  needs\r\n\r\nof  a  year  or  two  ago when there  was  a  great\r\n\r\nshortage of staff officers both in the field units,\r\n\r\nin the Ministry and in the logistics bases. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  to  be turned out in large numbers  and  in  a\r\n\r\ngreat  hurry. I think it is bad to have two classes\r\n\r\nof  officers, one service and one combat, with  the\r\n\r\nservice  officer  being at a  disadvantage  in  the\r\n\r\nsense  that  he  is  rather  an  inferior  sort  of\r\n\r\nindividual. I intend to discontinue the practice of\r\n\r\ntraining  service officers. In future all  officers\r\n\r\nin  the  army will do full combat training, and  if\r\n\r\nthey are required to do staff duties, there will be\r\n\r\nspecial  courses  for them to attend  in  order  to\r\n\r\nacquire the necessary skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards grievances, all soldiers in all armies\r\n\r\nhave  grievances, whether in Singapore, in Britain,\r\n\r\nin  America or any other places. I suspect even the\r\n\r\nChinese  Communist Army soldiers  have  grievances.\r\n\r\nThis  is  rather odd because it is unlike the  navy\r\n\r\nand  the  air force. Soldiers belly-ache,  soldiers\r\n\r\ngripe.  When  we meet them we must always  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind that this is in the nature of things, like the\r\n\r\nsun rising in the east and setting in the west. You\r\n\r\ngive  them a hearing and that helps and makes  them\r\n\r\nfeel better for it. Occasionally troubles come  out\r\n\r\nin  the  open  and  if they could be  remedied,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, one remedies them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the water pressure in the - Singapore Armed\r\n\r\nForces Training Institute is low. I suspect this is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  P.U.B, has installed a  rather  small\r\n\r\ndiameter  pipe. Until larger pipes go to that  part\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, the soldiers will always be short of\r\n\r\nwater. Too bad for them! But that is the way it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has suggested that we\r\n\r\nappoint welfare officers in the units to listen  to\r\n\r\ngrievances.  Actually, listening to the  grievances\r\n\r\nof  soldiers is the job for the commanding officer,\r\n\r\nof   a   platoon,  company  or  battalion.  A  good\r\n\r\ncommander  will  always  listen  to  his  soldiers'\r\n\r\ntroubles  and tales of woe and tries to  help  them\r\n\r\nout  as  best  he can. I do not think we  need  any\r\n\r\nspecial  arrangements  about  this.  This  is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the platoon  commander  or  the\r\n\r\ncompany commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards newspaper criticisms, I have been 11\r\n\r\nyears  in  the  political game and my epidermis  is\r\n\r\nquite thick.

As  the Board has declared interest  at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  five  and a half per cent  per  annum  to\r\n\r\nmembers'  contributions  since  1967,  the  present\r\n\r\nproviso  has been the subject of much criticism  by\r\n\r\ncontributors  of  the  Fund, especially  when  they\r\n\r\nwithdraw  their contributions late in the year.  To\r\n\r\nremove this manifestly unfair proviso, clause 2  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill has been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause will enable the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Board to compute interest payable to a member\r\n\r\nfor the year in which he withdraws from the Fund at\r\n\r\nthe same rate as that declared by the Board for the\r\n\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 (2) of the C.P.F.

As Malaya has been defined  to\r\n\r\ninclude  the  States of Malaya, what  is  now  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia, and Singapore, it has been felt that this\r\n\r\nsection of the Ordinance is unduly restrictive  and\r\n\r\ndoes  not  allow  a member of the  Fund  who  is  a\r\n\r\nMalaysian  citizen to withdraw from the Fund  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  good reasons for withdrawal,  that  is,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  wishes  to  go back  permanently  to  his\r\n\r\ncountry of domicile.

Since then the tonnage attracted\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore  flag has been satisfactory.

Like any other  valuable\r\n\r\nproperty, a ship may be pledged as a security for a\r\n\r\nloan or some other form of financial consideration,\r\n\r\nand  it  is common practice for ships to  be  built\r\n\r\nwith  concessional financing based on the  mortgage\r\n\r\nof  the  ship.  The  interests  of  the  mortgagee,\r\n\r\nnamely, the lender, are protected through a  system\r\n\r\nof registering mortgages, and any interested person\r\n\r\nmay sight the register book in Singapore on payment\r\n\r\nof  a  small fee, or alternatively a certified copy\r\n\r\nof the register may be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to introduce specific provisions\r\n\r\nin  the  Ordinance  to deal with  the  mortgage  of\r\n\r\nSingapore ships and matters such as the rights  and\r\n\r\npowers  of  the  mortgagee  and  the  priority   of\r\n\r\nmortgages.  The following important provisions  may\r\n\r\nbe noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a mortgagor, i.e., the ship-owner, is\r\n\r\nobliged to disclose in writing to the mortgagee the\r\n\r\nexistence  of any prior mortgage or other liability\r\n\r\nbefore   executing  the  mortgage.   This   is   an\r\n\r\nadditional safeguard for the lenders of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a mortgage may be executed on a ship\r\n\r\nholding  a provisional certificate of registration.\r\n\r\nIf  a  bank is prepared to accept a mortgage  on  a\r\n\r\nprovisional certificate of registration,  there  is\r\n\r\nno   reason  to  refuse  the  registration  of  the\r\n\r\nmortgage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a mortgage executed outside Singapore\r\n\r\nmay  be recorded by the Registrar in Singapore.  At\r\n\r\npresent all mortgages executed outside Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be produced before the Registrar in Singapore for  sighting  and then registered, the  \r\n\r\nregistered time  being the time the mortgage was produced  and approved  for  registration by the \r\n\r\nRegistrar.  This does   not  appear  to  be  a  practical  procedure particularly in the case of new \r\n\r\nbuildings, where it is  necessary to register the new ship at the  time of   delivery  and  \r\n\r\nsimultaneously  to  record  the mortgage. Under the new system, a mortgage executed outside Singapore \r\n\r\nwill be approved and recorded  by the   Registrar   in   Singapore   and   the   ship registration  \r\n\r\nformalities simultaneously  completed over  the  telephone.  This  arrangement  has  been stressed  by  \r\n\r\ninternational financial  institutions and maritime lawyers as being most important.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Having\r\n\r\nlistened  to the Minister's speech, I was concerned\r\n\r\nwith  his  remarks  about  the  registration  of  a\r\n\r\nmortgage against the provisional registration of  a\r\n\r\nvessel.  The problem, in fact, amounts to this.  If\r\n\r\nyou  have a person making a loan against a new ship\r\n\r\nthat  is being built as security, the lender would,\r\n\r\nof  course, want to be properly secured in  law.  I\r\n\r\nnotice  that it would be possible for a  lender  to\r\n\r\nregister   a   mortgage  against  the   provisional\r\n\r\nregistration of a ship, but the question  is,  what\r\n\r\nwould  happen  if the provisional registration  did\r\n\r\nnot   go  through  and  become  a  complete   legal\r\n\r\nregistration?  Is  the  lender  affected   to   his\r\n\r\ndisadvantage?  If he is, would it not  be  possible\r\n\r\nfor  him  to  step into the shoes of the  purchaser\r\n\r\nhimself    and   proceed   with   the   provisional\r\n\r\nregistration    and   convert   it    into    legal\r\n\r\nregistration?

I  must  therefore  assume\r\n\r\nthat  the  point  which the Member has  raised  has\r\n\r\nalready  been taken into account; but, as mentioned\r\n\r\nin  my  speech just now, the present provisions  do\r\n\r\nmake it necessary for the mortgagor, the person who\r\n\r\nowns  the  ship,  to  disclose in  writing  to  the\r\n\r\nmortgagee  the  existence of any prior  commitment.\r\n\r\nThis,  therefore,  should be sufficient  and  clear\r\n\r\nenough for the second man who steps in that when he\r\n\r\ndoes  lend  extra money, there is someone  who  has\r\n\r\npriority  and rights over his.

All of them recommended drastic changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, following the acceptance by the Ngee Ann\r\n\r\nKongsi  of  the  recommendations contained  in  the\r\n\r\nThong  Saw  Pak  Report,  Ngee  Ann-  College   was\r\n\r\nreconstituted by statute (Number 28 of  1967)  with\r\n\r\nits management vested in a Council, and the College\r\n\r\nwas  to  concentrate  on technical  and  commercial\r\n\r\ncourses  and  phasing  out  the  existing  academic\r\n\r\ncourses.  The  College officially became  known  as\r\n\r\nNgee Ann Technical College following the passing of\r\n\r\nthe Ngee Ann Amendment Act in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently negotiated a loan of $9\r\n\r\nmillion  with  the Asian Development Bank  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-year expansion programme will provide\r\n\r\neducational   facilities  to  serve   the   student\r\n\r\npopulation of about 3,000 compared with the present\r\n\r\nenrolment of 900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rate of expansion in our economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  sustained at  the  present  level,\r\n\r\nthere  will be greater demand for skilled personnel\r\n\r\nas  well  as  trained executives. It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nreasonable  to assume that there will be continuous\r\n\r\nexpansion of the College after the project period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulties were encountered in the negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  the  Asian Development Bank for the  loan  on\r\n\r\naccount of the peculiar position of the College  in\r\n\r\nthat  it  did not own the land on which development\r\n\r\nwas  to have taken place. The granting of the  loan\r\n\r\nis  conditional upon the alienation of the land  at\r\n\r\nClementi Road to the College within a period of  90\r\n\r\ndays from the date of the signing of the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of section 17 (b) of the\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann  Technical College Act,  the  income  and\r\n\r\nproperty of the College shall, inter alia,  include\r\n\r\nsuch immovable property as the Ngee Ann Kongsi may,\r\n\r\nsubject to the provisions of section 20 of the Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn Kongsi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Incorporation) Ordinance, alienate  or  donate  to\r\n\r\nthe  College. Section 20 provides that the Ngee Ann\r\n\r\nKongsi  will have to apply for leave of the Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt to alienate or donate land to the College and\r\n\r\nthat  no  application for such leave shall be  made\r\n\r\nwithout  a  resolution  being  first  passed  at  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  meeting  of  the  members  held  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  When  the  Ngee Ann Kongsi  accepted  the\r\n\r\nThong Saw Pak Report which, inter alia, recommended\r\n\r\nthat the properties at Clementi Road be endowed  to\r\n\r\nthe  College, the Committee of Management  of  Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn Kongsi in the same year passed a resolution  to\r\n\r\nrent  out  the  property at Clementi  Road  to  the\r\n\r\nCollege  at a nominal sum of one dollar  per  annum\r\n\r\nand to donate to the College 50 per cent of its net\r\n\r\nincome  or $100,000 annually whichever is  more.  A\r\n\r\nfew   days   ago   the  Ngee  Ann  Kongsi   at   an\r\n\r\nextraordinary general meeting passed  a  resolution\r\n\r\nto  donate approximately 40 acres of land  together\r\n\r\nwith  the  property  thereon  to  the  College  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  It will now take some  time  for  the\r\n\r\nlegal process to be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that further adjustment of the\r\n\r\nland may be necessary for future expansion plans of\r\n\r\nthe  College.  To  avoid  this  tedious  and  time-consuming process of alienation of land to Ngee Ann\r\n\r\nTechnical  College which was originally established\r\n\r\nby  the Ngee Ann Kongsi themselves, it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  amend  section  17 of the  Ngee  Ann  Technical\r\n\r\nCollege  Act as proposed in the present Bill.  This\r\n\r\nwill  enable  the Ngee Ann Kongsi  to  alienate  or\r\n\r\ndonate  immovable property to the  College  by  the\r\n\r\nManagement  Committee of the Kongsi notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe  procedures laid down in section 20 of the Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  Kongsi  (Incorporation) Ordinance.

Research  has  established  that\r\n\r\ncigarette smoking is the main cause of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nA  host  of  other diseases are also  known  to  be\r\n\r\ncaused  by  cigarette smoking --chronic bronchitis,\r\n\r\npeptic  ulcers, high blood pressure, heart diseases\r\n\r\nand what have you.

The first false\r\n\r\nstep  often results in the young person becoming  a\r\n\r\nhabitual smoker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case against cigarette advertising,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  what benefits  cigarette  smoking\r\n\r\nitself may bring to any particular person or groups\r\n\r\nof  persons,  is overwhelmingly strong.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nstop  anyone from smoking. But we can and  we  must\r\n\r\nstop the use of our mass media to glorify smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be interested to learn that the\r\n\r\nWorld  Health Organisation at its 23rd Assembly  on\r\n\r\n15th  May, 1970, adopted a report prepared  by  two\r\n\r\nconsultants,  namely, Dr M.  C.  Fletcher  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom and Dr D. Horn of the United States\r\n\r\non Smoking and Health. The two main recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the  report  were that cigarette advertisements\r\n\r\nshould  be  reduced  with a view  to  its  eventual\r\n\r\nelimination, and that cigarette packets  should  be\r\n\r\nprinted  with  a  label warning of the  dangers  of\r\n\r\ncigarette  smoking.  The World Health  Organisation\r\n\r\nhas  instructed its Director-General to submit  the\r\n\r\nreport  together  with its recommendations  to  all\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries have already taken steps to curb\r\n\r\nadvertisements on cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  Italy  all  advertising  of   tobacco\r\n\r\nproducts  is prohibited by a law enacted  in  April\r\n\r\n1962.  In  Britain, a similar ban  was  imposed  on\r\n\r\ntelevision  and  radio since August  1965.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States there is a law enforced since  April\r\n\r\nthis   year,  which  requires  that  all  cigarette\r\n\r\npackets  be  printed with a label  warning  of  the\r\n\r\ndanger  of  smoking,  and from 1st  January,  1971,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no  cigarette advertisements  over\r\n\r\ntelevision  and  radio in the United  States.  Thus\r\n\r\nmore  and more countries are taking steps  to  stop\r\n\r\nthe use of mass media for cigarette advertisement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, we in Singapore will be\r\n\r\nshirking  our social responsibility if we  continue\r\n\r\nto  allow  television and radio, the most effective\r\n\r\nmass  media  in  our republic, to be  used  by  the\r\n\r\ntobacco industry to pass on messages extolling  the\r\n\r\nvirtues of cigarette smoking. Hence, from June this\r\n\r\nyear,   the  Broadcasting  Department  has   ceased\r\n\r\nsigning  contracts  for  cigarette  advertisements.\r\n\r\nBeginning from 1st January next year, there will be\r\n\r\nno cigarette advertisements over our television and\r\n\r\nradio;   instead,  filmlets  and  messages  against\r\n\r\nsmoking will be screened and broadcast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette industry in Singapore spent about\r\n\r\n$3.6    million   on   all   forms   of   cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements, of which television and  radio  got\r\n\r\nabout $1.2 million last year. It is obvious that if\r\n\r\na  similar  ban  is not imposed on the  other  mass\r\n\r\nmedia  in  Singapore, the $1.2  million  which  was\r\n\r\nspent on television and radio will eventually  find\r\n\r\nits  way into the other media. This will make  them\r\n\r\nmore  vicious  and  intensive  in  their  work   of\r\n\r\npersuasion  and thus have the effect of  cancelling\r\n\r\nout  all  our  efforts  in imposing  the  ban  over\r\n\r\ntelevision  and  radio. It  is  thus  necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  Bill  in order  to  make  the  ban\r\n\r\napplicable  to  all  mass  media  in  Singapore   -\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and  magazines  which  are  printed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, billboards, films, posters, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, there must be exemption for\r\n\r\nforeign magazines for obvious reasons. Firstly,  we\r\n\r\ncannot    control   the   editorial    policy    of\r\n\r\ninternational magazines, and, secondly, we  do  not\r\n\r\nwant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  isolate  ourselves from external  thoughts  and\r\n\r\nliterature.  In any case, the circulation  of  such\r\n\r\nmagazines is probably small and largely confined to\r\n\r\nthose   who  are  resistant  to  most  methods   of\r\n\r\npersuasion.  Clause  7 (2) (a) gives  exemption  to\r\n\r\nthis type of international newspapers and magazines\r\n\r\nwhich  are  printed or published outside Singapore.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand,  we are not  going  to  grant\r\n\r\nexemption to supplements of local newspapers,  even\r\n\r\nthough   the   supplements  are   printed   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore. I therefore propose to introduce at  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage a new clause to make it absolutely\r\n\r\nclear that supplements of local newspapers are  not\r\n\r\nto be exempted under clause 7 (2) (a) .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers and magazines printed in Malaysia will\r\n\r\nhave to be given special treatment because our  two\r\n\r\ncountries  lie  so close to each other.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  publications from Malaysia should  be  given\r\n\r\nthe  same  exemption which we  are  giving  to  the\r\n\r\ninternational  magazines. We therefore  propose  to\r\n\r\ntake  administrative  action to  prevent  Malaysian\r\n\r\nnewspapers   and  publications  from  coming   into\r\n\r\nSingapore  if  those  newspapers  and  publications\r\n\r\ncontain cigarette advertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first ever legislation of this kind to be\r\n\r\nintroduced in this part of the world, we cannot  be\r\n\r\nsure of how it is going to turn out. We may have to\r\n\r\nmodify  and readjust later on, it is to be expected\r\n\r\nthat the cigarette industry, with enormous funds at\r\n\r\nits disposal, will try to find other ways and means\r\n\r\nof   marketing  its  products.  We  are   therefore\r\n\r\nwatching  them very closely, for they may  probably\r\n\r\ntry to circumvent the law by putting more money  in\r\n\r\nmass  media originating from outside this  country.\r\n\r\nIf  that does happen, we will have to introduce new\r\n\r\nmeasures  to meet this new challenge. We  will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate  to introduce new provisions to give  more\r\n\r\nteeth to the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I rise to give my fullest support\r\n\r\nto  this  Bill on the prohibition on advertisements\r\n\r\nrelating  to smoking, which is now being moved  for\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading by my colleague, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this Bill concerning advertisements\r\n\r\nfalls  within the jurisdiction of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture,  the  Ministry of Health  has  a  definite\r\n\r\ninterest and a stake in its enactment, for there is\r\n\r\nnow  conclusive  medical evidence  of  the  serious\r\n\r\neffect  of smoking in promoting the development  of\r\n\r\npulmonary and cardiac diseases, such as lung cancer\r\n\r\nand  coronary  thrombosis. Many  scientific-studies\r\n\r\nconducted   over  the  last  20  years   have   now\r\n\r\ndemonstrated   quite  conclusively   that   smoking\r\n\r\nincreases  the  morbidity and mortality  from  such\r\n\r\ndiseases.  Thus,  being  aware  of  these   serious\r\n\r\nmedical    findings,   many   health   authorities,\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and agencies all over the  world  are\r\n\r\nbecoming very concerned and are now advocating  the\r\n\r\nadoption  of measures by governments to  discourage\r\n\r\nand  minimise smoking. One of the measures strongly\r\n\r\nadvocated  is  the  ban  on the  advertisement  and\r\n\r\npromotion  of cigarettes, cigars and pipe  tobacco.\r\n\r\nFor  example, as was mentioned by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Culture,  the  23rd  World   Health\r\n\r\nAssembly   held   in  Geneva  in  May   this   year\r\n\r\nunanimously passed resolutions recommending  member\r\n\r\ncountries to adopt measures to discourage  smoking.\r\n\r\nOne  of these is the reduction of advertisement and\r\n\r\npromotion of cigarettes with a view to its eventual\r\n\r\nelimination.  More recently, the Royal  College  of\r\n\r\nPhysicians in the United Kingdom has called  for  a\r\n\r\ntotal ban on all tobacco advertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to give some facts and figures\r\n\r\nof  these medical findings to illustrate why  there\r\n\r\nis  this  grave  concern about the  ill-effects  of\r\n\r\nsmoking by health authorities all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me refer to lung cancer -I am glad the\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar is listening intently, it has\r\n\r\nnow been established that the risk of dying from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlung  cancer  is increased 15 to 30  times  amongst\r\n\r\nheavy  smokers  as  compared with non-smokers.  The\r\n\r\nfindings show that anyone smoking 24 cigarettes  or\r\n\r\nmore  a day has a one-in-nine-chance of contracting\r\n\r\nlung  cancer compared with a possibility of one  in\r\n\r\n284  for a non-smoker. It has also been shown  that\r\n\r\namongst  smokers, the incidence of the  disease  is\r\n\r\nincreased  directly in relation to  the  number  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes smoked. T he risk of lung cancer, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  is  reduced  when  smokers  give   up\r\n\r\nsmoking. It is estimated that 75 per cent  or  more\r\n\r\nof  lung  cancer  cases  is preventable  if  nobody\r\n\r\nsmokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, cancer is the number one cause of\r\n\r\ndeath  and  lung  cancer is the commonest  form  of\r\n\r\ncancer  encountered here. Our statistics show  that\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  deaths from lung cancer  has  been\r\n\r\nincreasing   in   the  last  20   years   and   has\r\n\r\napproximately doubled every five years since  1950.\r\n\r\nOnce a person contracts lung cancer, his chances of\r\n\r\nsurvival  beyond five years are more or  less  nil,\r\n\r\nand it is certainly a most painful way of dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies have also shown a steady increase in\r\n\r\nmortality   from  bronchitis  and  emphysema   with\r\n\r\nincreasing  cigarette consumption. Amongst  smokers\r\n\r\nof 20 cigarettes or more a day, the mortality is 15\r\n\r\ntimes  that  of  non-smokers.  The  mortality  from\r\n\r\nbronchitis  has  also been shown to  decrease  when\r\n\r\nsmokers stop smoking. Mr Govindasamy, Sir, perhaps\r\n\r\nthis will encourage those Members who smoke to stop\r\n\r\nsmoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every aspect of lung function is impaired by\r\n\r\nsmoking.    Abnormalities   demonstrated    include\r\n\r\nnarrowing of the air passages and impairment of gas\r\n\r\ninterchange in the lungs. The prevalence  of  cough\r\n\r\nand  expectoration is closely related to the number\r\n\r\nof  cigarettes smoked, and these symptoms  promptly\r\n\r\nsubside in those who stop smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to ischaemic heart diseases.\r\n\r\nMedical findings show that mortality from ischaemic\r\n\r\nheart  diseases  is  two  to  three  times  greater\r\n\r\namongst smokers than non-smokers. This mortality is\r\n\r\nhigher amongst heavy smokers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  those who start smoking at an earlier age.  It\r\n\r\nis  lower  amongst smokers who discontinue  smoking\r\n\r\nthan  amongst those who continue the practice. This\r\n\r\nincreased  risk  of mortality from ischaemic  heart\r\n\r\ndiseases  is  also  greater  amongst  the   younger\r\n\r\nsmokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking also aggravates the pain of peptic ulcer\r\n\r\nand delays the healing of the ulcer. The death rate\r\n\r\nfrom  peptic ulcer is increased three to four times\r\n\r\nby smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these specific diseases which I have\r\n\r\nmentioned,  it  has been established  that  smoking\r\n\r\nincreases   the   mortality  from  numerous   other\r\n\r\ndiseases  as  well  as  increasing  morbidity   and\r\n\r\ndisability whether this is measured by working man-days lost, by days spent ill in bed, or by days  of\r\n\r\nrestricted activity due to illness. In one study in\r\n\r\nthe United States of America, the excess disability\r\n\r\nattributed  to smoking represented 28 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe days of disability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I have been instrumental in creating a\r\n\r\nbit  of  a  morbid atmosphere in the  House  by  my\r\n\r\nrevelations  of  these medical  facts  and  figures\r\n\r\nrelating to smoking, I beg your pardon. But I  feet\r\n\r\nduty  bound  to  acquaint Members with  these  very\r\n\r\nserious medical findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with this massive scientific and conclusive\r\n\r\nevidence,  any government worth its salt must  feel\r\n\r\nduty  bound  actively to discourage this  hazardous\r\n\r\nhabit  of  smoking  by  taking  positive  steps  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage   those  who  have  not   started   from\r\n\r\nembarking  on  the practice and to encourage  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  started to stop. The first step  towards\r\n\r\nthis  direction  is to ban cigarette advertisements\r\n\r\nwhich   form  the  major  promotional   effort   in\r\n\r\nincreasing cigarette smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By banning advertisements on cigarettes,\r\n\r\nGovernment  is fully aware of the fact that  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing to lose immediately a substantial portion  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  from  such  advertisements  on  radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision. Further, in the long term, its  efforts\r\n\r\naimed  at reducing smoking will also result in  the\r\n\r\nreduction of revenue from duty on tobacco. However,\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  relatively  small price to  pay  and  if  it\r\n\r\nresults  in the reduction or prevention of increase\r\n\r\nin  smoking, this will be more than offset  by  the\r\n\r\nsavings in health and medical expenditure from  the\r\n\r\nreduced  morbidity and mortality. The reduction  in\r\n\r\ndeaths  and  disability  amongst  the  economically\r\n\r\nactive   population  will  certainly   have   great\r\n\r\neconomic  benefits to the country. In one study  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  States  of America, excess  disability\r\n\r\nattributed  to  cigarette  smoking  in   one   year\r\n\r\nincluded  77  million  working  man-days  lost,  88\r\n\r\nmillion  days  of  illness spent  in  bed  and  306\r\n\r\nmillion man-days of restricted activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from economic considerations, there is the\r\n\r\nover-riding  humanitarian and ethical duty  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the Government to protect the young,  who\r\n\r\nare  unwary  and impressionable, from falling  into\r\n\r\nthe  habit  of  smoking. Adults  who  have  already\r\n\r\nformed the habit of smoking may have difficulty  in\r\n\r\ngiving  it  up. Thus, measures aimed at  motivating\r\n\r\nadults into giving up smoking would undoubtedly  be\r\n\r\nless  successful  than those aimed at  discouraging\r\n\r\nnon-smokers  from embarking on the  harmful  habit.\r\n\r\nMost  of  the younger generation have  not  as  yet\r\n\r\nembarked  on  the smoking habit. It  is  imperative\r\n\r\nthat   they  be  discouraged  from  starting.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  certainly  owes  this  to  our   future\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisements on cigarette smoking are usually\r\n\r\nbased on emotional appeals and the exploitation  of\r\n\r\nhuman  weaknesses. They usually seek  to  associate\r\n\r\ncigarette   smoking   with   manliness,   virility,\r\n\r\nprestige  and  social acceptance  and  so  on.  One\r\n\r\ncatching advertisement that seeks to appeal to your\r\n\r\nmanliness  and  virility,  which  I  am  sure  many\r\n\r\nMembers  are familiar with, is the one which  tells\r\n\r\nyou that if you smoke the cigarette you will be  in\r\n\r\nMarlboro  country.  Another familiar  advertisement\r\n\r\ntells   you  that  if  you  want  to  be   socially\r\n\r\nacceptable and be in the in-crowd, you should smoke\r\n\r\nDunhill.  Yet another calls upon you to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\ncoolness of a mountain stream by smoking Consulate.\r\n\r\nAs such,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   young  and  impressionable  are  particularly\r\n\r\nsusceptible  to  them. Thus, it is  necessary  that\r\n\r\nthey  be  prohibited if only to protect  them  from\r\n\r\nthis   incessant  and  insidious  form  of  harmful\r\n\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Government is fully conscious of\r\n\r\nthe    fact    that   merely   banning    cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements by itself is not sufficient to bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  reduction  in  cigarette  smoking  or  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  the  young from starting.  Thus,  other\r\n\r\npositive  efforts  have to  be  made  to  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople,  particularly young people, about  the  ill\r\n\r\neffects  of  smoking  and to discourage  them  from\r\n\r\ntaking it up. The Government has decided to mount a\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  make  school children  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nhealth hazards of smoking and this will be done  in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the health education that will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced in the curriculum of schools. It  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, be illogical and rather ironical if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were, on the one hand, to adopt positive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to discourage smoking but, on the  other,\r\n\r\nallow     advertisements    promoting     cigarette\r\n\r\nconsumption  to  carry on. In fact,  when  the  law\r\n\r\nprohibiting  smoking in the auditorium  of  cinemas\r\n\r\ncame  into  force in October this year  and  before\r\n\r\nthis  present  Bill was introduced  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nthere  were complaints from the public which  found\r\n\r\nexpression in letters to the press pointing out the\r\n\r\nillogical  and  ironical  situation  where   cinema\r\n\r\npatrons were not allowed to smoke while watching  a\r\n\r\nshow, on the one hand, and, on the other, cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements encouraging patrons  to  smoke  were\r\n\r\nallowed to be shown on the screen. Sir, one  writer\r\n\r\nended  his  letter  to  the  press,  no  doubt   in\r\n\r\nexaggerated  terms, by stating, \"To add  insult  to\r\n\r\ninjury they [meaning the authorities] are indulging\r\n\r\nin  the  cruellest form of mental torture. So  stop\r\n\r\ncigarette advertisements in the cinema halls before\r\n\r\ndisaster strikes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, whatever the arguments pro and con its\r\n\r\neffectiveness,   the  banning   of   advertisements\r\n\r\nrelating  to smoking is the inevitable and  logical\r\n\r\nmove  consistent  with the Government's  policy  of\r\n\r\nactively  discouraging  smoking,  thereby  reducing\r\n\r\nunnecessary deaths, ill-health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   suffering.  As  far  as  the  Government   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it has no illusions whatsoever that  the\r\n\r\ncampaign  to discourage smoking is going  to  be  a\r\n\r\nlong and arduous one, just as our campaigns against\r\n\r\nlitter,  filth and pollution. We know that we  will\r\n\r\nbe engaged in a relentless battle against ingrained\r\n\r\nhabits, human weaknesses and susceptibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to add a cautious note.\r\n\r\nWith  the  passage of the Bill,  the  ban  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.  It is anticipated that attempts  will\r\n\r\nbe made to exploit every possible loophole to evade\r\n\r\nsome of the provisions of the law. Of course, human\r\n\r\ningenuity is always there to contend with. A  close\r\n\r\nwatch  will,  therefore, be kept by  Government  on\r\n\r\nattempts  to  circumvent the law. If  it  is  found\r\n\r\nnecessary,  the  provisions  of  the  law  will  be\r\n\r\nreviewed  regularly and changes made when necessary\r\n\r\nin  order  that  the loss of revenue by  Government\r\n\r\nfrom  the ban will not result in monetary  gain  to\r\n\r\nothers  and,  above  all, to ensure  that  all  the\r\n\r\nefforts  we  put  in  to  discourage  and  minimise\r\n\r\nsmoking will not be in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill is, in my view, conducive\r\n\r\nto the promotion of better health and hygiene among\r\n\r\nour   people.   However,  I  do  not  consider   it\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  enough. In  my  view,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  on a piecemeal basis. Nevertheless,  it\r\n\r\nis  still  a  progressive piece of legislation.  It\r\n\r\nwill cause some loss of revenue to our country,  as\r\n\r\nhas  been  pointed out by the Minister for  Health,\r\n\r\nparticularly revenue from advertisements over radio\r\n\r\nand  on  TV, and  advertisements  put  up  on  our\r\n\r\noverhead bridges. This is the price we have to pay,\r\n\r\nbut  it is worth while. There is no doubt that this\r\n\r\nBill will bring great benefits to our society as  a\r\n\r\nwhole. One of them is that our T.V, viewers will be\r\n\r\nleft in peace to enjoy their programmes without the\r\n\r\nharassment    and   embarrassment   of    cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements.  This  is,  of  course,   a   minor\r\n\r\nbenefit. But there are major benefits. This Bill is\r\n\r\nclosely related to an earlier Bill, that is, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProhibition of Smoking in Certain Places Bill.  One\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions in the present  Bill  prohibits\r\n\r\nadvertisements on smoking through pamphlets,  price\r\n\r\nlists,  packets and other forms of publicity  which\r\n\r\naim  at promoting smoking among the members of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  This  Bill shows that our Government  does\r\n\r\nnot endorse public encouragement of smoking amongst\r\n\r\nour  citizens, particularly our young people.  This\r\n\r\nBill  will be conducive to the cultivation of  good\r\n\r\nhabits or at least the discouragement of bad habits\r\n\r\namongst  our  people, particularly the young  ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a Bill with good intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the implementation of this Bill, other\r\n\r\nbenefits  will come too. The Bill will prevent  our\r\n\r\nyoung  people from succumbing to temptation through\r\n\r\nindulgence  in smoking. If there are no inducements\r\n\r\nor encouragement from cigarette advertisements, our\r\n\r\nyoung people will not succumb to temptations. There\r\n\r\nare  Members in this House, including Ministers and\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries, who  are  smokers,  but\r\n\r\nthey  are  probably  indulging in  this  bad  habit\r\n\r\nbecause there was no such Bill in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this Bill will help bring about a more\r\n\r\nrobust physique and better health among our people.\r\n\r\nIt will definitely reduce the hazards of smoking to\r\n\r\nwhich  smokers  are  exposed,  that  is,  from  the\r\n\r\nmedical  point of view as mentioned by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill will also help the growth of a\r\n\r\nless polluted environment. This Bill works in close\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  our campaign against  pollution,\r\n\r\nparticularly air pollution. According  to  experts,\r\n\r\nsmoking  of  cigarettes  will  also  add   to   air\r\n\r\npollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of all I have said, there are\r\n\r\ncertain  loopholes in this Bill  which  I  wish  to\r\n\r\npoint out. For example, there are certain loopholes\r\n\r\nin  the provisions for exemption which may be  open\r\n\r\nto manipulation by certain people whereby they will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  bring  home the  message  of  smoking\r\n\r\npleasure  by  some other means. I therefore  invite\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Minister concerned to several\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as regards imported publications such as\r\n\r\nLife,  we  must note that there are many  cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements   in   them.   If   these   imported\r\n\r\npublications are distributed free to the public  by\r\n\r\ncigarette dealers or tobacco companies, will it not\r\n\r\ndefeat  the purpose of this Bill? Has our  Minister\r\n\r\nany plans to deal with such a situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, if our people turn on to the T.V.\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  radio broadcasts  of  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries    which    do    not    ban    cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements, our people will still be exposed to\r\n\r\nsuch  advertisements. I wonder whether the Minister\r\n\r\nhas any plans to prevent or to reduce the influence\r\n\r\nof    cigarette    advertisements   from    foreign\r\n\r\nbroadcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I would like to indicate my support\r\n\r\nif  there  is  a  campaign to  educate  the  people\r\n\r\nagainst smoking. If we can start a campaign of this\r\n\r\nnature,  I  am  sure that popular support  will  be\r\n\r\nforthcoming.  And  it  is my  hope  that  when  the\r\n\r\ncampaign  is launched, those Members of  Parliament\r\n\r\nwho  are smokers will take the lead and set a  good\r\n\r\nexample by giving up smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, we have heard\r\n\r\ninteresting  speeches by the Minister  for  Culture\r\n\r\nand the Minister for Health. Some intriguing points\r\n\r\nwere  made by the Minister for Health when he  said\r\n\r\nthat  we should not be over concerned with the loss\r\n\r\nof  revenue from duty on tobacco and cigarettes and\r\n\r\nalso  loss of revenue from advertisements  on  T.V.\r\n\r\nand  over  the radio to the Ministry of Culture.  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that I support the passing of this  Bill\r\n\r\nand,  finally, the total elimination  of  cigarette\r\n\r\nsmoking.  But can the Minister clarify whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would accept donations  from  cigarette\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  for  the  promotion  of  sports  and\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministry of Culture would publicity  on\r\n\r\nT.V, and over the radio if, say, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs,  who  heads  the  National  Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board,  were to receive  such  donations\r\n\r\nfrom  cigarette  manufacturers and whether  or  not\r\n\r\npublicity in the news-papers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould be allowed?

The first point is that  from  the  $3\r\n\r\nmillion  or  more saved, it is pretty certain  that\r\n\r\nthe    cigarette   and   tobacco   companies   will\r\n\r\nmanufacture  articles like ashtrays  and  cigarette\r\n\r\nlighters outside Singapore for distribution to  the\r\n\r\npublic.  They will also make articles like  diaries\r\n\r\nand  pencils  for free distribution and  invariably\r\n\r\nmost of these articles will fall into the hands  of\r\n\r\nyoung  children,  particularly school  children.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  will indirectly promote the  sales  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible loophole is that there is no\r\n\r\nprovision   to  prevent  a  tobacco  company   from\r\n\r\nencouraging  people to purchase certain  brands  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes by offering indirect inducements like if\r\n\r\nyou  return 10 empty packets of a certain brand  of\r\n\r\ncigarette,   you  wilt  be  entitled   to   certain\r\n\r\narticles. This may be a possible loophole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to support the\r\n\r\npassing of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, it is very interesting\r\n\r\nto  know that before this Bill is passed into  law,\r\n\r\neveryone  starts  looking for loopholes  in  it  to\r\n\r\ncircumvent it. This is quite natural to people. All\r\n\r\nI   can  say  is  that  we  are  watchful  for  any\r\n\r\ncircumvention of the law. We will try to  implement\r\n\r\nit  in  a way that is best in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that the\r\n\r\nprovisions   in  the  Bill  are  not  comprehensive\r\n\r\nenough.  I  wonder  whether  he  can  suggest  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive measures which we can take, short  of\r\n\r\nprohibiting people from smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards foreign magazines, I think we all\r\n\r\nagree  that we should not cut ourselves  away  from\r\n\r\nthe   trends  and  information  imparted  by  these\r\n\r\nmagazines. Although it may be possible for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncigarette  companies to buy a few hundred  thousand\r\n\r\ncopies   of   Life   magazine  carrying   cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements and distribute them free to  people,\r\n\r\nI  do  not think cigarette companies can afford  to\r\n\r\nspend  so  much  money in buying  up  thousands  of\r\n\r\ncopies of international magazines such as Life  and\r\n\r\nTime  for free distribution to the public.  But  if\r\n\r\nthat does happen, we can think of ways to stop it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards advertisement commercials on\r\n\r\ntelevision  coming in from Malaysia,  I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat it is something that we cannot help. We are an\r\n\r\nopen  city  subject to influence from  many  forces\r\n\r\nfrom  outside. It is not possible for us to isolate\r\n\r\nourselves from these influences. All we can  do  is\r\n\r\nto strengthen the resistance of our young people in\r\n\r\nthis respect so that they can differentiate between\r\n\r\nwhat is good and what is bad. We can also introduce\r\n\r\nfilmlets, announcements and stills against  smoking\r\n\r\non  T.V, and over the radio instead of commercials\r\n\r\non  cigarettes. I think this would help  to  cancel\r\n\r\nthe  effect  which  will come  over  the  air  from\r\n\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has asked whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment or the sports organisations are  allowed\r\n\r\nto  accept donations from cigarette companies  such\r\n\r\na~  Rothmans  or the Singapore Tobacco  Company.  I\r\n\r\nhave  the  assurance  of the  Minister  for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  that  these donations  are  acceptable  to\r\n\r\nthem.  But  I  think we must make a  difference  in\r\n\r\nthis.  We are banning advertisements on cigarettes.\r\n\r\nBut  if  the  cigarette companies  are  willing  to\r\n\r\ndonate  funds for sports organisations, I think  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  no  objection because  the  publicity\r\n\r\nwould not actually be given to cigarettes but would\r\n\r\nbe  given  to the companies which are donating  the\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards ash-trays, diaries and articles which\r\n\r\nthe  cigarette  companies may try to distribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  people,  I  think these are matters  which  we\r\n\r\ncannot  help. But as I have said, we are keeping  a\r\n\r\nwatch   on  these  matters,  and  if  they   become\r\n\r\nuncontrollable, we will try to think of some  means\r\n\r\nto control them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Jek Yeun Thong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr N.

It  is certainly  not  the  general\r\n\r\nintention  that  the  owner of a  private  dwelling\r\n\r\nhouse  should be prohibited from cutting or felling\r\n\r\na tree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowing  in his private garden. It should be  noted\r\n\r\nthat three conditions must be satisfied before  the\r\n\r\nrestriction as to felling or cutting can apply:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The tree must be more than five feet in girth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The tree must be growing on vacant land as\r\n\r\ndefined  in the Bill or otherwise on  any  land\r\n\r\ndesignated by the Minister by order published in\r\n\r\nthe Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The felling or cutting of the tree does not\r\n\r\nfall  within the two specified exceptions, that  is\r\n\r\nto  say,  the  prevention  of  imminent  danger  or\r\n\r\ncompliance with any statutory obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to these conditions, the\r\n\r\nrestriction is in effect quite narrow in scope  and\r\n\r\nis  really directed against private developers from\r\n\r\nindiscriminately destroying the large trees growing\r\n\r\non  undeveloped land. It may be added that even  if\r\n\r\nthe  restriction  applies  to  a  particular  tree,\r\n\r\npermission can be granted to fell or cut  it  where\r\n\r\nthere are satisfactory reasons for doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill provides for the service of a\r\n\r\nnotice  on  the occupier of any land  adjoining  or\r\n\r\nabutting  or  near  to  a  designated  public  road\r\n\r\nrequiring  him  to  clear  the  land  of  weeds  or\r\n\r\novergrown  grass or to plant such trees and  plants\r\n\r\nas  are  specified  in the notice.  This  provision\r\n\r\nagain does not extend to the occupier of every land\r\n\r\nbut  can only apply to the occupiers of those lands\r\n\r\nwhich are adjacent or near to such public roads  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  may  designate.  The  provision   is\r\n\r\nconsidered  necessary in order  to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nhand  of  the authorities in the task of preserving\r\n\r\nand  enhancing  the amenities of  lands  which  are\r\n\r\nclose  to our main highways. Provision is made  for\r\n\r\nan  occupier  on whom a notice has been  served  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  Minister. However,  non-compliance\r\n\r\nwith  a notice does not attract any penal sanction,\r\n\r\nbut instead the Superintendent of Trees and Plants,\r\n\r\nwho is to be appointed under the Bill, is empowered\r\n\r\nto  take the necessary measures to comply with  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the notice and to recover the costs  and\r\n\r\nexpenses of such measures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the occupier. It will, however, be an offence\r\n\r\nfor  any  person wilfully to damage or  remove  any\r\n\r\ntree  or  plant which has been planted pursuant  to\r\n\r\nany notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen, therefore, that the Bill does not\r\n\r\ninterfere  unreasonably  with  the  right  of   the\r\n\r\nindividual to regulate his own house or garden, and\r\n\r\nMembers may be assured that the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill will be administered reasonably, having regard\r\n\r\nto  the  interests of the community as well as  the\r\n\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nGovindasamy,  Sir, I believe that Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  are aware that over the past few years  many\r\n\r\ntrees  have been cut down because of urban  renewal\r\n\r\nor other forms of development that have been taking\r\n\r\nplace  in  Singapore. As a result,  the  number  of\r\n\r\ntrees in the city is decreasing from year to year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are living in the tropics. It is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, essential that we have enough trees  and\r\n\r\nplants  because they will regulate our  rather  dry\r\n\r\nand  hot  climate. Their presence will freshen  the\r\n\r\nair,  thereby  promoting better  health  among  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is a follow-up of\r\n\r\nour  campaign  to keep Singapore clean  and  green.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  will protect trees and  plants  in  our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  Over  the past few years  we  have  been\r\n\r\nlaunching  campaigns to keep Singapore  green,  and\r\n\r\nthese  have been receiving great support  from  our\r\n\r\npeople,  for  example, in my Sembawang constituency\r\n\r\nwhere there has been a tremendous response from  my\r\n\r\nconstituents.   Over  the  past  few   months   the\r\n\r\nCitizens' Consultative Committee in my constituency\r\n\r\nand  the  Management  Committees  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  have  concertedly  launched  a   tree-planting  campaign. As a result of  these  efforts,\r\n\r\nmany shops and private houses have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrees  and  plants around them. In  public  places,\r\n\r\ntoo, trees have been planted, thereby enhancing the\r\n\r\nbeauty of the surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, because of this \"Keep Singapore Green\" campaign, we have a shortage of horticulturists and of young plants. A lack of experienced personnel to look after the plants has caused a lot of these plants to wither and die. Furthermore, a lack of personnel with expertise in\r\n\r\nplanting  trees has also given rise  to  the  wrong\r\n\r\nmethod of planting them. It is agreed that we  have\r\n\r\na  shortage of horticulturists to advise others  on\r\n\r\nhow  to plant trees and flowers, and I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government or the Minister  concerned\r\n\r\nhas any plans to train more people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noted that in certain crowded areas,\r\n\r\nsuch as Bras Basah Road, the traffic conditions are\r\n\r\ngenerally appalling during peak hours, resulting in\r\n\r\ntraffic jams. In spite of the shortage of space  in\r\n\r\nsuch areas, trees are being planted. They take up a\r\n\r\nlot of space in a very crowded area. One tree takes\r\n\r\nup  at  least  10  square feet of  space,  and  the\r\n\r\npresence of trees in these crowded areas will  only\r\n\r\naggravate traffic conditions. I wonder whether  the\r\n\r\nofficers  concerned  have given  due  consideration\r\n\r\nbefore  planting  trees in  these  busy  areas  and\r\n\r\npublic roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt trees are being planted with good\r\n\r\nintentions,  as they will beautify our  environment\r\n\r\nand refresh the air. With the success of this \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Green\" campaign, we have no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will become a garden city  in  the  true\r\n\r\nsense  of the word. In this way we will be able  to\r\n\r\nattract more tourists to our garden city. They will\r\n\r\ngo   back  to  their  own  countries  and  give  us\r\n\r\nfavourable  publicity. The \"Keep  Singapore  Green\"\r\n\r\ncampaign  will  therefore contribute  in  no  small\r\n\r\nmeasure to our economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am glad to see that the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang   is  also  interested  in  keeping   his\r\n\r\nconstituency  clean and beautiful.

More oil refineries  are\r\n\r\nbeing  developed on off-shore islands and  the  re-enacted  section 2 (a) would allow the Minister  to\r\n\r\nspecify  any  off-shore island  where  the  Customs\r\n\r\nOrdinance shall not apply in respect of petroleum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 also clarifies that the Ordinance shall\r\n\r\nhave  no application within the free trade zone  in\r\n\r\nrespect of acts lawfully done. This avoids the need\r\n\r\nto  list  out  and add to or delete from  the  list\r\n\r\npreventive   and   prohibitive  sections   of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  applicable to the  free  trade  zone  as\r\n\r\nrequired presently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 seek to amend sections 4 and 5 by\r\n\r\ntransferring   the  authority  for  the   statutory\r\n\r\nappointments  of  Comptroller, Deputy  Comptroller,\r\n\r\nAssistant  Comptrollers and Customs  Officers  from\r\n\r\nthe  President  to the Minister for  administrative\r\n\r\nsimplicity and to bring this provision in line with\r\n\r\nsimilar provisions in other revenue Ordinances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 seeks to amend section 11 o1 the\r\n\r\nOrdinance to empower the Minister to levy  duty  on\r\n\r\nlocally-grown  tobacco  as  Virginia-type  tobacco,\r\n\r\nsuitable  for cigarette making, is currently  grown\r\n\r\nlocally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to empower the Minister to exempt\r\n\r\nthe  payment  of such fees or charges  leviable  on\r\n\r\nitems   other  than  goods.  Section  13   of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  as  it now stands, gives  the  Minister\r\n\r\npowers  only to exempt payments of customs  duties,\r\n\r\ntaxes,  fees or charges payable on goods.

Clause  22  seeks to cover,  in  addition,\r\n\r\nprice changes arising out of the imposition of  new\r\n\r\nduties or the abolition of duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 seeks to provide a new general section\r\n\r\ngiving  the  Comptroller the right to  require  and\r\n\r\ntake  securities for payment of duty  and  for  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of revenue. At present the  requirement\r\n\r\nfor  security is only for certain sections  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.   The  new  provision  allows   enhanced\r\n\r\nsafeguards particularly where high duty  goods  are\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Containerised cargo moving through Singapore is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  increase and clause 28  empowers  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  make  regulations  on  documentation,\r\n\r\nstorage,  movement and examination of containerised\r\n\r\ncargo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause also enables the Minister to require\r\n\r\ncustoms  stamps to be used for the payment of  duty\r\n\r\non cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are purely technical or\r\n\r\nprocedural amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.- [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SECURITIES INDUSTRY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to place this Bill in its proper\r\n\r\nperspective  by reminding Members that developments\r\n\r\non  the  Stock Exchange have attracted both  public\r\n\r\ncomment  and  criticism since 1968. In fact,  there\r\n\r\nhas   been,   in   this  House  and   outside   it,\r\n\r\nconsiderable pressure put upon the Government  from\r\n\r\ntime to time to intervene in the public interest to\r\n\r\nprotect  investors  from unscrupulous  manipulation\r\n\r\nand rigging on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent developments on the Stock Exchange which\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in the Committee  of  the  Exchange\r\n\r\nsuspending  or limiting trading in certain  shares,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the  timely study of  the  Securities\r\n\r\nMarket  in Singapore and Malaysia by Mr George  M.\r\n\r\nFerris, Jr. (which is commonly referred to as  \"the\r\n\r\nFerris  Report\")  have  focused  attention  on  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings  and  deficiencies of  the  Securities\r\n\r\nMarket in Singapore and have raised the question as\r\n\r\nto  what form of legislative intervention is needed\r\n\r\nto  remedy  these  shortcomings  and  deficiencies,\r\n\r\nparticularly  as they affect the protection  to  be\r\n\r\nafforded to the investing public. For there can  be\r\n\r\nno   doubt  that  some  form  of  intervention   is\r\n\r\nnecessary to ensure that the Securities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarket  operates in a fair and open manner  and  to\r\n\r\nprevent,  as  far  as  possible,  certain  persons,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  with \"insider\"  knowledge,  from\r\n\r\nmanipulating the market by illegal means for  their\r\n\r\nown profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without the occurrence of the above-mentioned events, it is probably inevitable that\r\n\r\nthe  Securities  Market  in  Singapore  could  not,\r\n\r\nhaving  regard to the accelerated pace of  economic\r\n\r\nand  industrial development and the need to attract\r\n\r\nprivate  capital investment to support and  quicken\r\n\r\nthis  development, have continued for long  in  its\r\n\r\ntraditional laissez-faire state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of Singapore in this respect would\r\n\r\nnot, it is thought, have been unlike the experience\r\n\r\nof  the  more economically advanced members of  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, for example, Australia and the United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  where the need to exercise some  form  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the  Securities Market  has  in  the\r\n\r\nperiod  1958-1970 found legislative  expression  in\r\n\r\nvarious Acts of Parliament in those countries.  The\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government to legislate to regulate\r\n\r\nthe  Securities Market in Singapore can, therefore,\r\n\r\nbe regarded as part of a Commonwealth-wide approach\r\n\r\ntowards  investor protection. The form  of  control\r\n\r\nadopted  in Australia and the United Kingdom  takes\r\n\r\nsubstantially  the same pattern and  it  is  to  be\r\n\r\nnoted that in each of these countries the system of\r\n\r\nself-regulation  by  the Stock  Exchange  has  been\r\n\r\npreferred  to that of regulation by an  independent\r\n\r\nstatutory  body  along the lines of the  Securities\r\n\r\nand  Exchange  Commission in the United  States  of\r\n\r\nAmerica.  And  it is this pattern  which  has  been\r\n\r\nincorporated in the present Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching the decision that self-regulation\r\n\r\nwas,  at  least under present conditions prevailing\r\n\r\nin the stock market, preferable, the Government was\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  the consideration  that  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange of Malaysia and Singapore is in a position\r\n\r\nto exercise close and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffective  control  over  the  securities  industry\r\n\r\ngenerally.  It was also encouraged to believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  Committee of the Stock Exchange was  seriously\r\n\r\nattempting,  within the limits of its capacity,  to\r\n\r\nexercise this control with rigour. This has to some\r\n\r\nextent been evidenced by the new Rules and Bye-laws\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Committee have adopted, as well  as  by\r\n\r\naction   taken   by   the   Committee   to    deter\r\n\r\nmanipulation. These Rules have incorporated some of\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the Ferris  Report  and  in\r\n\r\nsome respects the new Rules have gone further along\r\n\r\nthe  road  to secure investor protection  than  was\r\n\r\ncontemplated  in the Report. No doubt future  Rules\r\n\r\nwill  incorporate some of the other recommendations\r\n\r\nmade  by  Mr  Ferris. Indeed, I  am  persuaded  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the spirit of cooperation  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen shown by the Stock Exchange Committee with  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  in  attaining  the  common  objective  of\r\n\r\ninvestor  protection will continue long after  this\r\n\r\nBill has passed into law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, it is proposed that meetings\r\n\r\nwill  be held periodically between members  of  the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange Committee and Government officers in\r\n\r\na  Standing  Committee whose function  will  be  to\r\n\r\nreview  problems  arising in the implementation  of\r\n\r\nthis   proposed   legislation  and  the   Companies\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill as well as the application of  the\r\n\r\nNew  Rules  of  the  Stock Exchange,  and  to  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations on amendments which experience  may\r\n\r\nshow  to be necessary. The Committee can be assured\r\n\r\nthat  the  full support of the Government  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  it in the application of the  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in  these  two  Bills,  particularly  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  those provisions dealing with  unlawful\r\n\r\nshare  trading  and disclosure by shareholders  and\r\n\r\ndirectors of companies and auditing of accounts  of\r\n\r\ndealers in securities. Since the Committee, in many\r\n\r\ninstances,  will  be the first to become  aware  of\r\n\r\npossible breaches of the provisions in the proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation, it will be one of the functions of the\r\n\r\nCommittee to consider these breaches and, if necessary,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  bring  them  to  the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for appropriate action to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that there is a unified Stock\r\n\r\nExchange as between Singapore and Malaysia.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe wish of, I am sure, the Malaysian Government as\r\n\r\nwell  as  of  the  Singapore Government  that  this\r\n\r\nunified Exchange should continue for the benefit of\r\n\r\nboth countries. Members will be reassured to learn,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  the  Malaysian  Government,  with\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have been in consultation, has indicated\r\n\r\ngeneral agreement with the principles written  into\r\n\r\nthis.  Bill and the Companies (Amendment) Bill.  It\r\n\r\nis  most  desirable  that the legislation  in  both\r\n\r\ncountries  should, in some respects, be uniform  on\r\n\r\nthese  subjects  and I am happy  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian    Government    is    considering    the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  complementary  legislation.   For\r\n\r\nwithout it, neither Bill will be fully effective in\r\n\r\nits operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the decision not to introduce into\r\n\r\nSingapore direct centralised control does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat   other   forms  of  statutory   control   are\r\n\r\nundesirable. This is far from being the  case,  and\r\n\r\nthis  has raised the question as to which forms  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  are  best suited to local conditions.  The\r\n\r\nBill  has answered the question by introducing  the\r\n\r\nfollowing forms of control over the Stock  Exchange\r\n\r\nand its members and other dealers in securities:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Ministerial approval will be needed to\r\n\r\nestablish any new stock exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any future alteration of the-existing rules\r\n\r\nof  a  stock  exchange  may be  disallowed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The maintenance of proper trust accounts by\r\n\r\nbrokers  and  other dealers in securities  and  the\r\n\r\nauditing of the same will be given statutory  force\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister  may  in  special  circumstances\r\n\r\nappoint a special auditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The establishment of a fidelity fund by the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange  has  been placed  on  a  statutory\r\n\r\nfooting  and persons who suffer loss as the  result\r\n\r\nof  defalcations by brokers may be compensated  out\r\n\r\nof the fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Dealers, who are not stockbrokers, will also\r\n\r\nbe required to keep accounts and records and make a\r\n\r\ndeposit of $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) All dealers in securities, including\r\n\r\nstockbrokers,   will  be  licensed   to   deal   in\r\n\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Specific offences are created to deal with\r\n\r\ndishonest trading in securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bill covers the whole of the securities\r\n\r\nindustry  in  Singapore, I would like  to  make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  the Bill does not attempt  to  prevent\r\n\r\nspeculation as such. Some speculation attends every\r\n\r\nanticipation or expectation of short or  long  term\r\n\r\nprice trends which induces trading activity on  the\r\n\r\nExchange.   It  is  and  always  must  remain   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the individual investor to decide\r\n\r\nas   to   the   advisability  of   any   particular\r\n\r\ninvestment. What the Bill does do is to attempt  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  the stock market operates in a fair  and\r\n\r\nopen  way  and  that people do not  manipulate  the\r\n\r\nmarket  by illegal means for their own profit.  The\r\n\r\nBill,  together  with  the  New  Rules  that   have\r\n\r\nrecently  been  passed  by  members  of  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange, will, it is considered, go a long way  to\r\n\r\nachieve these objectives. However, I would like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  again that the Bill does not merely  pay\r\n\r\nlip-service  to but acknowledges the  principle  of\r\n\r\nself-regulation  of the Exchange by  the  Committee\r\n\r\nand  is  not intended to interfere with the day-to-day  control  by  the  Committee  of  normal  share\r\n\r\ntrading  on  the Exchange, nor with the traditional\r\n\r\nform  of control that the Committee exercises  over\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Exchange except on such matters  as\r\n\r\nthe  licensing  of  dealers in securities  and  the\r\n\r\nreduction  to  statutory  form  of  existing  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  Rules  with regard to the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nbrokers' trust funds and the fidelity fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the proposals contained in the Bill\r\n\r\nas it affects investor protection is therefore much\r\n\r\nwider  than that contemplated in the Ferris Report.\r\n\r\nThis is probably inevitable since Mr G. M. Ferris,\r\n\r\nin  his  study  of  the  securities  industry,  has\r\n\r\nconcentrated, in the main, upon ways in  which  the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange  of  Malaysia and  Singapore  could\r\n\r\nstrengthen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe basic structure of the member firms of the\r\n\r\nExchange,  could dampen down excessive  speculation\r\n\r\nand  could improve trading facilities. However,  he\r\n\r\nhas  made  useful recommendations  with  regard  to\r\n\r\ninvestor  protection  on such  matters  as  listing\r\n\r\nrequirements    of   companies   minimum    capital\r\n\r\nrequirements   of  member  firms,  etc.,   surprise\r\n\r\nfinancial   audit   of  member   firms,   excessive\r\n\r\nspeculation  and disclosure of information  to  the\r\n\r\npublic some of which have been incorporated in this\r\n\r\nBill or the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1970, while\r\n\r\nothers  have been or will be incorporated in  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, for the first time in Singapore,\r\n\r\nproposes to license dealers in securities and their\r\n\r\nemployees who are engaged in negotiating investment\r\n\r\nin  securities.  The  Government  believes  that  a\r\n\r\nsystem  of  control  by  licensing  of  dealers  in\r\n\r\nsecurities  is necessary at this time and  this  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  so as regards dealers  in  securities\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  stockbrokers. For while stockbrokers\r\n\r\nhave  always  been  subject to certain  traditional\r\n\r\nforms  of  control  by  the stock  exchange,  other\r\n\r\ndealers  have not been subject to any real form  of\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The provisions in the Bill should  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  only persons of good character and in a sound\r\n\r\nfinancial position will be permitted to be licensed\r\n\r\nas  dealers  in securities under the Act.  Licensed\r\n\r\ndealers will be required to keep trust accounts and\r\n\r\nhave  them  audited. This will not prove burdensome\r\n\r\nto  stockbrokers,  for under Stock  Exchange  Rules\r\n\r\nthey have been required to maintain trust accounts.\r\n\r\nAgain,  licensed  dealers who are not  stockbrokers\r\n\r\nwill be required to enter into a fidelity bond. The\r\n\r\nreason   for   this  is  that  the  fidelity   fund\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Bill apply only to  stockbrokers\r\n\r\nwho  are members of the Stock Exchange. With regard\r\n\r\nto  the  latter,  they  will find  little  that  is\r\n\r\nunusual  about  those  provisions,  for  under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Stock Exchange Rules a Fidelity Guarantee\r\n\r\nFund  was created to compensate persons who  suffer\r\n\r\nloss  by  reason  of the default  of  members.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  Bill  therefore  merely   gives\r\n\r\nstatutory force to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablishment of such a fund. The amount of capital\r\n\r\nin  the  existing fund will form the basis  of  the\r\n\r\nfund established under this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant feature of the Bill is to be\r\n\r\nfound  in Part VII, where new offences are  created\r\n\r\nin  relation to market dealings. The first  offence\r\n\r\nrelates   to   creating  a  false   or   misleading\r\n\r\nappearance  of  active trading in  securities;  the\r\n\r\nsecond  to market rigging activities; the third  to\r\n\r\nthe  use  of fictitious transactions to affect  the\r\n\r\nstock   market;   and  the  fourth   to   knowingly\r\n\r\ncirculating   false   rumours   with   respect   to\r\n\r\nsecurities.  A  maximum  penalty  of   $30,000   or\r\n\r\nimprisonment for five years is provided  for  these\r\n\r\nserious offences. It may not often be necessary for\r\n\r\nprosecutions  to be launched under these  sections,\r\n\r\nas  in  the  United States similar provisions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  used  with  great  effect  to  inhibit  those\r\n\r\nwrongful  practices which do so much to  destroy  a\r\n\r\ntrue  market in securities. The Government believes\r\n\r\nthat it is important that Parliament should clearly\r\n\r\nstate  its  abhorrence of such practices  and  that\r\n\r\nevery  effort  should be made  to  stamp  them  out\r\n\r\nbefore they become widespread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not propose to dwell upon the other\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill, as these are dealt with  in\r\n\r\nsome  detail in the Explanatory Memorandum, or will\r\n\r\nbe clear in the explanations on the amendments I am\r\n\r\nintroducing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, however, I would like to clear\r\n\r\nup  a misunderstanding that has occurred due to  an\r\n\r\nerroneous  reference  in the Explanatory  Statement\r\n\r\ndealing  with  clause  13. It is  not  Government's\r\n\r\nintention that a remisier should deposit $30,000 or\r\n\r\n$100,000   as   security  with  the  Registrar   of\r\n\r\nCompanies.  This  provision  will  apply  only   to\r\n\r\ndealers who are not stockbrokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend this Bill to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, very briefly, I\r\n\r\nwould like to welcome the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this Bill. I  think  it  is  both\r\n\r\ntimely and necessary, as the orderly development of\r\n\r\nfinancial   institutions   is   indispensable   for\r\n\r\neconomic  development.  I  welcome  especially  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  assurance of the  co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Malaysia in this  regard.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause of the inter-relationship of the two  Stock\r\n\r\nExchanges of the two countries, and in a matter  of\r\n\r\nenforcement I hope that similar co-operation  would\r\n\r\nbe forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering whether the penalties which are\r\n\r\nspecified   in   the  Bill  are  adequate   enough,\r\n\r\nespecially $30,000 as the maximum penalty. The gaol\r\n\r\nsentence of five years, I think, would be adequate,\r\n\r\nbut in view of the fact that the ill-gotten rewards\r\n\r\nof  market  rigging  can be very  considerable,  in\r\n\r\nhundreds  of thousands if not millions of  dollars,\r\n\r\nthe maximum penalty of $30,000 would seem to me  to\r\n\r\nbe very trivial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, it gives me considerable\r\n\r\npleasure  to rise in support of the Bill  currently\r\n\r\nbefore  the House, because in the past two years  I\r\n\r\nhave  on  two occasions raised questions concerning\r\n\r\nthe  Stock Exchange in this House. In 1968, I urged\r\n\r\nthe  then  Minister  for Finance  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of an independent commission in order to\r\n\r\nsupervise  the  Exchange. Although the  scheme  now\r\n\r\nproposed is very much different from what I  urged,\r\n\r\nI  am  nevertheless  satisfied that  the  stringent\r\n\r\nprovisions and requirements will put to a  stop  to\r\n\r\nall the malpractices that have been going on in the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange, very much at the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\nsmall  man  - people who put their life savings  in\r\n\r\nthe Stock Exchange and one fine day wake up to find\r\n\r\nthat  their  savings are all gone. It is  all  very\r\n\r\npathetic. That is a situation that could  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen allowed to perpetuate for too long, bearing in\r\n\r\nmind  particularly the socialist policy adopted  by\r\n\r\nthis Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity of\r\n\r\ncongratulating  the Minister on  bringing  about  a\r\n\r\nvery timely piece of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  particularly encouraging to note  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister   will  be  forming  a  special   Standing\r\n\r\nCommittee to watch over the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  This  is,  to my  mind,  a  very  clear\r\n\r\ndemonstration  of the flexibility of  the  Minister\r\n\r\nand  his willingness to co-operate with the private\r\n\r\nsector  in  ensuring  that the measures  introduced\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  success. I have no doubt that  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of implementation, if it is found that there\r\n\r\nare   areas   which   are   not   practicable    or\r\n\r\nsatisfactory, the Minister will be prepared to make\r\n\r\nsuitable amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Member for Whampoa mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  penalty of $30,000 as being perhaps too  light\r\n\r\nfor  offences  of  this  nature.  As  this  is   an\r\n\r\nalternative  to a prison sentence, I would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat where the penalty is considered inadequate the\r\n\r\ncourt might very possibly impose the other penalty,\r\n\r\na  prison  sentence of five years. I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nMember  will consider this prison sentence adequate\r\n\r\nfor even a crime of rigging and manipulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the comment of the Member for Jalan Kayu on\r\n\r\nthe   nature  of  the  organisation  which  we  are\r\n\r\nproposing  to  set up, he mentioned an  independent\r\n\r\ncommission. I think this was considered but it  was\r\n\r\nthought  that,  having regard to the administrative\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  the  problem  of  finding   adequate\r\n\r\npersons  to staff an organisation on the  lines  of\r\n\r\nthe   Securities   and  Exchange  Commission,   the\r\n\r\nsolution we have arrived at - in trusting to  self-regulation by the Stock Exchange - is the best that\r\n\r\ncan be adopted in the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr N.

Clause 8, which amends\r\n\r\nsection  132  of the Act, makes it clear  that  the\r\n\r\nsection  deals  with misuse of  information  by  an\r\n\r\nofficer  and not, for example, with cases where  an\r\n\r\nauthorised  disclosure of information has  resulted\r\n\r\nin detriment to the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next main topic of the Bill is the disclosure\r\n\r\nby  directors of information to be included in  the\r\n\r\ndirectors' report.

Clause 17,  which  repeals\r\n\r\nand   re-enacts  section  208  of  the   Act   with\r\n\r\nmodifications,  enables  the  Minister  to  require\r\n\r\ninformation as to persons interested in  shares  or\r\n\r\ndebentures of a corporation, including a banking or\r\n\r\ninsurance  corporation, without  the  necessity  of\r\n\r\nappointing  an  inspector.  The  new  section   208\r\n\r\nconfers  wide powers to investigate holdings  where\r\n\r\nthe  Minister thinks fit so to do. Clause 15, which\r\n\r\namends   section  194  of  the  Act,  defines   the\r\n\r\n\"affairs\"  of  a  company for the  purposes  of  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  Part  IX  of the Act.

The existing provision under section\r\n\r\n364  of the Act is extended, under clause 18 of the\r\n\r\nBill, to the authorising of the making of false  or\r\n\r\nmisleading  statements  or  wilfully  omitting  any\r\n\r\nthing  without  which the document  is  misleading.\r\n\r\nClause 19 introduces an important amendment in that\r\n\r\nit  provides  for  the first time  for  a  specific\r\n\r\noffence for an officer of a corporation to make any\r\n\r\nfalse  or  misleading  statement  or  report  to  a\r\n\r\ndirector,  auditor,  member,  debenture-holder   or\r\n\r\ntrustee for debenture-holders or to the auditor  of\r\n\r\na  holding  company  or  to  a  stock  exchange  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   or   elsewhere.  In   the   past,   the\r\n\r\nobligations  under  the  Companies  Act  have  been\r\n\r\nmainly  confined  to  obligations  in  relation  to\r\n\r\ndocuments  filed with the Registrar or to  be  laid\r\n\r\nbefore   the  company  in  general  meeting.   This\r\n\r\nprovision  acknowledges that certain office-holders\r\n\r\nand  stock  exchanges also have a real interest  in\r\n\r\nnot  being  deceived  as to  the  position  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Companies Act is modelled on the\r\n\r\nAustralian and United Kingdom Companies  Acts  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  reports  by expert  committees  on  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  and  the  working  of  these  Acts   in\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  the United Kingdom  are  of  direct\r\n\r\nrelevance  to our own Company law. The  inspiration\r\n\r\nfor  the amendments proposed in this Bill has come,\r\n\r\nin  the main, from the recommendations made by  the\r\n\r\nJenkins  Committee in the United  Kingdom  and  the\r\n\r\nEggleston Committee in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

However, the Government requires\r\n\r\nadequate  safeguards  from such  parents  that  the\r\n\r\nchildren  will  be  sent home  to  discharge  their\r\n\r\nnational   service  obligations  to  the   country.\r\n\r\nPassports will not be issued unless parents provide\r\n\r\nadequate  security in cash bond or  bank  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat when their children reach their 18th birthday,\r\n\r\nthey  will  return  to Singapore  to  do  full-time\r\n\r\nnational  service. If the children fail to  return,\r\n\r\nthe bond will be forfeited, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment will take steps to bring them home.  In\r\n\r\nthe new enlistment policy, no distinction will  be\r\n\r\nmade  with respect to students at home and abroad,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  reach  the  age  liable  for  national\r\n\r\nservice.  Neither will deferment nor exemption  be\r\n\r\ngranted on the grounds that they have been  placed\r\n\r\nin  institutions of higher learning except for  25\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the H.S.C, students who may  proceed\r\n\r\nnext  year to the local universities on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  ballot. My colleague, the Minister of Defence,\r\n\r\nhas  already explained the rationale for  the  new\r\n\r\nenlistment policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that there was public outcry\r\n\r\nthat  the  rich had sent their children abroad  to\r\n\r\ndodge national service. Since July this year,  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department has not issued passports to\r\n\r\nboys  below  l6\u00ab years for purposes  of  secondary\r\n\r\nschooling  abroad.  The  result  has  been  public\r\n\r\ncriticism against the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has reviewed the policy of total\r\n\r\nrefusal  of granting of passports and has come  to\r\n\r\nthe  view that it is unduly restrictive. There may\r\n\r\nbe parents who quite honestly believe, although  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  are quite mistaken in  their  belief,\r\n\r\nthat  their  children will be better  equipped  in\r\n\r\nlife  if they receive their education abroad  than\r\n\r\nat  home. There is also genuine public demand that\r\n\r\nthose who can afford to send their children abroad\r\n\r\nfor  secondary education should not take advantage\r\n\r\nof  their  wealth to provide their  children  with\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  avoid  their  national  service\r\n\r\nliability. The Government endorses this position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is equally inequitable to impose a\r\n\r\ntotal  ban on the issue of passports as  to  leave\r\n\r\nunremedied an avenue by which those who so  desire\r\n\r\ncan  utilize their wealth to enable their sons  to\r\n\r\ndodge national service. A rational solution to the\r\n\r\nproblem  must allow those who wish to  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren abroad the opportunity to do so but  also\r\n\r\nimpose   a  penalty  on  those  who  exploit   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to save their children the  burden  of\r\n\r\nnational service, which should be borne by all,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout distinction as to social classes For  this\r\n\r\nreason, the Government has planned to introduce  a\r\n\r\nscheme  of bonding students on overseas schooling,\r\n\r\nthe  operation of which makes it possible to  lift\r\n\r\nthe  restriction on the issue of passports and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  sanctions  against those  whose  ulterior\r\n\r\nmotive is to avoid national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Passports Ordinance (Chapter 103), which the\r\n\r\nPassports  Act,  1970, seeks  to  replace,  is  an\r\n\r\narchaic    piece   of   legislation,    originally\r\n\r\nintroduced  half  a, century  ago.  It  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide  a statutory basis to enable the  Minister\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  Immigration  to  make  regulations\r\n\r\ngoverning   the  issue,  renewal  or  refusal   of\r\n\r\npassports,  particularly to meet the  requirements\r\n\r\nof the bonding system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Passports Ordinance (Chapter 103) cannot be\r\n\r\nneatly  amended  to  provide  for  such  statutory\r\n\r\npower.  For  this technical reason, the  Passports\r\n\r\nAct, 1970, has been introduced. Advantage has been\r\n\r\ntaken  to  remedy certain defects, in the existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance. At present, the Minister in  charge  of\r\n\r\nImmigration may invalidate, cancel or withdraw  a.\r\n\r\npassport  already issued to a person, but  neither\r\n\r\nan  immigration  nor a police  officer  has  legal\r\n\r\npower  to  recover  the  passport  if  the  holder\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  surrender it. In such an  event,  the\r\n\r\nholder  can  still use the passport,  despite  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Minister has declared  it  to  be\r\n\r\ninvalidated   or   cancelled.  Legal   power   for\r\n\r\nimpounding   or  re-possessing  a   passport   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  essential if the  order  made  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister to invalidate or cancel a passport is  to\r\n\r\nbe made effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present Bill, the Minister will be\r\n\r\nempowered  to remedy this deficiency. In addition,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  incorporates the  various  actions  for\r\n\r\nwhich   the   Minister  may,  at   present,   make\r\n\r\nregulations  under  section  2  of  the   existing\r\n\r\nPassports  Ordinance. When regulations  are  made,\r\n\r\nthey   will  be  published  in  the  Gazette   and\r\n\r\npresented to this House in accordance with  clause\r\n\r\n3 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for all fines\r\n\r\nimposed, and all monies forfeited,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  recovered under the Passport Regulations  made\r\n\r\nunder  this  Bill, to be paid into the Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides that a passport or\r\n\r\nany visa, renewal or endorsement, issued or granted\r\n\r\nimmediately prior to the commencement of this  Act,\r\n\r\nshall continue in force, unless cancelled under the\r\n\r\nprovisions of any regulations of the proposed  Act.\r\n\r\nFinally,  clause  6 repeals the existing  Passports\r\n\r\nOrdinance (Cap. 103).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the Passport Regulations made\r\n\r\nunder this Bill will come into operation early next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier I have explained that the immediate\r\n\r\nobjective of introducing this Passports Act  is  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Minister in charge of Immigration  to\r\n\r\nset  up a scheme for bonding boys sent overseas for\r\n\r\nsecondary education. It is obvious that the  scheme\r\n\r\nmust necessarily be tailored to meet the enlistment\r\n\r\npolicy of the Ministry of Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bonding scheme, all male citizens born\r\n\r\non  or  after  1st January, 1949,  and  liable  for\r\n\r\nnational   service,   will  be   subject   to   the\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  a  bond if they  wish  to  proceed\r\n\r\noverseas  for  studies, if they  have  not  already\r\n\r\ncompleted their national service obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those above the age of 16\u00ab years will be granted\r\n\r\nan  exit  permit,  subject  to  their  parents'  or\r\n\r\nguardians'  furnishing  a  cash  bond  or  banker's\r\n\r\nguarantee,  that  these boys will return  to  serve\r\n\r\nnational  service on their reaching the age  of  18\r\n\r\nyears, or the scheduled date of completion of their\r\n\r\nrespective  stages  of studies,  whichever  is  the\r\n\r\ngreater.  The  amount  of  cash  bond  or  banker's\r\n\r\nguarantee  is  graduated according tolines  of   the\r\n\r\ngraduated scheme have already been worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, guarantors are divided into\r\n\r\nthree  categories.  Under  category  \"A\"  are   the\r\n\r\nemployees   of  government,  statutory  bodies   or\r\n\r\neducational  institutions.
